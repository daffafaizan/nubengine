      trial will be implemented by an experienced, transdisciplinary, and productive team of
      investigators from two sites to enhance the diversity of the study sample and
      generalizability of results. The investigators will enroll healthy pregnant women (n=312)
      with a recent history of smoking and a desire to remain abstinent after childbirth. Using a
      2Ã—2 factorial design, participants will be randomized into one of four assignments: (1)
      Prog+DMPA, (2) Prog+placebo, (3) placebo+DMPA, and (4) placebo+placebo. Using procedures
      successfully implemented in our pilot study, participants will begin the 13-week study
      medication four days after childbirth. Participants will be followed for nine months with
      home/clinic visits, self-administered surveys, and self-collection of dried blood spots to
      measure hormones and smoking-related biomarkers.
