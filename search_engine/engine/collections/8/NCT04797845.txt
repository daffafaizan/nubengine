      sclerosis when patients have a chronic respiratory failure with alveolar hypoventilation
      signs. It is demonstrated to improve quality of life and prognosis of the disease. These
      patients, often severely disabled, generally have a negative experience of repeated
      hospitalizations. Despite everything, medical and paramedical monitoring is necessary,
      especially when they are fitted with non invasive ventilation (NIV). A quarterly reassessment
      is recommended . The possibilities of telemonitoring at home have grown considerably in
      recent years. In addition, the fans are currently able to remotely transfer a certain amount
      of data to the service provider, making remote monitoring feasible.Our project therefore aims
      to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      (ALS) fitted with non invasive ventilation (NIV) through the assessment of their
      satisfaction, using both medical data and data provided by the ventilator. It is a
      single-center, prospective pilot study on 30 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      fitted with noninvasive ventilation. Patients will benefit from a quarterly teleconsultation
      to assess the study criteria through questionnaires during 12 months. Ventilation machines
      make it possible to carry out remote monitoring, with the help of healthcare providers.
