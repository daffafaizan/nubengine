      in contrast to a computer learning control. The NRTs include: 2 dosages of nicotine gum, 2
      dosages of nicotine lozenges and 2 dosages of oral nicotine inhalers. In the sampling group,
      each participant tries each of the 6 NRTs for 3 minutes. In the control, the individuals read
      about the treatments. Dependent measures include: quit attempts, use of NRTs, preferences
      among NRTs, and learning and motivation.
