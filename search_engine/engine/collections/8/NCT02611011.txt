      test results. Women will be recruited to complete a test instruction and comprehension
      assessment and a usability assessment. Study participants will be a convenience sample of
      women seeking health services. Participants will first be asked to review the instructions
      for the Congo Red Dot Test and complete a short written questionnaire that assesses their
      comprehension of the test instructions. Participants will then be asked to perform the test
      using a test control and to interpret the results obtained by answering a second written
      questionnaire. After the woman performs the test, a healthcare provider will use a matched
      control to perform a second test.
