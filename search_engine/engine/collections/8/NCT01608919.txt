      death at 30 days after cancer surgery, and is a significant source of patient morbidity and
      health care cost. Pharmacoprophylaxis has proven efficacy in preventing post-discharge VTE in
      surgical cancer patients, but perceived risks and costs pose barriers to widespread adoption
      by clinicians. Risk stratification of this patient population is necessary to allow
      appropriate prescription of prophylaxis to the highest risk patients. Can the investigators
      develop a risk stratification model that includes a readily available laboratory test, the
      thromboelastogram with or without platelet mapping?
