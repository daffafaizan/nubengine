      macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase (CEREDASE (Trademark) ) in splenectomized patients
      with type I Gaucher's disease. The magnitude and rate of development of the skeletal response
      will be monitored non-invasively. Theoretically, an enhanced response should occur in
      patients supplemented with pharmacologic doses of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol),
      since calcium absorption and enzyme delivery to bone marrow macrophages should be increased
      in this setting. These issues will be addressed in a clinical trial that uses a modified
      factorial design. A total of 57 patients will be assigned to three treatment groups by block
      randomization.

      Group 1: CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 0-6 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 7-24 months)

      Group 2: Calcitriol (0.25-3.0 micrograms/day; 0-24 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 7-12 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 13-24 months)

      Group 3: Calcitriol (0.25-3.0 micrograms/day; 0-24 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 0-6 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 7-24 months)

      The number of patients responding to enzyme replacement with a significant decrease in
      hepatic volume and a significant increase in trabecular bone density of the lumbar spine will
      be compared between the treatment groups.
