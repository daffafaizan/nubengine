        1. Prospective randomization (FlexAbility group vs. TactiCath group )

        2. Target number of subjects: 360 (180 per group)

        3. Rhythm follow-up : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 2
           month, and thereafter every 6 months; ECG if the patient has any symptom)

        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines

        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,
           cardioversion frequency, major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.

      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up

        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management

        2. Follow-up at 2 weeks, 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month.

        3. Rhythm control at 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter

        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.
