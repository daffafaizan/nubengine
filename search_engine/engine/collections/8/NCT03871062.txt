      combined sub-conjunctival anesthesia (two-step anesthesia) and topical anesthesia.

      Methods: This prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trail is conducted at Shanghai
      Aier Eye Hospital. Selected group of 60 patients will be randomized divided into 2 groups and
      underwent intravitreal injection of antiangiogenic agents and steroids. Group1 uses two-step
      anesthesia , whereas Group 2 uses topical anesthesia. A 5-point Visual Analogue Pain Scale is
      used to assess patients' pain score and surgeon's ease while operating. Any complications
      therefore will be made note of.
