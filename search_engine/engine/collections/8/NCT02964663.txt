      cardiac surgery in order to assess and guide therapeutic interventions so as to decrease
      postoperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to compare CO measured by two easy to
      use non-invasive monitors, the esCCO (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) to the Volume View (Edwards
      Lifesciences, Irvine, USA) and to assess their trending ability in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. After Internal review board approval and written informed consent, 19
      patients were included in this study. Before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), CO was measured
      simultaneously using both the esCCO and the Volume View device before and after 3
      CO-modifying maneuvers [passive leg raise (PLR), end expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) and
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cm H2O. Five CO values for esCCO and three for
      volume view were averaged and compared during a one minute period of time before and after
      each maneuver. The precision error and its 95% confidence interval (CI) that corresponds to
      the least significant change (LSC) were calculated within this period of time. The
      Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare bias, precision and limits of agreement (LOA) of
      both devices. Trending ability of CO changes was assessed by a modified 4 quadrant plot
      analysis, within angular limits of agreement considered as acceptable when the mean angle
      between both delta CO was less than 30Â°.
