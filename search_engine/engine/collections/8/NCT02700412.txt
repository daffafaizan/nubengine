      patients 18 years of age and older, are to prospectively and longitudinally assess the safety
      and tolerability, including cognitive effects, of Cannabidiol (CBD) at various doses between
      5 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, with additional titration in some cases up to 50 mg/kg/day. In
      order to participate in the study, participants will need to fulfill the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      The goal of the study is to fulfill the mandate of "Carly's Law" and to provide patients with
      debilitating epileptic conditions with access to CBD as an add-on treatment. Other care
      including routine neurological care unrelated to participation in the CBD study will need to
      be provided by patients' primary/current treating neurologist.
