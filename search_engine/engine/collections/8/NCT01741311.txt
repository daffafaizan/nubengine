      vector for the transmission of new HIV infections (Avants et al., 2004; Margolin et al.,
      2003), which occur through preventable drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors. Though
      numerous evidence-based HIV risk reduction interventions are now widely available as complete
      intervention packages, few evidence-based interventions have been designed for implementation
      within common drug treatment community-based organizations (CBOs), such as methadone
      maintenance programs (MMPs), where many high-risk HIV-infected drug users seek treatment.
      Moreover, the few evidence-based interventions that are applicable to drug treatment CBOs are
      not designed to be "community-friendly" and, hence, are unlikely to be implemented as
      intended or durable within these critical settings.

      The investigators have developed a significantly shortened version of the comprehensive
      evidence-based Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP; Avants et al., 2004; Margolin et al.,
      2003). This shortened version, Holistic Health for HIV (3H+), has demonstrated feasibility
      and acceptability as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness in an uncontrolled study
      within a resource-limited drug treatment CBO. Therefore, this randomized controlled
      comparative effectiveness trial (RCT) will test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 3H+
      versus the original gold standard evidence-based intervention(EBI), Holistic Health Recovery
      Program for HIV+s (HHRP+), targeting HIV+ drug users (DUs).
