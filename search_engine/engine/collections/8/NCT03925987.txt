      symptoms (e.g., dyspnea or heart palpitations) and is a core construct underlying the
      initiation and maintenance of pathological anxiety. Recent evidence suggests that reducing AS
      may be critical for the prevention and treatment of anxiety across diagnostic categories.
      Exposure therapy, an important component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is one of the
      most effective treatments for reducing AS, and has been shown to improve symptoms across a
      number of different anxiety disorders. Meta-analyses reveal an approximately 50% treatment
      response rate, with the remaining half of patients showing either no response or dropping out
      of treatment early. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research exploring which variables
      predict treatment outcome and there are currently no tests for predicting which patients
      would benefit the most from exposure therapy. In this study, participants will complete two
      sessions of a carbon dioxide (CO2) habituation paradigm, a safe and noninvasive physiological
      test that entails repeated exposures to single vital capacity inhalations of 20% CO2. Both
      CO2 testing sessions will be completed within a 72-hour time period. Patients then complete a
      10-week group-based exposure therapy to determine whether an individual's degree of
      habituation to CO2 predicts treatment outcome.
