    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of combining BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) with
      cisplatin and etoposide in advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the MTD (maximally tolerated dose) of BKM120 in combination with
      cisplatin/etoposide.

      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and toxicity profile associated with
      BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide.

      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide
      in an expanded cohort of patients with SCLC.

      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BKM120 in this combination.

      V. To collect blood samples for future exploratory biomarker analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.

      Patients receive PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
