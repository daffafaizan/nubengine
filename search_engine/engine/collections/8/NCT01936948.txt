      in patients undergoing endoscopic resection of large polyps between:

        -  A) Closing the mucosal defect after resection (Clip group) and

        -  B) Not closing the mucosal defect after resection (No clip group).

      Aim 2. The secondary aim of the study is to compare the rate of overall complications in
      patients undergoing endoscopic resection of large polyps between two cautery settings:

        -  A) Low power coagulation and

        -  B) Endocut.
