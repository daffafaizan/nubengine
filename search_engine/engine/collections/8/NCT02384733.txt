      In patients treated with boost 2 dose levels are accepted: 16 Gy/8 fractions and 10 Gy/5
      fractions. These boost treatments will be provided as simultaneous integrated boost, where
      the overall treatment time in general is shortened 5 days. Thus the dose levels for boost
      patients are:

      63 Gy / 51.52 Gy / 28 fractions, 57 Gy / 50 Gy / 25 fractions, 52.2 Gy / 42.3 Gy / 18
      fractions, and 45.75 Gy / 40 Gy / 15 fractions.

      The primary endpoint is arm lymphedema 3 years after radiation therapy, but other late
      radiation morbidities will also be evaluated along with recurrence and sites of recurrence.
      Follow up of morbidity will continue for 10 years.

      The hypothesis is that women operated for early breast cancer with indication for
      loco-regional radiation therapy can be offered moderately hypofractionated therapy without
      developing more late radiation induced morbidity compared to normofractionated radiation
      therapy.
