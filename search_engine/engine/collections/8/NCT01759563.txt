      6 patients selected for Transcutaneous Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)-procedure will be
      subjected to intra-operative transnasal cooling (RhinoChill) ; cooling will be started after
      induction of anesthesia until tympanic temperature achieves 34° (cooling will be continued
      until 33°C of tympanic temperature, below 33°C active cooling will be stopped)

      No intra-aortic catheter will be inserted before tympanic temperature reaches 34°

      The aim of this study is to test the safety (as referring to routinely used neuromonitoring :
      ForeSight cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) monitoring; and as referring to
      cardiovascular stability : blood pressure & heartrate) and feasibility (as referring to
      temperature characteristics) of brain cooling during TAVI (cerebral (or tympanic) cooling
      rate, differential tympanic-rectal cooling rate, rectal cooling rate, time needed to obtain
      tympanic temperature below 34°)

      Patients will be monitored with FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter (regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation, sensors placed on patient's forehead) and BIS VISTA (bilateral continuousEEG).

      Tympanic temperature will be measured every 5 minutes while oesophageal and blood temperature
      will be continuously measured.

        -  Neuromonitoring (Fore-Sight, Bispectral Index (BIS) Vista) will be started before
           induction of anesthesia and cooling

        -  Transnasal cooling will be started after induction of anesthesia until a target tympanic
           temperature of 34°C

        -  Core temperature will not be monitored by esophageal (caveat interaction TEE probe), but
           by rectal and blood temperature

        -  TAVI-procedure will be started at a tympanic temperature of 34°C

        -  Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) will be checked every 30 minutes intra-operatively
           (target=normocapnia) by arterial blood gas analysis to maintain strict normocapnia

        -  and the end of the TAVI-procedure, patient will be rewarmed at a max rate of 0.8°/h by
           total body bair hugger

        -  when patient reaches tympanic and systemic (rectal) temperature of 35.5°C, extubation
           can be performed
