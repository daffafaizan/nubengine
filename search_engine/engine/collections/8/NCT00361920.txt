      treatment of airway inflammation (1,2). However, some asthmatics do not respond to steroids
      (3-6). Unfortunately these patients are subjected to the unwanted side effects (osteoporosis,
      cataracts, etc) of high dose steroid therapy because non-immune tissues remain sensitive to
      steroids. Recent studies suggest that the costs of asthma are largely attributable to
      uncontrolled disease (7). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) of steroid
      resistance and introduce new forms of therapy for the treatment of these difficult to control
      asthmatics. As a prelude to pharmaceutical studies in steroid resistant asthma, it is
      imperative to develop biomarkers that can robustly identify individuals likely to be poor
      steroid responders so that alternative non-steroid anti-inflammatory therapies, such as
      XolairÂ®, can be introduced early in the course of asthma therapy.
