      nutrient composition to the control diet of previous DASH studies. The control diet, which is
      a diet typical of most Americans, is reduced in servings of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy
      products and relatively high in total and saturated fat. Immediately following the run-in
      phase, participants will receive the DASH diet during a 14-day intervention phase. Both diets
      will have the same sodium content and caloric intake will be adjusted for each participant to
      keep weight stable. All study meals and snacks will be provided.
