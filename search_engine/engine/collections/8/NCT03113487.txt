      I. To assess response rate (complete responses and partial responses) after treatment with
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess median progression free survival (PFS), clinical benefit (complete response,
      partial response lasting > 6 months), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate if the CD8+ T cell signal exceeds that detected in the single agent p53MVA trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing
      p53.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks and modified
      vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) every 3 weeks for up to 3
      vaccines. Cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks for up to 49 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-3 weeks and every 12 weeks
