      effects from its treatment. Depression in this population decreases quality of life and
      adherence to treatment and increases the risk of suicide. Psychotherapy can be effective to
      treat depression, but most patients affected by cancer and depression do not receive it, due
      to a lack of tailored therapies or trained clinicians in cancer treatment centres or in the
      community. To address this issue, we developed a novel 3-6 session psychotherapy intervention
      called Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) to prevent and treat depression in
      patients with advanced disease. In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), we demonstrated
      that CALM reduces or prevents depression in these patients. However, since access to trained
      clinicians is limited, we will develop an online version of CALM, referred to as iCALM, and
      test its feasibility and preliminary efficacy. In the present study we will: i) adapt the
      CALM intervention to its online delivery; and ii) recruit 50 patients at the Princess
      Margaret Cancer Centre (PM), who will be randomized (25 patients per group) to receive either
      iCALM or usual care. Usual care patients will be offered iCALM at the end of the study on
      compassionate grounds. Questionnaires assessing intervention satisfaction, depression, death
      anxiety, and quality of life will be administered at recruitment and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with patients and eCoaches to explore their
      experience of using iCALM.
