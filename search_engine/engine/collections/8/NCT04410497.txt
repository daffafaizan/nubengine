    
      Aim: The aim of this study was to compare two different treatment regimes for children with
      partial-thickness scald burns. Burns were treated with either a porcine xenograft (EZderm®,
      Mölnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden) or a silver foam dressing (Mepilex® Ag, Mölnlycke
      Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden).

      Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial including 58 children admitted between May
      2015 and May 2018 for partial-thickness scalds to The Burn Centre in Linkoping, Sweden.
      Primary outcome was time to wound closure. Secondary outcomes were pain, need of surgery,
      wound infection, length of hospital stay, required dressings changes, and labour time.
