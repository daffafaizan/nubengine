      symptoms (rigidity, akinesia, tremor and impairment of balance and gait). Even though
      pharmacological treatment has changed the natural course of the disease, balance worsens over
      time and leads to falls. The aims of this study is to assess the efficacy of the crossover
      (group 1) on balance in Parkinsonian patients and compare this results with the results of a
      control group of patients treated with a stabilometric platform (group 2). The group 1
      executed 6 days/week for a 4-weeks cycle a crossover protocol based on the first 4 level of
      resistance and a training which lasts at most 5 minutes. The group 2 executed 6 days/week for
      a 4-weeks cycle different exercises with the stabilometric platform in monopodalic and in
      bipodalic standing.
