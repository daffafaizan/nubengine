    
      The study is a randomized, controlled, parallel double-blind 4-week trial of 0.5 mgs of
      exogenous melatonin timed to either 3 h before actual dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) based
      on in-home measurement (M-DLMO, n = 25) or 3 h before DLMO estimated at 2 h before average
      sleep onset time based on actigraphy and sleep diary (E-DLMO, n = 25) in adult participants
      with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. All participants will receive melatonin 0.5 mgs.
      Outcomes include change in DLMO, subjective and objective sleep parameters, and daytime
      symptoms.
