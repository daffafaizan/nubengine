      headache during their hospital stay. Pain control often requires high doses of opioid drugs
      and sedation that remain only partially efficacious. In addition, there is to the
      investigator's knowledge currently no recommendation or consensus on aSAH related headache
      management. aSAH related headache results from the prolonged increased intracranial pressure
      and meningeal inflammation related to the accumulation of blood products in the subarachnoid
      space. Preliminary studies, suggest that hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal by
      lumbar puncture (LP) or lumbar drain, is safe and decreases intracranial pressure. However
      its impact on headache control has never been tested. A reliable headache evaluation has to
      be performed among conscious patients experiencing a "low-grade" aSAH.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate in patients experiencing low-grade acute aSAH (WFNS
      1-3), the efficacy of CSF removal by LP vs. sham LP, on headache control. 74 patients with
      secured aneurysm by coiling, will be randomized (1:1) between day 3 and day 5 after
      aneurysmal rupture. The procedure will be performed in addition to a pre-specified antalgic
      protocol.

      Mean headache intensity will be measured with the numeric verbal scale during the 24 hours
      before and the 24 hours after the procedure. The variation of mean intensity will be compared
      between the 2 groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that this treatment may significantly decrease headache
      intensity after an aSAH. If this hypothesis is confirmed CSF removal by LP could be a simple
      cost effective and worldwide available strategy to improve
