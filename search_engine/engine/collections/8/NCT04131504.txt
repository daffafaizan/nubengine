      inadequately treated CD, treatment selection for newly diagnosed patients is currently based
      on clinical factors which do not define CD sub-types. Now, with additional biologic therapies
      for CD, there is a critical need for individual biochemical analysis both pre-treatment, and
      following induction to assess the probability of durable remission. These data will inform
      decisions on continued dosing of the current biologic, or whether addition of combination
      therapy or switching to a therapy with an alternative mechanism of action will be more
      beneficial.

      The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) defines a companion diagnostic as a device that can
      identify patients most likely to benefit from a therapy or a device to monitor response with
      the purpose to adjust the treatment to achieve improved effectiveness.Our global aim is to
      develop a companion diagnostic (peripheral blood panel) that accurately predicts the
      probability of deep remission (clinical remission with MH) to anti-TNF and a protein (blood)
      biomarker panel that reproducibly distinguishes endoscopic MH from active (ulcerated)
      intestinal inflammation in patients with CD.

      The long-term strategy is to utilize the "low-risk" anti-TNF specific module (protein panel)
      to personalize CD therapy. With the addition of new biologics for CD, patients with a
      low-risk inflammatory profile would not only be expected to achieve MH but also predicted to
      respond to treatment escalation strategies while avoiding or stopping the drug (if drug
      exposure is optimized) sooner in patients in which the protein profile predicts a low
      probability of deep remission with anti-TNF. As additional therapies are approved for
      pediatric CD, the priority would be to avoid anti-TNF in patients with a "high-risk" protein
      profile and specifically select therapies that target the patient's individual inflammatory
      signature. Additionally, the investigators expect the protein profile of patients failing to
      achieve deep remission to provide further insight into molecular mechanisms contributing to
      the continued inflammation and thereby directing the next therapeutic option.
