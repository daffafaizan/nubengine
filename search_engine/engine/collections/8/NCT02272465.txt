      helicopter directly from the scene will be screened and initial data collected. Of that
      group, all patients who meet the "highest risk" category (based on vital signs, type of
      injury, use of tourniquet, and/or intubation) or received blood during transport will be
      followed through "direct observation" through the initial resuscitation period and then
      indirectly through medical chart review until hospital discharge or 30 days after admission
      (whichever occurs first).
