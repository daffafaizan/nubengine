      decrease of physical activity and ADL performance. This circle can be reversed by physical
      exercise to increase physical fitness.

      The goal of this research is to establish the effects of a trainings program on ADL
      performance, physical fitness and nocturnal cramps. Furthermore the characteristics from
      participants who benefit from the program will be investigated by the research.

      The study design is a randomized intervention study. Participants are elderly people, age 65
      years and older, without cognitive impairment.

      Intervention: The intervention is a physical trainings program. The intensity is moderate,
      the frequency is daily and the total duration is 6 weeks. The control group will be provided
      with an education program.

      Main parameters are: physical fitness, nocturnal cramp severity and frequency.
