      related to violence prevention (during and after school theatre projects, during and/or after
      school visual arts project, and the web page design project. (All students will either
      directly participate in these activities or at least see them), 2) Curricular components for
      all 7th graders, 3) Violence prevention and early intervention student support/discussion
      groups, and 4) Faculty and staff training on the subject. The evaluation is a
      quasi-experimental pre/post test comparison group design (2 schools in each group), where our
      comparison schools convert to intervention schools one year after serving as comparison
      schools. We are using both group (student and teacher surveys) and school wide (climate of
      the school) measures pre and post intervention.
