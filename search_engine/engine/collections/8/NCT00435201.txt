      persons with HCV have MC. MC is associated with the development of autoimmune symptoms and B
      cell proliferative disorders. We plan to study B cells from individuals chronically infected
      with HCV as well as from healthy controls. We sort B cells into different types, and we
      analyze these types for differential levels of gene expression. We are testing the hypothesis
      that certain types of B cells from subjects with MC have increased expression of genes that
      allow for increased cell survival.

      People interested in participating in this study will have a complete history and general
      medical examinations before beginning the study. Following the screening, you will have a
      procedure called leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are removed, but your own red
      blood cells are returned. The procedure takes approximately 3 hours and is similar to blood
      donation. The leukapheresis is done during a same day admission to the hospital by an outside
      blood collection company with trained nurses and certified equipment.

      Some aspects of this study are experimental which means the fluid and cells collected will be
      studied and analyzed to determine more precisely how your body's immune system is responding
      to the virus. These tests are experimental in that they are not part of the usual routine
      care of patients.
