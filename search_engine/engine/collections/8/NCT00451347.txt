      cause patellofemoral pain include: over use, soft tissue imbalance, and malalignment of lower
      extremity. Patients with patellofemoral pain, caused by soft tissue imbalance was thought to
      be favorite to receive physical therapies. Clinically, physical therapies for patients with
      PFPS are including: Quadriceps strength training, taping, and stretching exercise. The
      aforementioned treatment tools showed different effect mechanism. However, there were few
      clinical studies to compare the clinical effects among the aforementioned three treatment
      tools. The purpose of this study was to investigate the different effects among the
      quadriceps strength training, taping, and stretching exercise of iliotibial band in patients
      with patellofemoral pain syndrome by randomized control trial study.

      Methods:An observer blind, prospective, factorial design randomized controlled trail. 90
      young adults with patellofemoral pain syndrome were randomly allocated into one of three
      treatment groups: (1) Quadriceps strength training, (2) taping, and (3) stretch. Each group
      received treatment for 8 weeks.

      Outcome measures were including visual analog scales for worst pain, active-active joint
      reposition error test, the Chinese version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index, and one repetition maximum recorded at baseline and after the
      interventions for 8 weeks.
