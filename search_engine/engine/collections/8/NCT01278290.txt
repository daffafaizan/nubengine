      (PT) and CPP. However, intravenous GnRH for testing is not fully available in all countries.
      To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a novel Triptorelin-test in the assessment of CPP
      compared to the GnRH test, a validation study was performed. Girls who presented thelarche
      with accelerated growth and/or advanced bone age were included. All girls underwent the two
      tests in a randomized order. CPP was ascertained according to LH response under GnRH (gold
      standard test).
