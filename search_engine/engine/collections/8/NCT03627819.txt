      grams/day) for 12 months on biopsy proven liver inflammation in NAFLD patients.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded pilot study with a run-period
      of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 12 months and a wash-out period of 1 month.

      The study population consists of 15 patients with biopsy-proven liver inflammation, aged
      18-75 years.

      All subjects will start a run-in period of two weeks during which they consume daily 20 grams
      of control margarine after which they will be randomly allocated to consume 20 grams control
      margarine or plant sterol or plant stanol enriched margarine on a daily basis for a period of
      12 months. The primary outcome parameter in this study is biopsy proven liver inflammation.
