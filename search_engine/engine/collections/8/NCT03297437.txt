      Learning voluntary control over their own brain activity allows for establishing causal links
      between brain activity and mental functions. However, patients participants differ in their
      ability to learn control over their own brain activity with neurofeedback. It is thus crucial
      to understand why some participants are more successful in regulating their own brain
      activity than others. The objective of the present study is thus to identify predictors for
      successful learning self-regulation with real-time fMRI neurofeedback. To achieve this goal,
      we will evaluate the introspection ability of healthy participants using standardized
      psychological questionnaires and tasks. These scores will then be correlated with how well
      they learned self-regulation skills using established real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols.
