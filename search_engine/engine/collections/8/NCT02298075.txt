      discontinuation. However, the available data consist of description of case reports from
      different patients' series. At this time, systematic data collections on this topic do not
      exist and the real incidence of such persistent response is unknown. Therefore, because of
      the increasing interest in this new and challenging therapeutic field, also for the
      therapeutic implications, we would like to investigate the impact of TPO- RAs on the
      achievement of sustained and persistent responses after their discontinuation in the Italian
      adult patients affected by pITP who have been referred to the GIMEMA Centers.
