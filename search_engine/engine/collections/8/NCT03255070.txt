      whose HER2 test results are in situ hybridization (ISH) positive or immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) 3+, based on safety, tolerability, PK findings and antitumor activity. Phase 1b will
      assess the safety, tolerability, and PK and anticancer activity in five expansion cohorts,
      including breast cancer, gastric cancer / gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, and other advanced
      HER2-positive solid tumors.
