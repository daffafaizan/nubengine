      surgeries. The goal of our randomized, prospective, multicentric, internet-based study is to
      compare rate of SSI after surgery of colon and rectum by using triclosan-coated suture for
      abdominal wall closure. Two arms are separated by computer randomization at abdominal wall
      closure: application of triclosan-coated and non-coated PDS suture (PDS versus PDS-Plus).
      Triclosan is an antiseptic material which we hope provides better local infection control at
      the site with reducing the risk of bacterial colonisation.
