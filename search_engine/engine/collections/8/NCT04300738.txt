      Calcium Score measurement in a outpatient clinic. Ct Scann is expensive, learning time is for
      at least 2 years, and the reliability is operator dependent.

      The Pulse Wave Velocity is measured using a new device with half an hour learning curve, and
      you get a result within 2 minutes.

        1. A non-invasive medical device vs invasive

        2. A better benefit-risk ratio

        3. A lower diagnostic cost both for equipment and for qualification for use and learning
           time
