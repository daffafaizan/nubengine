    
      This is a randomized, two condition, crossover study in healthy individuals with overweight
      and obesity examining the effect of a mid-morning snack of pecans vs. a low fat savory snack
      on appetite, energy expenditure, blood biomarkers of appetite and metabolism and ad libitum
      food intake at lunch. Twenty-four participants will be enrolled and studied on two test days
      with at least one week washout in between. On test days, participants will have baseline
      measures of appetite (by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), blood hormones and substrates, and
      energy expenditure and fuel oxidation (Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), by indirect calorimetry)
      taken just prior to consuming a standardized 300 kcal breakfast. VAS measures will be taken
      at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min following the meal and RMR will be measured for 20 min after
      eating. A mid-morning snack of either 300 kcal of pecans or unsalted pretzels will be
      consumed and VAS and blood measures will be taken at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min following the
      snack and RMR will be measured for 20 min after eating. Participants will be given an ad
      libitum lunch meal and VAS and blood measures will be taken at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min
      following the lunch and RMR will be measured for 20 min after eating. Blood will be analyzed
      for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, ghrelin, leptin, PYY, and GLP-1. Two
      hypotheses will be examined: 1. pecans will provoke greater feelings of fullness and reduced
      hunger after the snack and lunch meal consumption (on either a calorie per calorie or volume
      basis) as compared to the pretzel snack, and 2. the pecan snack will provoke greater
      responses of satiety hormones compared to pretzels. Post-snack and lunch energy expenditure
      and fat oxidation will also be compared between treatments as an exploratory aim.
