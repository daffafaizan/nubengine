      representing different disciplines: neurology, orthopedics, physical medicine and psychology.
      Each patientÂ´s perceived change in outcome was also assessed. Assessment was made before
      treatment and at follow-up two years afterwards.

      In addition to the assessments of outcome made by the examiners, the patients completed the
      SF-36, EQ-5D and BIS (Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders) questionnaires before
      treatment and at follow-up. The results of these assessments will be given in a forthcoming
      paper.
