      Kaposi sarcoma (KS). These virally associated diseases occur more frequently in HIV-infected
      individuals, but can also be found in HIV-uninfected population. Evolution of
      immunosuppressive mechanisms presumably plays a permissive role in the development,
      progression and recurrence of these virus-associated cancers and pre-cancers. Currently,
      available treatment options for these lesions are imperfect.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether intra-lesional injections of nivolumab can
      enhance specific T cell responses in vitro and enhance activity against these
      virus-associated lesions. Chronic viral infections generate "exhausted" CD8+ T cells with a
      diminished capacity to produce cytokines and to lyse infected cells. The PD-1 (program
      death-1)/PD-L1 (program death ligand-1) pathway implicated in the balance between immune
      eradication and immune escape. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      potential benefits of injecting nivolumab into KS in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
      individuals every 2 weeks for total of 4 doses. The investigators believe this mode of
      treatment is feasible and tolerable by avoiding the systemic autoimmune adverse events caused
      by systemic injection of nivolumab.
