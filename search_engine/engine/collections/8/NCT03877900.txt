      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and tissues samplings.

      Because of the raise of parental refusal of autopsy, we intend to assess the local
      feasibility of a minimally invasive autopsy approach using post mortem MR imaging of fetuses
      and newborns in order to detect the major pathological abnormalities and/or to determinate
      the cause of death.
