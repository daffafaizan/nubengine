      Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious respiratory disease caused by a newly
      discovered corona virus in December 2019, has been recognized as a serious threat to global
      health. Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in early March 2020, the WHO and the
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been considered the most reliable
      sources of information for the COVID-19 global pandemic. The CDC listed moderate to severe
      asthma, especially if not well controlled, as high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

      A large number of cases occurred among health care workers (HCW), which were contracted
      within the health care facilities. Some of the HCWs even died from the COVID-19 disease.
      Moreover, it was reported that unrecognized, asymptomatic patients transferred to their
      family or close contacts. All these factors were alarming and potentially distressing for the
      hospital staff who worked during the pandemic.

      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 also involved disease
      transmission to HCWs. Even though the fatality rates for SARS were lower than for COVID-19
      infection, nonetheless, they were a cause of significant stress, emotional turmoil, and
      concern for all the SARS healthcare providers.

      The emotions, perceived stressors, complete knowledge assessment and coping strategies of
      HCWs especially doctors during COVID-19 have not been explored. These issues were the
      intended focus of the study.
