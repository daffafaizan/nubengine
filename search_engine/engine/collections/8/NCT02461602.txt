    
      ELITE will be a prospective, multicenter observational study of 500 participants to
      characterize demographics, comorbidities, risk profiles, socioeconomic status, and patient
      preferences related to anticoagulation management. The primary study endpoint will be
      warfarin discontinuation without resumption as documented in the medical record. Secondary
      outcomes of interest include warfarin adherence and factors associated with suboptimal
      adherence and/or permanent discontinuation. Clinical data, including demographics, medical
      history, and comorbidities, will be abstracted and entered by site coordinators. An internal
      survey developed by Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) will be administered to patients
      during regularly scheduled clinic visits. Survey items will include patient treatment
      priorities, perceived risk of bleeding and/or stroke, barriers to adherence, and treatment
      satisfaction. Subjects will complete a survey at baseline and at the followup visit closest
      to 6 months after enrollment.

      This study will provide the foundation for numerous potential future questions about
      medication adherence and barriers to treatment, such as a survey on physician preferences/
      shared decision-making (concordance between physician and patient preferences), followup to
      capture clinical events, and interventions to improve long-term medication adherence in AF.
