      during craniotomies on surgical outcomes. Patients were distributed into 2 major groups based
      on the surgical position: sitting and horizontal. Each group was further divided into
      subgroups based on the type and location of the lesion. To achieve the study goals,
      comparison of the 2 approaches in equivalent patient groups was performed, including
      comparable demographics, diagnoses, topographic location of the lesions, anesthetic
      approaches, and surgical experience.

      The operating surgeons decided patient positioning based on clinical judgment. Type of
      anesthesia was defined by the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient however, it was
      maximally standardized for both sites. All the surgeries were performed by neurosurgeons with
      sufficient experience of sitting craniotomies.
