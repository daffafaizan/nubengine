    
      All patients which had suspected respiratory muscle dysfunction will have usual exploration
      of the respiratory muscles according to the clinician prescription. These explorations can
      include :

        -  Lung volumes in seating and supine position

        -  Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures

        -  Maximal sniff pressures

      And when diaphragmatic dysfunction is suspected :

        -  Maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure

        -  Phrenic nerve conduction

      These patients will also beneficiate to the determination of volume variations of the upper
      rib cage, the lower rib cage and the abdominal compartments by using Opto-electronic
      plethysmography.
