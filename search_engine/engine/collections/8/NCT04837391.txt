      tests, timing of tests, and the method used for diagnosis. In non-cardiac surgery over the
      age of 60; the incidence of POCD was 26% in the postoperative 1st week and 10% in the
      postoperative 3rd month. Although old age is an important risk factor, POCD incidence of up
      to 36.6% has been reported in a younger period. Major cancer surgery is an important risk
      factor for development of POCD.

      Numerous biomarkers such as; S100β, NSE, Human IL-6, HMGB-1 protein; have been evaluated in
      studies to determine the diagnosis, prognosis, stage and treatment of POCD.

      In this study, our aim is to evaluate the relationship between the development of
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in geriatric urologic oncology patients with brain
      injury and inflammatory markers. (S100β, NSE, Human IL-6 and HMGB-1 protein).The hypothesis
      of our study is that postoperative brain injury and inflammatory markers (S100β, NSE, Human
      IL-6 and HMGB-1 protein) will be higher in patients who develop POCD compared to patients who
      do not develop POCD in geriatric urologic oncology surgery.
