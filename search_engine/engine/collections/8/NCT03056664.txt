      antibiotics, immunosuppressive drug and infliximab improve the quality of life of the
      patients suffering Crohn's perianal fistula, but the recurrent rate is still high. MSC showed
      promising effect in the therapy of CD, but the standard treatment strategy is unclear. Here
      investigators will carry out this phase II clinical trial to explore a effective therapeutic
      regimen of MSC in the Crohn's perianal fistula.
