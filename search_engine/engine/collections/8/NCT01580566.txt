      are associated with frequent hospitalisation and increased mortality. Furthermore, there are
      mechanistic reasons why one condition may beget the other; the so-called "cardiorenal
      syndrome". The investigators therefore wish to determine if a sizable myocardial infarction
      (heart attack) results in negative changes to renal structure and function (i.e. has a
      negative impact on the kidneys). The investigators also wish to determine if the renal
      response to a myocardial infarction is a predictor of the patients future health. To do this
      the investigators will measure markers of kidney function at the time of the heart attach, at
      discharge, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months and correlate this with the patients clinical
      condition.
