      intervention period of 3 months using indices of reliable change(36). This method assesses
      the number of people who changed in each of the groups based on the magnitude of change
      relative to pre-post variability and correlation. We will estimate the proportion of people
      with reliable change. Estimates from the pilot study will be used to plan the main trial if
      the pilot demonstrates feasibility. For the maintenance period, reliable change from baseline
      will also be estimated and used to identify the proportion of people who maintained reliable
      change or who gained/lost this status.

      The study is designed to detect a minimal important within-group change of moderate magnitude
      or greater (effect size Â½ standard deviation) with adequate precision. A sample size of 20
      per group with completed follow-up will provide a 95% confidence interval with precision that
      excludes an effect size of 0.03.
