        -  To identify the key components of driver pathways of primary and secondary soft tissue
           sarcomas.

        -  To perform the next-generation sequencing on primary versus normal on undifferentiated
           sarcomas.

      OUTLINE: Genomic DNA and RNA samples from undifferentiated sarcoma tumors are analyzed by
      next-generation sequencing for somatic mutations. Normal matched lymphocytes and tissue are
      also analyzed.
