      effective in reducing depressive symptoms and stress, and in improving memory and cognition
      of caregivers who perform a daily meditation for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks compared to
      caregivers listening to a relaxation CD for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks. A second purpose of
      this study is to examine the role of genetic and inflammatory markers in response to
      listening to a relaxation CD and meditation.
