        1. Group A :

           Thirty patients will participate in physical therapy program in form of high-tone
           external muscle stimulation (HTEMS), with Frequencies continuously will be scanned from
           4096 Hz to 31768 Hz, allowing for a much higher power of up to 5000 mW to be introduced
           3 times per week, for 10 weeks plus supervised regular aerobic exercise program on
           stationary bicycle with moderate intensity, ( score 12-14 on Borg scale for rate of
           perceived exertion) 40 minutes per session, 3 times per week, for 10 weeks .

        2. Group B:

      Thirty patients will participate in a supervised regular aerobic exercise program only on
      stationary bicycle with moderate intensity, (score 12-14 on Borg scale for rate of perceived
      exertion) 40 minutes per session, 3 times per week, for 10 weeks.
