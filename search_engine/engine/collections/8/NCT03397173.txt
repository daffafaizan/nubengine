    
      Primary Endpoint To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of standard
      dose azacitidine and oral dose of ascorbic acid in patients with MDS, AML, and MDS /
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) overlap with heterozygous TET2 mutations

      Secondary Endpoints

        1. The safety profile of the combination in the targeted patient population

        2. Response duration

        3. Overall survival of the treated population (compared to matched historical cohort of
           patients treated with single agent Azacitidine)

        4. The identification of biomarkers that predict response to the combination

      Study Design This is an open-label, phase II study that will be conducted at Cleveland
      Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute.

      Azacitidine will be administered intravenously or subcutaneously at a fixed dose of
      75mg/m2/day for 7 consecutive days, (allowing for weekends, and holidays) of each 28-day
      cycle. Ascorbic acid will be administered orally daily at 1 g/day three days prior to start
      azacitidine and then continues daily for a total of 28 days of each 28 day cycle.
