      high-risk patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this endovascular
      prosthesis is safe and effective for the intended use of treating AAA/iliac aneurysm in
      patients who are at high risk for standard aneurysm surgical repair. Up to 400 patients will
      be enrolled at the Cleveland clinic Foundation. Baseline procedures may include angiogram,
      intravascular ultrasound, CT scan, physical exam, blood work and ankle-brachial index. The
      endovascular prosthesis is placed in the operating room under regional or general anesthesia
      and the procedure length is approximately 2-3 hours. Follow up evaluations will be done at 1
      month, 6 months (if clinically necessary), 12 months and yearly, and may include a physical
      exam, CT scan, KUB, ultrasound, blood work, and an ankle-brachial index.
