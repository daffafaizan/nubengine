      of mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI), likely via
      decreased gut permeability, and they hypothesize supplemental vitamin A at the time of HSCT
      can reduce the risk of MBI-LCBI and gastrointestinal graft versus host disease (GI GVHD). A
      3x3 dose escalation/de-escalation study design will be used to determine the safety and
      dosing required to maintain vitamin A levels in the upper quartile of normal range for age at
      day +30 (Â± 7 days) with single dose vitamin A supplementation prior to hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation.
