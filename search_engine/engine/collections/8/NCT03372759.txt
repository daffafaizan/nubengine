      phacoemulsification and vitrectomy by photography of purkinjereflexes. During vitrectomy
      tamonade with air or saline are regarded as equal in substituting the removed vitreous. In
      case of airtamponade, air will be resolved within several days. As airtamponade induces more
      anterior movement of the implanted intraocular lens in the superior parts of the lens, tilt
      can result. Saline doesnÂ´t have any influence on the intraocular lens.
