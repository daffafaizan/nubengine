      end of treatment. The appliance in this study is designed by Prof. Seifi and will be
      constructed by a well trained technician in the orthodontic laboratory of shahid Beheshti
      School of dentistry under the supervision of the operator. The appliance consists of a jack
      screw in the midpalatal region plus two Adams' clasps on the upper 1st molars and four Kimia
      clasps on the buccal embrasure of the upper deciduous molars or premolars. For the mandibular
      portion there is an incisal clasp and incisors are capped by acrylic.

      The participants will be advised to use the appliance 24 hours per day except for meal times
      and when brushing the teeth or reading Farsi or English in class room.

      Each patient will pay his/her first recall visit to the orthodontic department one week after
      the appliance delivery and will be instructed to turn the maxillary expansion jack screw 1:4
      turn twice a week to achieve coordination of the upper and lower arches in the transverse
      dimension. The patients will be evaluated over one month intervals and necessary adjustments
      were made.

      All cephalometric records, before and after treatment, will be coded and analyzed by a second
      party and the ultimate results and evaluations will be made.
