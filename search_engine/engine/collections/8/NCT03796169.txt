      and colorectal cancer-related death. It is uncertain how to improve colonoscopy quality
      effectively. The quality of screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer depends on the
      endoscopist who performed the examination. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      impact of endoscopists' personal characteristics on the quality of colonoscopy and
      effectiveness of intervention.
