      factor for cardiovascular morbidity. The mechanisms responsible for developments of
      cardiovascular sequelae in patients with OSA include hypoxia, hypercapnia, exaggerated
      negative intrathoracic pressure and bursts of sympathetic activity provoking surges in blood
      pressure and heart rate. Meanwhile, increase of inflammatory mediators, which included
      C-reactive protein (CRP), oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) -1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and
      tumor necrotic factor- (TNF-)), also involve in the development of cardiovascular disease
      in patients with OSAS.

      According to our preliminary study, serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were higher in patients with
      OSAS than control subjects and levels of both IL-6 and CRP were highly correlated with the
      lowest pulse oxygen saturation. Hypoxia triggered the production of IL-6 through the
      induction of NFB, which was demonstrated in ischemic heart disease and pancreatitis.
      However, this mechanism has not been prooved in OSAS.

      Therefore, we conduct this study to prove our hypothesis (1) The mRNA expression of IL-6 in
      peripheral blood monocytes was significantly higher in patients with OSAS than control
      subjects (2) The activation of NF-k B in peripheral blood monocytes was more significant in
      patients with OSAS than control subjects, and the level of NF- kB activation is associated
      with the level of IL-6 mRNA expression (3) CPAP therapy could lower both the activation of
      NF-kB and IL-6 mRNA expression in patients with moderate-severe OSAS.
