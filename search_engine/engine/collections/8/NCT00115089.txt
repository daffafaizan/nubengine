      summer and early fall at 25 sites across the U.S. Approximately 375 patients, based on
      severity of symptoms will be randomized among the treatments (150 to R926112, 150 to placebo,
      75 to Beconase). During, and for about 2-3 weeks prior to the study, patients will have to
      abstain from other anti-allergy medications. Patients will fill out diary cards two times per
      day to record their symptoms. The entire study should take between 2-4 weeks.
