      was approximately 41%. This means that current methods of clinical assessment fail to
      identify regions of mastectomy skin with poor blood flow that lead to necrosis in 41% of
      patients. The investigators know that using the SPY imaging system is more sensitive for
      necrosis than clinical assessment. With SPY Q analysis the investigators hope to obtain 90%
      sensitivity, 100% specificity at absolute perfusion unit values identified in the previous
      study. The investigators do not anticipate obtaining a 0% all-inclusive necrosis rate but do
      believe they can eliminate all clinically significant necrosis that would result in operative
      debridement or removal of implant. The less severe forms of necrosis including epidermolysis
      and incisional necrosis are self-limiting and usually do not require invasive interventions.
