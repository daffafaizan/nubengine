      the development of new approaches for investigating the underlying genetic basis of
      neurological disorders, but genetic questions remain open and on going. Application of many
      genetic techniques require a family pedigree and blood sample. Peripheral blood lymphoblasts
      which are banked also serve as a renewable source for harvesting DNA which can be used for
      developing genetic markers in the future. This study will allow collection of family and
      psychosocial information and blood specimens from patients with neurological diseases, their
      families, and normal control subjects.
