      medications, such as Prednisone and Cyclosporine A or Tacrolimus, that prevent the body from
      rejecting the transplanted organ. These medications may cause bone loss which leads to
      thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and therefore greatly increase the risk of having broken
      bones (fractures) after transplantation. Several published studies have shown that 14% to 35%
      of heart transplant patients develop fractures (spine, ribs and hip) during the first year
      after transplantation. We have previously shown that alendronate (Fosamax), a drug approved
      by the FDA for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and prednisone-induced
      osteoporosis, prevents bone loss after heart transplantation. We are conducting this study to
      determine whether a newer drug, zoledronic acid, is as effective as alendronate.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year study. Participants will
      receive one dose of active zoledronic acid during the first month after heart or liver
      transplantation and weekly placebo alendronate pills or one dose of placebo zoledronic acid
      and weekly active alendronate pills for the first year after transplant. Over 2 years,
      participants will provide blood samples on nine occasions. Bone density will be performed 4-5
      times and spine xrays will be performed twice.
