    
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of a 3-month ad libitum program of the
      "exergame" "Dance Dance Revolution" (DDR) versus traditional treadmill exercise. Each group
      of subjects will be assessed at baseline, and then assigned exclusively to one of the two
      exercise modalities. Subjects will be free to attend exercise sessions in their assigned
      exercise modality at the exercise facility, at a frequency, duration and intensity of their
      own choosing with minimal staff supervision, for a period of exactly 90 days; adoption of new
      exercise programs outside of the study will be prohibited. Dosages of any concurrent
      medications will be maintained constant, and all subjects will receive standardized nutrition
      counseling.
