      obstructive calcified chronic pancreatitis. However, the investigators notice that patients
      after ESWL alone in calcified CP is followed by spontaneous elimination of stone fragments
      and pain relief. Inui reported that 40% of 555 patients spontaneous eliminate stone
      fragments. Dumonceau found that combining systematic endoscopy with ESWL adds to the cost of
      patient care, without improving the outcome of the pancreatic pain.

      So the investigators design such a prospective and randomized controlled trial. People
      diagnosed with uncomplicated painful chronic pancreatitis and calcifications obstructing the
      MPD will be randomly assigned to the ESWL or endoscopy group according to a table of random
      numbers.

      ESWL will be performed in all patients using a electromagnetic lithotriptor. ESWL sessions
      will be repeated if necessary, until stone fragmentation is obtained. Patients in the
      endoscopy group will undergo endoscopy in 48 hours with possible stent insertion. In the ESWL
      group, if pain continues or aggravates, endoscopic drainage of the MPD will be carried out.

      Follow-up will consists of telephone interview1 after treatment and clinical examination
      every 6 months thereafter. Data collected will include clinical presentation, ESWL,
      endoscopic and surgical procedures, life quality. In addition, S-MRCP will be performed 6
      months after treatment. Blood glucose, insulin, stool elastase will be taken each clinical
      examination.
