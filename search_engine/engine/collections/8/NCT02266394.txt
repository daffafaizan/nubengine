      St. Mary's Hospital. Studies include formal measurement of blood and urinary markers of
      kidney function, BOLD MR and multidetector CT scanning. Forty-two non-diabetic patients
      between 40 and 80 years of any race or ethnicity will be recruited. All will have
      hypertension (defined as BPâ‰¥140/90 mmHg or ongoing antihypertensive drug therapy) but will
      have less than 180 mmHg to be included (with or without drug therapy). These subjects will be
      free of cardiovascular events within 3 months and will not have implanted electrical devices,
      such as a pacemaker or defibrillator. All patients will have identified large vessel
      renovascular disease (RVD) for Aims 1, 2 and 3. At least 10% of these subjects will be of
      African-American descent (self-identified) and recruited in collaboration with the University
      of Mississippi under the direction of Dr. Luis Juncos and the University of Alabama under the
      direction of Dr. David Calhoun. For completion of Aims 2 and 3, a three-day evaluation will
      be repeated between three and four months later, and ongoing safety and imaging studies will
      be performed up to 24 months after MSC administration. Participants in these protocols will
      undergo transvenous kidney biopsy under the direction of Drs. McKusick and Misra and their
      colleagues in Interventional Radiology. All subjects for these studies will complete the
      research plan at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.
