      thymoma treated with octreotide. II. Determine the duration of remission in these patients.
      III. Determine the toxicity of the octreotide regimen in this population. IV. Determine the
      response rate, duration of remission, survival and toxicity of prednisone added to octreotide
      in patients with stable disease following octreotide alone.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive octreotide subcutaneously three times daily for 1 month. After
      two courses of treatment, patients are assessed for response. Patients experiencing partial
      or complete response continue octreotide for a maximum of 1 year (12 courses) in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable disease after 2 courses
      of octreotide receive daily oral prednisone in addition to octreotide for an additional 2
      courses. These patients are then reevaluated and continue on octreotide plus prednisone for a
      maximum of 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months
      for the next 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 38 patients accrued into this study over approximately 2
      years.
