      rituximab in subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). This study
      is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab
      in subjects previously treated with at least 2 prior systemic lines of therapy for FL, and
      features early futility stopping to maintain subject safety.
