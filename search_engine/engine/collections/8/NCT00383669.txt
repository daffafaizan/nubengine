      developing regions is limited, but gradually becoming standard of care in some countries.
      Multivitamin supplements have demonstrated immune-enhancing effects among individuals in
      pre-HAART HIV disease stages. However, the efficacy and safety of micronutrient supplements
      need to be documented in the context of HAART. This study is a double-blind randomized
      clinical trial, conducted to examine the effect of multivitamins (including B, C, and E) on
      HIV disease progression among individuals taking HAART. Participants are HIV-positive
      Tanzanian men and women aged 18 years and older, who are initiating HAART at the time of
      randomization. Eligible individuals are randomized to receive daily oral supplements in one
      of two intervention groups: a) multivitamins at the single Recommended Dietary Allowance
      (RDA) level; and b) multivitamins at multiples of the RDA at the same doses used in our
      previous study "A Trial of Vitamins in HIV Progression and Transmission".
