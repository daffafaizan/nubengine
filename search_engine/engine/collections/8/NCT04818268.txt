      adaptation using a between subjects design. Participants will be assigned to one of two
      groups. Each group will undergo both auditory and somatosensory working memory tests. This
      will be followed by adaptation to altered auditory feedback. Using a different group of
      subjects, cTBS will be used to disrupt neural activity in Brodmann area 46v in ventrolateral
      prefrontal cortex to test its involvement in adaptation. One set of tests will focus on the
      effects of cTBS on both auditory and somatosensory working memory. A second set of tests will
      focus on the effects of cTBS on speech motor adaptation to altered auditory feedback. Both
      working memory and adaptation are assessed on 0 to 100 scales.
