      evaluable subjects. The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence crossover with a washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session,
      the subjects will be administered a single oral dose of 250mg methyldopa (one BF-Methyldopa
      Tablet 250mg or one Metopa Tab 250mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours.
      Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0h) and at 0.75 (45min), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
      3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. The plasma concentrations of methyldopa will
      be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the
      plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as
      Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. Anylasis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on
      logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf using the General Linear Model. The
      two one-side tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean
      difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to assess the bioequivalence of the two
      products.
