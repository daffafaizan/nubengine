      Open-label Phase I study characterizing the safety, tolerability, and activity of
      subcutaneous rituximab hyaluronidase (sqR) alone (KSHV-MCD), or combined with local standard
      of care chemotherapy (BL or DLBCL), in 2 age-based cohorts of patients:

        1. Cohort 1: Age >= 15

        2. Cohort 2: Age: 2-14

      sqR dose for Cohort 1 (adults) will be 1400 mg (flat dose); sqR dose for Cohort 2
      (pediatrics) will depend on patient weight: >= 35 kg: 1400 mg, < 35 kg: 700 mg. For all
      participants, sqR will be administered with local standard of care chemotherapy (BL, DLBCL)
      or alone (KSHV-MCD), and supportive care.

      Each cohort comprises two Therapy Groups. Therapy Group 1: up to 6 participants and will
      receive the first cycle of rituximab IV, and subsequent cycles as flat-dose sqR. Therapy
      Group 2: up to 12 participants and will receive flat-dose sqR for all cycles.

      Disease-specific chemotherapy to be administered with rituximab hyaluronidase include:

      PEDIATRIC BURKITT LYMPHOMA (BL): cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone followed by 6
      cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and methotrexate (COP-COM).

      DLBCL: 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone PO on days 1-5
      of cycle 1 (CHOP).

      ADULT BL: 6 cycles modified dose: etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and
      prednisone PO on days 1-5 (adjusted EPOCH).

      KSHV-MCD: Rituximab or rituximab hyaluronidase SC on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months.
