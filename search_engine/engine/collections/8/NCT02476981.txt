    
      All patients fasted for 8 h before the procedure and were premedicated with midazolam 0.02
      mg/kg. In the prone position, patients were monitored by ECG, non-invasive blood pressure,
      and pulse oximetry, and received supplemental oxygen (3 L/min) via a nasal cannula during the
      procedure.

      Study drugs were prepared in 20 mL and 50 mL syringes to maintain a double-blind design. One
      anaesthesiologist administered normal saline or dexmedetomidine contained in the 20-mL
      syringe during the initial 10 min for loading dose of dexmedetomidine. Then, another
      investigator who did not know which syringes contained remifentanil or dexmedetomidine
      adjusted the infusion rate with a 50-mL syringe according to patients' response. After all
      patients in both groups received a bolus dose of propofol 0.3 mg/kg, patients given
      remifentanil received continuous infusion of the drug at 1-5 µg/kg/h, and patients receiving
      dexmedetomidine were given that drug at 0.3-0.4 µg/kg over 10 min, followed by continuous
      infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-1 µg/kg/h throughout the procedure. Levels of patient
      sedation were checked during the procedure and infusion rates of the study drugs were
      adjusted to maintain alertness/sedation below 4 on the OAA/S scale.

      Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate
      (RR), and adverse effects of the study drugs were recorded during the procedure. Ephedrine 5
      mg was injected when systolic blood pressure decreased below 90 mmHg. Duration of PACU stay
      was also recorded.

      Operator satisfaction score and patient's overall pain experience were also recorded.
