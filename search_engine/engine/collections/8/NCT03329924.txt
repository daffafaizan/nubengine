    
      The purpose of this study is to study implementation efficacy of an early mobilization
      program in a rural mixed surgical and medical ICU.

      The aim of the study is to test whether a program of early mobilization training along with
      ongoing ABCEDF bundle implementation will change the following:

        1. early mobilization of ventilated patients in the ICU measured using accelerometer data
           as a primary measure along with other nurse reported data from the EMR

        2. ICU length of stay

        3. other clinical variable outlined in the design section

      This study will have a pre- and post-implementation design. Baseline activity levels of
      eligible patients will be collected prospectively for approximately 3 months while staff is
      being trained and the details of the early mobilization program are being finalized. All
      eligible patients will wear an accelerometer while in the ICU. Length of ICU stay, total
      hospitalization, discharge disposition, and the occurrence of certain hospital-acquired
      complications will also be recorded as part of the baseline/current practice data. There will
      be a pause in data collection as the early mobilization program is incorporated into standard
      practice.

      Data collection will resume approximately one month after the implementation of the program.

      All eligible patients will wear an accelerometer to measure activity level while in the ICU.
      Length of ICU stay, total hospitalization, discharge disposition, and the occurrence of
      certain hospital-acquired complications will also be recorded. Other variables to be assessed
      include: ICU staffing costs, overall hospitalization costs, rate of patient falls, rate of
      staff injuries, level of exercise tolerance achieved by time of discharge.
