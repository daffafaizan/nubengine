    
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized and controlled study to compare the
      efficacy of a consolidation therapy with RIT vs. ASCT in patients with FL in CR or PR after
      second or third line chemotherapy supplemented with rituximab. Patients with FL will be
      eligible for screening at the time of relapsed or refractory disease after two or less
      chemotherapy lines at least one containing rituximab.

      This study will be conducted in six steps as follows. Screening Phase, Enrolment and
      Induction chemotherapy (STEP I) Randomization (STEP II) Stem cell mobilization and collection
      (STEP III) Consolidation (RIT vs ASCT) (STEP IV) Maintenance (STEP V) Follow-up Phase (STEP
      VI)
