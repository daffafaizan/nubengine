      in study IST Q4935s that low-density granulocytes (LDG) are elevated in the blood of patients
      with moderate or severe asthma. The greatest frequency and the highest percentages of LDG
      were observed in subjects with severe asthma. The LDG, which were first identified and
      characterized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, have been reported to display
      increased cytotoxicity for endothelial cells, increased tendency to form neutrophil
      extracellular traps, and increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It was also
      observed that the LDG expressed increased levels of CD15, which can facilitate attachment of
      activated platelets to the LDG. Identification of a putative serum biomarker that correlates
      with increased levels of the CD15+ LDG may be useful for the detection of
      neutrophil-associated inflammation in severe asthma.

      Thirty subjects will be screened to identify 20 subjects with severe persistent asthma. The
      following data and/or samples will then be obtained within three weeks of the clinical
      assessment: (1) the percentages of LDG will be quantified by flow cytometry; (2) a blood
      sample will be collected into a PAXgene Blood tube and stored until shipped to Genentech for
      gene profiling analysis; and (3) a serum sample will be collected for measurement of total
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) and for future confirmation of potential biomarkers identified in the
      gene profiling analyses.
