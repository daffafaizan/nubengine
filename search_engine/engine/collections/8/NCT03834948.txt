    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and expansion
      study of AO-176 in patients with solid tumors. Part A of this study will examine escalating
      repeat doses of AO-176 monotherapy in patients with select advanced solid tumors, including
      epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), which will include primary peritoneal and fallopian tube
      carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; endometrial carcinoma; castration
      resistant prostate cancer; non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma; papillary thyroid carcinoma;
      pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma; and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, for which
      standard therapy proven to provide clinical benefit does not exist or is no longer effective.

      Part B of this study will examine escalating repeat doses of AO-176 in combination with
      paclitaxel in platinum-resistant EOC, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube
      carcinoma; endometrial carcinoma; and gastric adenocarcinoma/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.

      The monotherapy and combination Dose Escalation portions of the study utilize a classic 3+3
      design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion of the cohort in the event of
      a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Once the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established in
      dose escalation, tumor-specific dose expansion cohorts will be recruited to further assess
      safety and evaluate preliminary efficacy of AO-176 as monotherapy and in combination with
      paclitaxel.
