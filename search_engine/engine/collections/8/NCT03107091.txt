    
      Terlipressin continuous infusion will be adminstered via an ambulatory pump initially for 7
      days in a clinical pharmacology unit. Serial blood draws for pharmacokinetic analysis will be
      performed to determine steady state concentration of both terlipressin and
      8-lysine-vasopressin during infusion. After establishing safety and tolerance of infusion for
      7 days, patients will be transitioned to an outpatient setting where they will be treated
      with terlipressin continuous infusion for an additional 21 days, monitored daily by home care
      nurses.

      A total of 6 patients will be treated. Monitoring will include successful management of
      ascites, with reduction in paracentesis procedures and decreased ascites fluid volume,
      further supported by improvement in renal function.
