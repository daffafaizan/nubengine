      seeking pain relief. Parenteral pain killers such as opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflamatuar
      drugs (NSAID) and paracetamol are used commonly in these patients. However, these drugs are
      not out of adverse effects and can not be used in some patients with diverse comorbidities.
      Gel forms of NSAIDs are used commonly in the outpatient clinics and shown to be effective in
      these patients by a Cochrane meta-analysis. However, there is no data on the effect of gel
      forms of analgesics in ED. The application of analgesics in gel forms might be a reasonable
      alternative to the paranteral drugs with fewer adverse effects.

      The present study aimed to reveal the effect of ketoprofen gel in patients presented with low
      back pain to emergency department.
