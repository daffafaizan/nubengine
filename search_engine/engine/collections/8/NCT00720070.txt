        -  To compare the efficacy, in terms of overall survival, disease-specific survival,
           recurrence, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness, of a PET/CT scan-guided watch and
           wait policy with the current practice of planned neck dissection in the management of
           advanced (N2 or N3) nodal metastases in patients with primary head and neck squamous
           cell carcinoma undergoing chemoradiotherapy.

        -  To assess the predictive value of PET/CT scanning in detecting persistent or residual
           disease in the primary site.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center,
      chemotherapy schedule (concurrent platinum vs concurrent cetuximab vs neoadjuvant and
      concurrent platinum vs neoadjuvant docetaxel, platinum, and fluorouracil with concurrent
      platinum), T stage (T1-T2 vs T3-T4), and N stage (N2a-N2b vs N2c-N3). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients undergo
           PET/CT scan at 9-13 weeks after completion of CRT. Patients with complete response of
           primary site undergo neck dissection within 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo neck dissection and then receive standard CRT. Patients undergo
           PET/CT scan at 9-13 weeks after completion of CRT.

      Patients are assessed periodically for quality-of-life. Tissue and blood samples collected
      periodically are stored for future research.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then
      bimonthly for 1 year.
