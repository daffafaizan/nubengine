      mechanical and physiological damage until the fertilized ovum reaches the uterus.
      Subsequently, spontaneous hatching occurs, and enables the embryo to attach to the
      endometrium. The technique of assisted hatching was originally investigated as a means to
      improve implantation in cases of zona hardening, and is commonly performed in 3-day embryos.
      In the current study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of assisted hatching on
      5-day frozen embryos.
