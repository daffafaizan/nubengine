      conditions. Physiologically active testosterone, also known as "free" testosterone, is
      present as a small percentage of the total blood level, mostly bound to sex hormone binding
      globulin and albumin. Estimation of serum free testosterone is difficult and costly,
      requiring equilibrium dialysis of a serum sample. These binding proteins are not normally
      present in saliva. It is hypothesized that the free fraction of testosterone in blood is in
      equilibrium with the extravascular space, notably saliva. The sponsor proposes to test this
      hypothesis by sampling saliva and serum and measuring testosterone. Serum free testosterone
      will be measured following equilibrium dialysis. To perform this study approximately 40
      eugonadal and 20 hypogonadal males will be recruited.
