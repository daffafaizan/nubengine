    
      To determine:

        1. the frequency, timing and correlates (clinical and angiographic) of drug-eluting stent
           (DES) thrombosis in a patient population with few clinical and angiographic exclusion
           criteria,

        2. the relationship of aspirin and/or clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness, and general platelet
           reactivity to early and late DES thrombosis in separate phases stratified by whether the
           patient is taking dual (aspirin plus clopidogrel) or single (aspirin alone) antiplatelet
           therapy, and

        3. combining the findings from the above 2 objectives, to identify a cohort representing a
           significant proportion of all patients at increased risk to have early and/or late DES
           stent thrombosis.
