      collected from an antecubital vein to assess serum/plasma aliquots of 200 μl each (frozen at
      -80°C until required for quantitation) for evaluation of biochemical parameters (fasting
      glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, serum creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, liver function
      enzymes, albumin) and determination of serum miR-192 and miR-25.

      Two urine samples will be also collected to assess aliquots of 200 μl each (frozen at -80°C
      until required for quantitation) for determination of albumin:creatinine ratio and urine
      expression of miR-192 and miR-25.
