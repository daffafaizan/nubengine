      parent/caregiver who are seen in the Sports Medicine clinic with a diagnosis of concussion.
      20 will receive usual care, and 20 will receive a decision aid to facilitate the decision
      making process about sport participation post-concussion. Adolescents and their
      parent/caregiver will complete separate surveys at a minimum of three timepoints: before
      their initial clinic visit, after each clinic visit (up until a decision regarding sports
      participation post-concussion is made), and three months after their final clinic visit. The
      study team will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians about their experiences
      with implementation.
