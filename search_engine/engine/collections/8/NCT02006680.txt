      determine adequacy of suppression. However, the use of this stimulation test to monitor
      suppression requires an expensive medication and collection of multiple blood samples.
      Alternative methods of monitoring pubertal suppression during gonadotropin releasing hormone
      receptor agonist (GnRHa) therapy have included both random and trough levels of Luteinizing
      Hormone (LH), estradiol or inhibin B. Recently, the free alpha subunit of pituitary
      glycoprotein (FASPG) has also been shown to be a potentially useful marker of hormonal
      suppression (Hirsch HJ, et al, JCEM 95:2841, 2010) as it undergoes a paradoxical rise
      following initiation of therapy, and reverts to baseline upon completion.

      In this investigator-initiated pilot study we will evaluate novel markers of pubertal
      suppression in children receiving standard of care gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor
      agonist therapy for the treatment of central precocious puberty. Children with central
      precocious puberty who have selected treatment with Supprelin LA will undergo hormonal
      testing of markers of pubertal activity before and after placement of the Supprelin LA
      insert.
