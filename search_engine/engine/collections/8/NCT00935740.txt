      age-matched volunteers. TF was 2.9 fold higher (p < 0.001) in HF patients vs. controls. HF
      patients showed increased clinical events (RR=1.29, p=0.04) when comparing procoagulant
      activity above/below median. HF is associated with increased TF expression.

      Previous studies suggest that markers of coagulation are elevated in heart failure (HF).
      Tissue factor (TF) plays the cardinal role in initiating the coagulation cascade. This study
      determines TF expression in HF and its association with disease progression.

      Methods: Monocytes were obtained from 50 NYHA function class II-IV HF patients and 25
      age-matched disease-free volunteers. TF protein, TF procoagulant activity, and tissue factor
      pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were determined.
