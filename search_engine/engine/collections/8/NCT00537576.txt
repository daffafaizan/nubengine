    
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that LACTIN-V is safe, well tolerated, and
      acceptable to healthy pre-menopausal women when administered vaginally using pre-filled
      applicators at doses of 150 mg (5.0 x 10^8 CFU), 300 mg (1.0 x 10^9 CFU), or 600 mg (2.0 x
      10^9 CFU) daily for 5 consecutive days as compared to placebo applicators containing 150 mg,
      300 mg, or 600 mg of a matching placebo formulation without Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05.

      Safety will be assessed by:

        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events through assessing symptoms, physical
           examination findings, and signs of irritation involving the external genitalia, cervix
           or vagina, including disruption of the epithelium and blood vessels as seen on pelvic
           examination and colposcopy.

        -  Laboratory parameters including urinalysis, a complete blood count (CBC) with
           differential, and chemistry panels to assess systemic effects of the study product.

      Tolerability will be assessed by:

        -  The proportion of participants who discontinue study product use due to overt adverse
           events

        -  The proportion of participants who complete the full dosing schedule

      Acceptability will be assessed by:

      - Self-administered questionnaires and focus group discussions about acceptability of the
      study product
