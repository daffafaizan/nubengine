      but also a peripheral muscular weakness. This weakness is characterized by a loss in
      strength, harmful for the patients' life quality and vital prognosis (Swallow et al., 2007).
      Even if many studies have enlightened damages at a peripheral level, the muscular atrophy
      itself cannot totally explain the loss in force (Menon et al., 2012). Furthermore, the
      contractile properties of COPD muscles fibres are preserved (Debigare et al., 2003).
      Consequently, peripheral muscle weakness cannot only be explained by peripheral factors and
      central structures must be investigated.

      At the central level, it is admitted that force production is controlled by the activation of
      contralateral motor areas. In COPD, these areas were found to be less activated than in
      controls during force production (Alexandre et al., 2014). However, recent studies bring the
      evidence that ipsilateral motor areas are also mobilized to cope demand during such task. The
      activation of ipsilateral areas is possible through inter hemispheric pathways, as the corpus
      callosum. Recently, the integrity of the corpus callosum have been linked to the capability
      of activating the ipsilateral motor cortex (Chiou et al., 2014) during force production. This
      is of concern knowing that several studies reported white matter lesions in the brain of COPD
      patients (Dodd et al, 2012) and more precisely in regions containing the corpus callosum
      (Lahousse et al., 2013).

      Therefore, we hypothesize that COPD patients have a lower capability of activating their
      ipsilateral motor cortex during force production compared to controls.
