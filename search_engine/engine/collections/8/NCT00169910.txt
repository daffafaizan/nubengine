    
      Stable renal transplant patients on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with steroids, a
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be randomized for
      AUC-monitored withdrawal of either CNI or MMF.

      The progression of cardiovascular markers will be assessed by yearly measurements of Intima
      Media Thickness, Pulse Wave Velocity and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in both groups.

      The duration of the study will be 3 years and the target sample size is 100 patients per arm
