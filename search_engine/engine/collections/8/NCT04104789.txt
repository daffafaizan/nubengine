      approval. Kovanaze is available as a 0.2 ml metered spray and is intended to achieve pulpal
      anesthesia of 5 maxillary teeth on either side of the face.

      With the ability to avoid the traditional painful injection Kovanaze offers promise in the
      field of maxillary anesthesia and this study intends to:

        1. Compare Kovanaze to conventional needle anesthetic in adults

        2. Evaluate patient anxiety, tolerance and acceptability of Kovanaze in patients undergoing
           dental procedures
