    
      Luteinizing hormone is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of a non-covalent association of
      an α and a β subunit. Prior to the generation of human-LH (hLH) through recombinant
      technology, hLH had only been available for therapeutic use as human menopausal gonadotropins
      (hMG), a co-extracted, purified preparation of hLH and hFSH from urine of post menopausal
      women. Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone (Luveris) has been found to be well tolerated in
      human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies at doses of up to 40,000 IU in healthy
      female volunteers without any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) experience being reported.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate safety and efficacy of addition of Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone
           (Luveris) to a standard ART procedure.

      In this study, subjects were first treated with a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary
      desensitization according to centre's standard practice followed by administration of r-hFSH.
      All subjects were then treated with Recombinant Human -Luteinizing Hormone (Luveris)150 IU
      per day subcutaneous (s.c.) from Day 6 of stimulation of their ART treatment cycle,
      continuing at the same dose until injection of hCG upto and including day of last FSH dose.
