      incentives using an escalating schedule for 30 treatment-seeking, MA-dependent individuals
      with scores on tasks of working memory and assessments of neuropsychological and demographic
      status. At the beginning and end of the CM program, participants will participate in MRI
      scans while performing a working memory task and will complete a battery of select
      neurocognitive and psychological assays to address two specific aims: (1) to determine
      whether changes in neural function within frontostriatal circuitry from baseline to end of
      the 8-week CM program are associated with parallel changes in measures of cognitive control
      and impulsivity and with MA abstinence outcomes and (2) to determine whether structural
      changes in frontostriatal circuitry over the 8-week CM intervention correspond with
      neurocognitive, psychological and MA abstinence measures.
