    
      -  Before beginning radiation therapy, the participants will have a radiation planning
           computed tomographic (CT) scan of the tumor site. This is considered standard of care
           and the doctor will use the images from this scan to plan the radiation treatment.

        -  Participants may also receive surgery either before or after the study radiation
           treatment. This surgery is also considered standard of care and would be done regardless
           of being in the research study.

        -  The IMPT technique for delivering radiation is for research purposes only. Radiation
           treatment to the affected tumor will be given daily, Monday through Friday.

        -  The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment: assessment of
           nerve, neuromuscular, motor and sensory function by clinical exam and toxicity
           assessment.

        -  Participants will return for follow-up visits after completion of the radiation
           treatment at the following intervals: 6 weeks after completion of treatment, 6 months
           after treatment, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, and then each year after for up
           to 15 years.
