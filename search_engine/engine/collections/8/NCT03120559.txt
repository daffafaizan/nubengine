      patients have difficulty complying. Floss holder devices and SMS may be useful in enhancing
      both the frequency and effectiveness of dental hygiene behaviors, by increasing patients'
      motivation and self-regulation efforts, but scarce scientific literature supporting their
      worth in controlling gingivitis and the underlying psychological processes is currently
      available.
