      investigated in a pilot study using a randomized controlled trial. According to the efficacy
      of the parenting training, it is expected that parents in the training condition show higher
      scores on mental health scales (BSI-18) and quality of Partnership (PFB). Furthermore, it is
      expected that infants whose parents has taken part in the parenting training have lower
      severity ratings of regulatory disorders assessed with the Baby-DIPS diagnostic interview
      than infants of parents in the care as usual control condition.
