    
      Background:

        -  Lack of reliable non-invasive method to monitor ablation zone during radiofrequency or
           microwave ablation

        -  Development of a non-invasive technique to examine temperature changes based on changes
           in CT or CBCT attenuation

      Objectives:

      -To measure accuracy of temperature monitoring using non-invasive thermomap (temperature
      imaging profile) method compared to the currently accepted invasive thermocouples method.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects are eligible if:

           --They are scheduled in interventional radiology for hepatic radiofrequency or microwave
           ablation requiring thermocouples for monitoring

        -  Subjects are excluded if they have:

             -  An altered mental status precluding understanding or consenting for the procedure

             -  A gross body weight exceeding 375 pounds (upper limit of angio table)

             -  A pregnancy

      Design:

        -  Number of participants: 16

        -  Number of sites: 1

        -  Recruitment time frame: 2 years

        -  Type of study: pilot study to validate an image analysis thermometry technique

        -  Patients undergoing clinically indicated hepatic ablations are eligible for this
           protocol. As part of this study, one to two additional research scans of the liver may
           be acquired during the ablation and analyzed separately with our software and compared
           with thermocouple measurements. There will be no changes in devices, probes or
           additional probe manipulations as part of this study. The operator will not modify the
           procedure based on results of this software.
