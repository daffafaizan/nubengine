      effects can sometimes be severe. One of the main difficulties is to identify before treatment
      patients who will respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, the selection is done
      in a very large majority of cases on the expression of PD-L1 by the tumor. But this biomarker
      is not sufficient to identify patients responding or not to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In
      addition, factors extrinsic to the tumor, to its microenvironment and patient immunity may be
      involved in the response to immunotherapy such as the microbiota.

      The investigators therefore assume that the immune response in place during immunotherapy
      treatment differs according to the profile of patient response to immunotherapy.

      The main objective of this project is to describe local and systemic anti-tumor immune system
      of patients responders or not to immune checkpoint inhibitors, but also whether the
      immunological characterization of sputum could be a reflection of the microenvironment tumor.
      The secondary objective is to study the intestinal microbiota tract of patients receiving
      immunotherapy, depending on their consumption of antibiotics, and compare it to the pulmonary
      microbiota.
