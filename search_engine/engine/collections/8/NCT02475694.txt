      complex and still not fully elucidate. No specific biomarkers are identified and the
      diagnosis is solely based on impaired oxygenation.

      The purpose of the present study is to identify biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation in
      blood withdrawn simultaneous from the pulmonary artery and the left atrium during surgery and
      up to 20 hours after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.
