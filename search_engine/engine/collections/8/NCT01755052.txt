      older adults who have recently had an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While there is
      emerging interest in understanding the role of geriatric conditions as they pertain to
      cardiovascular outcomes, there is no standard, feasible assessment of older patients with AMI
      that can stratify their risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. Currently available risk
      models are designed solely to predict clinical events (e.g. mortality, reinfarction). This is
      insufficient for shared decision making with older patients, who consistently rate
      maintenance of favorable health status as a top priority. This study will address these gaps
      by melding principles from geriatrics and cardiology to create post-AMI risk models
      specifically designed for older patients. This study is significant because older persons
      with AMI are a growing, yet understudied, population.

      Dr. Sarwat Chaudhry at Yale University is conducting a multi-center, observational study
      designed to collect data about the post-AMI recovery period that will be used to generate
      risk models for older patients with AMI. The intent of the study is to use the knowledge from
      the data collected in SILVER-AMI to ultimately design interventions to improve the care and
      outcomes of older patients with AMI.

      Study coordinators will screen older patients hospitalized with an AMI. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline prior to AMI hospital discharge through an interview, physical
      assessment and medical record review. One follow-up interview will be conducted approximately
      6 months later by the Yale Follow-up Center. Clinical outcomes will be assessed for the
      follow-up period occurring 6 months post AMI hospitalization through self-report and medical
      record review.
