      a coin) patients who have Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity to a 4-week Gluten-containing diet
      (GCD) or to a Gluten free diet (GFD). The study will evaluate small bowel (SB) permeability
      functionally (2-sugar differential excretion), morphologically, using probe-based confocal
      laser to evaluate the small intestinal, as well as molecularly, using tight junction (TJ)
      messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in small bowel mucosa in response to the different diets.
