      measurements and evaluation. Study protocol began in the early morning after overnight
      fasting (10.7 Â± 4.7 h). Firstly, participants were asked to lay in the supine position for 15
      minutes in rest to measure resting heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during
      the last 10 minutes and blood pressure afterward. Subsequently, participants completed PSS-10
      and HADS questionnaires, and then a venous blood sample was taken for BDNF and irisin
      concentrations measurements. Then measurements of cognitive functions and motor learning were
      performed. After baseline assessments, participants were randomized to the experimental and
      control groups. The experimental group subjects (n=15; 13 women) participated in 10 weeks Tai
      Chi practice. In the control group, participants (n=15; 13 women) were instructed do not to
      engage in any additional sports practice. All tests and measurements were repeated after 10
      weeks in the same order as it was at the beginning of the study.
