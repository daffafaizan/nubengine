      data in humans suggest an anti-atherosclerotic effect of the drug. The investigators assessed
      the impact of maraviroc treatment in HIV-infected patients on several subclinical indicators
      of atherosclerosis and putative mechanisms for such an effect.

      HIV-treated patients under effective antiretroviral (ART) therapy, with a Framingham risk
      score >20% and a brachial flow-mediated dilation (bFMD) <4%, as indices of high
      cardiovascular risk, were recruited. Maraviroc (300 mg per os for 24 weeks) was administered
      on top of ART to all participants using a cross-over design. Brachial FMD, carotid-femoral
      pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were measured as
      non-invasive markers of atherosclerosis. Vascular competence, as expressed by the ratio of
      circulating endothelial micro-particles (EMPs) to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), as
      well as markers of systemic inflammation, monocyte activation and platelet activation were
      assessed.
