2012. the use of technetium 99m as a clinical tracer elementthe physical properties, metabolism andradiation dose of tc 99m are discussed andcompared with those of i 123, i 125, i 131 and i 132.it is shown that with tc 99m the highest'in vivo' counting rates are obtained for agiven internal radiation dose, so that mea-surements of high statistical accuracy maysafely be made.  the y-ray energy is nearoptimum for scanning and the observation oftransients allowing light-weight collima-tors to be used.  while tc 99m tagged albuminis considered superior to risa for ap-plications such as brain scanning, placentographyand the measurement of cardiacoutput, i 123 if it becomes available will be preferablefor thyroid scanning.
