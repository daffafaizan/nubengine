      novel mechanism of action that does not belong to any existing pharmacological class of
      anticancer agents currently being used in the clinics. Specifically, CPI-613 is Cornerstone
      Pharmaceutical Inc.'s lead drug from its Altered Energy Metabolism-Directed (AEMD) technology
      platform. It is selective against tumor cells (but not normal cells)according to preclinical
      studies.
