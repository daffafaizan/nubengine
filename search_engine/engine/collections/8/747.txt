ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during developmentmammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changesduring the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of theseevents are associated with the derepression or repression of certain enzymeswhich may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvementof ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genomeinto the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study ofbiosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effortin this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as wellas in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism whichoccur during the development of the rat embryonic liver has been undertaken.this report concerns the fluctuations in nuclear ribonuclease during hepaticdevelopment and some of the properties of the enzyme.
