      corticosteroid (ICS) responsivenesss. Managing asthma based on sputum eosinophils leads to
      fewer exacerbations than management adhering to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)
      guidelines. However the use of sputum to measure eosinophil levels is expensive and
      impractical within a clinical setting. This study explores the use of blood-eosinophil levels
      as a clinical predictor for exacerbations and asthma control within a UK primary care
      dataset.
