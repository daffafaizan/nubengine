      surgery.

      The patient will receive, on average, 4.5mCi of Technetium labeled diethylene-triamine-penta
      acetate (DTPA) prior to the time of ureteral localization. The Neoprobe 2000 gamma probe will
      be placed on the field in sterile fashion in a manner similar to that which is performed
      during a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy. The surgery will
      continue until the surgical team feels the time is appropriate for each ureter to be
      identified. At this point, the surgical team will use the gamma probe to localize the ureter
      and the attending physician will note either, "yes" or, "no" to their feeling is that they
      have correctly identified or did not identify each ureter. The surgical team will know that
      the ureter has been correctly identified when gentle manipulation of the tissue with forceps
      produces a "vermicular contraction" of the tubular structure suspected to be the ureter. No
      other tissue and/or structure produces this classic type of contraction. Background gamma
      counts, gamma counts over the ureter, and time between Tc-DTPA injection and ureteral
      localization will be recorded for each ureter sought. If the ureter cannot be localized with
      this technique, and the surgical team feels that it is imperative that the ureters be
      identified, then the attending surgeon may request a urologist to place stents in the
      standard, usual fashion.
