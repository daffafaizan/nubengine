      growing evidence that other variants including scalp, nail, inverse, and palmoplantar
      psoriasis are prevalent, undertreated, and are correlated with an increased risk of psoriatic
      arthritis that may result in significant morbidity with functional impairment and greater
      impairment in quality of life. Therefore, the main aim of the study is to provide robust
      efficacy and safety data on guselkumab treatment for palmoplantar non-pustular psoriasis. The
      study comprises of a Screening Phase (4 Weeks [Week -4 to 0]), a Treatment Phase (up to Week
      48) and a post-treatment follow-up phase (up to Week 56). Key efficacy assessments include
      physician assessments and patient-reported outcomes questionnaires. Safety evaluations will
      include 12-lead electrocardiogram at baseline, pregnancy testing and monitoring of vital
      signs at all visits and recording of adverse events throughout the study. Also, participants
      will be evaluated for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis at all visits including
      follow-up visit. Biomarker assessments will include the evaluation of relevant markers in
      serum for all participants. The study will have an overall duration of 56 weeks.
