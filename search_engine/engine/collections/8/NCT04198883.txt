      Secondary Objective : The objective is to establish the individual efficacy of the
      interventional procedure beginning at the first G-CSF administration to 6 months after the
      injection of autologous expanded CD34+ stem cells (ProtheraCytes®) in AMI patients with a
      LVEF≤45% after PTCA and stent(s) implantation.
