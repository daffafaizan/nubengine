      in patients with chest trauma and to establish a score based on these factors to guide the
      analgesic protocol.

      Methods: This is a prospective study carried out from 2014 to 2016 including patients aged â‰¥
      18 years, admitted for isolated chest trauma. Each patient received a nebulization of 10 mg
      morphine. If Visual Analog Score (VAS) assessed after 10 minutes still> 4, nebulization was
      repeated every 10 minutes until pain relief. At 30 minutes, VAS> 4 means failure.
