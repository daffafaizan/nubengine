      SELECT-2 (NCT01750281)RCTs. Within this NIS patients will be followed longitudinally for
      treatment information and outcomes. The final dataset will enable linkage at the individual
      patient level of the clinical information datasets collected within LUMINIST to the
      exploratory biomarker data generated from samples collected as part of SELECT-1 screening.
      This will enable the examination of various molecular markers in patients with v-Ki-ras2
      Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) wild-type and some KRAS mutation positive
      (KRAS+) patients. The LUMINIST study aims to enable the investigation of various molecular
      segments in NSCLC, based on patient consent and where permitted by local legislation, some of
      which have not yet been discovered. The availability of a longitudinal dataset of clinical
      information linked to tumour samples will be a valuable tool to readily assess the clinical
      utility of potential new biomarkers. The determination of current standards of care and
      outcomes in future molecular segments of interest will provide valuable new insights to the
      scientific community.
