      obtained by finger pricking and the administration of insulin via subcutaneous bolus
      injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion.

      This study seeks to test a new treatment approach where glucose sensing and insulin
      administration are combined and performed at a single subcutaneous tissue site (single-port
      treatment approach). A single-port device consisting of a continuous glucose sensor and an
      insulin infusion cannula is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of 10 type-1 diabetes
      patients and used for insulin infusion and simultaneous glucose sensing over a 7-day period.
      The performance of the single-port device is assessed by comparing the obtained glucose
      readings with those of a blood glucose meter and an additionally worn control sensor.
