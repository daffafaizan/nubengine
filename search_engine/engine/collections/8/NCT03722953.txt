      peripheral circulation; however, the effects of a single exercise session on the cerebral
      circulation are unknown. This study will measure cerebrovascular function and peripheral
      vascular function before and after aerobic exercise at high and low intensities.

      The research aims are:

        1. To determine if a single bout of aerobic exercise acutely enhances cerebrovascular
           function

        2. To determine the effect of aerobic exercise intensity and dose on cerebrovascular
           function in healthy adults.

        3. To determine if the acute exercise-induced changes in cerebrovascular function are
           associated with acute exercise-induced changes in peripheral vascular function in
           healthy adults.
