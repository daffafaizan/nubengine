      (CD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is
      thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic, immune, microbial and
      environmental factors. The role of vitamin D in bone health and calcium homeostasis is well
      documented. However, emerging data suggests that vitamin D may also regulate immune
      responses, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and disease activity of IBD.

      The investigators seek to identify CD or UC patients with mild disease or in clinical
      remission who have vitamin D levels <30 ng/ml and not on any type of vitamin repletion
      therapy. The investigators will randomize the participants into one of four arms: (1) Oral
      50,000 vitamin D IU every week for 12 weeks (2) Oral 50,000 vitamin D weekly for 12 weeks
      than oral 800 vitamin D IU/d (3) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU weekly for 12 weeks then 5,000
      vitamin D IU/d (4) Oral 5,000 vitamin D IU/d and check vitamin D levels and inflammatory
      markers as part of standard of care follow- up every 3 months for nine months. Every
      participant will receive dietary counseling throughout the study duration. Our aim is to
      identify an optimal dosing strategy for repletion and maintenance of vitamin D levels in the
      subset of IBD patients. Based on clinical experience, doses higher than the recommended doses
      for bone health are needed to achieve and maintain optimal levels of Vitamin D in IBD
      patients, even patients are in remission or do not have small bowel (malabsorption)
      involvement.
