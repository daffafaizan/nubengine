      critically ill patients. Therefore, strict glycemic control with a target blood glucose level
      between 80 and 110 mg/dl is recommended. Intensive insulin therapy requires continuous
      intravenous insulin infusion according to an algorithm and frequent blood glucose
      measurements. Implementation of intensive insulin therapy increases workload for both
      physicians and especially for nurses.

      Continuous glucose measurement would facilitate blood glucose control in critically ill
      patients. Numerous studies have shown accuracy of the subcutaneous continuous glucose
      monitoring derived glucose values compared to blood glucose measurements in diabetics.
      Studies evaluating the subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring in an inpatient-population
      especially in an ICU-setting are rare. Therefore the aim of this study is the prospective
      evaluation of continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring in critically ill patients with
      circulatory shock demanding norepinephrine therapy as compared to critically ill patients
      without shock.
