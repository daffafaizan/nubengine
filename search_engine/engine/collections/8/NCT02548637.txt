      joint pain from aromatase inhibitor therapy. The investigators will serially measure
      patient's symptoms and track current medications, joint pain, daily activities, fatigue, and
      quality of life. The investigators will collect peripheral blood at baseline, weeks 4 and 7,
      one week after the last acupuncture treatment and 4 weeks after the last acupuncture
      treatment. The investigators will study the samples collected at the five predetermined
      time-points to test for immune parameters, such as the innate and adaptive immune responses,
      as well as the proliferative capabilities and pro-inflammatory mediators reflected in innate
      and adaptive functional immune responses.
