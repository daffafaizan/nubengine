      tested to treat people with NSCLC. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of brigatinib .

      The study enrolled 137 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the following treatment
      groups:

        -  Brigatinib 30 mg once daily (QD)/60 mg QD

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg QD

        -  Brigatinib 120 mg QD/60 mg twice daily (BID)

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg QD-180 mg QD

        -  Brigatinib 180 mg QD/90 mg BID

        -  Brigatinib 240 mg QD/120 mg BID/300 mg QD

      Participants will be enrolled in dose escalation study with expansion into 5 cohorts
      (histologically and molecularly defined) after an RP2D was established. All participants will
      be asked to take brigatinib, orally once daily or twice daily in each cycle of 28 days

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall expected time to participate
      in this study is approximately 4 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and 30 days after the End-of-Treatment visit. Follow-up is intended to continue for at least
      2 years after the initial dose.
