    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival rate, progression free survival rate, clinical and
           molecular remission rates, and time to treatment failure in patients with newly
           diagnosed stage III or IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with chlorambucil,
           mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone versus fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone.

        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      International Prognostic Index score [low risk (score 1) vs intermediate low risk (score 2)
      vs intermediate high risk (score 3) vs high risk (score 4 or 5)]. Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV on day 1, oral chlorambucil on days 1-10, and
           oral dexamethasone on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitoxantrone and dexamethasone as in arm I and fludarabine IV
           on days 1-3.

      Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 4-8 courses.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter until clinical relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 4 years.
