    
      The primary objective in this study is to assess the awareness, values and preferences of
      patients and physicians with respect to the risks, consequences and management of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Secondary objectives aim to assess awareness of available CKD treatments, referral tools and
      communication between patients and physicians.

      Both patients and physicians will complete a survey that consists of various questions
      regarding the knowledge of disease, values and treatments, patient-physician interaction,
      physician referral tools and disease risk management.
