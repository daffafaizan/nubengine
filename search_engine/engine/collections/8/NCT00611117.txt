      high fat diet is not abrupt and takes time. In a previous study from our laboratory, it has
      been shown that high level of physical activity can accelerate the adaptation to a high fat
      diet by increasing fat oxidation. In this study we will determine the mechanism involved in
      this adjustment. Our hypotheses are:

        1. High fat diets decrease skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and decrease mitochondrial
           biogenesis through the upregulation of PDK4 and downregulation of PGC1Î±; increased
           physical activity will prevent these deleterious effects.

        2. A high fat diet will increase hepatic and skeletal muscle lipid; increased physical
           activity will prevent these deleterious effects.

        3. These effects are more pronounced in individuals with a low mitochondrial content
