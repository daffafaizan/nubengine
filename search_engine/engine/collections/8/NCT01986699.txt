      Brook University Medical Center will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion using a computer
      generated system to undergo either partial colectomy (performed by means of laparoscopy when
      possible), or LACP for the treatment of advanced polyp(s). Our research assistant will be
      present in the operating room to record the data.Patients will then undergo standard clinical
      management while hospitalized at Stony Brook according to the procedure performed.
