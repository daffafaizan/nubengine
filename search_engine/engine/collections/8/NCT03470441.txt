    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an experimental drug
      called FDY-5301 as a possible treatment to reduce the size of the injury to the heart caused
      by the heart attack. An experimental drug is one that is being tested and is not approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      A heart attack occurs when a heart (coronary) artery supplying blood to the heart muscle
      becomes blocked and the heart muscle is injured. You will be having a cardiac catheterization
      procedure to clear the blockage in your coronary artery that caused your heart attack. This
      procedure works well but may not completely prevent some injury to the heart muscle which
      occurs when the blood supply is initially restored to the heart. This is known as
      "reperfusion injury".

      FDY-5301 is a single intravenous injection. About 80 subjects are expected to participate in
      this study at about 20 research sites in the United States and Europe. Each subject's
      participation is expected to last about 6 months after receiving the study drug.

      Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of 4 study groups.
      Three groups will receive FDY-5301 (low, intermediate, or high dose) and 1 group will receive
      a placebo.The study drug (FDY-5301 or placebo) will be given through a vein (intravenously)
      during the catheterization procedure. This is a double-blind study so neither the patient nor
      study personnel will know whether the dose is active drug or placebo until the end of the
      study.
