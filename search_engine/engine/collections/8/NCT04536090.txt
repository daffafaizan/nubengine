      (IQC-950AN) treatment on disease progression (defined as â‰¥ 6 on the World Health Organization
      (WHO) clinical progression scale) when given to subjects with confirmed COVID-19 in addition
      to standard of care. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) treatment on the reduction of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) viral titers in these subjects and their recovery. In addition, certain
      parameters which may help elucidate the mechanism of action (sLDLR, PCSK9, sACE2, D-dimers
      and CRP) will be followed. The safety of Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) will be evaluated at each
      visit. Subjects will be randomized to receive treatment for 28 days and then will return 30
      days following the discontinuation of treatment for a final safety visit.

      The results of this study will be used to design an adequately powered randomized controlled
      pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) in all or a
      subset of subjects with confirmed COVID-19.
