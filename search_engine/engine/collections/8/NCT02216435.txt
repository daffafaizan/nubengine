      slowness of movement, slowness of initiation of movement or rigidity of muscles. One method
      of easing PD symptoms is the FDA-approved method of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for patients
      who no longer get effective treatment from the best available medication. The location in the
      brain where the electrode is placed during DBS surgery for PD is called the Subthalamic
      Nucleus or STN. During placement of the DBS electrode, the patient is awake and is asked to
      do motor tasks to determine the correct placement in the STN and proper functioning of the
      DBS electrode. This study aims to investigate another location in the brain, the Substantia
      nigra pars reticulata or SNr, during the normal placement of the DBS electrode. This location
      is also known to be involved in motor control of muscles and may be involved in the process
      by which the initiation of movement occurs. The path through the brain to the STN used for
      DBS surgery goes into the SNr but currently, no testing of the SNr is performed. We will
      conduct a simple and well documented visual motor test to document the patient's stimulus
      perception and motor intention both at rest and during neural stimulation of the SNr.
