      in Parkinson's disease (PD). Urodynamic changes in PD include overactive bladder (OB),
      characterized by urgency with or without urge incontinence , usually with frequency and
      nocturia . The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the
      treatment of OB in patients with PD with the use of a specific treatment: Posterior Tibial
      Nerve Electrostimulation (PTNE). Materials and methods: This is test-clinical, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled comparison with placebo. The research will be conducted with patients
      diagnosed with PD and symptoms of OB in the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, in the
      Movement Disorders and Urogynecology Ambulatories. The patients are divided into two groups,
      one of which receives placebo stimulation (often below the therapeutic threshold). They will
      be assessed before and after 12 weeks of treatment with home PTNE through specific form of
      questionnaires assessing incontinence, quality of life and voiding diary. After the end of
      treatment will be made up of patients to verify the effectiveness of treatment in 30 to 90
      days. Hypothesis: Through this research the investigators hope to determine the true efficacy
      of this treatment method with PTNE in OB in PD with a high level of evidence, seeking to
      improve urinary symptoms and quality of life in this patient population.
