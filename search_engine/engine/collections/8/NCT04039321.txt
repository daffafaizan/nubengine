      narcotic analgesics are often used to pain management. However, the use of narcotic
      analgesics in the postoperative period causes many undesirable adverse effects, especially
      sedation, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, muscle rigidity, tolerance, and
      respiratory depression.

      The morbidly obese patients treated with narcotic analgesics increased risk for adverse
      effects such as atelectasis, hypoxemia, and postoperative ileus. Consequently, these are
      caused postoperative pulmonary complications, hypoxemia and longer lenght of hospital stay.
      Multimodal analgesia including local and regional anesthesia is recommended for morbidly
      obese patients.

      In recent years, the ultrasound (USG) guided ESP block has been frequently used to eliminate
      postoperative pain and reduce narcotic analgesic use. In the literature, it has been shown
      that bilateral USG guided ESP block provides effective analgesia and decrease the analgesia
      requirements after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Some case series and case reports has also
      been reported that ESP block provides effective analgesia after abdominal and bariatric
      surgeries.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of erector spina plane (ESP) block on
      pulmonary functions and postoperative analgesic consumption in patients undergoing bariatric
      surgery. For this purpose, ASA II-III, patients over 18 years of age, BMI 40-60 kg/m2 and
      elective bariatric surgery planned patients will be included in the study.
