      cognitive domains mostly affected by AD. This training will be performed for three months
      (each day for 20 minutes). After three months the intervention group will continue the
      training at home for six months and meet monthly for group sessions (i.e. booster sessions)
      on site.

      Primary endpoint will be the change in an "AD-specific" component score, quantified by
      episodic memory, semantic memory and visuospatial abilities. Secondary endpoints are changes
      in task related brain networks and changes in resting state networks.
