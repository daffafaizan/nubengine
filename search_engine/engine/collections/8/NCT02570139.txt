      formulated to protect damaged and denuded skin even in the presence of exposure to the most
      potentially damaging body fluids, such as liquid stool and gastric fluid. The product is
      expected to intimately adhere to damaged and denuded skin and provide better protection from
      further damage than commonly used products such as moisture barrier pastes, thereby making it
      easier for nursing staff to cleanse the skin after incontinence episodes, thus saving time
      and also materials.

      The denuded sites on buttocks/thighs will be scored for skin loss and degree of redness. Over
      the course of time, with the skin protected, it should re-epithelizes. The skin improvement
      will be scored and the change in baseline over time monitored.
