    
      A longitudinal descriptive, exploratory cohort study will be performed including females
      during pregnancy, puerperium and their newborns until sixth months of life.

      Women will be invited after the first pregnancy trimester from the federal state of Berlin
      (Germany) during their visits to gynecologists and/or midwives. Inclusion and all study
      visits and measurement procedures will be conducted at the Clinical Research Center for Hair
      and Skin Science at the Department of Dermatology at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin
      (Germany). If meeting the eligibility criteria women will be included into the study. After
      inclusion into the study during the baseline visit, women will be followed at date of
      delivery + four weeks and followed further at the sixth month after delivery. The
      newborn/infants will be examined up to four weeks after birth and will be followed at sixth
      month after birth.

      Due to the descriptive and exploratory nature of this study a broad range of characteristics
      and variables will be measured. Main aspects are skin structure, skin function and skin
      microbiome in one skin area. Skin structure will be measured by means of skin surface
      topography, epidermal thickness, skin stiffness and elasticity. Skin function will be
      measured by means of stratum corneum hydratation (SCH), TEWL and skin surface pH, which are
      established parameters to characterize the skin barrier function. Skin microbiome is defined
      as bacterial diversity, in detail the relative abundance of phylotypes, operational taxonomic
      units (OTU) will be measured. Hair growth will be measured on central and occipital scalp by
      means of hair density, hair widths.
