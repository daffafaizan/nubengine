compliance and resistance in the conditioning of autistic children:an exploratory study.twelve autistic children between 4 and 9 yrof age were asked to choose red objectsand square objects from a stimulus array.ten subjects made correct choicessignificantly less often than chance, that is,they avoided emitting correct responses.the subjects were given 60 conditioningtrials in which choices of either red orsquare objects were reinforced.  those whoattained either concept subsequentlyperformed perfectly when asked to produceboth red and square concepts; the othersubjects continued giving fewer-than-chancecorrect responses.  thus, conditioningtrials elicited in some subjects an increasedtendency to comply with the experimenter'sinstructions.  the results suggestthat more attention should be paid tothe distinction between responses thatautistic children are unable to make andresponses that they are unwilling to make.
