    
      -  Patients will be randomized into one of two study groups. Group 1 will receive letrozole
           and Group 2 will receive placebo. This is a double-blind trial so neither the patient or
           the doctor will know what treatment group they are assigned to.

        -  If the patient is in Group 1 they will take letrozole tablets orally once a day with
           food for one year. Patients in Group 2 will take a placebo tablet orally once a day with
           food for one year.

        -  Patients in both groups will also be given calcium tablets (500mg) and vitamin D tablets
           (400IU) once a day for one year.

        -  After the initial screening visits, the patient will return to the clinic at 3, 6, 9 and
           12 months (a total of up to 6 visits in the first year). There will also be two
           follow-up visits at 18 and 24 months. For the 3, 9 and 18 month visits, telephone
           contact instead of a clinic visit is allowed.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed during these visits:

      evaluation of side effects; routine blood tests(6, 12, and 24 month visits); urine sample (6
      and 12 month visits); complete physical exam including breast exam (12 and 24 month visits);
      mammogram (12 and 24 month visits); bone marrow density x-ray test (12 and 24 month visits);
      standard x-rays of the lower back and chest (12 month visit); and a questionnaire about how
      the patient is feeling (12 and 24 month visits).

        -  The length of participation in this study is for 1 year of study treatment followed by 1
           year of follow-up.
