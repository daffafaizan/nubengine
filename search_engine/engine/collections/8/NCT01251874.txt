    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of veliparib along with carboplatin on a 14-day
      and 21-day schedule in patients with Her2 negative metastatic breast cancer that are estrogen
      receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor(PR) negative or ER and/or PR positive with defects in
      Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway repair genes.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of combining veliparib on a 14-day and 21-day
      schedule with carboplatin in this patient population.

      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of this combination in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic endpoints of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      inhibition in the tumor by using, A) 3'-[F-18]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine positron emission
      tomography (FLT-PET) of the target lesions, B) circulating tumor cells to detect the
      induction of the histone variant gamma H2AX, and C) peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
      assess poly ADP-Ribose (PAR) levels.

      II. To determine biomarkers in the primary tumor that may predict antitumor responses to PARP
      inhibition such as breast cancer 1/2, early onset (BRCA)1/2 protein, Fanconi anemia,
      complementation group D2 (FANCD2) nuclear foci formation and expression of micro-ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) 155 (miR 155).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and veliparib orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 or 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.
