      VS and meningiomas by AR-42 in adult patients undergoing NF2-tumor resection. AR-42 will be
      administered three times per week beginning 3 weeks prior to surgery. A total of ten doses,
      +/- 1 dose at 40 mg/dose, will be self-administered orally by study participants at
      approximately the same time every day (+/- 1 hour, preferably in the evening) 3 times per
      week for 3 weeks pre-operatively, with the last dose taken the night before surgery. Patients
      will be evaluated within the context of their standard post-operative follow up which
      includes within 2 days of surgery and again at 2 weeks (+/- 10 days) after surgery. Samples
      will be shipped to the participating laboratories (OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC)
      Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource (PhASR) and Nationwide Children's Research Institute) for
      assessment of intratumoral drug concentration and assessment of intratumoral disease markers.
      During surgery, four blood samples will also be obtained and sent to the cooperating
      laboratory (PhASR) for determination of drug concentration and molecular analysis.
