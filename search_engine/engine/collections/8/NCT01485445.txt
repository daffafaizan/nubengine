    
      Fluticasone furoate (FF; GW685698), a novel corticosteroid, is being developed both as a
      monotherapy for the treatment of asthma and in combination with vilanterol (VI; GW642444) for
      the treatment of asthma and COPD. The novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) will be used to deliver
      both FF monotherapy and the FF/VI combination. The NDPI can be used with either a single
      strip or two strips, the single strip being used for FF monotherapy and two strips being used
      to deliver the FF/VI combination. In some previous FF monotherapy studies, including the
      phase IIB programme, conducted using the NDPI, the inhaler contained two strips (FF in the
      first strip and matched VI placebo in the second strip). This two strip configuration has
      been used for the majority of FF monotherapy treatment arms in previous and ongoing studies.
      The aim of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of FF monotherapy (single strip)
      compared with FF monotherapy (two strip), and to determine the bioequivalence of FF
      monotherapy (single strip) compared with FF/VI, administered via the NDPI. This data will
      facilitate the inclusion of FF monotherapy (two strip) data and FF/VI combination data to
      support the FF monotherapy product development. This will be a randomised, open-label,
      replicate, six-way crossover, single dose study in healthy male and female subjects. Thirty
      healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled in this study to ensure twenty-four
      evaluable subjects.

      Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken over 36 hours. Safety will be assessed by adverse event
      (AE) monitoring throughout the study.
