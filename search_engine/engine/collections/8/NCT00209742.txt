      (Japanese Classification of Colorectal Cancer, English edition), also according to pTNM

      UFT+LV+PSK (5 courses) / UFT+PSK (1 year). The usefulness of the three regimens as
      postoperative adjuvant therapy was evaluated by comparing the disease-free survival rate
      (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event, and quality of
      life (QOL).
