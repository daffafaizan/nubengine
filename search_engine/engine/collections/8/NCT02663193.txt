    
      This is a multicenter (more than one study site), open-label (all people know the identity of
      the intervention), prospective, observational study to characterize the tolerability profile
      of treatment and quality of life (QoL) in participants receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone
      acetate (with prednisone) in a clinical practice setting. Approximately 100 male participants
      will be enrolled into this study, 50 participants will be recruited to each treatment arm.
      Participants will complete 2 scheduled on-site visits (Baseline and Month 2). Participants
      will primarily be observed for tolerability profiles of enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate
      (with prednisone) and safety over an observational period of 2 months.
