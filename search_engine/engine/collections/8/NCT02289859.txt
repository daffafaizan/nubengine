      improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure without undermining. Our aims are to compare
      outcomes using a split wound model, where half the wound is undermined and the other half is
      not. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar
      instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wound undermining will result in
      cosmetically superior wound outcomes.
