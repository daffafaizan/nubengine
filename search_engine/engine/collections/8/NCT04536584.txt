    
      A multicentric, phase III, randomized open-labelled study with two parallel groups which
      evaluates the benefits of a personalized remote exercise and physical activity coaching
      compared with the standard supportive approach in terms of health-related quality of life at
      12 months in breast cancer survivors treated in an adjuvant setting.

      Other objectives include:

        -  To evaluate the impact of the intervention on each dimension of the SF-36 at 12 months

        -  To evaluate the impact of the program on the health-related quality of life over time

        -  To evaluate the impact of the program on the practice of exercise and physical activity
           (EPA) at the recommended intensity (30min of moderate EPA, 5 days/week)

        -  To evaluate the impact of the program on:

           o fatigue, pain, depression, sleep, motivation for the practice, self-respect, biometric
           measures (including fat mass and lean mass), physical capacities, patient's satisfaction
           regarding the assigned program, occurrence of Adverse Events (AE) related to the
           treatment, professional life for patients who worked before the announcement of getting
           cancer and psychotropic and analgesic drug intake

        -  To evaluate the compliance to the program through the engagement score during the first
           4 months (in the experimental group).

        -  To evaluate the impact of the program in terms of disease-free survival

      Additional objectives on health economics include:

        -  To evaluate the efficiency of the personalized remote exercise and physical activity
           coaching compared with the standard supportive approach in BC survivors treated in an
           adjuvant setting.

        -  To characterize the health-state utility of BC survivors over time; assessing the
           association of change in health-utility with changes in other variables such as exercise
           and physical activity.
