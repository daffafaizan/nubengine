      that measures at least 89 centimeters for women, and 102 centimeters for men), high blood
      pressure (130/85 mm Hg or higher), dislipidemia (triglyceride level 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or
      higher of this type of fat found in blood; reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
      less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L) in men, or less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women of HDL
      cholesterol), elevated fasting blood sugar (100 mg/dL (5,6 mmol/L) or higher). All patients
      were random separated into two groups: trial (30 pers., who will undergo 15 procedures of the
      IHHT, 5 days a week for 3 weeks), and control (30 pers., who will undergo 15 placebo
      procedures simulating IHHT, 5 days a week for 3 weeks). Before and after procedures of IHHT
      all patients will undergo laboratory and instrumental examinations, wich include arterial
      stiffness measurement, making by Fukuda Denshi VS-100 VaSera, measurement of liver tissue
      elasticity and fibrosis, making by elastography on FibroScan (Echosense, XL-sensor), and
      laboratory analysis (lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, trimethylamin N-oxyde (TMAO),
      Toll-like receptors 4,7,9). After 6 month of IHHT all patients will undergo the same
      laboratory and instrumental examinations to assess the duration of the effect.
