      Participants will be randomized to the intervention group to receive a Resilience Curriculum
      or to a wait-list control group to receive a condensed version of the curriculum following
      the post-intervention assessments.

      Pre- and post-intervention assessments will be administered to both groups, with baseline
      assessments administered in the first two weeks of the semester. The assessments will include
      measures of stress levels, levels of resilience, coping flexibility, optimism, positive and
      negative emotions, social support, and symptoms of illness. The intervention, the
      presentation of a resilience curriculum, will be delivered to the intervention group during
      the week following the baseline assessments and it will last for four weeks.

      The resilience curriculum will provide education for participants about methods to increase
      protective factors against stress, the use of effective coping strategies, and the importance
      of accessing social support, with the goal of better managing stress and enhancing
      resilience. The intervention will include a didactic component, skills-building training, and
      homework exercises to encourage the application of the skills. The curriculum will be
      delivered in four 2-hour modules, with one module delivered each week. The follow-up
      assessments will occur after midterm examinations are concluded. An abbreviated curriculum
      which will last approximately two hours will be delivered to the wait-list control group.
