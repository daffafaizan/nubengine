      syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading rapidly across Europe. While data from
      European centers are still missing, several publications from Chinese centers are available.
      Respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of
      mortality, and may be caused or exacerbated by a 'cytokine storm syndrome'.

      Recent trials from our group demonstrated that the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane
      administered during ventilation of patients has anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, in in
      vivo studies volatile anesthetics reduce the severity of ARDS compared to intravenous
      sedation, which has been confirmed in a clinical pilot trial. Attenuating ARDS and thereby
      improving oxygenation strongly decreases morbidity and mortality of patients.
