      beneficial effects on word-retrieval in healthy younger and older subjects. The present study
      aims to extend these findings by assessing whether atDCS can also improve known impairments
      of word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment. atDCS will be applied to the left inferior
      frontal gyrus in a sham controlled cross-over within subjects design. Simultaneous functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will assess underlying neural effects of the stimulation.
