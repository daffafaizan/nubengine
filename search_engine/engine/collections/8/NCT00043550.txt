    
      MDD is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Different forms of psychotherapy for
      depression have been found effective. This study compares a form of dynamic psychotherapy
      called supportive-expressive psychotherapy to medication and to placebo.

      Participants are evaluated on 2 occasions, 1 week apart, before they are randomly assigned to
      receive either supportive-expressive psychotherapy, sertraline (Zoloft) (followed by
      venlafaxine [Effexor] if patients do not respond to sertraline), or placebo. The active phase
      of treatment lasts 4 months. The frequency of patients' visits depends on the assigned
      treatment.

      Patients who are randomized to receive medication or placebo are initially seen on a weekly
      basis, then less often, depending on the rate of symptomatic improvement. Patients who are
      randomized to psychotherapy are seen twice a week for the first 4 weeks, then once a week for
      the remaining 12 weeks. Outcome is monitored at week 2,4,6,7,8, 12, 15 and 16. At the end of
      the first 16 weeks of treatment, patients are thoroughly evaluated. Those who have responded
      to treatment are assigned to a continuation phase and are seen once a month for another 16
      weeks. At the end of the 16-week continuation phase, patients are again evaluated and all
      treatments are stopped. Follow-up continues every 3 months for up to 2 years to ensure that
      the patients' depression remains under control.
