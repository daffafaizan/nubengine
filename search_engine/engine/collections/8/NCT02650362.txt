      will be obtained at baseline, prior to trial implantation of SCS.

      Normal trial period will be respected based on the reimbursement rules in Belgium (4 weeks).
      When the patient is eligible for implantation of the definitive SCS system (more than 50%
      pain reduction and/or more than 50% reduction in pain medication), patient will undergo
      surgery for definitive implantation.

      After stabilisation of the stimulation parameters at least for more than 1 month, the second
      session of neuroimaging will occur (T1). Minimal one month later (2 months after implantation
      of definitive SCS system) the patient will undergo the last session of neuroimaging (T2). The
      MRI protocol will occur after stabilisation of the stimulation parameters at least for more
      than 1 month. During the whole period, patients will fill in a VAS diary and at time of
      neuroimaging T1 and T2 a Likert-scale in order to evaluate the satisfaction grade of the
      patient. Additionally, patients will also wear 1 month before neuroimaging an Actiwatch,
      measuring sleep patterns and filling in questionnaires at baseline, T1 and T2 (Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
