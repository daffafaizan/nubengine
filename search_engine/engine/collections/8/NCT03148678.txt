      technologies using a combination of smartphone-based assessment and micro-interventions, fMRI
      and real-time fMRI-neurofeedback. More specifically, we aim to i) evaluate whether
      smartphone-based micro-interventions affect mindfulness, stress, and mood, ii) evaluate
      whether mindfulness, its neural substrate, and related mental and physiological functions can
      be modified by training volitional control over brain activity by means of real-time
      functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (RT-fMRI-NF), iii) differentiate neural
      activation patterns during mindfulness vs. mind wandering.
