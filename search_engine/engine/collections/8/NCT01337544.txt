      solid tumours. The aim of this study is explore the graft versus tumour effect mediated by
      allogenic natural killer cells (NKs). NK cell alloreactivity can be predicted by donor killer
      immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles
      mismatch. Cells without an inhibitory HLA ligand may trigger natural killer cell activation
      and elimination of those target cells. Reduced risk of relapsed has been described in
      malignant cancer after haploidentical stem cell transplantation when HLA ligands against the
      inhibitory KIRs present in the donor were absent in the recipient (KIR-HLA receptor-ligand
      mismatch). NK alloreactivity could also be obtained by Natural Killer Receptor (NCR),
      Toll-Like-Receptors (TLRs) and NKG2D receptor stimulation mediated by cytokines or tumour
      cell lines.
