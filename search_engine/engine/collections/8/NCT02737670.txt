      from our Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) clinic. After verification of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, patients consenting to enter the study are assigned randomly to one of the
      following groups: 1- Sulodexide 25 mg for 40 days 2- Placebo for 40 days. Clinical evaluation
      of the patient is performed; tinnitus is assessed according to Tinnitus Handicap Inventory
      score, Mini Tinnitus Questionnaire score. Adverse effects are also noted. Patients are
      followed at 40 days post-treatment and outcome measures are assessed.
