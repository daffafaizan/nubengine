      comparison phase 1 trial in Germany.

      The trial consists of a screening phase, an induction phase, a rest phase, and a challenge
      phase. There will be 2 columns of test fields on each participant's back with the 3
      treatments in either column for a total of 6 treatments. One column of test fields will be
      irradiated and the other will not be irradiated. All participants will be exposed to UV-light
      on skin treated delgocitinib cream or vehicle and on untreated skin on test fields to be
      irradiated.
