      the majority of hematologic malignancies. B-cell lymphomas represent the largest percentage
      of these neoplasms, and the relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphomas have proven very
      difficult to treat. Success rate, defined as complete or partial response, is as low as 2% to
      4% in many of these diseases, and they remain an area of a significant unmet medical need.
      Patients that have failed BTKi, including WM patients, represent a very challenging patient
      population with significantly reduced life-expectancy.

      CLR 131 is a targeted radiotherapeutic that exploits the selective uptake and retention of
      Cellectar's proprietary phospholipid ethers (PLEs) by malignant cells. Cellectar Biosciences'
      novel cancer-targeted small-molecule compound is radiolabeled with the radioisotope
      iodine-131 (I-131) which has previously been used approved for use in select tumors. CLR 131
      has been evaluated in over 80 xenograft and spontaneous (transgenic) tumor models where it
      was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating tumors.

      Based on the critical unmet medical need for effective agents with novel mechanisms of action
      in B-cell malignancies, Cellectar Biosciences has chosen to expand this ongoing study to
      assess CLR 131 in a pivotal expansion cohort in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia patients that
      have failed BTKi treatment.
