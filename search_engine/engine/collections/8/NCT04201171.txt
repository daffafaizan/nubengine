    
      In Norway, all children with diabetes 0-18 years should, due to a recommendation from the
      national health care authority, receive their diabetes follow-up in a pediatric department.
      All pediatric departments participate in the NCDR reporting standardized clinical data on
      their patients to the NCDR, at diabetes onset and annually, until the patients reach 18 years
      of age. The data completeness of NCDR is high, on individual level 99 % at diabetes onset,
      and 98 % on the annual examinations in 2016 - 2017
