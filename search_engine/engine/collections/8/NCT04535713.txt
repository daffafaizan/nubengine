    
      This is an open label phase 2 study for advanced sarcoma using metronomic doses of
      gemcitabine, doxorubicin and docetaxel, and nivolumab immunotherapy given intravenously.

      A total of 260 patients will receive gemcitabine 600 mg/m2 (maximum dose: 1000 mg) on D1 and
      D8, doxorubicin 18 mg/m2 on D1 and D8 (maximum dose: 32 mg), docetaxel 25 mg/m2 on D1 and D8
      (maximum dose: 42 mg), on Days 1 and 8. After the first cycle, nivolumab 240 mg IV will be
      added on Day 1 of each cycle (see product information; www.accessdata.fda.gov). Treatment
      cycles are given every 3 weeks. Patients in this study may continue treatment until
      significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs up to one year of therapy.
