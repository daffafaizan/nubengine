      will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with oral doses of either CF102 25 mg
      or matching placebo administered twice daily (BID) for consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects
      will be evaluated regularly for safety. Tumor imaging will be performed every 8 weeks.
      Treatment will continue until the subject experiences unacceptable drug-related
      intolerability. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the
      last dose of study drug, and every attempt will be made to obtain survival data on all
      randomized subjects. Subjects who discontinue will be followed indefinitely for survival
      status. The trial will continue until 75 deaths have been recorded.
