    
      This study is designed to obtain and store samples of serum and liver tissue in HCV-infected
      patients being treated with DAA therapy.

      A liver biopsy will be performed pre-treatment for research reasons. A small liver sample
      that is not required for pathologic analysis will also be stored. Patients will undergo
      another liver biopsy at either 4 or 12 weeks after initiation of DAA therapy.

      Any patients with HCV-related liver disease (age > 18) will be considered for this study.

      Patients will have a 120 ml blood draw for research purposes at baseline and 12 weeks after
      stopping DAA treatment along with a 60 ml blood draw at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.

      The liver biopsy at baseline and then either at 4 or 12 weeks will be examined using
      molecular techniques to measure transcription of key genes involved in the antiviral
      response.
