      personal communications.

      A randomized, cross-over design experiment with three treatments will be carried out. Three
      different beverages will be prepared:- No carbonation (NC): Potable water + sugar- Low
      carbonation (LC): Potable water + sugar + little CO2- High carbonation (HC): Potable water +
      sugar+ high CO2.

      The outcome measures assessed will be glycemic response, gastric emptying and satiety.
      Glycemic response will be measured by taking capillary blood samples (<5ul) by fingerpricking
      with one-time use sterilized lancets. Gastric emptying will be assessed by ultrasonography
      methodology developed by Okabe et al, 2015. Satiety will be measured using electronic visual
      analogue scales assessing hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective consumption and
      thirst. In addition, participants will be asked to rate the level of effervescence of
      beverage, sweetness of beverage, amount of beverage consumed, as well as how pleasant the
      beverage was immediately after drinking of test beverage. Feelings of bloatedness will be
      assessed using electronic visual analogue scales administered at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,120
      min from drinking of test beverage. At the end of the test session, ad libitum lunch will be
      served, and the amount of food and drinks consumed will be measured (by weight difference
      before and after serving).
