      cells called histiocytes. Many histiocytic disorders (LCH, juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG),
      Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD)) arises from blood cells that
      receive incorrect growth signals. These incorrect signals are caused by changes in genes
      (mutations) that lead to tissue damage (lesions) which causes disease. Some patients with LCH
      can develop neurodegeneration (LCH-ND) which is damage to neurons that results in reduced
      brain function, from LCH cells that go to the brain and activate inflammation. LCH arises
      from blood cells that receive incorrect growth signals. These incorrect signals are caused by
      mutations (changes in genes). The LCH blood cells can create changes in the structure of
      almost any organ, and can cause damage to normal organ function.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether cobimetinib is safe and effective in
      subjects diagnosed with LCH, LCH-ND, RDD, JXG and ECD which may have a specfic mutation
      called BRAF-V600E. In healthy cells, certain proteins (called BRAF and MEK) are thought to
      help control normal cell growth. BRAF-V600E is a specific change in a gene that may cause
      cancer cells to grow and spread by sending constant signals to the MEK protein. Cobimetinib
      is designed to attach to and block the activity of MEK.
