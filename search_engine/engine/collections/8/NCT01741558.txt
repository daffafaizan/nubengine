      anti-inflammatory action of methotrexate by increasing adenosine. Experimental studies
      demonstrate reduction of infarct induced in animals treated with methotrexate. We expect a
      reduction in the area under the curve of creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB fraction
      (CK-MB) and Troponin I high sensitive, decreased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
      and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction.
