    
      Patients, all planned for nephrectomy, will be stratified according to the Heng risk criteria
      (high risk patients vs. intermediate risk patients) and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
      Intuvax+ Sunitinib or Sunitinib alone.

      Two doses of Intuvax will be administered in to the primary tumour before nephrectomy. The
      control group will be scheduled for nephrectomy directly.

      All patients will start Sunitinib treatment 5-8 weeks after operation.

      Results from the phase I study, together with the results reported in the literature on the
      use of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) in combination with Sunitinib encourage Immunicum AB
      to further investigate the possibility of exploiting Intuvax vaccination when combined with
      Sunitinib for the treatment of mRCC patients.
