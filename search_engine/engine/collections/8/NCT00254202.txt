      Patients with schizophrenia suffer from productive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and
      delusions), and deficit symptoms (e.g., a reduction or absence of normal behaviors or
      emotions). Other symptoms include a reduced ability to recall and learn new information.

      Iloperidone is being development as a treatment for symptoms of schizophrenia. This trial
      will test the safety and efficacy of iloperidone in patients with an acute exacerbation of
      the disease.
