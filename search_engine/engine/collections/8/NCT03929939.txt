      of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), and Texas Health Resources. VANTHCS researchers
      will be responsible for recruitment of women veterans with PTSD and psychological
      assessments. UTSW/Texas Health Resources researchers will be responsible for recruitment of
      non-veteran women without a diagnosis of PTSD, physiological assessments, and the lifestyle
      modification intervention.
