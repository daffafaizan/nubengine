      transient but when delirium persists, it can impact cognitive function, morbidity and
      mortality. Currently, there are no drugs to prevent delirium but dexmedetomidine has the
      potential to meet this unmet medical need.

      Dexmedetomidine is currently approved for use for 24 hours in patients on ventilators in the
      Intensive Care Unit(ICU). This study is to determine whether or not dexmedetomidine can
      prevent delirium after heart surgery. Study participation will last from randomization prior
      to surgery, to 3 days after surgery. Dexmedetomidine will be given through an intravenous
      catheter beginning at sternal closure and continue throughout the stay in the ICU. Delirium
      will be assessed prior to surgery and for 72 hours after surgery. This assessment will
      consist of questions that will evaluate memory and thought process. Thirty days after
      surgery, questions will be asked regarding the patients feelings about their health status
      and hospital billing information will be collected.
