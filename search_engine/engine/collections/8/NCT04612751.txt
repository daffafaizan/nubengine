    
      The primary objective of this study will assess the safety and tolerability of datopotamab
      deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with durvalumab with or without 4 cycles of platinum
      chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have either been
      previously treated or are treatment na√Øve in a metastatic setting.

      Two dose levels of Dato-DXd (4.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg) will be studied in combination with
      1120 mg fixed dose of durvalumab, with or without 4 cycles of platinum chemotherapy in 6
      study cohorts. This study will be conducted sequentially and dose escalation will occur
      according to lower dose to higher dose in the same combination regimen (4.0 mg/kg to 6.0
      mg/kg) and from 2-drug combination (Dato-DXd and durvalumab) to 3-drug combination regimen
      (Dato-DXd, durvalumab, and carboplatin or cisplatin).
