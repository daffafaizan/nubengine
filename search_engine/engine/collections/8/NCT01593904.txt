      The 3D structural information provided by the protocol combined with the ability to observe
      and quantify flow through the major vessels of the neck, as well as the azygous vein, make it
      an ideal method for evaluating subjects' venous outflow. The protocol also has the potential
      to confirm the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, observe any changes in the parenchyma, as
      well as provide data on any potential co-morbidity which may have been previously overlooked
      or non-emergent. The baseline scan data acquired on normal and pre-treatment MS patients can
      be tracked longitudinally for MSpatients for changes in: arterial and venous cross sectional
      area; morphological changes of vessels, brain structures, and lesions; flow distribution and
      flow patterns in arteries, veins, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); iron quantification in the
      deep basal ganglia and thalamus; parenchymal lesion volume and morphology; atrophy or ratio
      of gray matter, white matter; and CSF in the intracranial space; and appearance of
      intracranial veins and potential iron lesions in the parenchyma. A major benefit is that MRI
      is independent of operator bias and acquisition can be easily reproduced.
