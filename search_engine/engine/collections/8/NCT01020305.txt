      "hormone-refractory" prostate cancer. While numerous therapies impact biochemical response in
      the setting of CRPC, there remains unmet medical need. New therapies that extend survival of
      patients beyond that provided by chemotherapy are needed.

      The mechanisms of tumor progression to castration-resistance are unclear, but preclinical
      studies suggest that functional loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and subsequent
      up-regulation of Akt, which is upstream of mTOR, may be involved in prostate cancer
      progression and metastasis. Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that mTOR
      inhibitor temsirolimus may prolong hormone sensitivity and delay disease progression in
      castration-resistant prostate cancer patients before antiandrogen withdrawal.

      This study will assess efficacy on the basis of serum levels of PSA, an established surrogate
      endpoint for efficacy in prostate cancer.
