      Early follow-up visits after discharge. Comparison: Usual care follow-up. Outcomes: The
      primary outcome is readmission within 30 days after discharge. Secondary outcomes are:
      mortality 30 days after discharge and 90 days after admission, length of stay (LOS), direct
      discharge from the Emergency Department, time at home before readmission, duration of
      readmission and physical functional status 30 days after discharge.

      Methods The first study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using two
      different degrees of intervention. The second study is a cohort study of an unexposed control
      group. The third study is sub-group analyses of the RCT data according to frailty status and
      type of dwelling.

      A focus group comprised of included patients and relatives will be set to identify additional
      patient related outcome measures (PROMs) and to participate in an advisory group throughout
      the remaining project.
