      diastasis in post-partum women. The lack of evidence may, to a great extent, be explained by
      the lack of uniform criteria for assessing the trunk function and how the trunk function
      affects the ability to perform daily activities. To be able to evaluate the condition with
      symptomatic ARD a more comprehensive, multimodal instrument is therefore needed.

      In collaboration with the surgical clinic and the physiotherapy clinic at SÃ¶dersjukhuset a
      multimodal examination test was developed with the purpose to be able to evaluate the full
      picture of the condition.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of surgical reconstruction of
      post-partum abdominal rectus muscle diastasis in women with insufficient improvement after
      adequate physical training using a novel multimodal evaluation tool.
