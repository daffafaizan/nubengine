      during pregnancy.

      Many scoring systems, like Lipsitz scoring system, are used to diagnose and manage neonatal
      abstinence syndrome but they are subjective. The majority of items in these scores are motor
      skills items.

      Actigraphy allows to measure objectively the newborn motricity. We will analyse the
      correlation between actigraphy and Lipsitz scoring system in four groups of newborns.
