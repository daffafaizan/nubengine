    
      Objective: to investigate the problem of incomplete myocardial revascularization in
      percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with acute coronary syndrome without St
      segment elevation who were admitted to the angiographic Department of the Sergiev Posad city
      hospital in the Moscow region.

      The study will include all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the regional
      hospital and sent to the angiographic Department for diagnosis and performance of PCI with
      acute coronary syndrome NSTEMI, including myocardial infarction (mi) and unstable angina,
      determined by clinical data, ECG signs and laboratory indicators. Anamnestic, clinical,
      biochemical indicators, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbid index that determines the
      course of acute coronary syndrome and prognosis (grace), a number of angiographic data,
      including the number of affected arteries and variants of the index "syntax score 50" and
      modified "syntax score 30", "syntax score 70" and" syntax score 90" to separate complete and
      incomplete revascularization, an integral indicator of the quality of the remaining index
      Syntex, the absolute value of which is corrected during data analysis. The data of patients
      living in the city of Sergiev Posad will be reviewed in such a way as to minimize the
      subsequent year of follow-up, using a telephone survey and the EMIAS electronic system
