      unique to our collaborative efforts, the investigators identified clinically relevant
      phenotypes of asthma. The phenotypes are defined by biomarkers specific to underlying
      biochemical mechanistic abnormalities, including eosinophil-mediated oxidation, depletion of
      antioxidants and protective airway S-nitrosothiols, and airway acidification. Here,the
      investigators propose to study a new component that is informative for longitudinal
      assessment of severe asthma phenotypes: gender effects. The investigators reason that
      identification of the metabolic mechanism(s) underlying onset of severe asthma in young women
      during adolescence, and resolution of severe asthma in boys, will reveal fundamental
      pathophysiology of severe asthma. Importantly, we aim to develop clinical testing procedures
      to accurately assign metabolic asthma phenotypes; and to follow patients in each phenotype to
      uncover clinical longitudinal outcomes. At the conclusion of the project, we anticipate that
      we will have 1) developed clinically relevant tests to identify severe asthma phenotypes; 2)
      determined the longitudinal outcome of the phenotypes; and 3) identified the mechanisms
      underlying the preponderance of women in the severe asthma population. This application will
      focus on the development or clinically relevant metabolic tests to identify subphenotypes of
      adults and children with severe asthma and will lead to new targeted innovative treatments.
