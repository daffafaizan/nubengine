      diagnosing and staging lung cancers, diagnosing interstitial lung diseases, and acute and/or
      chronic rejections following lung transplantation. Confocal fluorescence microscopy is a
      novel technique used for in vivo microscopic imaging of proximal and distal airways including
      bronchial and alveolar walls, microvessels, and inflammatory cells. We hypothesize that
      confocal fluorescence microscopy images of bronchiolar and alveolar structures during
      standard bronchoscopy could help recognize and classify the presence or absence of acute or
      chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients.

      The objectives and outcomes of this study are:

        1. To assess the safety of confocal microscopy imaging in pediatric patients

        2. To create diagnostic criteria for fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy image
           interpretation of acute and chronic rejections following lung transplantation

        3. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of confocal imaging in these patient groups
           compared to the transbronchial biopsies

        4. Correlate confocal images to FEV1 results

        5. Correlate with CXRs and/or CT images
