      University (Xi'an, China) between March 2020 and March 2022 were recruited to investigate the
      RBP4 profles. Peripheral blood samples are drawn at the initial medical examination, in the
      morning after a fast of at least 8 h, and immediately stored at -80ËšC until the sphingolipid
      measurements were performed.

      Blood pressure, WC, hip circumference (HC), body weight and body height were measured by a
      trained physician. The participants enrolled in the study provided written informed consent.
