    
      HAR is a repriming technique based in Retrograde Autologous Priming (RAP), that has been
      implemented by recently recommended measures in terms of reducing blood transfusions.

      The expected clinical benefits are related to hemodilution´s reduction up to only 300ml. The
      extracorporeal circuit has been reduced to 3/8 inch diameter in both lines, reducing the
      surface up to 1000ml of dynamic priming.

      Vacuum assisted venous drainage (VAVD) allows to empty the venous line after priming and
      deairing, facilitating the venous flow for CPB initiation.

      The antegrade repriming eliminates the maximum amount of crystalloid contained in the
      circuit, displacing it to a collector bag, by using autologous blood sequestered from the
      arterial line to the hardshell reservoir.

      HAR reduces the CPB hemodilution related to priming from 1500 to 300 ml preventing the usual
      sudden haemoglobin level reduction occured during every extracorporeal techinque´s
      establishment.

      Our mission is to analyze if HAR can be validated as a safe and effective tool to improve
      clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery procedures under extracorporeal circulation
