      decided upon at the multidisciplinary consultation meeting. During the radiotherapy
      consultation, the study will be offered to the patient if they also meet the other inclusion
      criteria. As soon as the consent is signed and before the first radiotherapy session, a first
      biological check-up including a blood count and renal function will be performed. This
      biological investigation will serve as a reference.

      During the dosimetric computer-tomography scan for radiotherapy, bony structures will be
      delineated, iliac bones, lower pelvis, femoral heads, lumbosacral spine and entire pelvis.

      Dosimetry will be performed in the same way whether patients are included in the study or
      not, they will receive between 25Gy in 5 fractions and 78Gy in 39 fractions, depending on the
      primary tumor. The dose volume histograms will be received.

      During treatment, patients will have a weekly blood test starting from the second week of
      treatment. At one months and three months after the end of the radiotherapy, patients will be
      seen in consultation and will also have a blood test.
