    
      This is a randomized, crossover study that includes 1 screening visit and four meal challenge
      test visits, separated by a 1-2-weeks washout period. The screening will include 2000 people,
      males and females, to evaluate the genotype frequencies in studied population, and to find
      carriers of the rare genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), who will fulfill all the
      other inclusion criteria. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be completed at
      screening visit. Moreover, the fasting blood samples will be collected for genetic analysis,
      and measurements of blood glucose and lipid metabolism profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CRP), hormones/peptides and other factors involved in energy balance regulation.
      Subjects will be asked to record their daily food intake for 3 days. Assessments of vital
      signs and body height and weight, waist and hip circumferences, body fat content and body fat
      distribution, review of concomitant medication/supplement use and inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, and evaluation of adverse effects will be performed throughout the study. To meal
      challenge test only men will be included, since the sex hormones may influence the study
      endpoints. Subjects will be encouraged to maintain their habitual diet during wash-out
      periods. During the each meal challenge test subjects will consume one of the study meals in
      random order. The blood will be collected at fasting state and 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240
      minutes after meal intake. The energy expenditure and substrate utilization will be measured
      by indirect calorimetry method at the fasting and postprandially.
