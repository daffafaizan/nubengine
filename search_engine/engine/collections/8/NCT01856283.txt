    
      This study is designed to establish the disappearance of Ph+ stem cells (CD34+/lin-) in BM
      during nilotinib treatment.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is to measure the rate of CD34+/lin-Ph+ cells in the BM after 6
      months of treatment. In order to obtain this result, BM blood of all enrolled patients will
      be stored after 6 months of treatment with nilotinib. The isolated CD34+/lin- cells will be
      employed for standard FISH analysis. These endpoints will be obtained at the central
      laboratory of Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milano, Italy.

      Secondary endpoints will be reached performing:

        -  the same analyzes on CD34+/lin- cells at diagnosis, at 3 and 12 months of treatment;

        -  cytogenetic analysis to estimate the rate of CCyR at 3, 6 and 12 months; this analysis
           will be performed at each local laboratory;

        -  molecular analysis to determinate the rate of MR (≤ 10%, ≤ 1%, MMR, MR4,5 IS) at 3, 6
           and 12 months in the peripheral blood; the molecular analysis will be performed using
           the Labnet standardized laboratories in Lombardy.
