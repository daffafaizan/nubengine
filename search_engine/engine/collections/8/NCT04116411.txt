      therapy) + placebo tablets or to standard treatment + valganciclovir. Patients are randomized
      using 1 to 1 distribution of the patients between the treatment groups and are stratified
      according to methylation status of the MGMT promoter; equal proportion of patients are
      included in each group. A maximum of 30% of patients with methylated MGMT promoter are
      allowed into the study (to harmonise with current data used for statistical power
      calculation), as MGMT promotor methylation status is prognostic for patient survival.
      Patients must enter the study within 10 weeks after surgery.

      Full dose treatment with 900mgs of Valganciclovir is given twice daily for 6 weeks,
      thereafter 900 mgs daily during 98 weeks (total treatment of 24 months). Valganciclovir is
      available in 450 mg tablets. The dose of Valganciclovir will be adjusted according to renal
      function.

      This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, ICH-GCP, the declaration of
      Helsinki and applicable Swedish regulatory requirements.
