      naturopathy, a fixed homeopathic drug combination (HDC) is established in the treatment of
      edema and swellings. For the first time, the efficacy of HDC was investigated in the
      treatment of low-back pain.

      Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of HDC medication vs. placebo in the treatment
      of chronic low back pain considering constitution and diathesism in a double-blind,
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
