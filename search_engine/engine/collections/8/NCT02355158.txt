    
      Study CLO-311 is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to assess the long-term use of
      Clonidine Gel in the treatment of pain associated with PDN. Subjects who have completed their
      12-week participation in Study CLO-290 or Study CLO-310 are eligible to rollover into this
      study and receive active study drug in an open-label manner. All eligible subjects will
      receive Clonidine Gel regardless of the blinded treatment they have received in the previous
      double-blind study (Clonidine Gel or Placebo Gel). Study drug will be applied topically TID
      to both feet for 12 months during an Open-Label Treatment Phase. Approximately 400 adult
      subjects with PDN are estimated to enroll in this study.
