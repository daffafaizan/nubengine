      subject will receive an investigational drug called IMC-1121B. ImClone LLC, the maker of
      IMC-1121B, is running this research study.

      In order for a cancer to grow, it needs blood vessels to bring to it oxygen and food. Cancer
      cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. This is
      called angiogenesis. Normally, new blood vessels do not grow in adults. Angiogenesis
      inhibitors are drugs that may prevent abnormal growth of blood vessels to tumors. IMC-1121B
      is an angiogenesis inhibitor. We believe that IMC-1121B blocks the growth factors made by the
      cancer cells, so new blood vessels do not grow. It is believed that without the new blood
      vessels, the cancer or tumor will not get the oxygen and food that it needs to grow. This may
      stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die. Since normal blood
      vessels have already formed in adults, it might be possible to stop tumor growth without
      harming normal cells.
