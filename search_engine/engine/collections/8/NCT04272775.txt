      tolerability, safety, and PK of ixazomib administered alone or in combination with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      This study will enroll approximately 24 participants (3 to 6 participants in each
      dose-escalation cohort). Participants will be assigned to receive treatment in one of the
      four treatment cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Ixazomib 4.0 mg

        -  Cohort 2: Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

        -  Cohort 3: Ixazomib 5.5 mg

        -  Cohort 4: Ixazomib 5.5 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 7 years. Participants will make a final visit 29 days after receiving
      their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
