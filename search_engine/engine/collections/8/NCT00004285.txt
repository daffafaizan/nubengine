      age, and diabetes prior to dialysis initiation.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: moderate dose dialysis, low flux membrane;
      high dose dialysis, low flux membrane; moderate dose dialysis, high flux membrane; or high
      dose dialysis, high flux membrane. Moderate dose is a target eKt/V of 1.05 and high dose is
      1.45. The dose and delivery of dialysis are measured monthly by the equilibrated fractional
      clearance of urea (eKt/V) calculated with double pool kinetics.

      Patients are dialyzed 3 times a week in the shortest possible time (minimum 2.5 hours),
      adjusted for adequate fluid removal. General medical care, protein and calorie intake, and
      dialyzer reuse and other aspects of dialysis therapy are standardized. The protocol document
      lists approved dialyzers; no unsubstituted cellulosic membranes are permitted.

      The intervention phase of this study is 5 years. Patients are followed for survival.
