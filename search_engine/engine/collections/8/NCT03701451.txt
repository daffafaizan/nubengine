      nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a disease with hypermethylation changes, and epigenetic treatment
      has not yet been carried out in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this study, Simon's two-stage
      design method was used to select 30 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated with
      demethylating drug decitabine 7mg/m2 d1-5 + cisplatin 80mg/m2 d1 induced chemotherapy for 3
      cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin 80mg/m2. observing the
      efficacy and toxicity of decitabine in the treatment of regionally advanced nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma, followed up for 2 years, observing the 2-year survival rate,evluating the
      relationship between different degrees of methylation and survival before and after
      treatment,provide clinical basis for the clinical study of stage II-III.
