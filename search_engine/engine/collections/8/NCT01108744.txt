      Pressure measurements may not be sufficient in the management of elevated ICP. Based on this
      evidence, monitoring of partial brain tissue oxygenation has gain acceptance among
      neurosurgeons and neurointensivists, and has become a standard of care monitor in some
      centers across the country. There is, however, insufficient information in the literature
      describing the effects of hyperosmolar medications on regional brain tissue oxygenation.

      We intend to undertake this non-inferiority, prospective, randomized double-blind study to
      answer very important clinical questions not yet answered in the literature: Will hypertonic
      saline therapy, given at equiosmolar load, be non-inferior to mannitol in reducing elevated
      ICP?
