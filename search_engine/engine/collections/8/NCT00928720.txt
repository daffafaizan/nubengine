      the investigators propose that cranial electrical stimulation (CES) that works on the brain
      may ameliorate symptoms of FM by interacting with the central pain networks. The specific
      aims of this randomized, controlled, three-group pilot study design are to: (1) determine
      differences in pain over time between the active CES, sham device, and usual care (UC)
      groups; (2) explore differences in brain activity in pain processing regions (i.e.,
      cingulate, insula, prefrontal and somatosensory cortices, amygdala, and thalamus) between the
      active CES, sham device, and UC groups in a subset of 12 participants (6 in each device
      group); (3) determine the effects of CES on other symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbances,
      depression, perceived stress) and functional status, and blood pressure over time between the
      active CES, sham device, and UC groups; and (4) determine the amount of influence that
      selected psychological factors (negative affect, catastrophizing, and other personality
      characteristics) have on group differences in pain, other symptoms, functional status, and
      brain activity.
