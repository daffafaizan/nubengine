    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation, phase I, study of HTI-1090 (also known as SHR9146), a
      small molecule that inhibits both indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan
      2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) - two enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of L-tryptophan (Trp) into
      kynurenine (Kyn), thereby interrupting the immune escape and the attainment of immunologic
      tolerance. Dose escalation will use a modified "3+3" design and continue until a MTD or RP2D
      is identified. This study will also characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of HTI-1090 in subjects with advanced solid
      tumors.
