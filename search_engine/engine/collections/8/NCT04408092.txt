      macrophage infiltration in children with ependymoma (EPN) who are to have planned surgery as
      a standard procedure for incomplete resection or recurrent tumor. To correlate the extent of
      macrophage infiltration with other immune markers of the tumor at subsequent surgery with
      outcome. This is intended as a pilot protocol with the potential to be incorporated in the
      next COG (Children's Oncology Group) national ependymoma studies.

      Recombinant Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulation Factor (rGM-CSF) is a hematopoietic
      growth factor which supports survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic
      progenitor cells. rGM-CSF induces partially committed progenitor cells to divide and
      differentiate in the granulocyte-macrophage pathways. rGM-CSF stimulates the production of
      monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, and sometimes, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It
      also induces mature macrophages to increase phagocytosis, superoxide generation, Antibody
      Dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC), tumoricidal killing and cytokine production
      (IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor).

      Registration of all participants must occur before any study-related procedures. Staff will
      be available to register participants Monday thru Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Mountain
      Standard Time.
