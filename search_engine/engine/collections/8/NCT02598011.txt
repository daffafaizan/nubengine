    
      This is a multi-center, open label trial of combination therapy with Toca 511 and ascending
      doses of Toca FC added to the SOC for newly diagnosed HGG.

      Enrolled subjects with presumed newly diagnosed HGG will undergo planned resection of tumor.

      Subjects with HGG will receive Toca 511, administered by intracranial parenchymal injection
      into the walls of the resection cavity.

      This study will establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of Toca FC to be used in combination
      with standard of care chemoradiation and temozolomide in subjects with newly diagnosed HGG.

      Subjects will begin chemoradiation treatment approximately 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Oral
      Toca FC (7-day courses) will be administered concurrent with the start of the second and
      sixth weeks of chemoradiation during the concurrent treatment period, and concurrent with the
      start of temozolomide during the maintenance treatment period.
