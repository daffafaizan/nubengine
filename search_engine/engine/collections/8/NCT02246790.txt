      long-standing persistent AF and coronary artery disease. 116 patients are required to have a
      80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome
      (freedom fro AF) measure by 12% in the biatrial group over left atrial group. Patients are
      divided into two groups, group I - biatrial + CABG (58 patients), and group II - left atrial
      + CABG (58 patients). Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before
      operation. The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received
      coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about kind of surgical ablation. Subcutaneous
      cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.
