      or nose into the airways. This allows direct visualization of the airways as well as taking
      different samples. In addition, this procedure allows opening of airway obstruction.

      Administration of sedation during FFP is important, since this diminishes patient discomfort
      and body movements. It also lessens the untoward physiologic response to airway manipulation.
      In addition, patients requiring repeated examinations may refuse if they have suffered an
      unpleasant experience.

      FFP is usually a brief procedure (several minutes up to an hour). Therefore, it is
      advantageous to use short acting drugs in order to shorten the prolonged post procedural
      monitoring and allow rapid patient discharge.

      Several clinical trials have shown the superiority of propofol over midazolam for sedation
      during bronchoscopy regarding recovery of alertness, memory & motor function.

      Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic with rapid onset and short duration. Using propofol, one can
      achieve rapid onset of sedation and faster recovery.

      Propofol given in boluses of 10-20 mg was found as an effective dose to reach BIS target
      values.

      Awareness is the postoperative recollection of events occurring during general anesthesia.

      BIS is a monitor of anesthetic depth approved by the FDA. It incorporates time-domain,
      frequency-domain and bi-spectral analysis of the EEG. This analysis is displayed as a
      dimensionless number between zero (deep anesthesia) and 100 (awake).

      BIS values between 80-90 represent values corresponding to light/moderate sedation
