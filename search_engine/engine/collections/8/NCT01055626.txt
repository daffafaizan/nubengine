      Obesity is a serious medical problem because it increases the risk of hypertension, type 2
      diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, sleep-breathing disorders, and certain forms of
      cancer. Obesity is defined medically as a state of increased adipose tissue of sufficient
      magnitude to produce adverse health consequences. The definition of obesity is based on an
      excess of body fat, not of BMI. However, BMI is the reference used to establish a graded
      classification of weight relative to height. Although BMI is widely used as a simple
      surrogate measure of body fat and has been shown to correlate closely with adiposity, it
      would be more appropriate to determine body fat percentage and to use this value for
      classification purposes. The present study contemplates the determination of the per cent
      body fat (by air displacement plethysmography) in more than 5,000 subjects representing the
      whole BMI range, with the aim of establishing new diagnostic and therapeutic criteria
      according to the associated comorbidities. The specific objectives are: a) To know the body
      fat percentage means for normal weight, overweight and obesity for both sexes. b) To know the
      body fat percentage means for normal weight, overweight and obesity for the different age
      ranges. c) To analyse the relationship between body fat percentage and BMI values in order to
      detect misclassified individuals. d) To establish new cut-offs for body fat percentage and
      the normality ranges according to its relationship with cardiovascular risk factors that
      could be useful in the diagnosis and therapy of obesity.
