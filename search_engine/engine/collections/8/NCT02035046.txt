    
      Gitelman syndrome (GS), is an autosomal recessive salt wasting tubulopathy caused mainly by
      loss of function mutations in the SLC12A3 gene coding for the thiazide sensitive
      sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). Thus, GS mimics a chronic treatment with high doses of
      thiazide diuretics. NCC is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible
      for 7% of NaCl reabsorption. GS is the more frequent hereditary tubulopathie with estimated
      prevalence of 1/40000, which implicates that 1% of general population are heterozygous
      carriers (600 000 in France). Previous publications suggest that the apparently asymptomatic
      heterozygous carriers could present some clinical traits of GS or chronic thiazide treatment.
      These including: beneficial aspects (low blood pressure, low urinary calcium excretions) or
      metabolic risks (hypokalemia, insulin resistance). Nevertheless, these studies do not
      evaluate all the aspects and blood pressure was evaluated once in hospital setting. This
      study aims to compare home monitoring blood pressure; salt balance; potassium, glucose lipid
      and mineral metabolism and vascular function in 80 heterozygous carriers, 80 GS patients and
      80 controls persons (without mutations in SLC12A3 gene).
