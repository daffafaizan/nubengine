      Pain, considered in its multiple versions (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria and,
      in general, chronic pelvic pain) is the most common and disabilitating symptom in affected
      women. Usual care, consisting on palliative pharmacological treatment in combination with
      surgery, is clearly insufficient and physical therapies need to be explored in order to
      reduce pain and to improve quality of life in affected women.

      Objective: The overall objective of 'Physio-EndEA' study will be to explore potential short
      and mid-term benefits of a rehabilitation program on the quality of life of symptomatic
      women.

      Methods: A total of 40 symptomatic endometriosis women will be recruited. Inclusion criteria
      includes: aged 18-50, clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and interested in improving
      lifestyle while exclusion criteria includes: diagnosed chronic disease or orthopaedic issues
      that would interfere with ability to participate in a physical activity program. Women will
      be randomized to either intervention (n=20) or usual care group (n=20). Intervention group
      will receive twice weekly session for 9 weeks and control group will receive recommendations
      about healthy lifestyle and usual care.

      Discussion: This study attempts to improve the quality of life of symptomatic endometriosis
      women by reducing musculoskeletal and occupational impairments. Findings will offer a new
      therapeutic approach for a better pain control.
