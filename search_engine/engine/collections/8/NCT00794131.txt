      preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells. This study seeks to evaluate the
      safety profile of an attenuated vaccinia virus when administered intravenously to patients
      with advanced solid tumors. The study also seeks to detect virus delivery to primary and/or
      metastatic tumors, including evaluation of viral delivery by fluorescence imaging (GFP
      expression); whether anti-vaccinia virus immune response occurs; and will record evidence of
      any anti-tumor activity. For Cohorts 8 and Expansion Cohort 1B, CTC counts, virus-encoded
      marker gene analysis and Dynamic Contrast (DCE-MRI) MRI imaging will be used to evaluate
      tumor micro-circulation in vivo. These measures will be evaluated for their potential
      predictive value of survival outcomes, and to evaluate any correlation of such
      pharmacodynamic and response rate indicators in the GL-ONC1 treatment context.
