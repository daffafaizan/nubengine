      I. Identify pelvic floor muscle (PFM) activity on electromyogram (EMG) and
      electroencephalography (EEG).

      II. Identify any synchrony in EMG and EEG for PFM activity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify changes in EEG and EMG activity with Kegel exercise. II. Examine relationship
      between EEG activity and continence.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Examine feasibility of replacing EMG with EEG monitoring for muscle activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients perform standard of care Kegel exercises while undergoing brain and muscle activity
      monitoring by EEG and EMG, respectively, before surgery, 6 weeks after surgery, and at 3, 6,
      and 12 months after surgery. Patients complete questionnaires over 5-10 minutes about urinary
      function.
