      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is currently the most effective treatment strategy
      for AMI. Brisk thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow immediately after
      PCI in patients with AMI is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with lower
      flow grades. However, myocardial reperfusion is suboptimal in many patients, mostly because
      of the 'no-reflow' phenomenon. No-reflow is defined as suboptimal myocardial reperfusion in
      part of the coronary circulation without angiographic evidence of mechanical vessel
      obstruction. To date, however, very few drugs have been shown to reverse established
      no-reflow.

      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and
      GLP-1 analogues were recently introduced for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.
      GLP-1 has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and may protect endothelial function.
      Experimental studies have also revealed that GLP-1 or its analogues protect against
      reperfusion injury in pigs. Exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue, was reported to reduce reperfusion
      injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Similarly, liraglutide
      was reported to reduce cardiac rupture and infarct size and improve cardiac output in normal
      and diabetic mice. To date, however, there is no clinical evidence for the effects of
      liraglutide on no-reflow in patients with AMI. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of liraglutide pretreatment on myocardial no-reflow of prime PCI in
      patients with AMI.
