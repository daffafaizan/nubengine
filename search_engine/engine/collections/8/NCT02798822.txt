      investigated,4 reporting a maximum maxillary intermolar and intercanine width increase of 6.7
      mm and 5.3 mm,5 respectively, when RME is banded on upper first permanent molars.

      Literature also reported cases of periodontal and endodontic damage on RME anchoring teeth;
      therefore, some authors have suggested banding RME on primary teeth and reporting also
      different mean intermolar (3.6-4.1 mm) and intercanine width increases (5-5.9 mm).

      Few studies have investigated the changes in molar dental tipping and inclinations (on
      average from 3° up to 16.7°) following RME but comprised difficult (ie, barium sulfate
      solution) and more invasive examinations such as computed tomography and cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) Few articles concerning the indirect effects on mandibular arch following
      RME reported a low but statistically significant increase of lower intermolar (0.66-0.97 mm)
      and intercanine width (0.9 mm). Since no studies in the literature have analyzed the
      differences in permanent vs primary molars as anchoring teeth for RME, the decision to band
      the permanent deciduous molars did not follow a clinical protocol, but an individual decision
      was made for each patient based on clinician experience.
