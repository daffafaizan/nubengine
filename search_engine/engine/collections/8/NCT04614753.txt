      skin aging is classified as extrinsic, or photoaging because it results from exposure to UV
      light of the sun that causes oxidative stress The remaining 20% of facial aging is the
      intrinsic type which is partially caused by the accumulation of proteins that are modified by
      reactive carbonyls in a reaction known as protein glycation. Aging also shifts the
      composition of the gut microbiome in at least 35 genera towards an unhealthy state of
      dysbiosis.

      Previous studies showed that muscadine nutraceuticals inhibited protein glycation under a
      simulated physiological condition. Additional experiments using cell culture and mice showed
      that muscadine wine alleviated inflammation and protected against dysbiosis in the gut. The
      objective of this research is to confirm the health benefits of muscadine wine in a clinical
      trial. The investigators hypothesize that muscadine wine consumption in women over 50 years
      old will alleviate skin photoaging and skin conditions by decreasing oxidative stress and
      inflammation. It is also expected to improve the composition of the gut microbiome.
