      involved in estrogen production, while in men regulates spermatogenesis. On the other hand,
      in women, menopause is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and
      the concentration of FSH rises. It is unclear whether such an increase has any effect on the
      development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction represents an early trigger of
      atherosclerosis. Since estrogens can directly stimulate endothelial function and increase in
      response to FSH administration, males might represent a potential model to study the effcts
      of FSH independent from estrogens.Purpose of the study will be to evaluate the effects of the
      s.c. administration of 300 IU of FSH in 16 healthy males. The endothelial function will be
      evaluated by the measurement with ecographic approach of the flow mediated dilation (FMD) of
      the brachial artery. The FMD will be measured before and 6, 12, 24 or 48 hours after FSH or
      placebo adiministration in the same subjects studied 2 weeks apart. The results will help to
      clarify whether perturbation of FSH, similar to the one observed in women after the
      menopause, affects endothelial function.
