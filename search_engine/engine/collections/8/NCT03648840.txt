      aversion (SDA) as a platform for the laboratory testing of novel pharmacologic and behavioral
      interventions that can be used among those with the highest risk, but who have yet to
      progress to treatment-resistant drinking. The objective of this application is to test SDA
      across multiple levels of analysis. The investigators consider SDA as an early marker of
      alcohol use disorder progression that is related to lifetime drinking history, alcohol use
      disorder risks, and brain physiology. The investigators have completed a pilot study
      demonstrating that SDA can be objectively quantified via an intravenous alcohol
      self-administration task, in which operant work for identical incremental alcohol rewards is
      paired with aversive stimuli. This preliminary data supports the central hypotheses that
      behavior in the SDA model is attributable to lifetime alcohol exposure, is related to alcohol
      use disorder risk factors and phenotypes, and reflects alterations in neural system function.
      In this project, SDA will be measured along with recent drinking history, negative
      affect-based rash action (i.e. negative urgency, including action with respect to alcohol
      use), and self-rating of the effects of alcohol. The rationale for this work is that it would
      lead to the first objective, well-validated measure of SDA in humans.
