      (T1DM) in the United States. This disease results from the autoimmune destruction of the
      insulin-producing beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Initially, diabetes
      is usually clinically occult with localized pancreatic inflammation characterized by a
      lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets, termed insulitis, which leads to beta-cell
      specific destruction of the islets. This is often followed by the clinically overt phase that
      ensues when the bulk of beta cells have been destroyed and the pancreas is no longer able to
      produce sufficient insulin to maintain glycemic control. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging with ferumoxtran-10, a functional molecular
      imaging agent consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles, to detect changes in the pancreas
      associated with the insulitis of T1DM.
