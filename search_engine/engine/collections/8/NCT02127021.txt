      resection. After pancreatic surgery, there are several ways to improve patient condition in
      terms of quality of life including nutrition.

      In the investigators previous study, pancreatic enzyme supplement through the administration
      of Norzyme® 25000 IU containing lipase 25000 IU, amylase 22500 IU, and protease 1250 IU after
      various type of pancreatectomy to improve quality of life and nutritional status failed to
      prove its effectiveness. After administration of low-dose Norzyme® (25000 IU), some patients
      showed weight gain, but statistically significant conclusions were not obtained mainly
      because of various types of pancreatectomy and low supplementary dosage of pancreatic enzyme.

      Therefore, the investigators design this study to find out the effect of high-dose Norzyme®
      (40000 IU) on weight gain, quality of life, stool habit change, and nutritional status in
      patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and
      adequacy of high-dose pancreatic supplementary treatment through a randomized, placebo-using,
      single-blinded, and multicenter study.
