      NSCLC. Since angiogenesis inhibitors have also shown activity in NSCLC, the simultaneous
      inhibition of the EGFR and VEGF pathway may improve the efficacy of therapy. In a recently
      reported Phase III trial (Hainsworth et al. 2008), the combination of bevacizumab and
      erlotinib improved the Progression- Free-Survival (PFS) vs. erlotinib alone when given as
      second-line therapy in NSCLC (3.4 months vs. 1.7 months, respectively; HR 0.63). Pazopanib
      also inhibits the angiogenesis pathway, and may have advantages over bevacizumab including:
      (1) inhibition of other potentially important targets, including PDGFR; and (2) more
      convenient oral administration.
