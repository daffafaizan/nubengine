      by drinking water, and increased osmolality caused by intravenous infusion of hypertonic
      saline.Before and after each osmolality change, sensitivity to carbon dioxide will be tested
      by partial rebreathing through a so called Bain-system. Throughout the whole experiment heart
      rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be recorded.Blood samples will be collected
      before each rebreathing test and every 20 minutes during the two hours of water or salt load.
      Urine will be collected and analysed.
