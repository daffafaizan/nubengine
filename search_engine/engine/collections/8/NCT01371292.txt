      health problems. One potential vehicle to foster adolescent involvement in physical activity
      relates to physical education in schools.

      A potentially important framework, that has recently been applied to educational and health
      promotion contexts, relates to transformational leadership theory. Transformational
      leadership involves the demonstration of behaviors that empower and inspire others to achieve
      higher levels of functioning, and has been consistently found to be associated with greater
      motivation, self-efficacy, well-being, and performance in those being led. From an applied
      perspective, a growing body of evidence also suggests that transformational behaviors can be
      developed in leaders through short-term interventions (e.g., one-day workshops), which
      subsequently result in positive changes in followers' attitudinal and behavioral responses.

      With this in mind, the overall goal of this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to test the
      efficacy of a theory-driven evidence-based transformational teaching intervention for use
      within school-based physical activity settings. In this 5-month trial, physical education
      teachers from 36 schools from three provinces across Canada (British Columbia, Ontario and
      Nova Scotia) will be provided with (through a one day work shop and follow-up support
      program) the resources they need to implement transformational teaching behaviours in their
      day-to-day teaching practices. The primary hypothesis for this RCT is that students taught by
      teachers in the intervention condition will display greater adoption and maintenance of
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) behaviors outside of school hours in comparison
      to control students, after controlling for baseline levels. A process evaluation will also be
      conducted with teachers to evaluate the procedures embedded within the intervention.
