    
      Type-2-diabetes is a growing healthcare problem. Both because of the increasing amount of
      patients and because of the complications of diabetes.

      Non-pharmacological treatment is considered fundamental in the treatment of patients with
      type-2-diabetes.

      In the Community of Copenhagen, all patients diagnosed with diabetes receive rehabilitation.
      The rehabilitation consists of counseling with regards to nutrition, physical activity,
      smoking cessation and education about diabetes.

      Some patients however, remain poorly regulated despite rehabilitation as well as
      pharmacological treatment.

      A total number of 165 patients will be randomized to intervention group or standard care.
