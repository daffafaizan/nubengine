        -  Postsurgical patients in an anesthesiological ICU with ICU LOS (LOS: length of stay) > 3
           days

             -  Inclusion:

                ---- Age ≥ 18 years

                ---. demand of central venous and arterial line

                --- written consent of patient and/or assignee

             -  Exclusion

                  -  Handicapped patients

                  -  patient with ICU LOS < 3 days

        -  Study design

             1. Three days after admission to ICU blood cultures are drawn to exclude preexisting
                blood stream infection

             2. Patients in a bed with even number are assigned to Bionecteur® group. Control group
                (without using bionecteurs) are patients with an odd bed number.

             3. Biconecteurs® are connected to all lumens of the central catheter and to arterial
                catheter. Control group is treated without using Bionecteurs®. Handling of vascular
                catheters are performed as described in institutional guidelines in both groups.

             4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections are monitored by an independent person
                during ICU treatment

             5. The study will be finished ab discharge of ICU or removal of catheters.
