    
      This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, kinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SYNB1618
      within the following 2 study parts:

      Part 1 comprises a single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted over 4 days in HV male and
      female subjects in up to 6 dose cohorts (3 treated:1 placebo) to identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) within the single-dose range studied. Up to 24 HV subjects are planned
      for enrollment in this part of the study. Following attainment of the MTD in HV, a SAD cohort
      of up to 4 subjects (male and female, ≥ 18 years old) previously diagnosed with PKU will be
      enrolled (3 treated:1 placebo).

      Part 2 comprises a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting (6
      treated:2 placebo) over 10 days in HV male and female subjects in up to 4 cohorts at doses
      not exceeding the MTD from the SAD part of the study to identify the MTD of SYNB1618 within
      the multiple-dose range studied. Up to 32 HV subjects are planned for enrollment in this part
      of the study. Once the highest MAD cohort and the SAD PKU cohort are completed, a
      multiple-dose cohort of male and female subjects (≥ 18 years old) previously diagnosed with
      PKU are evaluated. Up to 20 subjects with PKU are planned for enrollment in the MAD PKU
      cohort (12 treated:8 placebo).
