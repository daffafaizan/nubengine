      damage to the pancreas therefore the cells contained in the pancreas--i.e.--islets that house
      beta cells, which make and release insulin (similar to T1D). Recent evidence suggests that
      other factors may also be associated that are similar to those with T2D. For example,
      patients with T2D, have decreased secretion of incretins, hormones released by the small
      intestine in response to nutrients from food which act, among other things, to increase
      insulin secretion from Beta cells of the pancreas. When patients with T2D are treated with
      incretin hormones, their pancreatic Beta cells release more insulin (measured as 'second
      phase insulin secretion'). Currently, we do not know if patients with CFRD have decreased
      incretin secretion like T2D or if treating CFRD patients with incretin hormones will improve
      their insulin levels. This study will measure insulin release from the Beta cells from CFRD
      patients (second phase insulin secretion) that are being given incretin hormones in the
      veins. This will be compared with insulin release when the same patients are given a placebo
      (salt containing solution). The patients and the research team will not know what is being
      given until all the results are collected. The results will provide unbiased evidence if
      incretins will help improve insulin release in CFRD patients.
