      (IM) influenza vaccine in the past 3 years; and 2) those that reported not receiving the IM
      influenza vaccine in the past 3 years. The survey responses were compared between the two
      groups. In addition, the subjects that reported receiving the IM vaccine in the past 3 years
      were asked to compare their experience with the IM vaccine versus the ID vaccine.
