      research. The World Health Organization has been conducting the Global Burden of Disease
      study since the 1990s. This study, which has been the subject of numerous publications, aims
      at estimating the burden for a given population of different causes of mortality and
      morbidity. It defines a standardized measure allowing comparisons between different
      countries. The measure developed internationally is the "Disability-adjusted life year"
      (DALY). This also allows the monitoring of the relative importance of each pathology. This
      standardized classification of the relative importance of the pathologies and risk factors
      involved is a major public health tool.

      This measure was developed at the international level initially and then recently applied
      locally (London neighborhoods, US states). For the Indian Ocean zone, DALY values are
      available for Madagascar, Seychelles and Mauritius. The estimate of this measure for Reunion
      Island is based on data from metropolitan France. It therefore uses for Reunion mortality,
      morbidity, income per capita and social indicators of metropolitan France. It does not take
      into account the specificities of Reunion. In order to better understand Reunion's public
      health priorities, it seems important to decline this measure at the regional level. The
      implementation of this measure at the regional level corresponds to the research project
      AVIRON which aimed at collecting all the data for the calculation of the DALY in Reunion
      Island. The AVIRON-2 study, which extends AVIRON's focus on morbidity and mortality, will aim
      at determining the attributable part of the various disease risk factors and to classify
      these risk factors according to their importance in a given population for all diseases.
