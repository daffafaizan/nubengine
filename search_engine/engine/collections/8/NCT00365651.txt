      2006 based on FitnessGram testing done by graduate students at MSU during their prior (4th
      grade) school year. After receiving informed consent from parent/child, the subjects will be
      checked for height/weight and other screening criteria, then exposed to 2005 My Pyramid for
      Kids, "Tips for Families" information, and watch a short 8 minute DVD that discusses the
      importance of exercise and fitness by way of interviewing two club level female soccer
      players of equivalent age. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to fall youth soccer in
      Starkville, or spring youth soccer, after first phase data collection occurs in November,
      2006.
