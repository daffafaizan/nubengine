    
      This study is a placebo controlled (2:1 drug vs. placebo), randomized clinical trial of 21
      healthy, non-diabetic volunteers receiving daily doses of oral glyburide (1.5 mg) vs. placebo
      while under careful medical monitoring in an inpatient Clinical Research Unit (CRU)within the
      Center for Applied Research Sciences (CARS) at the Washington University in St. Louis Medical
      Center for a duration of 7 days and nights (24 hours per day). Interested subjects who call
      for more information about the study will be scheduled for a screening visit. Subjects will
      participate first in an informed consent process, and those wishing to take part will be
      asked to undergo a comprehensive interview detailing their past medical history and formal
      physical examination (which includes laboratory tests of the urine and blood). If a subject
      is deemed appropriate by the team, he/she will be asked to perform an exercise test
      (treadmill for 30 minutes) and will have an Electrocardiogram (ECG) completed to further
      determine eligibility. Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria based on screening
      activities will be notified immediately that they are not eligible. Volunteers meeting all
      eligibility criteria will be scheduled for the week long in-patient evaluation.

      Each subject will undergo a battery of physical, cognitive, and laboratory tests in addition
      to receiving oral glyburide or placebo each day for one week.
