      many upper level pediatric residents are unable to successfully intubate neonates or
      pediatric patients in a timely manner. Simulation has been shown to be effective in teaching
      procedural skills, but it is not known if improvements in intubation skills can persist. The
      investigators sought to determine if video laryngoscopy could be used to enhance resident
      intubation skills that would be retained for one year.

      Methods: There were 67 Pediatric and Internal Medicine/Pediatric residents, levels 1-4, who
      completed the study and were randomized by month of service into non-intervention (NI, n= 36)
      and intervention (IN, n=31) groups. IN residents observed the intubation portion of the
      Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) training video and received cognitive instruction and 30
      minutes of hands on instruction using a video laryngoscope. At the study's conclusion, 12
      months after enrollment, residents completed a survey of intubations of live patients over
      the past year, a cognitive assessment of intubation, and were timed on intubating a manikin.
      Results were analyzed by Student's T-Test.
