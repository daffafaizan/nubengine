      I. Determine the efficacy of 3-AP (Triapine®) followed by fludarabine phosphate in patients
      with myeloproliferative disorders or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in aggressive phase or
      transformation or chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase or blast crisis.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine, preliminarily,
      the effect of this regimen on circulating leukemic cell genetics in these patients.

      Outline: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 4 hours followed by fludarabine phosphate IV over
      30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow and/or peripheral blood collection at
      baseline and periodically during study treatment for molecular analysis of Janus kinase 2
      (JAK2) mutations, GATA-1 mutations, and expression of the death-inducer-obliterator (Dido)
      genes on chromosome 20q.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
