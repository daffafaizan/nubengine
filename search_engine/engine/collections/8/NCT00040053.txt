    
      This study was designed to be a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of 3-wide
      range doses of ondansetron (0.25, 1.0 and 4.0 mg taken orally twice per day) to reduce
      methamphetamine use in subjects with methamphetamine dependence and to determine the optimal
      dose of ondansetron.
