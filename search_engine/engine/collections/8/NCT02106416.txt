      recruited to undergo PET/MRI employing simultaneous dynamic acquisition of PET and
      gadolinium-chelate data sets. For initial technical development within this pilot study,
      analysis will be performed attempting to compute tracer delivery using inputs from an
      integrated MRI-perfusion analysis. Flow and permeability will be obtained from the MR
      perfusion analysis, which can be used to compute the inflow rate constant K1. K1, reflecting
      the transfer of contrast, will then be used to compute the metabolic uptake of FDG by the
      organ as well as of any visible tumors. A determination will be made whether this metabolic
      uptake is successfully computed for each case. If not, then acquisition and post-processing
      modifications will be made for subsequent cases.
