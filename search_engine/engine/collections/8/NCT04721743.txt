    
      Objective: To investigate the potential of gut microbiota as a biomarker of responsiveness to
      treatment and to evaluate treatment related changes in fecal microbiota composition among
      posterior segment uveitis patients.

      Study Population: Up to 150 participants with uveitis may be enrolled in this study across up
      to 21 participating sites.

      Design: This is a prospective, case-control ancillary study. Participants will be asked to
      provide a stool sample, blood sample, and complete an on-line Diet History Questionnaire
      (DHQ). The study will last approximately three years, with two years for recruitment and one
      year for follow-up. Participants must be co-enrolled in the parent ADVISE protocol (NCT
      03828019.) in order to be eligible for this study.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome answers whether there is a gut microbial signature at
      baseline that can predict therapeutic response among uveitis patients. Additionally, this
      study will explore whether the gut microbial ecology change differentially in response to
      conventional immunosuppressives or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) treatment.
      Secondary outcomes include exploring if there are molecular or immune phenotypic markers of
      activity or therapeutic response: To identify molecular correlates of disease activity and
      treatment response through transcriptional profiling (bulk ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing
      of whole blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes or a similar RNA stabilizing tube) and to
      identify immunophenotypic correlates of activity and treatment response through flow
      cytometry analysis (using Transfix tubes or a similar direct draw collection tubes used to
      stabilize venous blood at the point of collection and preserve whole blood specimens for
      immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.)
