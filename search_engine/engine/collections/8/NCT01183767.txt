    
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent neuromuscular condition to occur in
      childhood and youth. The course of the disease is progressive, and life expectancy is
      severely curtailed by the participation of the respiratory muscles and/or by progressive
      cardiomyopathy.

      DMD derives from mutations in the DMD gene which leads to a loss of the protein dystrophin.
      Secondary inflammatory/immunological reactions contribute to the progressive course of the
      disease (1,2).

      No curative therapy yet exists. Administration of steroids is the only established medical
      treatment. Symptomatic measures are also available, such as orthopaedic operations, the
      treatment of cardiomyopathy or, in advanced stages, home mechanical ventilation.

      In studies involving experiments on cells and animals, Epigallocatechin-Gallate (EGCG, the
      major polyphenol in green tea) has shown a neuroprotective effect. The neuroprotective
      mechanism of action is probably based on several factors, including EGCG's modulation of
      several signal transduction pathways, its influence on the expression of genes regulating
      cell survival or programmed cell death, as well as its modulation of mitochondrial function.

      The mdx mouse is the best-investigated animal model of a dystrophin-negative muscular
      dystrophy. Administration of EGCG in the mdx mouse led to both a reduction in the proportion
      of fibre necroses as well as to a less pronounced proliferation of connective tissue in the
      muscle (3,4), and also to an improvement in clinical symptoms (5,6).

      Therefore, the investigators want to investigate safety and tolerance of EGCG in a dosage of
      up to 10mg/kg in patients with muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type in this multicentre,
      prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized pilot study.
