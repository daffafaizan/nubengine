      mental images without the need for an external stimulus, although it has been demonstrated
      that providing visual information, prior to a task of imagination, facilitates it and causes
      a greater neurophysiological activity than if it were done in an isolated manner. Some
      studies have shown that in the short term, in complex motor tasks of foot and hand in a
      coordinated manner, the action observation training provokes a greater motor learning
      compared to the motor imagery strategy.

      However, these studies have only assessed short-term memory immediately after the
      intervention. No study has so far evaluated these improvements in motor learning through
      action observation training and motor imagery on consecutive days, nor has it been evaluated
      with short to medium-term follow-up.

      It is therefore that there is a lack in the current scientific literature regarding which
      isolated method, without physical practice, of mental practice on motor learning is the most
      effective when exposed both on consecutive days, as well as to short-medium-term follow-up.
