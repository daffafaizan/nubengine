    
      Study Design: a controlled, randomized, parallel assessor-blinded clinical trial.

      Patients suffering from chronic plantar fasciitis (duration more than 6 months) will be
      assigned to three different groups:

        -  Group I: Treatment applied by standard shock waves device.

        -  Group II: Shock wave therapy applied by a modified standard device to offer more
           attractive, more technical, smarter, better appearance, larger and with an expansion of
           external information devices more sophisticated.

        -  Group III: Shock wave therapy applied by a modified standard device to offer a more
           austere, disfigured, unattractive, modest and smaller external appearance.

      The shock waves emitted to the 3 devices will be identical; the only difference will be the
      external image of the device.

      The main outcome will be the function of the foot by the FFI (Foot Function Index)
      questionnaire.

      As secondary variables: pain by VAS (Visual Analogical Scale) in different situations, the
      plantar fascia thickness measured by ultrasound, and the perception of patient recovery
      measured with the Likert scale. Adverse effects, painkillers consumption and pain experienced
      during the treatment of shock waves were also assessed.

      The patients will be followed and monitored for a month, two months and four months after
      treatment finished.

      For the statistical analysis of clinical variables, ANOVA (analysis of variance) will be
      performed to check whether the evolution of patients over time was different depending on the
      device applied.
