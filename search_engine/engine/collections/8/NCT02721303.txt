      run-in. On the study day they will present in the fasting state, have an intravenous catheter
      placed for blood draws and have baseline blood samples taken and appetite measures performed.
      Participants will then undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will be
      followed by a breakfast meal. Blood and appetite measures will be performed every half hour
      for 3 hours. Repeat fMRI will be performed 30 minutes after the meal. After three hours
      participants will be offered a buffet style lunch and then will be done with the study visit.
