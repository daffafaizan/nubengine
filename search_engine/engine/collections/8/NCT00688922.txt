      pravastatin on major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction and
      mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in the OACIS-LIPID Study. The PRACTIC study is designed
      as the OACIS-LIPID II trial to determine whether early treatment with pravastatin can reduce
      adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction and minimally to mildly
      elevated serum Low Density Lipoprotein -Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.
