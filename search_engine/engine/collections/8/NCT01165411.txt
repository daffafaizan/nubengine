      settings.CVCs disturb skin integrity and create vulnerability for bacterial and fungal
      infections. It has been estimated that 90% of bloodstream infections associated with
      catheters, are due to CVCs, and that 500 to 4,000 patients in the United States die annually
      due to these bloodstream infections (Mermel, 2000). The risk of central line (CL)associated
      bloodstream infections (CLAB) is typically expressed as the number of line infections per
      1000 catheter days.A recent study demonstrated that following a set of standardized
      procedures can reduce the mean CLAB rate from 7.7 per 1000 catheter days to 1.4 (Pronovost et
      al., 2006).In an effort to decrease hospital acquired bloodstream infections and
      complications resulting from CVCs, an initiative to standardize and track CL placement
      throughout the institution is proposed. A uniform CL protocol will be developed;practice
      guidelines will be updated based on current evidence, and a standard procedural checklist
      will be developed based on CL care bundles recommended by the Institute for Healthcare
      Improvement (IHI)(5 Million Lives, 2007).Generally,a care bundle is a series of best
      practices that each enhances care when applied individually, but considerably improves care
      when implemented together.The CL care bundle includes hand hygiene, barrier precautions,
      chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, optimal site selection, and daily consideration of line
      necessity, with timely removal of unnecessary lines(5 Million Lives, 2007).Another goal of
      this initiative is to create a CL registry to capture and store data relevant to each CL
      placed throughout the institution.This registry will provide a wealth of data on CL
      insertions and complications which may be used as a valuable source of information for
      quality assurance, performance improvement, and research.Finally,with the knowledge and
      information obtained through this registry, educational offerings can be created, and a
      standardized institutional process for CL insertion can be developed.

      Objective: 1.To capture information on each CL insertion throughout the institution.2.To
      capture and track the amount of days a patient has a CL in place.3.To capture and track CL
      infectious complications.4.To capture and track mechanical complications.5.To capture
      data,which may be used as a valuable source of information for quality assurance, performance
      improvement, education, and research.
