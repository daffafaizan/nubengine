management of advanced ovarian carcinoma.the life graph is presented for the purposeof illustrating the results of treatmentfor patients with ovarian carcinoma whoeventually died from their disease.  it includesall patients regardless of initial stageof disease, histology of the tumor, ortherapy employed.  the series is a selectedone because of the type of patient referredto the medical oncology service, andit demonstrates that almost 2/3 of the patientsdied within 2 yr. of diagnosis.  allpatients received active, aggressive anti-tumoras well as supportive therapy, althoughthere was no formal protocol for patientmanagement.  it might be possible, employinga standardized therapeutic approach-irradiationwhen indicated to the entireabdomen in the dose range of 3,500rads, followed by judicious use of currentlyavailable anticancer drugs when thedisease recurs-to produce a modest increasein the 2-year survival figures.  sincemost series show that approximately 75%of patients with ovarian carcinoma are instage iii of iv when first diagnosed, moreattention might be directed to earlierdiagnosis.  while it is an important field forinvestigation, methods of facilitatingearly diagnosis are not apparent at the moment.controlled trials of adjuvant therapyfor stage i and ii disease in which approximately40% of recurrences are seenshould be expanded.  this might consist ofinstillation of radioactive or chemicalagents into the abdominal cavity, the use ofsystemic chemotherapy during or immediatelyafter operation, or infusion of drugsinto the abdominal aorta.  for stagesiii and iv controlled trials of drugs alone,sequentially, or in combination with orsubsequent to irradiation seem indicated.finally, efforts to find more effectiveanticancer drugs must continue.
