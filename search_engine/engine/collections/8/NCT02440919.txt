      associated with undesirable effects on the hemodynamic parameters, ventilation, oxygenation
      and respiratory mechanics.

      The hyperoxygenation is one of the methods of prevention of hypoxemia induced by tracheal
      suction procedure and have been proposed for its efficiency. Another method is the
      hyperinflation with the mechanical ventilator. Ventilator hyperinflation improves
      oxygenation, mobilizes the bronchial secretion excess and re-expand the lung collapsed areas.

      The PEEP-ZEEP is a ventilator hyperinflation technique, described as a lung inflation through
      a positive pressure enhancement at the end of expiration (PEEP), followed by rapid lung
      deflation with an abrupt reduction in the PEEP to ZEEP (0 centimeters of water (cmH2O)).
