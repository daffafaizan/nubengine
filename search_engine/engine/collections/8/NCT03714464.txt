      morning for each study, with the studies separated by approximately 1 week. We will measure
      breath hydrogen before the test meal, and after that approximately every hour for the next 5
      h. We will also scan the subjects at baseline, immediately after the test meal and then
      approximately every hour for 5 hours postprandially. Subjects will be scanned on a research
      dedicated 1.5T MRI scanner. At baseline and every time the subjects come out of the MRI
      scanner we will ask them to rate their feelings of fullness, hunger and appetite as well
      their gastrointestinal symptoms on 100mm VAS scales. The subjects will be fed three types of
      Pink Lady apples test meals: whole apple, apple puree and apple juice. The apples will be
      sourced from supermarkets. The apple juice and apple puree will be prepared for this study by
      Campden BRI, a world famous food science research institute in Chipping Campden, UK. Each
      test meal will approximately provide 46g of available carbohydrate; 180kcal
