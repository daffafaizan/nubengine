    
      Based on a review of the literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that
      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The four observational post-marketing
      requirement (PMR) studies are labeled Study #2065-1, Study #2065-2, Study #2065-3, and Study
      #2065-4.

      The objective of PMR Study #2065-4 is to define and validate doctor/pharmacy shopping as
      outcomes suggestive of misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction.

      Study #2065-4 consists of three sub-studies, Study 4A, Study 4B, and Study 4C. In the current
      study (#2065-4 sub-study, Study 4C), the association of doctor/pharmacy shopping behavior
      with misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction will be assessed by reviewing medical charts
      in a sample of patients within specific categories of a priori defined doctor/pharmacy
      shopping. The four categories of doctor/pharmacy shopping behaviors identified and defined in
      Study 4A and will be applied to Study 4C. The medical chart is a rich source of information
      about the patient's medical conditions and behaviors suggestive of misuse and abuse. Medical
      record review for behaviors suggestive of misuse and abuse in patients with chronic pain
      discriminates between patients with and without opioid use disorders. Therefore, Study 4C was
      designed to utilize an insurance/health plan database (HealthCore Integrated Research
      Database [HIRD]) with access to medical records, to evaluate the association of a priori
      defined categories of doctor/pharmacy shopping and behaviors suggestive of misuse, diversion,
      abuse and/or addiction.
