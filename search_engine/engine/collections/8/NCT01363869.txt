      inflammatory arthritis in men. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is one of the
      uric-lowering agents commonly used in patients suffering from recurrent and chronic gout.
      Nevertheless, its use is limited by adverse effects and serious allergic reaction in some
      patients.

      Green tea is one of the most frequently consumed beverages, particularly in Japan. Green tea
      contains high level of catechins, in which Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most
      abundant compound among other types of catechins. Antioxidant effect contributes to various
      potential health benefits of green tea. Several in-vitro studies have found that green tea
      inhibits xanthine oxidase activity and subsequently decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      and uric acid production. We therefore would like to investigate the hypouricemic effects of
      green tea.

      The study consists of three periods with a total duration of four weeks. The first week is
      the control period. The following two weeks is the interventional period and the last week is
      the follow up period. Thirty healthy participants will be randomly assigned into three
      experimental groups, receiving 2 gm/day, 4 gm/day and 6 gm/day (in capsule, two times after
      meal) of green tea extract during interventional period. Blood and urine samples will be
      taken at the beginning and at the end of each study period.
