      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in
      treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that an intervention is being studied.
      In this study, the investigational agents are apalutamide and abiraterone acetate.
      Abiraterone acetate (used in combination with prednisone) is an FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) approved drug for prostate cancer, but is approved in patients that have
      prostate cancer spread to other parts of their body and have been previously treated with
      ADT. Apalutamide has also been approved by the FDA for men whose cancer does not respond to
      hormone therapy but it is still investigational for this type of cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at two methods of androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT), also known as hormonal therapy, to determine which method is better for
      improving long term cure rates. ADT blocks the function of hormones, including testosterone
      which prostate cancer uses to grow and spread. The first method of ADT includes prednisone,
      apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate plus standard ADT and the second method of ADT is
      standard ADT alone for men with this type of prostate cancer. Currently, the best standard
      treatment for men with this type of prostate cancer includes standard ADT. All participants
      in this study will receive the main standard form of ADT called a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist (LHRHA).
