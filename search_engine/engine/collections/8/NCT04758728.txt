      analogous of the gravity of subcutaneous ecchymoses and hematomas formation, as a result of
      surgical interventions during open surgery, when the great saphenous vein is being removed.
      Adrenaline (epinephrine) is a potent vasoconstrictor, whose local hemostatic ability has
      already been documented and applied in many medical specialties. Aim of the present study to
      investigate the efficiency of adrenaline (epinephrine) used locally in reducing and avoiding
      post-operative formation of subcutaneous ecchymoses and hematomas, in comparison with
      traditional practice of hemostasis, and to assess improvement in the quality of life of
      subjects undergoing classic great saphenous vein stripping, who received or did not receive
      adrenaline as a local hemostatic.

      Material-Methods 40 subjects diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and/or
      varicose veins of the lower limbs of varied clinical gravity (CEAP classification II & III),
      admitted in the department of Vascular Surgery for open surgical management, i.e. great
      saphenous vein stripping +/- removal of varicosities, will be enrolled after signing an
      informed consent for their participation in the study. They will be then randomized into 3
      separate groups: Group A - great saphenous vein stripping with local adrenaline use for
      hemostasis Group B - great saphenous vein stripping with local normal saline use for
      hemostasis Group C - great saphenous vein stripping with traditional hemostatic practice
      Study subjects will be followed-up after surgery, and in each group measurement of ecchymoses
      (small 2-5mm2 and large >5mm2) and hematomas (medium 0,2-1cm and large >1cm) will be
      performed by using ImageJ software after digital high-resolution photographing on 1st, 8th
      and 14th post-operative days. Quality of life of subjects will be assessed pre-operatively
      and 1 month post-operatively, by using SF-36 and CIVIQ-2 questionnaires for QoL in CVI.
