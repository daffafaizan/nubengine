      the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Behavioral components of impulsivity will be tested
      through delay and probability discounting tasks. Finally, measures of frontotemporal
      functioning are also included in a neuropsychology and neurocognitive battery. Recent studies
      have shown that these areas of the brain function differently in pathological gamblers; thus,
      the following neuropsychology/neurocognitive tests have been included: Attention/Information
      Processing Speed (via Simple Reaction Time Task and Continuous Performance Task), Episodic
      Memory (via Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test),
      Executive/Frontal Lobe Measures (via Wechsler Memory Scale-III, Choice Reaction Time Task,
      Working Memory Task (N-back), Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task, and Stop-Signal Task).
      Between group comparisons on this battery of impulsivity tests will be made to clarify which
      components of impulsivity are associated with pathological gambling. Secondly, within-group
      analyses will be performed to correlate impulsivity to gambling severity. Lastly, an
      exploratory analysis of subtyping pathological gamblers by performances on tasks of
      impulsivity and types of gambling will be conducted.
