implications of gerstmann's syndrome .of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery ofneuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann'ssyndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic braindysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number ofgerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended tobe larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greaterneurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann componentshad associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and thelesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of thepatient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasiain agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling outthe four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is alsoprepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrentdeficits are also separate syndromes .in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved bythe lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere containeda lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and theprobability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area alsoincreased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . withtwo, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were neverrestricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over theparietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency asdysphasia .
