    
      Purpose: This study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in
      cervicovaginal fluids of HIV-infected women, and compare this to the blood plasma
      pharmacokinetics being obtained in the main study, CID 0706.

      Participants: Six HIV-positive women from the CID 0706 study Procedures: During the
      pharmacokinetic visit to obtain blood plasma in the CID 0706 study, women will be asked to
      self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a vaginal aspirator at the following timepoints:
      pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose administration.
