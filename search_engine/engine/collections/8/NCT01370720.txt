      to asymptomatic controls. A significant increase in the number of both mast cells and
      T-lymphocytes in the mucosa of IBS patients have been reported. Electron microscopic studies
      demonstrated that mast cells were more frequently degranulated in IBS, suggesting their
      increased state of activation. Accordingly, an increased mucosal release of preformed
      mediators, such as histamine and tryptase, as well as de novo synthesis and secretion of
      arachidonic acid end products (e.g. prostaglandin E2) have been demonstrated. These mediators
      are known to target sensory nerve pathways, including those innervating the gastrointestinal
      tract, leading to visceral hyperalgesia.

      Electron microscopic studies showed that the mean distance between inflammatory cells and
      enteric nerves is significantly reduced in IBS patients, thus providing a conceptual basis
      for a putative pathogenetic role of low-grade inflammation on sensory-motor dysfunction in
      IBS. Activated mast cells in close proximity to mucosal colonic innervation correlated with
      the frequency and severity of abdominal pain. Evidence that mast cell mediators of IBS
      patients, but not controls, evoked activation of nociceptive sensory afferent neurons are
      available, thus providing a possible mechanism through which mast cells can evoke pain in IBS
      patients. Similar results has been recently reported following the administration into the
      rat colon of supernatants collected from human IBS colonic biopsy samples in culture. This
      nociceptive effect on murine sensory neurons was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors and
      a Protease Activating Receptor-2 antagonist.
