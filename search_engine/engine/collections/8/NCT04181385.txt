    
      Postprandial lipid and hormonal responses are being investigated in up to 15 individuals.
      Participants are their own control in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
      Participants are admitted after an overnight fast. Participants will consume a high-fat drink
      (50g of fat) along with either oral placebo, olanzapine (10mg) or olanzapine (10mg) plus
      bromocriptine (5mg). Study visits occur 2-4 weeks apart with the three treatments applied in
      random order. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and regular intervals after the
      treatments for up to 8 hours to measure glucose, insulin, triglycerides, fatty acids and
      other hormones/metabolites.
