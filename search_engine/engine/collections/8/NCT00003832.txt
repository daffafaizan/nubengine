      I. Measure the potential doubling times of multifocal adenocarcinomas of the prostate using
      broxuridine.

      II. Determine whether the doubling times of multifocal carcinomas occurring within a single
      prostate are consistent with a model in which low-volume carcinomas have slow doubling times
      and high-volume carcinomas have fast doubling times.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive broxuridine IV over 30 minutes on day -1. Approximately 12-96 hours later,
      patients undergo surgery to remove the prostate. Tumor tissue is examined by immunostaining
      for the presence of broxuridine to determine doubling times of the tumor.
