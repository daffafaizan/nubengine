    
      Non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. In-depth qualitative interviews assess attitudes
      and barriers to treatment.

      In Phase 1, potential participants will be pulled from a convenience sample at a Portland
      clinic providing care for the urban area. An initial target sample of 100 Hepatitis C
      positive participants will be enrolled for DBS validation. Power will be reassessed based on
      feedback from receiver operating curve model and additional participants enrolled up to a
      total of 100 Hepatitis C Positive participants, if necessary. A total of 500 potential
      participants can be screened expecting 1 in every 4 participants will be positive HCV.

      In Phase 2, rural peer care coordinators (PCCs) and research assistants recruit up to 200
      PWUD participants from high-needs rural Oregon counties. Study staff specifically target
      untreated populations recruited from local syringe exchange programs and direct community
      outreach (e.g. community barbeques, parks, homeless shelters, food pantries, etc.).
      Participants are encouraged to refer others for study screening.

      A subset of up to 40 study participants will complete in-depth qualitative interviews
      regarding their experiences of hepatitis C treatment.
