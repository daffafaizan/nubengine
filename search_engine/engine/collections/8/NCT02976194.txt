      different features such as polypoidal terminal of new vessels, and relative resistance to
      anti-VEGF treatment. Other cytokines then VEGF are thought to be associated with development
      and progression of the disease. The aim of the this study is to investigate intraocular
      cytokines related to recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Aqueous humor will be
      sampled from the anterior chamber at baseline, after loading injections of ranibizumab and at
      recurrence. The concentration of various cytokines will be measured in the aqueous humor.
