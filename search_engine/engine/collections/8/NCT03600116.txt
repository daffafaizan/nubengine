      with type 1 diabetes with normoglycemia and induced hypoglycemia to determine if there is a
      relationship between VOC signature and hypoglycemia. The investigators will administer an
      insulin injection to provoke mild hypoglycemia and thereby increase the number of breath and
      sweat samples collected under hypoglycemic conditions.
