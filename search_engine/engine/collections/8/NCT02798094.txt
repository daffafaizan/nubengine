      Mental Health Services, and a third, 1.5-hour session at the Queen's MRI Facility. At the
      first session participants will complete a packet of questionnaires about their mood and take
      part in an interview about their mood, medications, drug use, and any other symptoms, as well
      as an interview about their relationships with their parents and any experiences of abuse. At
      the second session participants will participate in a stress test, which involves giving a
      speech to a panel. The investigators will also collect saliva samples to look at stress
      hormones. Participants will also complete a task on the computer that involves looking at
      cartoon faces and making decisions about them. At the third session, the investigators take
      images of of participant's brain using a magnetic resonance scanner.

      Participants are invited to participate in a 6-month follow-up for this study, which would
      involve the same procedure as outline above.
