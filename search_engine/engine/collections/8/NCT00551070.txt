      I. To examine the tumor response rate of patients on AZD6244 (selumetinib sulfate) (NSC
      #748727).

      II. To examine the acute toxicity of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) during the first course of
      treatment using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

      III. To define the pharmacokinetic profile for AZD6244, 100 mg administered orally twice
      daily.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicity of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) using the 21 major categories of the
      CTCAE version 3.0.

      II. To examine the dose and number of courses of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) given. III. To
      estimate the progression free survival, and overall survival of women receiving AZD6244 (NSC
      #748727).

      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation with sequencing of braf, and ras mutation
      analysis and to explore their relationship with tumor response with AZD6244 (NSC #748727).

      II. To examine protein levels of phosphorylated (p)-ERK/ERKERK) and explore their
      relationship with tumor response in patients treated with AZD6244 (NSC #748727).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative and pharmacokinetic
      studies and to analyze selumetinib sulfate peak concentrations and the corresponding peak
      time values. Previously collected archived tumor tissue samples are obtained to determine
      protein levels of p-ERK/ERKERK, DNA isolation and sequencing of BRAF and ras mutation
      analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then once a year for 5 years.
