    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 2-part comparator- and placebo-controlled study
      to evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of TLC590 via a single infiltrative local
      administration in adult subjects following bunionectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of TLC590 for
      post-surgical pain management in subjects following bunionectomy.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and dose-exposure relationship of TLC590,
           as well as the bioavailability as compared with Naropin®.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TLC590 for post-surgical pain management in
           subjects following bunionectomy.

        -  To evaluate the exposure-response relationship between PK parameters and pain intensity.

      The study will be divided into two parts:

      Part 1: Blinded Pharmacokinetics of TLC590 and Naropin®. Approximately 48 subjects will be
      randomized to treatments.

      Part 2: Efficacy and Safety of TLC590 versus bupivacaine and Placebo. Part 2 of the study
      will randomize approximately 150 evaluable subjects who meet all entry criteria.
