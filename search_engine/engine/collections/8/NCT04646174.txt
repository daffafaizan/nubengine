      cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly
      50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high
      rates of co-occurring conditions - nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety - which serve
      as barriers to quitting. The proposed research will develop and pilot test a behavioral
      intervention designed to target the common psychological factors underlying these
      co-occurring conditions and foster smoking cessation among COPD patients. The specific aim is
      to:

      Aim: Examine effects of psychological risk factor reduction on smoking outcome. We will
      conduct a pilot trial in which 62 participants are randomized to the multi-component
      behavioral treatment (9 weekly sessions) or self-guided treatment (mailing of printed
      self-help materials).The primary outcome is number of days abstinent for 2 weeks post-quit
      (range = 0-14 days).
