      who have been pregnant in the last 5 years. These two hospitals both have a provincial role
      in the care of pregnant women, BC Women's as the designated provincial tertiary maternity
      care referral centre, and St. Paul's through its provincial PATCH clinic. Using the data from
      these two centres should capture the majority of LQTS cases in parturients in the province.
      We will search for these women from the Department of Anesthesia BC Women's consult database,
      the St. Paul's Cardiac Obstetrical Care database, and BC Women's Health Records using
      International Classification of Diseases - 10 coding for long QT. Then, after obtaining
      patient consent, review the charts collecting data using the data entry form. The cases will
      then be compared and any conclusions into the different anesthetic managements made.
