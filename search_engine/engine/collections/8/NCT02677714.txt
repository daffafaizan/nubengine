      patients were to be enrolled in the PoC phase of the study to assess the potential of
      99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 in terms of imaging quality, uptake and medical relevance. Based on the
      results of the first 10 patients, the DMC was to decide whether to terminate the study or
      continue to the Phase II and enroll the next 20 planned patients. The maximum study duration
      was 26 (Â±4) weeks per patient (including the screening and follow-up periods).

      The sponsor decided to terminate the study earlier than planned due to strategic decisions to
      focus the AAA development portfolio on oncology theragnostics and not based on safety
      concerns.
