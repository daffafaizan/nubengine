      normalization of blood glucose using a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp technique reduces
      the risk of a composite outcome (one or more) of 30-day postoperative mortality and serious
      postoperative cardiac, renal, neurologic, and infectious postoperative complications in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Our secondary hypothesis is that hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic therapy will reduce length of
      stay in intensive care unit, atrial dysrhythmias, creatinine elevation, hospital readmission,
      all-cause and cardiac one-year mortality.
