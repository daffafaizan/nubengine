4396. effects of arginine deprivation, ultraviolet radiation,and x-radiation on cultured kb cells.  a cytochemical andultrastructural studycultured kb cells (derived from ahuman oral carcinoma) grown in monolayerswere injured by one of three agentsstarvation by arginine deprivation or treatmentwith high doses of either ultravioletradiation or x-radiation.  the different agentsproduced changes in nucleolar structureand varying accumulations of triglycerideand glycogen.  all three agents producedan increase in number and size of lyso-somes.  these were studied in acidphosphatase preparations, viewed by both lightand electron microscopy, and, occasionally,in vital dye, esterase, and aryl sul-fatase preparations.  ultrastructurally,alterations in lysosomes suggested that'residual bodies' developed in a varietyof ways, i.e., from the endoplasmic retic-ulum, multivesicular bodies, or autophagicvacuoles.  following all three agents,the endoplasmic reticulum assumedthe form of 'rough' or 'smooth' whorls, and,after two of the agents, argininedeprivation or ultraviolet radiation, it acquiredcytochemically demonstrable acidphosphatase activity.  near connections betweenthe endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomesraise the possibility that in kb cells, atleast when injured, the endoplasmicreticulum is involved in the formation oflysosomes and the transport of acidphosphatase to them.
