      years died from pneumococcal disease in 2000, making it the leading vaccine-preventable cause
      of death. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines have progressed from 2-valent vaccines to the
      current 23-valent vaccine, which has been available since the early 1980s. The 23-valent
      vaccine includes serotypes accounting for 72% to 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease,
      depending on the geographic area. Many countries have added pneumococcal polysaccharide
      vaccine to their existing national immunization programs or recommended it for people aged 65
      years and older and for individuals aged 2-64 who are at increased risk of pneumococcal
      disease.

      A newly 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was developed with promising safety and
      immunogenicity demonstrated in the phase III trial in China. A large scale, double blind,
      randomized, PNEUMOVAX 23 (Merck & Co., Inc.) controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted.
