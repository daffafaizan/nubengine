      morbidity, functional limitations, pain, and health care costs. Psychosocial interventions
      that target improved symptom control and patient functioning have the potential to improve
      the outcomes of patients with ALBP. This study evaluates a psychosocial intervention designed
      to enhance self-efficacy and social support for patients with ALBP.

      In this randomized, controlled trial, we will randomize eligible patients with ALBP to
      receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention program consists of: (1) patient
      education regarding ALBP; (2) explanations and rationales, in layperson's terms, of
      diagnostic and treatment options for ALBP; (3) discussions regarding the management of
      negative affect (i.e., depression, anger, fear, hostility, anxiety); (4) methods to involve
      social support systems; and (5) strategies to involve the primary care physician to reinforce
      patients' behaviors and progress. We will follow patients for 12 months and assess outcomes
      at 3 and 12 months.

      Primary outcomes are health-related quality of life (i.e., functional status, role function,
      back pain symptoms) and patient satisfaction with care. Secondary outcomes include health
      care use, direct health care costs, self-efficacy, and social support. We will also estimate
      the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      We will conduct this investigation among socioeconomically vulnerable patients with ALBP, a
      group that shoulders a disproportionate burden of disability and morbidity from
      musculoskeletal conditions and comorbid medical conditions.
