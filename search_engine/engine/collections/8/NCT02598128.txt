    
      Protocol ALCT-0000497 consists of three distinct study periods as follows:

        1. In Period A (7 days), subjects will receive Peptamen 1.5 enteral feedings at home.

        2. In Period B (11 days), subjects will be randomized to either Group A (active
           investigational then placebo control) or Group B (placebo control then active
           investigational) and receive Impact Peptide 1.5 on Days 1 and 9. During the 8-day
           washout period between Days 1 and 9, subjects will receive Peptamen 1.5.

        3. In Period C (9 days), subjects will use RELiZORB during nocturnal enteral feedings with
           Impact Peptide 1.5.
