    
      The subject of this clinical investigation is the Continuum Ceramic Bearing THA System in
      primary total hip arthroplasty. This system consists of a cementless modular Trabecular
      Metalâ„¢ (TM) Continuum Acetabular Shell, a modular BIOLOX delta Taper liner, and a modular
      BIOLOX delta femoral head. The characteristics of this THA system may allow for reduction in
      wear and osteolysis as compared to other approved and marketed THA systems and thus increase
      the expected implant life. The study design will be a prospective, multicenter,
      non-comparative post-market study, involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hip arthroplasty
      procedures. A total of 200 patients will be enrolled into the study distributed between 6
      study centres. This number of clinical centers will permit assessment of consistency among a
      multitude of investigators. Follow-up visits will. be performed at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1,2, 3,
      5; 7 and 10 years post-operatively. All potential study subjects will be required to
      participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      The safety and performance of the Implant System will be assessed as following: implant
      survivorship based on revision with removal of the study device; safety based on incidence
      and frequency of adverse events; and Performance will be determined by comparing the overall
      pain and functional performances, survivorship, subject quality-of-life and radiographic
      parameters of study subjects who received the Continuum Ceramic Bearing System.
