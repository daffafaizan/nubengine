      derivative) have all demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium
      avium-intracellulare, a common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS. Further
      information is needed, however, regarding the clinical and pharmacokinetic interaction of
      these drugs used in combination.

      AMENDED 03/10/94 (Part B): Approximately 38 HIV-infected or uninfected subjects are
      randomized to receive azithromycin or rifabutin (Groups 3 and 4) daily for 14 days, followed
      by a combination regimen of both drugs for 4 additional weeks. Patients are followed weekly.
      Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 14, 15, and 42-45.

      ORIGINAL: Sixty-eight patients are randomly assigned to one of four groups (17 patients per
      group). They receive either clarithromycin or azithromycin in combination with rifabutin on
      one of two different dosing schedules. Patients receive medication for 6 weeks and undergo
      follow-up weekly during drug administration and at week 8.
