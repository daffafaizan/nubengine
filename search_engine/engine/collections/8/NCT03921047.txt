      I. Characterize the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients
      before and after receiving hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      II. Identify molecular changes (germline variants and somatic mutations) that contribute to
      shaping the TCR repertoire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patents undergo collection of blood samples before, on day 100, and 1 year after HSCT. Donors
      undergo collection of blood at the time of HSCT for ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based next
      generation sequencing of TCRA and TCRB genes.
