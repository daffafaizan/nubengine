      compared to whites. The cause for this phenomenon is probably multifactorial and includes
      differences in pathogenesis, risk factor patterns, genetic background, behavioral variables,
      strategies for education and prevention, and socioeconomic factors. Recent evidence suggests
      that acceleration of some of the processes related to vascular biology may account for the
      greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease in blacks. A diminished vasodilator response of
      the microvasculature has been shown in African Americans and may therefore be responsible for
      their increased prevalence of hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is a central mechanism in
      the development of atherosclerosis. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that endothelial
      dysfunction of large conductance arteries may also contribute to a greater susceptibility to
      atherosclerosis in blacks compared to whites, even in those individuals without the known
      risk factors for coronary heart disease. In the present study, we propose to investigate
      brachial artery dilation in response to endothelium-dependent and -independent stimuli in
      black and white individuals to determine whether racial differences in the vascular biology
      of large conductance vessels that might contribute to the greater cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality previously reported in blacks.
