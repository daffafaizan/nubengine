      setting is Loyola Medicine's Access to Care Clinic, which serves patients who are low-income
      and uninsured (and often members of racial/ethnic minority groups). The investigators are
      determining whether it is feasible for providers in a low-resourced primary care setting to
      recommend volunteering to their patients, and whether patients who are recommended this
      "treatment" actually do volunteer work (and how much). The investigators are also interested
      in measuring whether volunteering is associated with any potential health benefits,
      specifically well-being and self-esteem.

      Promoting volunteerism is the intervention because research evidence suggests that volunteer
      work may be good for one's health. For example, research shows that volunteering is
      associated with numerous potential health benefits: improved mental health, increased
      physical activity, higher preventive health care utilization, lower cardiovascular risk and
      lower mortality. Besides better health, volunteering also can teach valuable skills, help
      individuals meet others, and foster new relationships.

      Despite all these potential benefits, rates of volunteering are low. Overall, just one in
      four people volunteers. Additionally, people who have lower incomes are less likely to
      volunteer (14% of people with incomes below $20,000 vs. 35% of people with incomes above
      $100,000. And minority groups are less likely to volunteer than whites (just 19% of African
      Americans and 15% of Latinos compared with 26% of Whites).

      Thus, the intervention is aimed to increase volunteer participation rates among groups
      unlikely to volunteer: low-income uninsured persons who are members of racial/ethnic minority
      groups.
