      intervention. In this pilot study we enrolled three participants into a protocol including 10
      rTMS sessions (twice a week for five weeks) and one into a protocol including 15 rTMS
      sessions (three times a week for five weeks). Assessments occurred at pretreatment and at
      posttreatment.
