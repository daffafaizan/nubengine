      has been accepted as a treatment option instead of radical nephroureterectomy for patients
      with low grade, low stage disease. For this reason, information on tumour stage and grade is
      important for a clinical decision. Until now,diagnostic ureterorenoscopy combined with
      histology/cytology is the gold standard. Unfortunately, histology/cytology is often
      inconclusive.

      Optical Coherence Tomography is a new high resolution imaging technique that has potential to
      provide the urologist real time per-operative information of grade and stage of the disease.

      In this study the investigators aim to establish in vivo sensitivity and specificity of OCT
      in the diagnosis of Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma. Secondary objectives are
      inter-observer variability of 1300 nm OCT in the diagnosis of UUT-UC and optical properties
      of cancerous and healthy ureter and collecting system tissue in vivo in humans.
