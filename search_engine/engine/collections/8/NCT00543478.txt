      social and personal function and can diminish quality of life.While the precise
      pathophysiology of IBS remains to be elucidated, dysmotility and altered visceral sensory
      perception are currently the most popular hypothesis. There has been a suggestion that some
      patients with IBS may harbor bacterial overgrowth leading to low grade inflammation, immune
      activation, and their symptoms may be ameliorated by its eradication.Probiotics, defined as
      live or attenuated bacteria or micro organism that confer a significant health benefit to the
      host.

        -  I. Firstly, probiotic organism exert antibacterial and antiviral effects.

        -  II. Probiotics could alter the composition of the gut flora, either directly through
           augmentation of commensal or indirectly through a reduction in pathogen related
           inflammation or bacterial fermentation.

      Trial protocol:

      Phase 1: placebo BID (1 week),both arms Phase 2: Randomization by pharmacy, placebo vs.
      active drug (6 weeks) Phase 3: placebo BID (1 week), both arms

      -III. Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects at mucosal
      surfaces by reducing mucosal inflammation, decreasing immune mediated activation of enteric
      motor and sensory neurons and modifying neural traffic between the gut and central nervous
      system.

      Saccharomyces Boulardii is a probiotic yeast and its role for the treatment of IBS has not
      been extensively investigated.
