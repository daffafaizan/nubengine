    
      This is a single-centre, open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic trial with prucalopride in
      subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. Subjects were classified into one of four
      renal function groups, as defined by a 24-hour creatinine clearance determination (CRCL)
      obtained within 2 weeks before trial entry. Each subject was administered a single 2mg oral
      dose of prucalopride. Plasma samples and complete urine collections were obtained from 0
      through 120 h (6 days) after dosing to characterize the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.
