      vasospastic attacks in patients with secondary Raynaud's. The secondary goal is to document
      increased blood flow and lessened capillary dysfunction in these patients. Both of these
      goals are to be achieved using a course of treatment with Tadalafil.We anticipate a decrease
      in the frequency, duration and severity of Raynaud's attacks. Improved digital blood flow and
      digital blood pressures, and a decrease in digital capillary dysfunction.
