    
      Patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will be randomly allocated to one
      of three groups; Standard of care: Initiate standard of post-resuscitative care including a
      triple lumen catheter to monitor central venous pressure, core temperature maintenance
      between 32C and 34C if unconscious. Fluids, inotropes, vasopressors, vasodilators to maintain
      hemodynamics.

      Low-volume Hemofiltration for 48 hours: Initiate standard of post-resuscitative care
      including a triple lumen catheter to monitor central venous pressure, core temperature
      maintenance between 32C and 34C if unconscious. Hemofiltration x 48 hours via a 11.5F double
      lumen venous catheter, blood flow 250mL/h, ultrafiltration 45mL/kg/h. Fluids, inotropes,
      vasopressors, vasodilators to maintain hemodynamics.

      High-volume Hemofiltration for 48 hours: Initiate standard of post-resuscitative care
      including a triple lumen catheter to monitor central venous pressure, core temperature
      maintenance between 32C and 34C if unconscious. Hemofiltration x 48 hours via 11.5F double
      lumen venous catheter, blood flow 250 mL/h, ultrafiltration 90 mL/kg/h. Fluids, inotropes,
      vasopressors, vasodilators to maintain hemodynamics.

      30 patients will be enrolled.
