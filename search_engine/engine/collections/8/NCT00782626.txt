      Primary

        -  To determine the response of children with chemotherapy-refractory or progressive
           low-grade gliomas to everolimus. Secondary

        -  To evaluate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 3A4 & 3A5 alleles and
           P-glycoprotein/MDR for their influence on the metabolism of everolimus in this patient
           population.

        -  To evaluate the role of Apolipoprotein E genotypes as predictors for development of
           hyperlipidemia during therapy with everolimus.

        -  To assess preliminary correlations of response with changes in pharmacodynamic
           parameters including p70s6 kinase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

        -  To describe the toxicity of everolimus when administered to this patient population.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus when administered to this
           patient population.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a one-stage design to evaluate response to everolimus. If at least 3
      responders are observed in 20 evaluable patients, then everolimus will be considered
      promising. If the true response rate is 5% (null hypothesis), the chance of concluding the
      treatment is active is 0.08 (Type I error). If the true response rate is 25% (alternative
      hypothesis), the chance of concluding the treatment is active is 0.91 (power).
