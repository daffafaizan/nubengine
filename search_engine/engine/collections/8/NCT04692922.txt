      (e.g., clinical factors, neuroimaging, and EEG) in the early phase of severe brain injury
      (i.e., during the acute hospitalization when a patient has impaired consciousness), and
      measuring the patients' recovery of consciousness, function, and quality of life in the late
      phase (at 3, 6, and 12 months following the brain injury), we aim to construct an algorithm
      that synthesizes the results of these metrics to help predict recovery.

      There will also be secondary aims as follows:

        1. To identify patient phenotypes with predictive significance, in order to revise our
           classification scheme for disorders of consciousness in a clinically meaningful and data
           driven manner.

        2. To compare prognostic value between metrics.

        3. To determine how the initial goals of care expressed in the acute setting (i.e., the
           expected quality of life associated with disability) compare to the actual quality of
           life in the chronic setting (i.e., the actual quality of life associated with
           disability).

        4. To compare the prognostic value of metrics between different etiologies of brain injury.
