      patients with mild-to-moderate distress 100% oxygen at 2.0 ATA for 90 minutes on consecutive
      days for a total of up to 5 treatments. A comparison will be made using a historical cohort
      not receiving HBOT. Data will be collected to determine whether or not HBOT is of any benefit
      to COVID-19 positive patient with mild-to-moderate respiratory distress.

      Study Group: Provide 100% oxygen at 2.0 ATA for 90 minutes on consecutive days for a total of
      up to 5 treatment to COVID-19 patients meeting inclusion criteria Control Group: Any COVID-19
      positive patient meeting study inclusion criteria that does not receive HBOT (historical) The
      control group is further defined as patients who were previously treated for COVID-19 at
      Morton Hospital that did not receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This will require accessing
      medical records to obtain patient information to establish the historical control data
      metric.

      Study outcome measures:

        -  Time to normalize 02 requirement (ambient air pulse ox greater than or equal to 92% or
           ABG w/Pa02 greater than 60mmHG on air)

        -  Mortality

        -  Days free of invasive mechanical ventilation
