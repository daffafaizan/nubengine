      During the first study visit, the investigators will compare sweat collected following
      pharmacological stimulation of sweating (using the drug pilocarpine) to sweat collected
      following physiological stimulation of sweating (using a stationary bicycle). During the
      second study visit, the investigators will collect sweat following stimulation of sweating by
      the drug pilocarpine from the inner part of the forearm (near the wrist) and also the upper
      surface of the thigh (near the knee). During the third study visit, the investigators will
      collect sweat following stimulation of sweating by the drug pilocarpine from the inner part
      of both forearms (near the wrist). During the fourth study visit, the investigators will
      collect a sweat sample following stimulation of sweating by the drug pilocarpine from the
      inner part of the forearm (near the wrist) and a blood sample (about one teaspoon) from the
      other arm. After blood and sweat collection, participants will consume 400 mg (two tablets)
      of ibuprofen. The investigators will then collect blood and sweat from 30 minutes, 2 hours
      and 4 hours after participants consume the ibuprofen.
