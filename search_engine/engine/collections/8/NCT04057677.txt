      is the deterioration in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. Periods of disuse
      caused by illness or hospitalization causes rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which
      negatively impact physical function upon re-ambulation. Without adequate rehabilitation,
      physical function does not fully recover in older adults following disuse, reducing the
      quality of life and loss of independence.

      In this study, participants will enter a 10-day strictly controlled bed rest intervention at
      the Translational Research Institute (TRI) clinical research unit. Participants are
      randomized to either a progressive 4-week aerobic and resistance training recovery program at
      the exercise training or an ambulatory recovery group.

      The overall objective of this project is to determine how an exercise intervention can aid in
      recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function following bed rest in older adults
      with T2D.
