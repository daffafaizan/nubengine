        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of epirubicin and
           irinotecan in patients with advanced cancer.

        -  Determine the objective antitumor responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour followed by epirubicin IV over 5 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Sequential dose escalation of epirubicin is followed by sequential dose escalation of
      irinotecan. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin and irinotecan
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
