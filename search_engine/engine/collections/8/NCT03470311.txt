      signalling, and inducing apoptosis in cells with an IL-5receptor. Hence, for patients who
      remain 'uncontrolled' on anti-IL-5 therapy (with detectable eosinophil activity and IL5-RÎ±+
      cells in the airways), the investigators believe would benefit from a strategy that not only
      reduces eosinophil proliferation/recruitment/maturation, but also depletes cells capable of
      inducing downstream IL-5 signalling.
