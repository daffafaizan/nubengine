      anesthesia workstations. Therefore the investigators planned an an experimental study on
      healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of a simple method on preoxygenation.

      Healthy volunteers are randomized in cross-over between spontaneous breathing with the APL
      valve on spontaneous position or spontaneous breathing with the APL valve on 5 cmH2O or CPAP
      mode with 5 cmH2O PEEP.

      The volunteers will breath through an anesthesia face mask. The fresh gas flow rate is 12
      L/min, inspiratory fraction of oxygen is 100%. The exhaled gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide)
      are monitored. The inspiratory and end expiratory fraction of oxygen will be recorded every
      10 seconds.

      The primary endpoint is the time to achieve end expiratory fraction of oxygen of 90% or
      more.The secondary endpoint is the proportion of subject with end expiratory fraction of
      oxygen of 90% or more after a 3 min period and the end expiratory fraction of oxygen at the
      third minute.
