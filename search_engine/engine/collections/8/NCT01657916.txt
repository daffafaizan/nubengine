      slings in patients who were only receiving this operation. Very few studies have outcomes at
      5 years of greater. The aim of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate five-year
      objective and subjective cure rates. Secondary endpoints will assess failure risk factors and
      describe any complications of the retropublic Align Urethral Support System five years
      postoperatively.
