    
      In summary, the aim of the study is to examine the effect of the immunosuppressive agent
      Everolimus (Certican) on the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).

      Therefore the study is divided in three sections:

      Substudy 1: Evaluation of morphological differences between between CAD and CAV.

      Substudy 2: Analysis of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension) under a specific
      immunosuppressive protocol in patients with CAV.

      Substudy 3: Prospective, randomized analysis of the influence of different immunosuppressive
      protocols in patients with CAV.

      Primary endpoint of the study will be the adaption of intimal thickness after 10 years,
      analysed by means of optical coherence tomography.

      In addition to the explanations above the most important in- and exclusion criteria are
