      fluid challenge of 3ml/Kg" provides information about fluid responsiveness namely increased
      cardiac output. This new test will be compared to "gold standard" that is, "the stroke volume
      variation after standard fluid challenge of 15ml/Kg". It is the evaluation of the diagnostic
      accuracy of a diagnostic test based on an index obtained by transthoracic cardiac
      echocardiography for diagnosing fluid responsiveness. This index is the stroke volume
      variation measured by transthoracic cardiac echography.

      The study will include anesthetized patients undergoing scheduled surgery. For hemodynamic
      optimization, these patients will benefit, early after anaesthetic induction, before the
      surgical procedure has started, from a fluid challenge of 15ml/kg achieved in two stages (3
      ml/Kg then 12 ml/kg) separated by an interval of one minute. Three-time hemodynamic will be
      analyzed.

        -  T0: basal

        -  T1: one minute after first vascular filling with 3ml/Kg in 2 minutes

        -  T2: one minute after second vascular filling with 12 ml/Kg in 8 minutes which is
           performed one minute after the end of the first filling (a total of 15 ml/kg)

      At each time, we will retrieve a collection of hemodynamic data (stroke volume, cardiac
      output) obtained by transthoracic echocardiography, standard method to assess fluid
      responsiveness. And at the same times, the PVI and hemodynamic parameters obtained by
      esophageal Doppler will be noted.
