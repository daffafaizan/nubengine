      trial. Patients will be randomized prior to treatment, to which the examiner will be blinded.
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline and 3 months after treatment has been
      completed. At the time of recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria checklist, informed
      consent and baseline measurements will be obtained and recorded. Medical history will be
      updated and radiographs will be reviewed or taken. During the second appointment,
      conventional scaling and root planing will be performed in the corresponding quadrant; during
      the third appointment, laser therapy will be conducted, 1 month after, during the forth
      appointment, a follow up (no measurements) will be scheduled with provider, and 3 months
      after scaling completion, measurements will be taken and periodontal maintenance performed.
      Patient will receive home care instructions at every visit and will fill out a visual
      analogue scale at baseline, 1 month and 3 month visit.
