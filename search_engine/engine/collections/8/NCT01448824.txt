    
      This study is a 2-part, multiple ascending dose (MAD) and drug drug interaction (DDI) study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability and the effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition
      by ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of LY2484595 in healthy participants.

      In the MAD portion (Part 1) of this study, participants in 4 cohorts (Cohorts A through D)
      will be randomized to receive either LY2484595 (5 ascending dose levels [100 to 1800 mg]) or
      placebo. Cohorts will have staggered starts ≥7 days from the previous cohort to allow for
      review of safety and tolerability. The total duration of Part 1 is approximately 13 weeks
      including screening.

      Participants in Cohort A will participate in 2 periods separated by a washout period lasting
      ≥14 days. During Period 1, participants will receive the starting dose of LY2484595 (100 mg)
      or placebo once daily (QD) for 14 consecutive days. During Period 2, participants will
      receive the highest dose of LY2484595 (1800 mg) or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days.
      Participants will complete a follow-up visit ≥14 days after the last dose of study drug.

      Participants in Cohorts B, C, and D will receive LY2484595 (300, 600, and 1200 mg LY2484595,
      respectively) or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days followed by a follow-up visit ≥14 days
      after last dose of study drug.

      The DDI portion of this study (Part 2) will be open label and consist of 2 periods. The total
      duration of Part 2 is approximately 10 weeks. LY2484595 (100 mg) will be administered on Day
      1 of Period 1 and on Day 5 of Period 2. In Period 2, ketoconazole (400 mg) will be
      administered QD for 14 consecutive days (13 days alone [Days 1 through 4 and 6 through 14] +
      1 day with LY2484595 [Day 5]). There will be a ≥14-day washout period between dosing during
      Period 1 and Period 2. Participants will return for a follow-up visit ≥14 days after last
      dose of study drug.
