    
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue that can convert chemical energy directly
      into heat due to the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein. Data from preclinical
      studies shows that glucocorticoids (GCs) inhibit the function of BAT. In clinical practice
      GCs are often administered due tue their antiinflammatory properties making the investigation
      of short term (e.g. one week) and long therm (several months) effects practically relevant.
      This study's objective is to evaluate the effect of glucocorticoid treatment on cold induced
      thermogenesis (CIT) in humans.
