    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of brain tissue oxygen saturation
      monitoring will lead to a reduction of the intra-operative use of packed red cell units.

      Patients randomly allocated to groups A and B. In group A INVOS monitoring available. In
      group B, no access to INVOS for the attending anesthesiologist. An "observer"
      anesthesiologist has access to INVOS and provides information if it is considered necessary.

      For BOTH GROUPS:

      During CBP and before aortic unclamping, PRC not to be given if hemoglobin is >7g/dl. For
      values less than 5.5g/dl, one unit of PRC is transfused and the patient is reevaluated. After
      weaning from CPB and retransfusion of the salvaged shed blood, transfusion when hemoglobin is
      <8g/dl. During ICU stay, transfusion when hemoglobin is <8g/dl. Between 8-10g/dl evaluation
      for transfusion in a multimodal manner.

      For GROUP A:

      As above and during CBP and before aortic unclamping, if hemoglobin is between 5.5-7g/dl,
      transfusion when INVOS is less than 60%.

      For GROUP B:

      As above and during CBP and before aortic unclamping, if hemoglobin is between 5.5-7g/dl,
      decision for transfusion is taken by the attending anesthesiologist (judgment).
