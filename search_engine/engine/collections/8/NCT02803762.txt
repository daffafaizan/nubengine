    
      The present study is designed to investigate the absorption, metabolism, excretion as well as
      safety/tolerability of pacritinib following the administration of a single oral dose to
      healthy male volunteers. The pacritinib dose is administered with a [14C]-labeled form to
      enable detection and quantitation of dose-related material independent of possible
      biotransformation. The study design allows detection of potential human specific metabolites
      that have not been detected in the animal species. Subjects are confined at the clinical site
      from the time of Check-in until Day 14 post-dose, but may be discharged from the clinical
      site between Day 10 and 13 post-dose if study discharge criteria are met (i.e. completion of
      sufficient radioactivity excretion). All remaining subjects will be discharged from the
      clinical site on Day 14 post-dose irrespective of the study discharge criteria. The data
      obtained in this study will be used for the further clinical development of the compound.
