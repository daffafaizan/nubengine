      treatments.

      The investigators will apply different imaging methods to investigate the effects of
      antidepressive interventions on resting state neural activity, functional activiation during
      cognitive and emotional stimulation, neurotransmitter concentrations as well as
      concentrations of brain- derived neurotrophic factor.

      The investigators hypothesize that antidepressive interventions modulate the excitatory
      glutamatergic system and thereby increase either the concentration of glutamate or the
      glutamate/ glutamine ratio. These metabolic changes are accompanied by altered functional
      activation in medial and lateral prefrontal areas during emotional and cognitive stimulation,
      respectively. After longterm treatment, excitatory glutamate and inhibitory
      gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations adapt to a new homeostatic level which is reflected in
      antidepressive response or remission of symptoms. The investigators assume that the levels of
      glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid determine the amplitude of BOLD responses during
      emotional and cognitive stimulation. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the
      plasma concentration of brain- derived neurotrophic factor might be a predictor for therapy
      response and changes in the course of treatment.
