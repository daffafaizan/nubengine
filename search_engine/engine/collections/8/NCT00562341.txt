      morbidly obese men require correction due to the obesity itself. Secondary outcome measures
      that will be followed include the affect of obesity and weight loss on testosterone,
      estradiol and leptin. In as much as these might also affect PSA, we will be measuring these
      values as well. Also, we do not know the effects of lap-band induced weight loss on clinical
      outcome measures of sexual, bowel and urinary function. Thus we will aim to investigate these
      parameters as well.
