    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved lamivudine for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the effects of lamivudine on this type
      of cancer. This drug may help prevent the growth and spread of the cancer cells to other
      parts of the body. The investigators have discovered that this particular type of colon
      cancer, which has a p53 mutation may be sensitive to treatment with lamivudine by impairing
      the ability of the cancer cells to grow.
