      fourth most common retinal disease after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
      retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. In a population-based retrospective cohort and case
      control study in Olmsted county, Minnesota, USA, Kitzmann et al4 reported a mean age-adjusted
      incidence of 9.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-12.4) per 100, 000 in men, and 1.7 (95% CI
      0.7-2.7) in women. The mean age of onset of CSCR appears between 41 and 45 years5. The
      disease affects various racial groups5-8 and occasionally can be familial9. The pathogenesis
      remains poorly understood and currently the exudation is thought to result from
      hyper-permeable choroid secondary to venous stasis, ischemia, or inflammation2. Because of
      lack of proper animal models and lack of definite cure, clinical research has focused on risk
      factors such as stress, corticosteroid intake, and type A personality. Different
      hospital-based studies yielded different risk factors. Epidemiologic studies failed to
      ascertain many of these risk factors. Due to different methodology (retrospective vs.
      prospective case-control studies; selection of controls; questionnaire vs. interview by
      physician assistant vs. interview by physician) and focus on single risk factors in the
      literature, the investigators designed a study that targets a vast number of known or
      potential risk factors in various collaborative centers and compare it to results reported in
      the literature.
