    
      An open label, post-market, non-randomised, historical controlled, multi-centre study of the
      outcomes of the Triathlon Cruciate Retaining (CR) Total Knee System. The primary objective of
      this study will be to compare the active range of motion values for the Triathlon CR Total
      Knee System with those of the Scorpio CR Total Knee System, a historical control group. ROM
      values will be measured by use of a Goniometer according to the protocol. It is expected that
      the Triathlon CR Total Knee System group's range of motion is not 5 degrees worse or superior
      to the control group's range of motion at two-years.
