      sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma. The fluorescence surgery consists in a
      injection of indocyanine green around the primary tumor, or, when already excised (excisional
      biopsy), the biopsy site at the beginning of the surgery. Patient performs, in a standard
      fashion, the lymph scintigraphy prior the surgery and is injected at the same time a blue die
      similarly the indocyanine green. Immediately after the indocyanine infusion, the injection
      site is massaged and a near infra red light (NIR) is focused over it. An appropriated infra
      red camera is positioned over the lymphatic pathway, searching for the fluorescence and
      localizing the sentinel node at the basin. The skin is opened and the sentinel node is
      resected. The success or not in localizing the sentinel node is pointed and the standard
      techniques are applied - gamma probe and surgical location of a blue lymph node. All sentinel
      node characteristics are noted as number, which technic identified it, time, location. Later
      information will be gathered as histological status, surgical complications, recurrence and
      survival.
