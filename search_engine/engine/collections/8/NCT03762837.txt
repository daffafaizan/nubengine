      for gallbladder cancer include gallstones, gallbladder polyps, gallbladder adenomas, chronic
      inflammation of the gallbladder, etc. However, recently, there is still a lack of evaluation
      data on relevant risk factors. Therefore, on the basis of large-scale epidemiological
      investigations, large-scale prospective studies are needed to further clarify the level of
      risk factors associated with gallbladder cancer. With the development of modern imaging
      technology and deep understanding of gallbladder diseases, the detection rate of benign
      gallbladder lesions (cacerous polyps, gallbladder adenomyosis, gallbladder adenoma,
      gallstones, etc.) has increased year by year, and some benign gallbladder lesions can pass A
      series of pathophysiological processes have gradually evolved into gallbladder cancer. This
      study aimed to establish a prospective cohort of benign gallbladder disease, to explore the
      correlation, intervention time and socioeconomic benefits of benign gallbladder disease and
      gallbladder cancer. In order to further understand the current trend and diagnosis and
      treatment of benign gallbladder disease in China, the Chinese Society of Surgery Branch of
      the Chinese Society of Surgery will launch a national epidemiological survey of gallbladder
      cancer (2018). This study will provide a more detailed basis for the diagnosis and treatment
      of benign gallbladder disease in China.
