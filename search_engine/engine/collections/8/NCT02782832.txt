      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, umbilical and inguinal hernia repair.
      Inclusion period was from 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2015. All patients received general anesthesia
      using propofol (2 mg/kg) and remifentanil (1 μg/kg/min) for induction. In patients where
      tracheal intubation was required, this was done without use of neuromuscular blocking drug;
      otherwise a proseal laryngeal mask was used. For the maintenance of anesthesia, additional
      continuous infusion of propofol (3-5 mg/kg/h) and remifentanil (0.3-0.5 μg/kg/min) was used.
      Data were derived from a prospective local database on demographics, anesthetic methods and
      supplements (i.e. need for neuromuscular blockade) and postoperative needs for supplementary
      analgesics besides the postoperative standard analgesic regimen, number of hours stayed in
      the ambulatory surgery department, and discharge rate (including reasons for hospital
      admittance).
