      squares design. To maintain blinding, subjects will be required to ingest eight capsules with
      approximately 240 mL water on each study drug administration day.

      Serial pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations will be conducted up to 24 hours after each study
      drug administration. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be obtained to confirm exposure to
      EB-1020. Safety monitoring will include recording of adverse events (AEs), regular
      assessments of vital signs measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and
      continuous telemetry monitoring for at least 3 hours after study drug administration.
