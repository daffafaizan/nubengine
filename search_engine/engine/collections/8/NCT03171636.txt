      clinical-prognostic correlations has been extensively studied in many populations. Few
      Brazilian studies evaluating mutational status in NSCLC has been done so far, none of then
      explored the regional background nor have considered the quantitative analysis of mutant cell
      in each sample. Quantitative analysis of the tumor maybe relevant for treatment design for
      positive samples, p.e a tumor with 90% of mutant clones versus a 15% of mutant clones, which
      can be obtained currently by the method of pyrosequencing. In this study, investigators will
      assess EGFR and KRAS status through the pyrosequencing quantitative technique, and will also
      correlate these with clinical-pathological variables among both adenocarcinoma and squamous
      cell histological subtypes. So far, no study that have made this correlation is available.
