      especially females and searched for presence or absence of associating anti-thyroid
      antibodies with controversial results .

      isotretinoin or radiotherapy on thyroid pathologies and dysfunction .

      Global Acne Severity Scale (GAGS) is a simple, accurate, fast method for the determination of
      severity of acne, and it requires no special equipment and is relatively cost-effective. Its
      personal and interpersonal differences is low and it was first used by Doshi and his
      colleagues in 1997 in USA .

      patients of different age categories and correlating thyroid function with other important
      patient and acne variables as body mass index (BMI) , age (starting from 16 years) , acne
