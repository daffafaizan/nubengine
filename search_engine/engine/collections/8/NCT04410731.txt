    
      Phase I prospective study to determine the safety and feasibility of allogeneic,
      culture-expanded BM-MSCs in subjects with painful facet-mediated low back pain. Target
      accrual is 10 subjects with diagnosis of painful lumbar facet joint arthropathy. Eligible
      subjects will receive a single set of intra-articular bilateral injections of allogeneic,
      culture-expanded BM-MSCs human, allogeneic, culture expanded, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, treatment day 0, post-operative day 1,
      post-operative days 3-5, week 2, and months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment.
