      diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part 1 consists of four cohorts with multiple ascending doses of
      insulin Tregopil and comprises a sentinel dosing design. Part 2 consists of a randomised,
      2-treatment, crossover design with mixed meal tests (MMTs) of different compositions followed
      by parallel design titrated treatment period. Both parts include dosing during an in-house
      period and during a subsequent outpatient period.
