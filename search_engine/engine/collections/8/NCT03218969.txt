      ecopipam for subjects with augmented Restless legs syndrome (RLS). Investigators will recruit
      10 subjects taking dopamine agonists for RLS who are currently experiencing augmentation. The
      goal is to have 8 completers. There is no power analysis as this is an exploratory study and
      there is no previous data on treatment of augmentation. "Meaningful improvement" is not even
      established. A safety analysis will be done after 5 subjects have been enrolled. Duration of
      study and is based mostly on contracted drug availability for this pilot study.
