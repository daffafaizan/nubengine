      angina symptoms who are referred to the Amsterdam University Medical Centers will be screened
      for potential inclusion in the registry. Patients will be eligible for inclusion in the
      registry after consideration of in- and exclusion criteria. Subsequently patients will be
      approached for study participation. Patients can freely withdraw informed consent to
      participate in the study at any time.
