      based upon pathoanatomy, symptom irritability, and impairment identification, but the
      reliability and validity of classifying patients by symptom irritability is unknown.

      Purpose Examine the reliability and use of the shoulder symptom irritability classification
      system for the purposes of determining an appropriate treatment intensity.

      Design Prospective repeated-measures single-blinded design to determine reliability and a
      cross-sectional design will be utilized to aid in determining construct validity.

      Methods Twenty-five (25) raters will be trained to make paired ratings in 90 subjects with
      primary complaints of shoulder pain. Raters will record the shoulder symptom irritability
      level and also select the appropriate intervention intensities for the subjects. Raters will
      also be asked to choose anticipated interventions for subjects.

      Data Analysis Prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted Kappa for ordinal scales (PABAK-OS) will be
      the primary measure of reliability. Dependent upon the distribution of the data, other forms
      of Kappa may be utilized to analyze the data most appropriately. To determine differences in
      reliability between groups with and without clinical specialization, an independent t test
      will be utilized with Î± = 0.05. Lastly, analysis of variance with post-hoc analysis will be
      used to compare functional disability across different levels of irritability.

      Significance This study addresses key gaps in the understanding of symptom irritability and
      how it relates to clinical decision making. It is expected that symptom irritability should
      logically drive intervention selection and intensity of rehabilitation interventions.
