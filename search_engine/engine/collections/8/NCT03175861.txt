      individualization of pulmonary stereotactic radiotherapy treatments and the selection of
      patients at high risk of relapse, who could then benefit from a dose escalation in order to
      increase the chances of local control .

      Beyond the pulmonary RTS (Radiotherapy in stereotactic condition), this study will aim to
      generate one or more models of multi-scale response to hypofractionated irradiation from
      biomarkers (biological or images) extracted from preclinical or clinical literature data and
      to allow simulations of Various modified fractionation irradiation schemes, potentially
      leading to new regimens that reduce side effects and increase therapeutic efficacy.
