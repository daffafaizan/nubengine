    
      SORT OUT VII is a randomized, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial
      comparing the sirolimus eluting ORSIRO stent to the biolimus-eluting NOBORI stent in treating
      atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions.

      Primary Endpoint:

      Target lesion failure within 12 months of stent implantation (combination of cardiac death,
      myocardial infarction (not index procedure related) not related to other than index lesion or
      target lesion revascularization).

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Individual components of the primary end point comprised the secondary end points and stent
      thrombosis rate according to the Academic Research Consortium definition (see protocol for
      further specification of secondary endpoints).

      Clinically driven event detection will be used to avoid study-induced reinterventions. Data
      on mortality, hospital admission, coronary angiography, repeat percutaneous coronary
      intervention, and coronary bypass surgery will be obtained for all randomly allocated
      patients from the following national Danish administrative and healthcare registries: the
      Civil Registration System; the Western Denmark Heart Registry; the Danish National Registry
      of Patients, which maintains records on all hospitalizations in Denmark; and the Danish
      Registry of Causes of Death

      Inclusion criteria:

      at least 18 years old chronic stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes at
      least one coronary artery lesion with more than 50% diameter stenosis requiring treatment
      with a drug-eluting stent

      Exclusion criteria:

      life expectancy of less than one year allergy to aspirin, clopidogrel, sirolimus, or biolimus
      participation in another randomized trial nability to provide written informed consent
