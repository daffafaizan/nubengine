      anesthesia induction and for apneic unconscious patients. One-handed E-C clamp mask holding
      technique, two-handed mask ventilation with jaw thrust, and two-handed mask ventilation with
      triple airway maneuver are three common airway management maneuvers. However, the efficiency
      of ventilation between these three maneuvers has to be clarified. Besides, whether sniffing
      position or neutral position may improve ventilation between these three maneuvers is to be
      determined. The investigators will collect airway parameters of the patients receiving
      general anesthesia and measure the expired tidal volume, airway pressure, EtCO2 slope and
      hemodynamic change between these three maneuvers during anesthesia induction.
