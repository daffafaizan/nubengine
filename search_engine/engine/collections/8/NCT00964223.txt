    
      Multi-center, single-blind, randomized, comparative, split-face study. The duration of the
      study is 8 weeks and consists of a baseline visit and visits at weeks 1, 2, 5 and 8.
      Commencing at baseline, subjects will apply once daily both clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide
      gel and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene gel in a bilateral split-face fashion (allocation to left
      and right side randomly assigned) for an initial 2 weeks. After visit 3 subjects will
      commence application of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide gel to the entire face for an
      additional 6 weeks.

      Blinding This is an investigator-blinded study; therefore, subjects and study-center staff
      will not be blinded to study treatment allocation (ie, left vs. right side application).
      During the first 2 weeks, the investigator will be unaware of which study product is being
      used on either side of the face. Subjects and study-center staff will be instructed not to
      reveal study treatment allocation to the investigator. Subjects will be instructed not to use
      study product in the presence of the investigator.
