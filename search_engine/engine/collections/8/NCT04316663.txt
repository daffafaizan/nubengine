      well-being has often been neglected and most interventions for sleep improvement have focused
      primarily on sleep disorders. This approach is limited to those individuals who have specific
      conditions and little resources have been directed to the promotion of sleep quality in the
      general population.

      This study will be a pilot parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial to assess the baseline
      associations between psychological well-being and different measures of sleep outcomes,
      determine the effect of elements of a psychological well-being promoting intervention on
      sleep quality, and examine effect size estimates of key sleep-related outcomes (duration,
      efficiency, quality) to provide essential data to inform a main efficacy trial.
