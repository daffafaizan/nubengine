    
      Background: Studies addressing the clinical performance of the Siemens Healthineers
      High-Sensitivity Troponin I assay (TnIH) on the Atellica IM analyzer for the diagnosis and
      rule out of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in consecutive patients
      presenting to a United States (US) emergency department are lacking.

      Study objective: Examine the analytical and clinical performance of Atellica IM TnIH assay
      for the diagnosis and rule out of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in
      patients presenting to the emergency department in whom serial cTnI measurements are obtained
      on clinical indication.

      Hypothesis: The Atellica IM TnIH assay will offer an excellent diagnostic performance for
      acute myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction, as well as expedite the risk
      stratification of patients for early discharge from the emergency department.
