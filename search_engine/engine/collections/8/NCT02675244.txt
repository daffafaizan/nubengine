      the right atrium. TR is a condition where the valve does not close fully when it is supposed
      to and blood can then leak back into the right atrium. When TR becomes severe, surgery is
      usually performed to correct it. The purpose of the research is to determine whether
      repairing a tricuspid valve in patients with mild to moderate TR, at the time of planned
      mitral valve surgery, would improve the heart health of those who receive it compared to
      those who do not. There are no new or "experimental" procedures being tested in this study:
      both the mitral valve procedure and the tricuspid valve repair procedure are well established
      surgeries and are regularly performed together in patients who have severe TR. The available
      evidence addressing this issue is not definite: it is based on less rigorous methods of
      investigation, and the results have been conflicting. The study being proposed here will use
      rigorous scientific methods and should result in a very high level of certainty about what
      surgical treatment is best for patients with your condition.

      This study will enroll people scheduled for mitral valve surgery with mild to moderate
      tricuspid regurgitation.
