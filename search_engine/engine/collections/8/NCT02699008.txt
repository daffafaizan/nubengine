      with clopidogrel and aspirin were included. in the 3-5th day after prescription of
      clopidogrel, platelet function were tested simultaneously by three methods: MPAADP by Light
      transmittance aggregometry（LTA）, MAADP by Thrombelastography (TEG) ,and CTP2Y by Innovance
      PFA-200 . According to three result（Two of three or all three results higher than cutoff
      value was identified as HPR, MPALTA>50%;MAADP>47mm;CTP2Y<106s）.Patients was defined as
      HPR(n=125) or unHPR(n=232), HPR patients were divided into HPR-Ticagrelor(HPR-T)and
      HPR-Clopidogrel(HPR-C) randomized. HPR-T group(n=77) patients' antiplatelet agents changed to
      ticagrelor, both unHPR and HPR-C groups keep unchanged(Clopidogrel). The major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE) were recorded during 1 year Follow-up.
