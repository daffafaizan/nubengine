      catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue.
      Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for delivery of the
      ASCs therapy.

      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected mainly from the patient's abdomen using a
      liposuction cannula. The adipose tissue may be collected from other areas if necessary The
      adipose tissue is transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue-derived
      stem cells, which are then transferred to an injection/infusion catheter for delivery into
      the akinetic myocardial scar in the region of a previous infarct
