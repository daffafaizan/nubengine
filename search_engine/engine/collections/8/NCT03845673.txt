      UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas from July 2003 to July 2005 were screened for
      symptoms of constipation. Subjects were randomized to a 6-week course of either psyllium
      (Konsyl, Konsyl Pharmaceuticals, Easton, MD) or a special bowel recipe. The bowel recipe was
      a modification of that used by Behm and consisted of 1 cup of unprocessed wheat bran, 1 cup
      of applesauce, and 1/4 cup of prune juice. A validated constipation scoring questionnaire12
      was administered to participants at the beginning and at the end of the six-week study
      period. During the six-week trial patients also kept a bowel diary recording characteristics
      of each bowel movement.
