      lung cancer is nonsquamous NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) is a effective
      first-line treatment for EGFR mutations non-squamous NSCLC treatment.Icotinib is the first
      EGFR-TKI,and have been proved efficiently in the treatment of lung cancer, and SBRT become a
      main therapy for the primary lesion,Accordingly, we have come to a scientific hypothesis that
      icotinib combination with SBRT might be a better treatment strategy for stageIV non-squamous
      NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation. It can improve the PFS of stage ⅢB/Ⅳ non-squamous NSCLC
      patients with EGFR mutation . The primary endpoint is disease-free time to progression (PFS).
      The secondary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate
      (DCR),overall survival(OS) safety and quality of life (QOL). Through this study lay the
      foundation for further exploration of the non-squamous NSCLC first-line treatment in patients
      with EGFR mutation strategy.
