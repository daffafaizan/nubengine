      Participants will be randomized to 1 year of treatment with L1/DFO combination therapy or DFO
      monotherapy. At baseline, 6 months, and 1 year on therapy, cardiac function will be assessed
      by MRI measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), T2*, Holter monitoring, and
      electrocardiography. Additional monitoring for safety includes weekly blood testing, monthly
      visits, and periodic eye and ear exams.
