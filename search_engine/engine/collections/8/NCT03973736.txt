    
      Since 2012 in Reggio Emilia a new diagnostic and therapeutic protocol has been implemented
      including multidisciplinary team discussion of non-metastatic PDACs and radiological review
      of CT scans by an experienced radiologist.

      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of this new protocol on the occurrence of
      surgical failures, including incomplete resection or surgery in which resection resulted
      impossible at all. The investigators also describe the changes in overall survival and
      process indicators such as the proportion of patients referred to different therapeutic
      options (upfront surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and no surgery) and the compliance with
      referral.

      Through a population-based cohort study, the investigators evaluated the impact of the new
      protocol on therapeutic management and surgical outcome of patients with non-metastatic PDAC
      by comparing two four-years periods, respectively 2008-2011 and 2013-2016, before and after
      the introduction of the protocol. Since 2012 was the transitional year when the protocol was
      introduced, patients diagnosed with PDAC in 2012 were excluded.
