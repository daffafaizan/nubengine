      given for seven days and to also look at the safety of oral acyline.

      Acyline temporarily blocks the production of the hormone testosterone in healthy men. It has
      been tested in over 100 men in an injection form. This study will be testing acyline in a
      pill form for seven days.

      This study may help develop an oral form of testosterone-blocker which may be useful in the
      treatment of diseases such as prostate cancer, premature puberty and possibly in a male
      contraceptive.

      This study will evaluate a single dose of oral acyline given once a day for seven days and
      subsequent effects on Testosterone, FSH and LH blood serum concentrations.
