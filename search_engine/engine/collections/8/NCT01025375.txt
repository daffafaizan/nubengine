      soluble dietary fibres, such as inulin, is hypothesized to be more satiating, and to limit
      energy intake, in humans. Does supplementation of inulin (at 2 dosages) versus placebo over
      13 consecutive days in normal to overweight men and women, lead to an increase in satiety, a
      reduction in food intake and stronger postprandial increases in GLP-1 and PYY?
