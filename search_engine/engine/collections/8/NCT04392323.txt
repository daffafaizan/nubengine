      pause in all elective surgeries [1-6]. Multiple healthcare systems and surgical societies
      recommended ceasing all elective procedures until this crisis is contained [7-10]. As such,
      it will be necessary for hospitals to restructure as surgeries increase to protect surgical
      patients from becoming infected. Our study will be the first to define the test conversion
      rate of those undergoing surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information
      gathered from this study can have implications in how surgical centers treat patients during
      and after this pandemic.

      There has been a single study examining postoperative nosocomial infections during the
      initial incubation period in which 100% of patients developed Sars-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, 14
      (44%) required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation, and 7 (20.5%) died after ICU
      admission [11]. A second cohort of bariatric surgery patients found that 4 of 4 (100%)
      developed Sars-CoV-2 infections postoperatively with all patients surviving [12]. Another
      retrospective study found that of 305 patients admitted to the digestive surgery service, 15
      (4.9%) developed nosocomial Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia [13]. Of this cohort, two patients died, and
      seven were hospitalized with six discharged at the time of chart review. Another
      retrospective non-operative hospital cohort found that 34 of 102 adult patients contracted
      Sars-CoV-2 as a nosocomial infection. In a review of Gynecologic Oncology procedures in Wuhan
      the overall nosocomial infection rate was 1.59% (3/189) with two of the three patients being
      discharged by the publication date [14]. However, in a retrospective review of a general
      hospital ward in Hong Kong in which the staff used 'vigilant basic infection control
      measures' 10 patients and 7 staff members that met the definition for close contact were
      identified and through contact tracing 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts with no
      Sars-CoV-2 infections identified [15]. Another cohort from Wuhan demonstrated that when
      performing regional anesthesia (45/49 for Cesarean Section), no anesthetists were infected
      when complying with level 3 PPE [16].
