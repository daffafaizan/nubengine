    
      This is a pilot intra-patient comparative study to evaluate the ability of cyclic
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) using Red (635 nm) or Blue (400 nm) light with 5-Aminolevulinic
      acid, to eliminate BCC skin cancers that occur in patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome
      (Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome).

      Patients will receive 3 cycles of Red light and Blue light PDT treatments, for a total of 6
      treatments, over a 4 month period. Cycles will be spaced 2 months apart. Each cycle consists
      of a double course of PDT treatment with treatments spaced one week apart. Every subject will
      be treated with two light sources, blue and red, according to randomized assignments made to
      left side or right side of the body. There will be a final assessment visit at month 6.
