      head and neck cancers. Swallowing becomes difficult when radiation damage induces
      inflammation (with swelling and pain) in the inner covering tissues of the throat and muscles
      that involve in the swallowing process. Currently, supportive measures are used to manage
      this symptom while waiting for the tissue damages to heal. In some patients, the inflamed
      muscles develop scar tissues causing long-term swallowing difficulty and narrowing of the
      swallowing passage. Needle acupuncture may help to reduce tissue inflammation and may lessen
      the severity of swallowing difficulty. However, needle puncture is often not desired by
      patients. Acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ALTENS) is like
      acupuncture treatment, but the acupuncture points are stimulated with mild electrical
      stimulation without needles, simplifying treatment delivery. This study is to examine if a
      pre-selected set of acupuncture points treated using ALTENS can reduce swallowing difficulty.
      There will be a total of 12 treatments given over 6 to 8 weeks. Changes in severity of
      swallowing difficult after treatment will be assessed using 2 subjective assessment tools.
