      address whether perineal trauma, sphincter lacerations, anal incontinence, and fecal urgency
      impact the subject on any level. Subjects will also be asked about their bowel habits and
      history of problems with bowel movements. Subjects will then be asked to undergo an
      ultrasound study of the anal sphincter at the time of enrollment. Completing the entire study
      will take no more than 15 minutes. This will be done at the doctor's office. Answering the
      questionnaire will take no more than 5 minutes.

      The endoanal ultrasound is a probe with a diameter equivalent to the index finger. It is
      inserted in the rectum and measures the length and width of the sphincter muscles.
