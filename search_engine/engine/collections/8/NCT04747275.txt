      oral tablet levothyroxine (L-T4) is primarily used to treat this condition. However, children
      with T21 have developmental delay and other functional gastrointestinal (GI) issues that may
      negatively affect L-T4 tolerability and absorption. For an age group unable to swallow
      tablets whole by mouth, tablets must be crushed and suspended in water, breast milk or
      formula for administration in order to treat children with hypothyroidism. For this age
      group, ease of administration may have a significant impact on compliance and ability to
      remain euthyroid. Until recently, there was no liquid preparation of L-T4 in the United
      States for use in children. Tirosint-SOL® (liquid stable L-T4) is now FDA-approved for use in
      children. The Investigator proposes that Tirosint-SOL® will be more favorably received due to
      ease of administration, improved tolerability and palatability, therefore leading to improved
      adherence when compared to L-T4 tablets.
