      oncology creates promising opportunities for supportive cancer care and patient education.
      Mobile applications were established for the supportive cancer care but their area of use is
      limited. Although there are many field specific medical mobile applications, there are few
      training programs for the benefit of patients. However, these are innovative tools and
      provide accessibility, individual training and consultancy in order for the patients to be
      able to cope with side effects of the treatment; thus, improving their quality of life,
      symptom management and distress.
