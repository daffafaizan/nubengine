      compromised memory and concentration with altered performance on intellectual tasks that can
      affect patients of any age but it is more frequent in advanced age people after anesthesia.

      Recently clinical research has demonstrated the efficacy of computer- controlled endovenous
      drug delivery system guided by bispectral index score (BIS) of the electroencephalogram as
      the control variable. The BIS closed loop (CL) titration of propofol and remifentanyl target
      control infusion provides clinically adequate anesthesia with stability of cardiovascular
      parameters and favorable patients outcomes, including decreasing drug consumption and
      shortened postoperative recovery times when compared with manual control infusion.
