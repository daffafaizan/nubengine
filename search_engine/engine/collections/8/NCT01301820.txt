           combining azacitidine and lenalidomide in elderly fit patients with previously untreated
           AML and with high risk cytogenetics or secondary AML, who achieved either a complete
           remission after an LIA induction therapy

        -  The secondary objectives will be to determine the relapse incidence, overall survival,
           event free survival at 1 and 2 years of follow-up, toxicities of the treatment,
           incidence of infectious events.

        -  To define a gene expression and promoter methylation signatures associated with CR and
           absence of relapse when patients received azacitidine and lenalidomide. Gene promoter
           methylation and gene expression profiling will be performed at diagnosis, at CR, and
           after 2 courses of azacitidine and lenalidomide in order to give insight within the
           mechanisms involved by the use of these 2 drugs and to identify new epigenetic
           prognostic markers.
