    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of Remsima™ in
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients by evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) up to 5
      years and to exploratory compare patients receiving Remsima™ with patients receiving
      non-biologic treatments or other anti-TNF drugs.

      In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated:

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  Opportunistic infection (excluding tuberculosis)

        -  Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infections and
           tuberculosis)

        -  Tuberculosis (TB)

        -  Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions)

        -  Haematologic reactions

        -  Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus like syndrome

        -  Demyelinating disorders

        -  Lymphoma (not HSTCL)

        -  Hepatobiliary events

        -  Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL)

        -  Serious infusion reactions during a re-induction regimen following disease flare

        -  Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions

        -  Leukaemia

        -  Malignancy (excluding lymphoma)

        -  Skin cancer

        -  Pregnancy exposure†

        -  Infusion reaction associated with shortened infusion duration

        -  Others

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy. Further, additional safety
      of Remsima™ in RA patients, in comparison with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or
      other anti-TNF drugs. Health-economics parameters will also be assessed.
