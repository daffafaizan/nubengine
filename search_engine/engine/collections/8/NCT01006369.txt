      Primary

        -  To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal
           carcinoma treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with capecitabine, oxaliplatin,
           and bevacizumab and to compare this to a previously reported median PFS of 7.9 months.

      Secondary

        -  To measure the overall response rate.

        -  To measure the duration of response for responding patients.

        -  To measure the disease-control rate (complete response, partial response, or stable
           disease for at least 2 courses).

        -  To document the safety and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To develop surrogate biomarkers for autophagy detection in patient tissue specimens and
           to characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine on autophagy in patients in vivo.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
      Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-15 and oral hydroxychloroquine
      twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples may be collected for biomarker and other laboratory
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
