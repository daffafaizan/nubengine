      because of the high rate of recurrent hospital admissions. Although guideline-recommended
      treatments, such as beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin inhibitors, are effective on both
      mortality and morbidity, these drugs are very often underprescribed or used at lower doses
      than those shown to be beneficial in clinical trials, particularly in the primary care
      setting, for fear of adverse events. Although referral to specialist services may improve
      prescription of recommended drugs and doses achieved, frequent consultations may be
      unfeasible and costly.The study is designed to assess whether active specialist support and
      educational material improve the prescription process for heart failure patients in primary
      care
