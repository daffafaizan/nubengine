      The first phase is a cross sectional survey including all patients transplanted in Basel,
      Bern and in Zurich speaking German and transplanted at least 6 months ago. Renal transplant
      recipients having poor sleep quality and / or daytime sleepiness as result of this first
      phase will be asked to participate in phase two. Phase two is an sleep assessment, resulting
      in a presumed sleep diagnosis.

      Renal transplant recipients having a sleep wake dysregulation, assessed in phase two, will be
      asked to participate in phase three. Phase three is a pilot randomized controlled trial to
      compare the sustained impact of bright light therapy on sleep-wake regulation.
