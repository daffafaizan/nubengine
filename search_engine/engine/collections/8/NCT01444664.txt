    
      To design a registry to evaluate the wall of intracranial aneurysms during open surgical
      clipping by direct photographic appearance, wall biopsy samples, CSF and blood plasma fluid
      collection (Interleukins; IL-8/ Matrix Metalloproteinase; MMP-9) for complete evaluation and
      comparison.

      The focus of the registry will be to determine the presence of aneurysmal wall defects, mural
      clot, atherosclerotic and atheroma, wall permeability and delamination. These findings will
      then be correlated to the collected CSF and blood values to determine if there is any direct
      features of the aneurysm wall that would predict any of the reported post embolic syndromes.
      The collected data can also be correlated to the peroperative imaging, (MRI, CT and
      Angiogram).
