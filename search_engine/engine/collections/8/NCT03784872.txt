      done. Under vision the skin overlying the attachment of the round ligament to the anterior
      abdominal wall was incised followed by introduction of 30 curved needle attached to
      absorpable Vicryl 2/0 suture through the incision and withdrawn through grasper under
      laparoscopi vision. The needle was turned around the round ligament all through its length to
      plicate it then the needle was pushed again beside its entry side to appear at the skin
      incision. The same was repeated on the other side and both sutures were tied at the
      subcutaneous tissue simultaneously. then the laparoscopy was withdrawn followed by closure of
      the skin incision using Vicryl 2/0 suture.
