    
      60 Patients aged between 35 and 70 years with proximal humeral fracture and surgical
      treatment will be recruited in three different clinics in Germany and randomised into an
      intervention and a control group. Participants will be assessed before randomisation and
      followed up after completing an intervention period of 3 weeks and additionally after 3, 6
      and 12 months. Baseline assessment will assess cognition (SOMC), level of pain in the
      affected arm, ability to work, gait speed (10m walk), disability of the arm, shoulder and
      hand (DASH), as well as the range of motion of the affected arm (goniometer measurement),
      visual acuity and motor function of orthopaedic patients (WMFT-O). Clinical follow up
      directly after intervention will assess disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH), the
      range of motion and motor function (WMFT-O). Primary outcome parameter will be the DASH and
      secondary outcome parameter will be the WMFT-O. The long-term results will be assessed
      prospectively by a postal follow-up. All patients will receive conventional occupational- and
      physiotherapy. The intervention group will receive an additive robotic-assisted training
      using the ArmeoÂ®Spring robot for three weeks.
