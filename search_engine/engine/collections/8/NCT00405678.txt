      exercise capacity, tumor vascularity and response in women undergoing neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy for operable breast cancer, prior to the initiation of the full investigation,
      we will conduct a small vanguard study to ensure we can achieve acceptable exercise adherence
      rates in the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Specifically, three operable breast
      cancer patients will be recruited and enrolled as described below and perform exercise
      training for a minimum of six weeks. If acceptable exercise rates are observed in the absence
      of severe DLTs during this time, we will proceed with the full investigation (recruitment of
      additional 20 patients) (see Figure 2). Using a prospective, randomized design, potential
      participants will be identified and screened for eligibility by an assigned Breast Protocol
      Nurse (TBD) via medical record review of patients scheduled for their primary neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy consultation at DCCC
