      event and/ or following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. These patients are then
      later followed up as outpatients during cardiac rehabilitation(CR) in turn to improve
      cardio-respiratory fitness and quality of life and to delay the incidence of subsequent
      coronary events. Early mobilisation and physical activity is often the first choice of
      treatment, but evidence as to the optimal intensity, timing and choice of exercises is
      scarce. In 2018 the effect of obesity on functional capacity, anxiety and Daily life
      activities in patients with coronary artery disease and phase II cardiac rehabilitation. The
      results shows that When Group 1 patients were assessed at the end of 30 sessions of cardiac
      rehabilitation (CR) program, a statistically significant improvement was detected in 6MWT,
      physical functioning, physical role, mental health, social functioning and pain sub
      parameters.

      In 2019, study Changes in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and heart rate walking speed
      index following a cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation programme .Patients increased
      their 6-minute walk test distance by 40 meters and decreased their heart rate walking speed
      index by 2.7, which translates into a saving of three heart beats for every 100 meters walked
      or 45 heart beats for every mile walked.

      In 2012, conducted study Resistance and Balance Training Improves Functional Capacity in Very
      Old Participants Attending Cardiac Rehabilitation Participants were assigned randomly in a
      ratio of 1:1 to an intervention group (IG; inpatient CR plus resistance training and balance
      training) or control group (CG;inpatient CR)after Coronary Bypass Surgery. The study
      concluded that there is significantly greater improvement in functional capacity measured as
      6-MWD,TUG time, and maximal relative workload in the IG than in the CG..
