    
      This study is designed to determine the amount of interest in an educational application
      (app) on social media for glaucoma patients and their caregivers.

      The purpose of this App is to enhance understanding of glaucoma by using short video
      tutorials. The App will include glaucoma eye drop medication reminders, a short video
      tutorial which aims to improve understanding of how visual field testing should be performed,
      how to administer eye drops and a feature that will enable participants to store and organize
      testing results using a mobile device.
