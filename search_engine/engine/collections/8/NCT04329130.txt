      lymphoma.There are no international studies of Chidamide combination with lenalidomide for
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, this study intends to select
      the oral HDAC inhibitor Chidamide combined with lenalidomide for relapsed or refractory
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and explore its efficacy and safety.
