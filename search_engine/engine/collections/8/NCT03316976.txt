      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of Dexlansoprazole 30 mg and
      60 mg delayed-release capsules in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants, 20 participants in each parallel arm.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: A single oral dose of Dexlansoprazole 30 mg delayed-release capsule

        -  Group 2: A single oral dose of Dexlansoprazole 60 mg delayed-release capsule

      All participants will be asked to take single dose of study drug on Day 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 40 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone or will make a
      final visit to the clinic 5 to 10 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
