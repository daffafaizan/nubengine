      patient-reported satisfaction with procedure outcome and treatment efficacy to reduce pain
      levels following an orthopedic procedure for knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, or
      anklesspinal cord (SCS) stimulation. Secondary objectives include changes in physical health,
      quality of life, and quality of life and pain-related prescription medication usage.

      Design and Outcomes This is a prospective observational single-arm study to access the
      primary outcome variable of lower back and/or lower limb patient satisfaction with procedure
      outcomes as measured using a modified MacNab scale. Patients will have presented to their
      healthcare providers with knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or ankle pain and will have
      elected and been assigned a medically-appropriate surgical procedure as part of their
      standard of care. It is possible for subjects to have multiple areas of pain and subsequent
      surgeries, and subjects have the option of completing surveys for all
      medically-indicatedmedically indicated areas being treated.pain

      IIIntervention and Duration There will be no study intervention. Subjects will only be
      monitored and evaluated for pre and post-operative satisfaction, pain, physical activity
      levels, quality of life, and medication use levels. Subjects will be followed for 12 months
      following their SCS stimulation implant procedure.

      Sample Size and Population Investigators aim for a minimum population size of 1,500 in order
      to give statistical significance with results. Subjects will be stratified by surgical
      procedurearea of chronic pain.
