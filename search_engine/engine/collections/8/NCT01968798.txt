      Prevention of Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Study, a 5 year randomized placebo- controlled
      trial of 100 mg of daily aspirin in 19,000 elderly in Australia and the US to determine
      whether the benefits of low dose daily aspirin outweigh the bleeding risks. The primary
      outcome of ASPREE is defined as prolongation of "disability-free life", measured as survival
      without physical disability or dementia. At present, the primary purpose of ACES is to: 1)
      collect information about participant cancer screenings, cancer diagnosis, and family history
      of cancer and to 2) establish a biologic specimen repository (biobank) for DNA and tumor
      tissue, and urine from the ASPREE large healthy aging population in the US and Australia for
      future use by ASPREE, NIA and NCI investigators, and academicians from the broader research
      community. At a time in the future and under separate application, the stored blood or
      saliva, urine, and tumor tissue, together with other information obtained about these
      participants (in relation to their health, lifestyle and other circumstances) will be
      analyzed to address specific questions regarding the association of biomarkers and major
      health outcomes including cancer.
