      6-week very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarette condition (N=50) or a 6-week normal
      nicotine content cigarette control condition (NNC; N=25). Participants will undergo
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline and 6-weeks to investigate the
      nicotine-related modulation of brain circuitry involved in incentive salience valuation and
      executive control. Imaging tasks will engage the incentive salience of smoking cues and
      non-smoking rewards and executive control functions to identify changes in functional
      activity within, and effective connectivity between, known salience and executive control
      brain circuitry. A novel fMRI task using specialized odor presentation equipment and fMRI
      sequences will assess neural cue reactivity to smoke odors.
