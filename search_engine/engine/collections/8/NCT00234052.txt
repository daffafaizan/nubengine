      Primary

        -  Determine the median time to disease progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV or
           recurrent non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin,
           pemetrexed disodium, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes, and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses,
      patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease continue to receive
      pemetrexed disodium and bevacizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
