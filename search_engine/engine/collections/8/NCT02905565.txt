    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to standard-of-care study with
      a primary objective to assess the safety of NBP treatment in patients with mild to moderate
      acute ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives include determination of pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile and exploratory evaluation for the efficacy of NBP treatment in stroke patients.

      All randomized subjects will also receive standard supportive medical care for treatment of
      AIS throughout the study. The overall duration of the study will be approximately 90 days,
      including 30 days of treatment and an additional 60 days for follow up assessments. Subjects
      will be hospitalized long enough to receive the first four doses of study drug. After
      discharge from the hospital, subjects will continue to take study treatment daily through Day
      30 and have scheduled assessments completed.

      To maintain the blind, all subjects will take 4 softgel capsules BID, which will contain
      either 100 mg NBP or matching placebo. The first dose must be taken within 12 hours of the
      onset of the AIS defined as the last known normal.
