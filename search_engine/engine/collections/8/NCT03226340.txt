      average variation of diastolic blood pressure (sitDBP) of the study group in which
      S-amlodipine / Chlorthalidone combination therapy is to be used in patients with essential
      hypertension who did not adequately respond to monotherapy of amlodipine or S-amlodipine,
      compared to the control group, in which a combination therapy of S-amlodipine / telmisartan
      is to be used.
