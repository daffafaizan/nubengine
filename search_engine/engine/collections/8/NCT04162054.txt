      vibrating platform that moves in sinusoidal oscillations, and during which static and dynamic
      exercises can be performed. Rapid movements of the platform lead to muscle spindle reﬂexes,
      which result in reﬂectory contraction of muscle groups and thus promote gain of muscle
      strength and power. The most efﬁcient vibration rate enhancing muscle function is assumed to
      be ∼20 Hz, leading to constant muscle contraction and anaerobic metabolism of the affected
      muscle ﬁbres. As a consequence, lactate liberation serves as a stimulus for muscle gain.This
      methodology has been successfully utilised to enhance moving velocity, muscle power and
      strength in young athletes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease though not been
      understood in all details. Therefore this investigation will help to evaluate acute
      cardiopulmonary effects of whole body vibration (WBV) on healthy individuals analysed in
      non-invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX).
