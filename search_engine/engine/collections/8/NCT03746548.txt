      hours per day) of the waking hours, whereas the Contact Mini will be worn ~ 50% (~5 - 8 hours
      per day) of the waking hours (p<0.05). The authors expect this difference due to increased
      wearing comfort, reduced/no pressure to the skin of the ADHEAR. The primary objective will be
      assessed with the diary patients are asked to use.
