    
      Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The newly
      developed small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), abemaciclib,
      provides a new opportunity of treating patients with BTC. The goal of this clinical study is
      to determine the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with advanced or metastatic
      BTC that has progressed or intolerant following one line of chemotherapy.

      The investigator's objectives for this study are as follows:

      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To determine the objective response rate (ORR)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To determine the disease control rate (DCR)

        -  To determine the overall survival (OS) rate at 6 and 12 months

        -  To determine quality of life (QoL) using EORTC-QLQ-C30
