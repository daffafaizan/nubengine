    
      Today, pro-fertility information is generally unavailable to healthy women; clinically
      meaningful in-clinic testing is limited by physician availability and patient willingness to
      undergo testing in-clinic, while home testing is limited to hormonal bloodwork which is
      insufficient on its own and has high false positives. Sponsor is developing home telemedicine
      transvaginal ultrasound as part of a home fertility assessment. Sponsor wishes to demonstrate
      the ability to obtain interpretable images, in women of varying body habitus, reproductive
      age, and reproductive status.
