      - To assess whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI) for the
      assessment and early prediction of response of treatment with regorafenib or placebo in
      patients with advanced, metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST)

        1. Evaluation of pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and b1000 signal
           intensity (SI) of GIST visualized on the WB-DWI as predictor of time to progression,
           determined by progression-free survival (PFS)

        2. Evaluation of WB-DWI using changes of high b-value SI and ADC early during treatment
           (2weeks after start of therapy; allowed optimal window 10-14 days) as early predictor of
           time to progression or patient benefit according to RECIST (stable disease + partial
           response + complete response)

        3. Evaluation of WB-DWI for treatment follow-up 3 months after initiation of treatment.
           Confirmation of prior published pilot study (Dunet V et al, J Nucl Med 2010)

        4. Comparison of WB-DWI with conventional CT imaging for response assessment
