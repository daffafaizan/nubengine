      solutions. Currently available interventions (medication and psychotherapy) have failed to
      provide adequate clinical improvement in 40% of adolescents with depression and only produce
      remission in 30% of youth. There is a clear need to develop better targeted interventions for
      this growing population of youth.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To examine the efficacy of a targeting strategy to optimize repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) to reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents between 12-17 years of age. Hypothesis
      1: Six weeks of open-label daily intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) sessions
      delivered to the left DLPFC will be effective at reducing depressive symptoms between
      baseline and 10- week follow-up. Hypothesis 2: iTBS over left DLPFC will decrease functional
      connectivity between left DLPFC and subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) and will reduce
      depression-related hyperconnectivity between nodes of the default mode network (DMN).
      Hypothesis 3: Higher anti-correlation between left DLPFC and SCC and lower cingulate
      glutamate concentrations will predict better clinical outcome following iTBS.

      Aim 2: To determine the tolerability of iTBS in adolescents between 12-17 years of age.
      Hypothesis 1: iTBS will be well tolerated without any more than minimal side effects.
      Hypothesis 2: iTBS will result in sufficient cortical excitability, as measured by
      64-channel-EEG pre, during, and post iTBS, to induce an antidepressant effect but not induce
      seizures or other adverse events.
