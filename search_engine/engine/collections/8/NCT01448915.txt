      liver disease and its treatment in HIV-infected persons who use drugs. The recent
      availability of a novel, non-invasive method of measuring HCV disease stage makes it possible
      to test the relationship of HCV disease stage and the management of coinfected IDUs with
      adequate precision. The investigators will apply the innovative technology, elastography
      (FibroScan®) to ask whether the marked differences in the final disease outcome, end-stage
      liver disease (ESLD), can be explained by a measure of liver stiffness as assessed by
      elastography (FibroScan®). While advances in non-invasive disease assessment are critical to
      HCV management, the greatest challenge to improving HCV treatment effectiveness in coinfected
      persons remains low rates of treatment uptake and adherence, even when freely accessible. In
      response to this glaring disparity, the investigators will test potent behavioral
      reinforcement interventions to improve the management of HCV disease by adapting a rigorously
      studied contingent behavioral incentives program to the treatment to coinfected IDUs.
      Hepatitis C Treatment Eligibility: To determine the population prevalence of significant
      liver disease in coinfected IDUs using an innovative, non-invasive methodology (transient
      elastography, FibroScan®) to measure liver stiffness. Liver Disease Staging: To test the
      hypothesis that liver stiffness, assessed by a novel, non-invasive methodology, is predictive
      of the development of ESLD, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular cancer, and
      liver-related death, in coinfected IDUs.
