    
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that causes verrucae, or warts, on the skin,
      particularly of the distal extremities, and lesions of the mucous membranes. Warts are highly
      prevalent, occurring in up to 13% of the general population and in around 25% of otherwise
      healthy children. About 67% of warts resolve spontaneously within two years; however more
      than 25% will persist for many years, some resulting in pain or dysfunction and some
      imparting significant psychosocial problems. Localized hyperthermia (warming) has been
      reported to be effective in the treatment of HPV-induced warts for nearly two decades. A
      novel method of treating warts with heat is the use of an occlusive patch that contains a
      mixture of chemicals (ferric chloride), which in the presence of oxygen reacts to generate
      reproducible thermal warming of the skin to a temperature of 42-43ÂºC for at least two hours.
      The heat is believed to alter the immune response and kill the HPV virus in the wart tissue.
