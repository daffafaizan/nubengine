      patient's withdrawal, or investigator's discretion. After achieving a maximal response on
      taxotere or other chemo schedule they were eligible to enroll in this trial and begin
      treatment with maintenance GMCSF for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Once progression
      was documented the patients were taken off study.
