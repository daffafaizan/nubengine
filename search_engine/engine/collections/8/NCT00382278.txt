      transplant was not expected to occur earlier than 12 months, due to low MELD scores.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic artery or portal vein thrombosis were excluded by
      color Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) and 3-phase computed tomography (CT). Under local
      anesthesia, 100 mL of bone marrow were aspirated from the posterior iliac crest. ABMMC were
      isolated by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, 10% of the cells were
      labeled with SnCl2-99mTc, and a small fraction was used for cell counting and viability
      analysis. ABMMC were delivered preferentially in the common hepatic artery by celiac trunk
      catheterism. Total body scintigraphy (TBS) was performed 3 hours after infusion. Patients
      were submitted to frequent clinical, biochemical and imaging evaluation during follow up.
