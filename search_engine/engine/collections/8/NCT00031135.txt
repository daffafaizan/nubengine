    
      Choline deficiency-induced hepatic steatosis occurs in patients that require long-term TPN
      and may progress to significant hepatic disease and death. Initial studies indicate
      choline-supplemented TPN may reverse TPN-associated hepatic steatosis.

      Choline chloride or placebo will be added to each patient's TPN for 16 weeks by the hospital
      or pharmacy providing their usual TPN. Patients will receive their TPN in the hospital until
      they are medically stable for discharge. If patients are discharged before study completion,
      the pharmacy will deliver the TPN supply to them. Evaluation of hepatic steatosis is done by
      CT scans and blood analyses. Blood will be drawn on a biweekly basis during the first 4 weeks
      and at Week 8, 12, 16 or withdrawal. CT scans will be done at Week 4, 8, 16, or withdrawal.
