    
      Objectives:

      The aim of this study is the characterization of healthy children/ young adults and matched
      patients with asthma in terms of lung function, and the degree of the systemic and bronchial
      inflammation.

      Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (qRT-PCR) and by a cytometric bead assay (CBA). Components of the innate immune system
      (mannose-binding protein, TLR recognition proteins and surfactant proteins) are determined
      from sputum or blood respectively.

      Methods and Work Programme:

      This study consists of two study visits (V1 and V2)

      V1 (day 0 - duration 1 hour):

        -  Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO)

        -  Lung function testing with and body plethysmography

        -  Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, markers of the
           non-specific pulmonary defense system

        -  Induced sputum attained by an ultrasonic-nebulizer for inflammatory mediators and
           microbiological investigations

      V2 (day 14-28 - duration 1 hour):

        -  Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO)

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Induced sputum attained by a nozzle-nebulizer for inflammatory mediators and
           microbiological investigations

      Study population:

      Children, adolescents and young people (6 - 25 years of age). Both the patients and the
      healthy subjects are recruited from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergy and
      Pulmonology.
