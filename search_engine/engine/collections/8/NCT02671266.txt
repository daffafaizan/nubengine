      dysmorphic disorder (BDD), treatment outcome data suggest that there is still considerable
      room for improvement. A closer examination of biological mechanisms underlying
      psychopathology may help uncover mechanisms to target during intervention and thereby provide
      a novel approach to treatment. Given that the neuropeptide, oxytocin, is involved in the
      regulation of a variety of social and cognitive dimensions, including emotion recognition and
      social attentional processing, there are direct implications regarding its role in the
      development of such deficits among individuals with BDD. The current study therefore aims to
      investigate the effect of oxytocin administration on social cognitive impairments in BDD and
      a related disorder, OCD. Twenty treatment-seeking male and female outpatients with BDD, 20
      individuals with OCD, and 20 healthy participants will be assigned to receive an oxytocin and
      placebo nasal spray one week apart. During each visit, subjects will complete a series of
      tasks to measure emotion recognition, attentional biases, interpretive biases, and trust
      behavior. Importantly, these findings may show that a single administration of oxytocin may
      alter social cognitive processes thought to maintain BDD, and ultimately inform treatments
      for BDD.
