      and found it to be effective when delivered by psychologists (Masia Warner et al., 2005;
      Masia Warner et al., 2007). The proposed dissemination study extends this work through a
      controlled trial of SASS delivered by school counselors. The investigators will randomize 126
      adolescents with social anxiety disorder, ages 14 through 17, to one of 3 treatments: 1) SASS
      delivered by school counselors (SC-SASS), 2) SASS delivered by psychologists (Expert-SASS),
      or 3) a manualized adolescent group counseling program specifically designed for school
      counselors, called Skills for Living (SFL). A comprehensive evaluation will include
      diagnosis, illness severity, scale ratings of social anxiety and depression, clinical global
      improvement, overall functioning, and school-relevant indices of function. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, mid-point (after 6 weeks of intervention), post-treatment, and 6 months
      following intervention completion.
