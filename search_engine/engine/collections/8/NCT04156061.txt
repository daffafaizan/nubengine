    
      This is a sub-study of the SCOT-HEART 2 trial (which aims to determine the best way to
      prevent heart attacks).

      The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the effect of getting information on heart
      disease risk on lifestyle. At present doctors usually use a "risk score" to identify people
      at risk of heart disease who may benefit from medical treatment. In the SCOT-HEART 2 study
      the investigator will compare this "risk score" to a specialised heart scan (a computed
      tomography coronary angiogram or CTCA scan). In this study the investigator would like to
      understand more about the effects of receiving this information about the heart on lifestyle,
      including effects on smoking, diet and activity.

      This study will recruit 400 participants who are taking part in the SCOT-HEART 2 trial. The
      investigator will assess lifestyle by using a detailed questionnaire which will be done at
      the start of the study and 6 months later. The investigator will also perform some simple
      investigations including a carbon monoxide breath test, blood pressure tests and measurements
      of activity such as step counts. This will help us understand the effects on lifestyle of
      getting information about a "risk score" or having a CT scan. In addition, for people who
      have CT scans the investigator will either provide a verbal explanation of the results, as is
      usual, or show pictures of the heart from the CT scan. This will help us understand how best
      to explain the results of the CT scan to partipants.
