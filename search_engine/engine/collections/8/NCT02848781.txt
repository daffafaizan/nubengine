      Randomization will be 1:1 between control group and ablation group. Those randomized to the
      control group will receive ICD therapy and routine drug therapy (including antiarrhythmic
      drugs as indicated). Subjects randomized to the ablation group will receive ablation therapy
      plus ICD for ventricular tachycardia. Patients that refuse ICD therapy and undergo ablation
      only will be enrolled in a prospective registry.

      Follow-up will be performed prior to hospital discharge for incision check and device
      interrogation as is standard of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will
      be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed
      pre-implant and prior to hospital discharge. Echocardiography (TTE) will be performed
      pre-implant and at 12 and 24 months.

      Patients that refuse ICD implantation will not be randomized and will be approached for
      inclusion into a registry if they undergo catheter ablation without an ICD. Basic
      demographics and medical history will be collected from registry subjects upon enrollment.
      Registry subjects will receive follow-up for routine clinical care every 6 months to check on
      their overall status.

      120 subjects will be randomized. An additional 60 subjects will enrolled into the registry.

      As of the time protocol revision C changes were made (07Nov2016), 33 subjects have been
      randomized. There has not been any preliminary or interim analysis of any data at this point.
      The study-sponsor has not had any access to any clinical follow-up for the patients enrolled
      to date.
