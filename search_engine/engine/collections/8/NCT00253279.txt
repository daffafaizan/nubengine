      (metabolism) in both burn patients and healthy people.The studies will help us understand how
      muscle metabolism is different for burn patients and healthy subjects. We hope to find ways
      to help the body of a burn victim heal without losing too much muscle.

      Protein is an important part of our daily diet. Normally, the body breaks down the protein we
      eat into smaller pieces called amino acids. It uses the amino acids to make its own proteins.
      It uses these proteins to heal wounds, fight infections, and provide energy.

      After a burn injury, the body speeds up the pace of its life activities. It needs more energy
      just to stay alive and recover from the burn. The body often gets the extra energy it needs
      by breaking the protein in muscles down into amino acids. The amino acids are then made into
      new proteins. If too much muscle is broken down, it is harder for the body to function. This
      can make recovery slower or possibly lead to death.

      For Healthy Volunteers, this study will require no more than 6 hours of time in total. This
      time will be spread out over two visits, a Screening Visit and a Scan Visit.

      For Burn Patients, this study will require no more than 14 hours total. This time will be
      spread out over four visits-a screening visit and a maximum of 3 scan visits. A total of
      three PET scans will be done over a 2 year period.
