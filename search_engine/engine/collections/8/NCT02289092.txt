      are necessary for school success, including sustained attention, self-regulation, initiating
      and sustaining successful peer relationships, and academic competence. Parent support at
      home, such as positive parenting and support for learning, is associated with school
      readiness indicators that predict successful adaptation to the school context. For many
      children at risk for poor developmental outcomes this transition can be difficult and may
      lead to early academic problems, which in turn may define a trajectory that culminates in
      more severe forms of problem behavior and learning difficulties. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy of implementing the Family Check-Up (FCU), a school-based,
      ecological approach to family intervention, during the transition into elementary school.
