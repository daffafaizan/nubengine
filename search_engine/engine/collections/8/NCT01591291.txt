      ondansetron or placebo. Participants will also receive Brief Behavioral Compliance
      enhancement Treatment (BBCET) as their psychosocial adjuct weekly in weeks 1 to 12, and then
      every 2 weeks in weeks 12 to 24. We will enroll two separate population groups (i.e.,
      African-Americans and European-Americans), each with 128 treatment-seeking, alcohol-dependent
      individuals in a 24-week clinical trial. Subjects in each of these two population groups
      (N=128/group) will be randomized into 4 cells (N=32/cell) in a 2 (TT vs. TG or GG) × 2
      (ondansetron 4 μg/kg twice daily vs. placebo) factorial design. Group assignment will be
      achieved using a block randomization procedure that balances the treatment groups on PHDD,
      age, and gender.
