      shows that LDCT scan has a higher detection rate for peripheral lesions (often
      adenocarcinoma), and a lower detection rate for central lung cancer (mostly squamous cell
      carcinoma). Fluorescent bronchoscopy uses the principle of differentiating fluorescence in
      different tissues to distinguish normal parts from diseased parts. It is often used for
      screening of central early lung cancer.Based on the results of the investigator's previous
      research, the investigators plan to conduct a second round of community
      screening-bronchoscopy screening, and perform white light bronchoscopy and autofluorescence
      bronchoscopy screening for high-risk groups of lung cancer with heavy smoking (â‰¥400 years)
      and no obvious lung nodules.
