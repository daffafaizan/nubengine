    
      The aim of this functional neuroimaging study is to analyze brain responses to visual food
      cues in obese (body mass index > 97th percentile) adolescents with BED (according to the
      criteria Marcus and Kalarchian) compared with healthy control adolescents in two situations :
      hunger et satiety.

      Fifteen obese adolescents (12/16 years) with BED and fifteen healthy control adolescents will
      be enrolled in the study protocol. Participants will be instructed not to eat food for at
      least 6 hours prior to the first imaging session. After the initial set of functional and
      anatomic scans, participants will be fed a standard calorie meal. Approximately 1 hour later,
      the experiment will be repeated while participants are in a satiated condition. The cortical
      fMRI activation will be measured during the following four experimental visual conditions :
      high calory food, low calory food, disgust and neutral presented in block design.

      First-level and second-level differences in neural activation assessed during functional MRI
      in the different conditions will then be analyzed.
