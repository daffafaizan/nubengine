      essential tremor using external wearable sensors to responsively initiate or terminate DBS.
      To this end, the researchers propose to use the Nexus-D system, which requires a firm ware
      update to an Activa Implantable Neurostimulator (INS), and it will in a smart way turn DBS
      on/off in patients. The study team will recruit subjects with Activa SC or PC neurostimulator
      implants during 6 post-operative programming visits. The research group is already familiar
      with and is in possession of the Nexus-D system, and the investigators have successfully
      performed responsive DBS in two patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and in four patients
      with Parkinson's disease in acute settings. The lab is also equipped with wireless wearable
      sensor and amplifier systems, such as a 16-unit wireless EMG+ acceleration+inertia Trigno
      Wireless Bio Acquisition System (Delsys Inc, Natick, MA). The study team aims to combine
      these signal modalities to capture pathological symptoms and generate commands to initiate or
      terminate DBS (also record adverse side effects, if any). The project goal is to characterize
      the clinical efficacy, side effect profile, and battery life of closed-loop DBS in acute
      settings using wearable sensors in essential tremor patients.
