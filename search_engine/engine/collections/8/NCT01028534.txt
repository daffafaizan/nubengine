      disorders are well known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Treating them
      appropriately may improve the prognosis of the patients. Presently, continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the first-line therapy for OSA, and angiotensin II receptor
      blockers and long-acting calcium channel blockers for hypertension in Japan. Therefore, in
      the present study, we wanted to compare the effects of these different types of
      antihypertensive drugs on the control of blood pressure in patients with OSA whose
      hypertension is not controlled well after CPAP therapy.
