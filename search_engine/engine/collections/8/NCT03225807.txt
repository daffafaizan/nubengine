      This is an observational quality improvement study comparing outcomes before, and after,
      implementation of a proven lung protective ventilation protocol in an electronic medical
      record system, iCentra, that will be implemented in phases across Intermountain Healthcare
      hospitals. A phased implementation with a two-month washout period will be used to evaluate
      the primary outcome of interest, ventilator free days (VFDs) to 28 days. Secondary outcomes
      will include: use of the protocol by clinicians, compliance with protocol instructions,
      hospital discharge disposition, hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality, time to first ICU
      activity, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, heath care utilization, quality of
      life, and costs of care. As the iCentra electronic medical record is implemented at
      Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, clinicians will have the opportunity to use the
      computerized lung protective ventilation protocol, or to order mechanical ventilation
      settings independently. This is an observational study designed to measure how often the
      computerized lung protective ventilation protocol will be ordered, compliance with the
      instructions of the protocol, and clinical outcomes among patients who are managed with the
      protocol. Physicians may choose to use the protocol on intubated patients requiring
      mechanical ventilation or they may choose to order other specific mechanical ventilator
      settings.
