      effects on vascular function. These include a decrease in proteinuria and amelioration of
      diabetic nephropathy. Although the anti-proteinuric effect of TZDs is well established the
      mechanism(s) underlying these changes has yet to be determined. Possible mechanisms include
      altered renal haemodynamics, maintenance of anionic electrostatic filtration barriers in the
      glomerular basement membrane and pleiotropic effects.

      The target of TZDs, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), directly
      modulate vessel wall function. The kidney differentially expresses all PPAR isoforms and
      there is evidence that TZDs have pleiotropic effects in the kidney over and above their
      metabolic and haemodynamic actions. These effects include a direct action on cultured
      mesangial cells, inhibition of in vivo mesangial expansion, reduction in podocyte injury, and
      decreased production of type IV collagen and urinary endothelin-1 levels in early stage
      diabetic nephropathy.

      Glomerular ultrafiltration of plasma proteins is governed by the size of the filtration pores
      and the extent of anionic sites in the basement membrane and podocyte slit pore junction. It
      is possible that the anti-proteinuric effect of TZDs is attributable to an increase in size
      and/or charge selectivity in the glomerular filtration barrier. A Medline search showed there
      have been no studies on the effect of TZDs on protein ultrafiltration. The aim of the
      proposed study is to measure urinary protein size and charge selectivity in patients with
      early stage diabetic nephropathy before and after treatment with the TZD, pioglitazone.
