      over a 30-day reference period for treatment of women experiencing bothersome bleeding while
      using the etonogestrel (ENG) contraceptive implant. The primary outcome of the study will be
      the total number of amenorrhea days in a 30-day reference period. The study has a number of
      secondary outcomes (see study objectives) focused around the efficacy of oral curcumin to
      stop bleeding/spotting and for how long.
