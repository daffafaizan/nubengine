      based combination of findings regarding suggestions for patient care on various levels of the
      perioperative period, which work in synergy for accelerating the postoperative recovery
      period. It has been used sucessfully for many surgical disciplines, primarily colorectal
      surgery, since it was first reported in 1997. However, there is a significant insufficiency
      of this patient oriented rehabilitation program regarding cardiovascular surgeries. This
      study is to compare the postoperative follow up periods of patients with ERAS protocol and
      patients with standard protocol who were both operated for cardiac surgery.

      Following approval of the local ethics committee, 210 patients who are operated for elective
      cardiac surgery are enrolled in this prospective randomized clinical trial. The patients who
      are not applied the ERAS protocol are evaluated in the control group (n=51). The findings
      regarding the patients under ERAS protocol are evaluated based on evidence. Our primary is to
      compare the durations of stay in the intensive care unit and in hospital; our secondary is to
      compare the incidences of complications of the groups. The demographic data, operative
      measurements, complication rates, the amounts of perioperative bleeding and drainage and the
      duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital are recorded.
