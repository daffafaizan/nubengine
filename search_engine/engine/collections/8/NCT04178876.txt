    
      Patients with pelvic pain (VAS scoreâ‰¥4) and ultrasound diagnosis of endometrioma > 4cm
      candidate to surgical removal of endometrioma will be randomized into 2 group. One Group will
      undergo laparoscopical stripping technique; the other one will undergo laparoscopic
      aspiration and sclerotherapy using 95% ethanol.

      The women will be introduced with both operative options and they will be informed about the
      randomization . After an elaborate explanation about the study they will sign an informed
      consent form. the following data will be collected prior the operation: age, gravity &
      parity, operative history, general medical history, the cyst size, AMH (Anti Mullerian
      Hormone), symptoms related to endometriosis (through VAS score), fertility history including
      any fertility treatment in the past and planned pregnancy after the operation.

      The laparoscopy will take place in Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCSS, Roma. in the study
      group the cyst content will be aspirated and flushed with normal saline. 95% sterile ethanol
      will be instilled into the cyst through a Nelathon catheter. Ethanol will be left in the cyst
      for 15 min then aspirated as completely as possible following normal saline flushing. In the
      control group we will follow the standard treatment which is cystectomy.

      The women will be followed at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months after the surgery.
