      the body. It often happens on the scalp, causing a few bald spots and it may result in
      psychological stress even though people are generally healthy. AA is believed to be an
      autoimmune disease progressing from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles
      that causes hair to fall out in small patches, it may remain unnoticeable until the patches
      eventually connect and then become noticeable. It can develop slowly, and also recur after
      years between occurrences.

      By standard AA treatment guideline, DPCP is the first treatment protocol and may follow with
      anthralin or minoxidil. This oldy but goody treatment gives a good result of 75% in spotty
      hair loss and 25% in total baldness. The new invention of treatment has been introduced in
      the past 2 years by using JAK inhibitor, an oral medicine such as Tofacitinib and
      Ruxolitinib. This treatment gives a good outcome so far in this short period of time,
      54-81.9% of patients had over 50% increase of hair grows over the original protocol. The
      theory is that JAK inhibitors would inhibit interferon-gamma and interleukin-15 signal
      between white blood cell and hair follicle which reducing the rate of destroying hair
      follicles.

      The investigators propose the study to assess the safety and efficacy of Tofacitinib for
      extensive and recalcitrant AA and to evaluate the economic impact effecting the AA patients.
      Tofacitinib is an expensive medicine and needed to be taken up to 6 months to finish the
      course to have a best outcome so it is not a popular choice of AA treatment at present time
      unless it can show a promising result in recalcitrant AA.
