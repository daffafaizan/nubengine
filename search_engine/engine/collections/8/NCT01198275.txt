      burden on the healthcare system. Treatment of AF remains controversial. In patients on
      antiarrhythmic therapy, the one-year relapse rates of AF after cardioversion ranges from 44%
      to 77% at one year and amiodarone appears to the be the most effective in maintaining sinus
      rhythm.Over the last few years, a growing amount of evidences has supported the protective
      effects of n-3 PUFAs in preventing ventricular arrhythmias and reducing the risk of sudden
      cardiac death. Furthermore, in the last years, the interest for their possible beneficial
      role in AF prevention has been increasing.We hypothesized that the administration of n-3
      PUFAs could reduce the AF recurrence rate more than amiodarone plus RAAS inhibitors in
      patients with persistent AF. Therefore the present study aims to evaluate the role of n-3
      PUFAs in the prophylaxis of AF recurrences after DCCV in addition to amiodarone and RAS
      blockers therapy in patients with persistent AF.
