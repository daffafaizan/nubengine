      alfa-2a inhibits translation of viral proteins. Combining agents that act at different sites
      of viral replication may improve HIV inhibition and produce more effective and sustained
      anti-HIV effects.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms to receive AZT/ddC alone or
      combined with one of two doses of IFN alfa-2a. Treatment continues for up to 12 months after
      enrollment of the last patient. Patients are followed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks
      thereafter. Mean duration of follow-up is expected to be 13 months.
