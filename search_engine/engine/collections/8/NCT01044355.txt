      greater degree of blood pressure reduction after 6 weeks of treatment with fixed CPAP in
      comparison to those treated with APAP. Explanatory and exploratory hypotheses are that a
      greater reduction in arterial stiffness will be noted when compared with the benefit in blood
      pressure, that reductions in arterial stiffness will be associated with benefits to serum
      measurements of inflammatory markers and glucose regulation, and that control of sleep apnea
      and the attendant improvement in sleep quality will be better with fixed CPAP than APAP.
