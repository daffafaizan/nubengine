    
      VIVO TM is a non invasive mapping system which can be used to localize PVC / VT origin prior
      to the ablative procedure.

      Subjects scheduled for catheter ablation with VIVO will undergo a CT scan prior to the
      procedure, which will be used to create a personalized 3D model. This will be merged with a
      3D photograph (taken at the start of the procedure) of the ECG electrodes on the subject's
      torso.

      Then, the recording of the 12 lead ECG will be imported into the VIVO software. All of this
      data will be combined via the software and a mathematical algorithm will determine the origin
      of the arrhythmia. This will show the physician where to perform a successful ablation. After
      3 months, the subject will return for follow up and will receive another ECG Holter monitor
      (ECG recording) to determine ablation success.

      Subjects will be exited from the study after the 3 month follow up visit. Patients will
      receive standard clinical care prior to, during and after their scheduled procedure, as well
      as after being discarded from the trial.

      Results will be analysed and compared to those from an historical cohort of patients (age /
      gender matched, undergone the same procedure) ablated by the same operator within the
      previous 5 years (from a database already collected). Data will be anonymised as per current
      regulations.
