      Medicine is able to detect genomic alterations in peripheral blood that are consistent with
      the genomic alterations detected in a patient's matched primary and/or metastatic tumor
      biopsy sample analyzed by the FoundationOne® test. Study sites will provide matched solid
      tumor and peripheral blood samples of cancer patients to FMI for the purpose of testing the
      concordance of the FMI ctDNA assay to the FoundationOne® test. Participation in this study is
      part of a broader 2000 patient study to determine which tumor types are most readily measured
      via ctDNA profiling, and to learn of the similarity between the alterations found in a
      patient's tumor biopsy and the ctDNA from their blood.
