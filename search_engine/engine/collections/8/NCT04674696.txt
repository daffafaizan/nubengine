      radiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy with CAPOX. After 5-7 weeks, patients will be
      evaluate by MRI. Patients with incomplete clinical response will be referred to immediate
      surgery and patients with complete clinical response will be managed with "watch and wait"
      approach. Patients with progression disease during the treatment phase will be withdrawn from
      the study and will receive their treatment according to the investigator's judgment.

      The sample size was calculated according to Simon's optimal two-stage design. Accordingly, 21
      patients must be included in each group during the first stage and 24 during the second
      stage. Treatment regimen will be considered effective if 9 or more patients show good
      response (final analysis), reaching 80% power with an alpha of 0.10 level of significance.
