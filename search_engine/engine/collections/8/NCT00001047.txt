      at least two antimycobacterial agents and for every regimen to include a macrolide
      (clarithromycin or azithromycin). However, the optimal treatment for disseminated MAC remains
      unknown.

      Patients are randomized to receive clarithromycin at one of two doses plus ethambutol and
      either rifabutin or clofazimine. Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 4 months and every 4
      months thereafter for a minimum of 1.5 years to a common closing date.
