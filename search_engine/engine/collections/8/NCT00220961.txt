      hyperglycemia-related complications of this devastating disease can be prevented. Subjects
      with IGT will be identified with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Eligible subjects
      also will have a measurement of first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using
      the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) and carotid intimal media
      thickness using carotid ultrasound. Following these measurements subjects will be randomized
      to receive pioglitazone or placebo and they will return every 3 months for determination of
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration and interim medical history. Recruitment will take
      place over 15 months. From the time that the recruitment period ends, subjects will be
      followed for a total of 24 months on pioglitazone or placebo. The OGTT will be repeated at
      15,27, and 39 months, or if the FPG is â‰¥ 126 mg/dl on the 3-month follow up visits. If the
      diagnosis of diabetes is established before month 39 or at month 39, the FSIVGTT and carotid
      ultrasound will be repeated. At 39 months, subjects will be washed out of pioglitazone or
      placebo and the OGTT, FSIVGTT, and carotid ultrasound will be repeated at month 45.
