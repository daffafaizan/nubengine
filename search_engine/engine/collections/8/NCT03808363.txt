      recommendations for individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Currently, moderate
      intensity continuous training (MICT) is suggested however this study intends to explore the
      effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT). To do so, approximately 8
      individuals with SCI will be undergo a 6 week HIIT intervention consisting of 3 sessions per
      week. With a focus on cardiometabolic health markers (listed in outcome measure section), we
      aim to provide support for HIIT as a viable method of mitigating cardiovascular risk in a SCI
      population.
