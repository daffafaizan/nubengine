      patients with primary or secondary liver cancer undergoing hepatectomy. Preoperative exercise
      programs have been shown to be effective in other cancer populations, but have been poorly
      studied in patients with liver cancer. For these patients, it remains unclear what the
      optimal composition of such programs should be and how they should be delivered. Outcome
      measures in this study will include preoperative outcomes (oxygen consumption, quality of
      life, fatigue and physical activity level, anthropometric measures, plasma concentrations of
      hepatokines) and postoperative outcomes (length of hospital stay and postoperative
      complications).

      After the study is explained and consent obtained, subjects will be tested on a submaximal
      exercise on cycloergometer with gas exchanges analysis and with pre and post blood test.
      Then, they will answer various questionnaires assessing physical activity, quality of life
      and fatigue.

      Patients scheduled for liver resection will be randomized to one of two groups. The first
      group (experimental group) will be subdivided into two groups: interval training 1 and
      interval training 2, which differentiate themselves by two different intensities.The second
      group (control group) will receive standard care.

      The prehabilitation program will last 6 weeks with 3 sessions per week and will consist in
      two interval training programs on a cycloergometer with two different intensities.

      One month after surgery, peri and postoperative complications will be noted.
