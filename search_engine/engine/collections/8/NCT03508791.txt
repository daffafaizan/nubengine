      Trendelenburg) on arterial, end-tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure is
      assessed intermittently before, during, and after pneumoperitoneum. End-tidal and
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure are continuously monitored.
