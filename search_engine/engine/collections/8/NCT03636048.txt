      Internal Os of the Cervix(IIOC) to maintain pregnancy. It is the operation that incise the
      lower abdomen and ligate the cervix in pelvic cavity. In our center, the surgery was
      conventionally performed under general anesthesia. Also, for pain control, operator has been
      inserting a catheter into the incision site and connected the wound PCA. In this way, there
      were some limitations that the wound PCA could only control the somatic pain and there were
      significant rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting as common complication of general
      anesthesia. Thus, the investigator planned to conduct combined spinal-epidural
      anesthesia(CSE) with postoperative pain control with epidural catheter and compare overall
      postoperative outcomes with conventional general anesthesia.
