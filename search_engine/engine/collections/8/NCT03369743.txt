      especially in older patients with cognitive impairment beginning. The ETR+RAL (ETRAL) QD dual
      therapy should be evaluated.

      ETR is a molecule to long half-life (30-40 hours) manageable in QD. SENSE study showed
      virological efficiency of ETR QD in combination with two NRTIs, and several studies have
      shown comparable plasma exposure for ETR BID and ETR QD.

      The half-life of RAL is shorter (9 hours), but plasma exposure there still seems comparable
      to RAL BID and RAL QD (same AUC, more important and residual peak lower). Clinical trial of
      phase III QDMRK also pointed out the non-inferiority of virologic effectiveness of RAL QD
      compared to RAL BID, in association to two NRTIs, in patients with a pretherapeutic pVL <
      100,000 cp/ml.

      ODIS clinical trial also showed the effectiveness of RAL QD in combination with two NRTIs
      (risk of virologic failure increased in case of mutation of prior resistance to the NRTI).
      The Federal BID to RAL QD switch finally was evaluated in a pilot, to the Pitié-Salpêtrière
      hospital, all combined cART (tri - and dual therapy), with maintaining a pVL < 50 cp/ml to
      W48 in 68/71 patients (96%).

      Currently, at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, 34 patients on dual therapy ETRAL QD (outside
      the Protocol), since 137 months median (IQR 41-201), maintain a pVL < 50 cp/ml, suggesting a
      virologic effectiveness to completely reassuring.

      The dual therapy etravirine + raltegravir (ETRAL) in once daily (QD) maintains W48
      virological control, switch in patients who were under ETRAL taken twice a day (BID)
