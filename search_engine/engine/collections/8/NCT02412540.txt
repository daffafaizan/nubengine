      outcomes in two parallel cohorts: 1) severely obese adolescents with NASH who have chosen to
      undergo WLS (specifically VSG) for clinical indications compared to 2) a control group of
      severely obese adolescents with NASH enrolled in a CLI offered as part of this study. The
      study will provide the best evidence to date of the effectiveness of WLS and CLI in treating
      NASH in adolescents with body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 35 kg/m2. The investigators will also
      concurrently collect health-care utilization data to enable subsequent cost-effectiveness
      analyses (CEA) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of WLS vs. CLI intervention in
      severely-obese adolescents with NASH. If the investigators' data support our hypothesis that
      WLS yields superior results, this will set the stage for randomized studies (if needed) and
      translational studies of weight loss-independent biological mechanism(s) unique to WLS, which
      may include specific changes in bile acid signaling and in the intestinal microbiome. The
      latter would facilitate developing novel pharmacotherapies accessible to younger or less
      obese children with NASH to whom WLS is not applicable. Cumulatively, this study has the
      potential to yield significant improvements in medical and quality of life (QOL) outcomes for
      a large proportion of pediatric patients with NASH and to reduce long term health care costs
      by identifying effective treatment options and decreasing progression to cirrhosis and
      end-stage liver disease.
