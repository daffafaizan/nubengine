      restrictions in engaging in various activities are common. However, the rehabilitation seldom
      focusses on the process of change people with stroke need to go through to adapt to their
      changed capacity and reach an active life on new terms. This implies that rehabilitation
      needs to be developed to provide activity-based self-management strategies that can
      facilitate an active life. Also, there is a need to improve the access to rehabilitation by
      making use of digital e- health solutions. Based on these needs, the web-based occupational
      therapy intervention "Strategies Empowering activities in Everyday life" (SEE 1.0) has been
      developed.

      This feasibility trial has a pre-test post-test design without a control group. The trial is
      embedded in a mix- method approach combining assessment tools, feasibility registration
      forms, intervention logbooks, qualitative interviews and focus groups. The feasibility of the
      web-based intervention SEE as well as of the study design, will be evaluated in terms of
      acceptability, adherence, values and appropriateness from the perspectives of patients with
      stroke and the staff. Also, the potential outcome of SEE will be evaluated quantitatively and
      qualitatively.

      The results will support the continued development of SEE and provide for larger-scale
      research studies. The intervention, that combines a focus on empowering an active everyday
      life with a web-based format including online meetings, is innovative and is not part of
      clinical practice today. Thereby, the results can be valuable for future research and
      clinical practice in general. The study protocol and the results will be published in
      peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at conferences.
