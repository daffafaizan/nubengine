        -  to evaluate the acute response to traditional cigarettes on the respiratory system

        -  to evaluate the acute response to electronic cigarettes on the respiratory system

        -  to assess the relationship between the type of smoked cigarettes (traditional vs.
           electronic) and concentration of markers of airway inflammation released in healthy
           smokers

      Material and methods:

        -  29 healthy smokers of traditional cigarettes

        -  29 healthy smokers of electronic cigarettes

        -  29 healthy, nonsmoking volunteers

      After 8 hours of smoking abstinence:

        -  the spirometry test

        -  the first collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC I)

        -  smoking a traditional / electronic cigarette

        -  the second collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC II) - one hour after smoking

        -  the third collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC III) - six hours after
           smoking

        -  the measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress in the EBC (isoprostane-8,
           malondialdehyde MDA, IL-8) and pH of the EBC
