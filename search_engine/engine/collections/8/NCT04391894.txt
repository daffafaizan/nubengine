    
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 - efficacy and safety of ECF843 vs vehicle,
      followed by Part 2 - exploratory assessment of ECF843 vs Xiidra®.

      Part 1 uses a double-masked design where subjects will be randomized to receive BID or TID
      treatment with either ECF843 or vehicle for 56 days.

      Part 2 will be initiated only if safety and efficacy of ECF843 during Part 1 is demonstrated.
      Part 2 uses an open-label design of ECF843 versus Xiidra® for 84 days after a 2-week vehicle
      run-in phase.

      Approximately 800 subjects will need to be screened in Part 1 to have approximately 680
      subjects randomized into the 56-day treatment period.

      For Part 2, it is estimated that up to 200 subjects will need to be screened to randomize up
      to 160 subjects into the 2 treatment arms.
