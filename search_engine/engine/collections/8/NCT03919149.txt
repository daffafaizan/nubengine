      activity (PA) practice. For example, sex, age, education level, socio-professional category,
      ethnicity, overweight seemed to impact PA level in general population and among cancer
      patient.

      Beyond the disease's effect, as well as its treatment, the socio-ecological approach has
      identified five group of factors associated to PA practice: individual factors, interpersonal
      factors, environmental factors, political factors and global factors.

      The aim of this mixed methods study is to identify the variables of the socioecological model
      facilitating PA practice, as well as PA level and preferences at different time during cancer
      (at diagnose, during treatment, after treatment).
