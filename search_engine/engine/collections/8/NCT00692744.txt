      disability between microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling in the elderly population.

      Randomized multicenter trial: 2 randomized arms (clipping and coiling) plus 3 observational
      prospective arms (clipping, coiling, conservative).

      Inclusion time: 48 months. Follow up: 12 months. Monitoring: 6 months. Duration of the trial:
      66 months. Major end point: proportion of patients with unfavourable outcome at 12 months
      (mRS > 2).

      Secondary end point: Quality of life at 12 months (EORTC scale), causes of morbidity (mRS >
      2) and mortality, Dysautonomia according to the ADL and IADL scales.
