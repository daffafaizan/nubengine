      or endoluminal techniques. The investigators have extensive experience with Transoral
      Incisionless Fundoplication(TIF). TIF is not indicated in patients with a hiatal hernia
      larger than 2 cm. Performing a Hiatal Hernia Repair(HHR) in those cases will make a patient
      eligible for TIF. HHR followed immediately by the TIF procedure under the same anesthetic
      session is called a Hybrid-TIF (HTIF). The study examines the safety and efficacy of this
      approach.

      Prospective data were collected from patients who underwent HTIF at two 300 bed community
      hospitals. Questionnaires were administered before the procedure, and mailed at 6 and 12 mos.
      They were the GERD-HRQL-health related quality of life, RSI-reflux symptom index, and
      GSRS-gastrointestinal symptom rating scale.

      The study continues with the new Esophyx-Z device
