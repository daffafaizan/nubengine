      extensive carious processes or trauma that promote major coronary destruction. In such
      situations, it may be necessary to indicate intra-radicular retainers, such as fiberglass
      pins, to retain the restorative material. The aim of this study is through a randomized
      clinical trial, double blind, splithmouth, evaluate the success rate (post or dental crown
      displacement; fracture of the core/post/crown; marginal integrity and absence of endotontic
      alterations) of definitive indirect crowns un endodontically treated teeth. The composition
      of the resin cement (with and without mineral trioxide aggregate) will be evaluated. Twenty
      participants with at least two teeth with endodontic treatment with need intraradicular post
      cementation and confection of indirect dental crown (each participant) will be selected. The
      teeth will be randomly divided into 2 different groups according to resin cement composition
      (with and without mineral trioxide aggregate). Data will be collected, tabulated and
      submitted to statistical analysis.
