      peripheral and central nervous system contributions in pain processing. It is a valuable tool
      to help identify central sensitization and may be important in the treatment of chronic neck
      pain. This study is a cross-sectional study. Two groups including chronic neck pain group and
      healthy volunteers group will be arranged in this study. The healthy subjects will be matched
      for sex and age in relation to the neck pain group. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be
      measured at the neck muscle in both groups. The cold pressor test will be used in both groups
      to activate conditioned pain modulation.
