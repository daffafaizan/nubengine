    
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a relevant problem in colorectal surgery. The aim of
      this study is to implement a bundle of care in order to reduce SSIs in colorectal surgery.

      All patients undergoing colorectal surgery between October 2018 and September 2021 will be
      included in a prospective observational study. Since our colorectal bundle has been
      established gradually, patients will be grouped in a pre-implementation (2018-2019),
      implementation (2019-2020) and post implementation phase (2020-2021), in order to assess the
      effectiveness of the actions undertaken. Primary endpoint of this study will be surgical site
      infection (SSI) rate, while secondary endpoints encompass potential risk factors for SSIs. We
      assume that obesity, age, diabetes, alcoholism and smoking may lead to a higher risk for
      SSIs.
