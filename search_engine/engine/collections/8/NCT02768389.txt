    
      Primary Objective

      - Determine compliance to treatment at 6 and 12 weeks. Compliance is assessed by review of
      the daily food diary and the urine and serum ketone levels. Diet compliance is defined as
      following the diet guidelines 80% of the time with resultant ketosis 80% of the time. If 60%
      of the patients are compliant with the diet, as defined above, that is a considered a
      positive result.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  Determine patient compliance in monitoring of blood glucose and urine levels of ketosis.

        -  Determine obstacles to compliance.

        -  Determine the frequency of achieving ketosis, as measured by urine ketones checked daily
           and serum BHB checked every two weeks.

        -  Determine quality of life (FACT-BR) and adverse events.

        -  Determine response, progression free survival at 6 months (PFS 6), and overall survival
           (OS).

      Exploratory Objective

        -  To correlate levels of ketosis and blood sugar with treatment outcome.

        -  To correlate the level of MCT4 expression and IDH1 mutation status with treatment
           outcome.
