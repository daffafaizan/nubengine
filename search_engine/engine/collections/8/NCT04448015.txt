      counties, Carbon and Emery, which have high rates of OUD and overdose. This model of care
      will entail University of Utah medical clinicians providing education and webinars to
      healthcare providers in Carbon/Emery counties who care for pregnant women with OUD and their
      babies. This model of care will also help other social and behavioral health care providers
      in the area to understand how to treat and better coordinate care. No clinical services are
      being provided by University of Utah investigators or staff.
