    
      A pilot, single-center, randomized, open-label, 3 parallel groups clinical trial with 1:1:1
      assignment of interventions, comparing outcomes between patients with persistent shock
      assigned to either 1) the "Volume expansion guided by PLR-induced changes in Stroke Volume"
      strategy, or 2) the "Volume expansion guided by PLR-induced changes in Pulse Pressure"
      strategy, or 3) to usual care (i.e., without the use of any predictive index of fluid
      responsiveness). Patients in shock (either of septic, cardiac or other origin) will be
      included once passed the first hours of resuscitation. The time window for inclusion will be
      from 6 to 24 hours after the beginning of resuscitation, a delay necessary to ensure that
      initial hypovolemia has been fully compensated.

      The randomization will be stratified according to the presumed origin of shock (cardiac,
      septic, or other) and according to the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<200 or â‰¥ 200 mmHg).

      The randomly assigned intervention will be used during the first 5 days of shock (120 hours).
