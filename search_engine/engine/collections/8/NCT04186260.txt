      fastest growing Hispanic subgroup. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic
      disease associated with obesity that is highest in the nation for Mexican-American men. NAFLD
      consists of a spectrum of conditions, ranging from fatty liver to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
      Lack of physical activity and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption are risk factors for NAFLD
      and are highly evident in the Mexican-American male population. Additionally,
      Mexican-American men are at increased risk of NAFLD and liver cancer if they are carriers of
      a version of a gene (PNPLA3) found to increase risk and severity of NAFLD. In the absence of
      prescription medications, weight loss due to changes in diet and physical activity is
      recommended for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Changes in lifestyle that result in
      >5% body weight loss have been shown to improve levels of liver fat and even reverse the
      condition. Despite the clear need to develop effective intervention strategies for
      Mexican-American men, no studies to date have explored the use of health risk assessment
      strategies, including genetic risk, to motivate behavior change to reduce the risk of NAFLD
      in Mexican-American men. Consequently, this will be the first weight loss intervention for
      Mexican-American men to incorporate genetic predisposition and lifestyle risk factors of
      NAFLD (e.g., dietary sugar consumption), as a strategy to improve engagement in weight loss
      and weight maintenance behaviors.
