      classification system of acetabular fractures. The fracture pattern, its influence on the
      surgical treatment decision making process, and the radiographic and outcomes will be
      detailed. In particular, both-column acetabular fractures with significant posterior
      deformity have been correlated with poor functional outcomes, increased arthritis
      radiographically, and worse prognosis in general. Despite these findings, there has been no
      specific study evaluating these injury patterns to date. We present ten patients with both
      column acetabular fractures and an associated posterior column/wall piece and their clinical
      outcomes in an effort to help guide surgical treatment and offer prognostic guidance.
