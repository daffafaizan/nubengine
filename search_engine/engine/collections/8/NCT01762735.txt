      is the success of the colonoscopy, although with the progress of the function and the
      technique, for most patients, when facing with inexperienced examiners, conventional air
      insufflation colonoscopy is still a painful experience. Despite of the application of the
      technique of abdomen compression, position change of the patients and the sedatives or
      analgesics, to master well of the colonoscopy for the first-learners still needs much
      practice.

      Up to now, many studies has showed that compared with air insufflation colonoscopy,
      water-related colonoscopy could shorten the cecal intubation time and relieve the pain of the
      patients,especially for training the beginnersï¼Œthe effect was notable, but the present
      researches on water assisted technique has still been confined to following aspects:1.Water
      infusing was based on air insufflation; predetermined amount of water was infused ,and water
      was infused while passing through certain segment of the bowel(such as the left half of
      colon) ; 2.When training the first-learners, certain dose of sedatives or analgesics was
      injected; 3.The patients recruited were less. Colonoscopies in this study would be performed
      by in-training examiners, water would be injected completely instead of air insufflation
      while advancing the colonoscope, the amount of the water infused would not be predetermined
      but vary from individuals, and all the patients would be examined without any sedatives or
      analgesics.
