      material is the major disadvantage of conventional osteosynthesis and requires a second
      intervention, with all the complications and risks for each patient. In order to avoid this
      second surgery, it is possible to use human bone screw grafts instead of metal screws.

      The bone graft helps to create a solid, bony connection. This connection leads to an
      extension, a bone remodeling, bone installation and optimal reparation process in the
      affected area.

      The comparatively rare occurrence of suitable patients contributes to the fact that there has
      not been enough systematic research to objectively confirm the benefits of the product, which
      is why this observational study is being conducted.

      In total, 20 patients will be enrolled in several centers in Austria. The low number of cases
      and the multicenter design is due to the rarity of suitable patients.

      This observational study will use Shark ScrewÂ® grafts without exception at all participating
      centers. These grafts are manufactured by two tissue banks, the Austrian Tissue Bank
      surgebright and the German Institute for Cell and Tissue Replacement (DZIG) and were approved
      by the competent Austrian authority (AGES) in 2016.

      All patients participating in this observational study, due to a medical indication, undergo
      surgical treatment of osteochondral defects using the bone screws mentioned above.

      Postoperatively, the patients are observed over a period of 24 months. In total, there are
      five follow-up examinations during which clinical examinations, x-rays and a magnetic
      resonance tomography (MRI) is performed. In addition the KOS-ADL and IKDC Score are
      collected.
