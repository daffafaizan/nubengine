      and second day after symptom onset using repetitive MRI examinations to visualize blood brain
      barrier function and metabolic changes of the brain in 5 sub-projects, each containing a
      specific MRI protocol with one of the following new MRI sequences:

        1. T1-Dynamics (measuring disruptions of the blood-brain barrier)

        2. pH-imaging (measuring metabolic changes, acidosis)

        3. Resting-state MRI (measuring changes in the cerebral perfusion)

        4. Quantitative MRI-Angiography (quantification of blood flow in single vessels)

        5. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) for patients with Anterior Choroidal Artery
           (AChA)-Infarcts (quantification of damage of white matter tracts)

      Each sub-projects will be conducted in blocks of a specific time span. Morphological outcome
      will be assessed at day 5-7. Clinical outcome will be assessed at day 5-7 and day 90. The
      association of the new imaging parameter with the clinical and morphological outcome measures
      will be analysed. No specific intervention is assigned to the subjects by the investigators
      of the study.
