    
      This is an unblinded, open-label study with ~160 subjects with diagnosed pulmonary disease
      and ~100 healthy controls. Subjects to be enrolled will include males and females 18-80 years
      old. Evaluation will be on an outpatient basis. Imaging will be done on a single day and will
      involve administration of up to four 1-liter doses of HP 129Xe plus one 129Xe calibration
      dose (~300-400mL HP 129Xe). In addition to 129Xe MRI, a series of anatomical conventional 1H
      MR images will be collected including a localizer scan, breath-hold spin echo image, and
      breath-hold steady-state free precession image to highlight the vasculature. All subjects
      will be evaluated at one center: The University of Kansas Medical Center, KS USA.
