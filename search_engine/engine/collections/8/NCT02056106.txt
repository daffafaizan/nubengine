      algorithm-based, nurse-driven model for managing antidepressant treatment in 10 Ugandan HIV
      clinics. The model will include (1) case identification facilitated by routine depression
      screening at each clinic visit for all patients, (2) training nurses to assist primary care
      providers in implementing antidepressant treatment by performing the initial evaluation,
      monitoring symptoms and side effects, and making algorithm-based dose recommendations, and
      (3) layers of supervision and monitoring by psychiatric specialists to ensure safety and
      quality of care. This model will be implemented at 5 randomly selected clinics (protocolized
      arm), while 5 other clinics will be selected to also use routine depression screening but
      will rely on primary care providers to decide whether to further evaluate and treat
      depression (clinical acumen arm). At each site, random samples of 150 patients (total n=1500)
      who have screened positive for possible depression will be followed for 12 months. We will
      compare the two arms on depression evaluation, uptake of antidepressant treatment, and change
      in depression (treatment response). We will also examine the relationship between change in
      depression and key economic and public health outcomes (e.g. work status, condom use, HIV
      treatment adherence).
