      studies suggest that the main mechanisms are as follows:

      (1) endogenous/exogenous nephrotoxic substances;(2) metabolic factors: mainly reflected in
      the preoperative status of patients, such as obesity, low body weight, etc.;(3) hemodynamic
      factors: hemodynamic instability is an important mechanism for further renal injury process
      such as ischemia reperfusion, which is mainly reflected in: a.preoperative and postoperative
      hypotension: cardiogenic shock caused by cardiac insufficiency and low cardiac
      displacement;Non-cardiogenic shock (vasoactive drugs/allergies/postoperative bleeding);b.
      hemodynamic instability of intraoperative intervention: deep anesthesia, intraoperative blood
      loss, CPB-related intraoperative low perfusion (long CPB time, low circulation flow, low mean
      arterial pressure in CPB), embolic release (atherosclerotic emboli/air emboli), aorta and
      distal arteriotomy;(4) neurohumoral system factors: hormones such as epinephrine,
      norepinephrine, renin and thyroxine change to varying degrees during cardiac surgery and CPB,
      thus affecting the body state and systemic blood vessels;(5) inflammation and oxidative
      stress.

      Kidney is an important metabolic organ of human body. Different from cerebrovascular system,
      kidney lacks automatic regulation ability and is easily affected by perfusion flow.For
      patients at high risk of postoperative acute kidney injury, appropriate intraoperative
      perfusion may reduce the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury.

      Esophageal ultrasound was used as a means of monitoring renal blood flow to observe the
      changes in intraoperative renal hemodynamic indexes. Meanwhile, KDIGO was used as the
      standard for renal injury. AKI was divided into two groups according to whether postoperative
      AKI occurred, and the correlation between intraoperative hemodynamic changes and
      postoperative AKI in the two groups was discussed.It provides new ideas for the early
      diagnosis of postoperative acute kidney injury.
