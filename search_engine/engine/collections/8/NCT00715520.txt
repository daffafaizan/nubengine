      change in the way the nerves act in the area of the brain that controls movement. This change
      is called use-dependent plasticity. The ability of that part of the brain, called the motor
      cortex (M1), to reorganize plays a major role in the recovery of motor deficits post-stroke;
      hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative strategies that utilize this
      potential for recovery. In this proposed study, investigators will further examine influences
      of use-dependent plasticity in the non-injured M1 of healthy subjects and injured M1 of
      stroke subjects using a combination of non-invasive cortical stimulation, medication, and
      exercise techniques. In Aim 1, investigators will test the effect of drugs that interact
      specifically with different neurotransmitter systems on use-dependent plasticity in intact M1
      of healthy humans. In Aim 2, investigators will identify the parameters for non-invasive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 that are most effective to enhance
      use-dependent plasticity in intact healthy human M1. In Aim 3, investigators will test the
      drugs and rTMS protocols that were demonstrated to be most effective to enhance use-
      dependent plasticity in the Specific Aim 1 and 2 and apply them to participants who have
      experienced a stroke. Results from this study will help to inform future research about the
      efficacy of plasticity enhancing methods in injured M1 of stroke patients.
