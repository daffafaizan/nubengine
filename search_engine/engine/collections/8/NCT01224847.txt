      AMD will be evaluated for inclusion into the study. After a positive evaluation, the study
      will be explained to the patient, the Letter of Explanation reviewed with the patient and
      informed consent approved if patient agrees to participate. Demographic data of sex and age
      will be recorded. As well the number of previous intravitreal injections will be recorded (
      none, 2 - 5 and > 5 ). A nurse will then proceed to select an opaque envelope from a box of
      identical envelopes. The envelope will contain the topical anesthetic agent to be used. The
      randomization code linking each patient to their anesthetic will be stored in a secure
      location, and only accessed at the completion of the trial. The anesthetic procedure will be
      performed by someone other than the surgeon who will perform the IVT injection. After a
      minute of the anesthetic application, the surgeon, blinded to the anesthetic intervention,
      will perform the IVT injection of Ranibizumab. Immediately following the injection, a blinded
      observer will first explain the Pain Questionnaire, and then conduct it. Also at this time,
      the physician who performed the injection will complete the Wong-Baker Pain Questionnaire.
      The patient will then be asked to wait in a room for an additional 15 minutes, where the same
      observer will return and the Pain Questionnaire will be conducted a second time.
