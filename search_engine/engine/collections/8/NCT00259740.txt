      progression following their last treatment regimen. Despite newer salvage therapies, their
      treatment options are limited and may include best supportive care and investigational
      therapy. Patients with plateau-phase myeloma have a stabilized serum M-protein level without
      further tumor regression despite continued treatment. Recent evidence suggests that their
      prognosis might improve with further reduction in serum M-protein or prolongation of time to
      disease progression (TTP). These patients are candidates for investigational agents that
      could further reduce tumor burden or increase TTP.
