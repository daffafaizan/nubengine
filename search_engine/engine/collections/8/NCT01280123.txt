    
      A Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase II Study of Pioglitazone in Early
      Parkinson's Disease (PD). The patient population has early stage PD (< 5 years from
      diagnosis), must be treated with 1 mg/day of rasagiline or 10 mg/day of selegiline for at
      least 8 weeks but not more than 8 months prior to enrollment.

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the futility of pioglitazone on PD
      disease progression as measured by the change in total UPDRS score between the baseline visit
      and 44 weeks. The secondary objectives of the study are to collect additional efficacy and
      safety/tolerability data to be used in planning a subsequent Phase III trial of pioglitazone
      in early, treated PD. Measures of cognition, mood and blood- and urine-based biomarkers will
      also be explored. Subjects in this trial are randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of
      three study arms: 15 mg, 45 mg or placebo.
