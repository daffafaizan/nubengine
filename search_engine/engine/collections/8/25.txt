corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome .the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjectswere observed in this series, and 18 additional cases were summarizedfrom the literature . twenty-two of the patients were male and four werefemale . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instancesand by autopsy in the others, with 18 patients considered to haveprimary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis .the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an averagesurvival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal diseasewas indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephroticsyndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence ofpurpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid andinexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinicaland biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosiswas found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults withthe nephotic syndrome .corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the diseaseand were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the highincidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroidtherapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may behelpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt thatcorticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloidnephrotic syndrome .
