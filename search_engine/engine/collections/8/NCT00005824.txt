        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of intensive chemotherapy and autologous
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with recurrent or refractory
           AIDS-related lymphoma.

        -  Determine the response and response duration in these patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this treatment regimen on HIV RNA and CD4 cells in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive mobilization chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide IV over 2
      hours followed 2 days later by daily filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) until blood
      counts recover. Patients then undergo leukopheresis to collect CD34+ cells.

      Patients receive conditioning chemotherapy consisting of oral busulfan every 6 hours on days
      -7, -6, -5, and -4 for a total of 14 doses and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and
      -2. Patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion on day 0. G-CSF is administered IV or SC
      daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
