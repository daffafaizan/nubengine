      The objectives of this study are (1) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse
      and dissociative experiences in both psychogenic movement disorders (PMD) and non-epileptic
      seizures (NES) and (2) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse and both PMD
      and NES. The secondary objective of the study is to investigate if measures of response
      inhibition differ between PMD subjects compared to normal controls. This study is part of a
      larger study investigating the psychological and biological correlates of conversion
      disorder.

      Study population

      We intend to study adult patients with diagnoses of PMD seen by the Human Motor Control
      Section clinic or patients with diagnoses of NES seen by the Epilepsy clinic and normal
      controls.

      Design

      A psychiatric assessment, measurement scales and neuropsychological testing will be
      administered to the PMD and NES patients and normal controls.

      Outcome measures

      The first primary outcome measure will be the comparison of the different subtypes of
      childhood abuse (as measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) and the severity of
      dissociation (as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale). The second primary outcome
      measure will be the comparison of frequencies of different subtypes of childhood abuse (as
      measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) between PMD, NES and normal control groups. The
      secondary outcome measure will be the comparison of stop-signal reaction time as measured
      with the stop-signal task.
