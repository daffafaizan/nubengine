      by reducing secondary brain injury. It is hoped that this will be achieved by improving
      clinical management through the adoption of Best Practice monitoring measures. The severe
      head injury population is a disparate clinical group with varying CBF derangements, and
      complex inter-relationships between the various physiological parameters which are being
      measured. Common protocol based therapy for all head-injured patients is simplistic and
      cannot fully accommodate the variations between patients or within an individual brain. We
      believe that to improve outcome, these individual derangements and patterns have to be
      identified and the correct therapeutic combinations fashioned on an individual basis. This is
      not the current practice in Australia. The first phase of this project was completed in March
      2004 following the recruitment of ten patients. These patients were intensively monitored and
      based on the data collected and current international literature we devised a new treatment
      protocol for patients with severe head injuries. We anticipate that implementation of this
      new protocol will improve outcome.

      We aim to:

        -  further clarify what the above mentioned relationships between monitoring parameters
           are, what are the most critical ones and the effect that optimisation of these
           parameters has on brain swelling, ICP control and on clinical outcome.

        -  introduce treatment algorithms/protocols to alter the haemodynamic parameters, CPP and
           ICP and to optimise PbrO2.

        -  study the patients having decompressive craniectomy using these techniques where
           possible

        -  compare patient outcomes to previous outcome studies at the Alfred Hospital.
