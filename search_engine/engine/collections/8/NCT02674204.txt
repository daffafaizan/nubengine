    
      This is a placebo-controlled study. It will compare the effects of atorvastatin against the
      effects of a placebo (an inactive substance, such as, a sugar pill) on changes to the heart
      before and during breast cancer treatment. Participants will be in the study for
      approximately a year and a half, and the study will enroll up to 60 patients. During that
      time, there will be six visits that may coincide with standard of care visits. Participants
      will also receive telephone calls from study staff during the study intervention and a
      follow-up phase to check-in with them.
