    
      This is an observational descriptive pilot study to explore the Somanetics INVOSÂ® system
      performance. In this study the investigators will recruit a convenient number of patients, 15
      patients, that will be admitted to our ICU after liver/kidney transplantation, in a 6 month
      period.

      The Primary endpoint will be the correlation between hepatic/renal NIRS measurements and
      graft's artery resistance indices, as evaluated with ecodoppler.

      The Secondary endpoints will be:

        -  The Correlation between NIRS measurements and biochemical indicators of graft function
           (NGAL for kidney transplantation and INR, SGOT/SGPT, bilirubin, lactate for liver
           transplantation)

        -  The Correlation between NIRS measurements and SvO2 values
