      Relationship Enhancement (CARE) plus peer mentor on increasing program adoption,
      acceptability, and appropriateness among 2-6 year old children and their parents at UNC
      Children's Primary Care Clinic. The investigators will also examine the effectiveness of CARE
      plus peer mentor on dysfunctional parenting and child behavior problems. Participants will be
      randomized to CARE plus peer mentor or standard CARE. Program attendance, acceptability, and
      appropriateness will be measured upon completion of the 6-week program. Dysfunctional
      parenting and child behavior will be measured at baseline and 6 weeks. The investigators will
      conduct semi-structured interviews among a sample of parents (~20-30) in order to understand
      the impact of the peer mentors on program implementation, as well as barriers and
      facilitators to program initiation and long-term participation.
