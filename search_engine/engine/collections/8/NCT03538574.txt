      Practices for Insomnia (MAP-I ) vs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on
      outcomes of insomnia, cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, and cellular aging in
      older adult AD spousal caregivers with insomnia (N=150) over one-year follow-up. The specific
      aims of this project are:

      Primary Aim 1: Determine the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on subjective and objective
      dimensions of insomnia.

      Secondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on cellular and genomic markers of
      inflammation.

      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on markers of cellular aging.

      Exploratory Aim 1: Explore moderating effects of caregiver stress (Stress and Adversity
      Inventory, STRAIN, number & experienced intensity of stress exposure) on insomnia outcomes,
      and effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on caregiver stress, health functioning, chronic medical
      morbidity and related medication use at follow-up.
