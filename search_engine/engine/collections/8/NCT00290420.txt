      birth weight among newborns. In Bolivia, malaria is mostly caused by P. vivax. Maternal and
      foetal consequences of P. vivax infections have been poorly investigated until now, over all
      in South America. In fact, recommendations for the protection of pregnant women from malaria
      in Bolivia have not been clearly established. Prophylaxis by chloroquine is still recommended
      in other continents than Africa, mainly because chloroquine resistances are still uncommon in
      P. vivax species. The alternative way to protect women during pregnancy is to treat malaria
      attacks during antenatal visits. For this purpose, we will realize a study in order to assess
      the most appropriate way to protect women and foetus from malaria infection, i.e. weekly
      prophylaxis or mild malaria attack treatment, both by chloroquine. By realizing a randomized
      and multicentric clinical trial on 800 women in each group, we will compare the impact on
      maternal malaria attack incidence rates, on proportions of mothers with anaemia, on low-birth
      weight and on positive parasitaemias during pregnancy and at delivery, of weekly prophylaxis
      and mild malaria attack diagnosis and treatment. The study will be undertaken during 18
      months in the region of Santa Cruz and will give important information to the Bolivian
      Ministry of Health for establishing national recommendations.
