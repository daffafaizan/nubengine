    
      Keratoconus is progressive ectatic corneal disorder characterised by progressive corneal
      thinning, steep corneal curvatures and usually associated with high irregular myopic
      astigmatism.

      The major problems concerning keratoconus in young patients are;

        1. Rapid rates of progression in young keratoconic corneas as compared to adults.

        2. Poor biomechanical properties of young corneas.

        3. Poor quality of vision, which predisposes to a very poor quality of life.

        4. High rates of complications and failure post keratoplasty in young patients.

      The investigators intend to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional collagen crosslinking
      in young patients with keratoconus with regards to keratometric indices and visual acuity.
