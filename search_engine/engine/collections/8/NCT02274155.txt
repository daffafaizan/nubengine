    
      This phase Ib clinical trial uses MEDI6469 at various dose intervals prior to definitive
      surgical resection of patients with stage III and IV Oral Head and Neck Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (OHNSCC) with the primary objective of determining the safety and feasibility of
      preoperative MEDI6469 administration. In addition, tumor tissue and peripheral blood will be
      obtained for exploratory immunologic end points including measurements of tumor infiltrating
      immune cell populations based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as well as
      circulating immunological parameters that may correlate with changes induced by MEDI6469
      administration.
