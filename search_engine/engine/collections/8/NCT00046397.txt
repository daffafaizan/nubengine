    
      Phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, schedule finding study of MVA.
      The hypothesis is that MVA will be safe in humans when administered by intramuscular (IM)
      injection and will result in an immune response comparable to that observed after Dryvax
      primary vaccination. The primary objectives include: evaluating the safety of MVA
      administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on single and multidose schedules and
      identifying a schedule of MVA that provides clinical evidence of protection against vaccinia
      (Dryvax) challenge. The secondary objectives are to compare the immunogenicity of Dryvax and
      MVA as measured by vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody, ELISA, and intracellular
      cytokines assays and by a variola-specific neutralizing antibody assay that will be conducted
      at the CDC on a subset of samples.
