      Dynasplint Trismus System (DTS) for patients with trismus. Improvement of mouth opening and
      quality of life of participants using DTS will be compared to improvement of mouth opening
      and quality of life of participants using standard therapy. Standard therapy will be the use
      of tongue depressors. Crossover from standard therapy to DTS will be implemented if at three
      months there is no improvement in mouth opening when using tongue depressors.
