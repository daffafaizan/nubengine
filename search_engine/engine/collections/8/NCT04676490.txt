    
      This pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to test the feasibility and acceptability of
      providing and evaluating outcomes associated with audio-recorded, language concordant ED
      discharge instructions (the RECORD-ED intervention) among low-income parents of children
      treated for an asthma exacerbation. The study will enroll 100 children and their
      parent/caregiver with low income and/or limited English proficiency (LEP) who are being
      discharged home from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of asthma; 20 will be
      randomized to receive usual discharge care, 40 will receive a physical card with
      audio-recorded discharge instructions, in addition to usual care, and another 40 will receive
      access to audio-recorded instructions through the patient portal in addition to usual care.
      The study team will also send a brief survey to providers and nurses in the ED about the
      intervention, and conduct qualitative interviews with parents and nurses about their
      experiences using the recordable cards for discharge instructions. Primary outcomes will
      focus on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and outcome ascertainment
      protocols, as recommended for pilot studies. Parents will complete surveys at 3 time points.
      Parent outcomes (instruction recall, adherence, comfort with home care, caregiver quality of
      life), child outcomes (asthma control, including rescue medication use and school absence if
      age-appropriate), and follow-up utilization (primary care follow-up, 3-month ED and hospital
      re-visits) will be collected to inform planning for the subsequent R01 proposal.
