      Primary

        -  To assess the percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by dual x-ray
           absorptometry (DEXA) scans of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip 2 years after
           randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).

      Secondary

        -  To assess the percentage change in BMD as measured by DEXA scans of the spine (L1-L4),
           and total hip 5 years after randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).

        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop BMD of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip
           below the absolute threshold value for osteoporosis (T score â‰¤ -2.5 SD below the mean
           peak bone mass in young women) in the treatment groups.

        -  To examine the pattern of changes in BMD parameters and bone biomarkers (i.e., PINP and
           NTx) over time and the impact of covariants using exploratory longitudinal analyses.

        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop clinical skeletal fractures in the
           treatment groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual x-ray absorptometry
      (DEXA). Blood specimens are collected at baseline and at 1 year, and 5 years and stored in a
      central laboratory for future assays of the bone biomarkers.

      If the subject withdraws from the core MAP.3 study before 5 years, a bone density measurement
      and serum for bone biomarkers is obtained unless performed within the past 3 months. Patients
      may continue to be followed on the MAP.3 core study for fractures (and other MAP.3 study
      endpoints) for a minimum of 5 years after randomization.
