      with metabolic syndrome. In a cross-over design, each subject received oral arginine and
      placebo, in a randomized order, and were studied the day preceding the first day of
      administration of arginine (or placebo) and after 4 weeks of arginine (or placebo)
      supplementation. The two periods of supplementation were separated by a washout period of at
      least 4 weeks.

      The subject were studied in the morning (when before supplementation) and in a whole day
      (when after supplementation).

      The mornings cessions consisted of fasting blood draw and vascular explorations, including a
      measurement of endothelium-dependent brachial artery reactivity ("Flow mediated dilation"),
      directly coupled to a measurement of post-ischemic digital reactivity (with the Endo-PAT
      method), completed by a measurement of non-endothelium-dependent brachial artery reactivity.
      An analysis of the pulse wave geometry was also performed.

      The whole-day cession consisted of the same fasting vascular explorations. Blood tests were
      performed fasting and repeated 2, 4 and 6 h after ingestion of a high-fat meal (900 kcal).
      Measurements of Flow mediated dilation was repeated 4h and postischemic digital reactivity
      were repeated 2, 4 and 6 h after ingestion of the high fat meal.
