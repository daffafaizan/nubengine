      concentration during maintenance therapy (even if the patient is asymptomatic) compared to
      empiric dose escalation and/or reactive TDM is associated with better long-term outcomes
      including longer drug persistence, reduced risk of relapse, and fewer hospitalizations and
      surgeries. IFX dosing by weight only (i.e., mg/kg) may not be adequate for many patients as
      interindividual variability in drug clearance and other factors affecting IFX concentrations
      and PK are often not accounted for. Dosing calculators take into account all of these
      individual factors and improve the precision of dosing towards better personalized medicine.
      These systems have already been validated, and personalized dosing has shown clinical benefit
      in patients with IBD.
