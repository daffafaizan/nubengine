      activity, not only in docetaxel - sensitive tumor models, but also in tumors models in which
      docetaxel was poorly or not active. In contrast to other taxanes, cabazitaxel has the ability
      to cross the blood-brain-barrier. Marked antitumor activity was obtained in nude mice bearing
      intracranial glioblastomas. Consequently, there is a good rationale to investigate
      cabazitaxel in patients with breast or lung cancer and recurrent or progressive brain
      metastases.

      The primary object of the study is to measure objective tumor response of brain metastases
      for patients with breast or lung cancer and recurrent or progressive brain metastases.
