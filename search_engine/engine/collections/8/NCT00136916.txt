      from which Pfizer licensed Exubera, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search
      for a new marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of
      Exubera. As a result, study A2171029 was terminated on June 9, 2008. Neither safety nor
      efficacy reasons were the cause of the study termination.
