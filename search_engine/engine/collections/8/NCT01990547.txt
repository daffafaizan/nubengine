      related to deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan have fMRI brain activation patterns similar to
      those reported in other populations with PTSD. The investigators have also demonstrated
      significant improvements, or normalization, in the activation of each of these brain areas
      following exposure therapy. In this study the investigators will assess recovery in SMs
      receiving virtual reality exposure therapy, comparing them to healthy veterans, those with
      history of blast exposure and those with PTSD receiving usual care. The investigators hope to
      (1) demonstrate that fMRI can distinguish between military service members with PTSD, with
      mild TBI, and those who have neither; (2) demonstrate that significant differences are not
      seen in brain activation patterns merely by repeating fMRI scans at 3 month intervals but
      when significant changes are present they in fact represent the effect of the exposure
      therapy intervention; (3) discern whether those with PTSD after TBI have different activation
      patterns than those with PTSD in the absence of TBI; and (4) identify fMRI characteristics of
      resilience in service members who have been deployed but did not develop PTSD.
