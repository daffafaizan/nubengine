      I. To determine the maximally tolerated doses of hypofractionated and conventionally
      fractionated radiation therapy in combination with pembrolizumab and to generate an estimate
      of the efficacy of this regimen. (Safety Lead-in) II. To estimate the clinical complete
      response (CR) rate of the primary irradiated tumor in patients receiving radiotherapy and
      pembrolizumab. (Dose Expansion Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the local control rate at 6 and 12 months in each study arm. II. To estimate
      the distant metastases free survival at 6 and 12 months in each study arm.

      III. To estimate progression free survival at 6 and 12 months in each study arm.

      IV. To estimate disease-specific survival at 6 and 12 months in each study arm. V. To
      determine the safety of combining radiotherapy with pembrolizumab in each study arm in the
      dose expansion phase.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess peripheral and tumor-based biomarkers of response and resistance. II. To define
      the treatment-induced effects on circulating immune cells. III. To explore the remodeling of
      circulating T cell repertoire.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) over 5
      fractions for 14 days.

      COHORT II: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Cohort I. Patients also receive
      conventionally fractionated RT over 30 fractions for 52 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 24 months.
