      lyse autologous HIV-1-expressing cells or autologous cells infected with vaccinia vectors
      encoding HIV-1-specific proteins. Administration of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may
      help prevent HIV disease progression.

      AMENDED 03/28/94:

      Patients are not accrued at the 25 billion CTL dose. Instead, a third cohort receives three
      infusions of 1 billion CTL 5-8 weeks apart.

      AMENDED 02/14/94:

      Patients infused with 1 or 5 billion CTL will be reinfused with 1 billion CTL 6-12 months
      later, and then followed for up to 12 weeks after the reinfusion.

      ORIGINAL DESIGN:

      Fifteen patients whose cells show an HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response are
      infused with autologous, ex-vivo expanded CTLs at a dose of 1, 5, or 25 billion cells (five
      patients per dose level). If one to three patients at a given dose develop acute toxicity, an
      additional three patients will be entered at that dose. If four patients at any given dose
      develop acute toxicity, the next lower dose will be designated as the MTD (if four patients
      develop acute toxicity in the first cohort, the study will be terminated). Patients are
      evaluated during infusion and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 weeks.
