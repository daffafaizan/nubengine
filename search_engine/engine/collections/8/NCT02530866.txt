      diabetes using the Carpenter-Coustan criteria in a 1:1 fashion to either standard care or
      intensive therapy. Subjects will be randomized to either standard care or intensive therapy
      at the first study visit, which will occur between 12-32 weeks of gestation after they have
      completed their gestational diabetes testing. Neither patients nor their providers will be
      blinded to patient study group. All women will receive standard nutritional counseling at the
      time of diagnosis, and they will also be treated with either glyburide or insulin as dictated
      by standard care. Women will return for a second study visit between 32-36 weeks of gestation
      to assess the impact of their glycemic target groups on overall glycemic control. The
      investigators will also collect information on the type and dose of each medication required
      to maintain glycemic control in women randomized to either standard care or intensive
      therapy.

      In addition to standard glucose monitoring 4x/day (fasting and one-hour post breakfast,
      lunch, and dinner), the investigators will utilize blinded continuous glucose monitors (iPro,
      Medtronic) at each study visit. Because women with GDM are receiving active management of
      their blood sugars and dietary counseling, the investigators will assess CGM for 5
      consecutive days both at study enrollment and again between 32-36 weeks. Study participants
      will complete food diaries during their CGM monitoring to correlate food intake with glycemic
      variation. The investigators will also compare maternal and cord blood metabolic profiles,
      neonatal body composition, and maternal sleep quality and duration between groups.
