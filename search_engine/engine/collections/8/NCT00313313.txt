      a short-term randomized treatment period. Subjects who complete the short-term period will be
      eligible to enter the long term extension period. Also, subjects in the short-term period who
      have an elevated blood sugar that requires additional medication for blood sugar control
      (defined as rescue) will be eligible to enter the long-term treatment extension period where
      they will receive metformin.Rescue treatment with metformin is also available during the
      long-term extension period for subjects who meet glycemic criteria.
