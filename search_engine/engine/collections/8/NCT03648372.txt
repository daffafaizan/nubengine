    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors or relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The study will include 2
      phases: Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts (cancer treatment
      expansions).

      The study will enroll approximately 202 participants, approximately 70 participants in the
      dose escalation phase, approximately 132 participants in cancer treatment expansion phase.

      In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and
      pharmacodynamic data and will also determine the single agent RP2D. Participants in dose
      expansion phase will be enrolled, once RP2D is determined. There will be 6 cohorts in cancer
      treatment expansions as following:

        -  Cohort A: Nonsquamous NSCLC

        -  Cohort B: Cervical cancer

        -  Cohort C: MSS-CRC

        -  Cohort D: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL progressed or relapsed after CAR T-cells therapy

        -  Cohort E: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that have not received prior cellular therapy

        -  Cohort F: Relapsed/refractory FL

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is approximately 4 years. The overall time to receive treatment
      in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year. Based on decision of
      sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical benefit can continue treatment beyond 1
      year. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will make a final visit 30
      days after receiving their last dose of drug or before the start of subsequent anticancer
      therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up assessment.
