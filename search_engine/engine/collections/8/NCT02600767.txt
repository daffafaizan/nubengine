      antimalarial efficacy. Patients with malaria will receive supervised therapy and will be
      monitored for 28 days to check for treatment response, both clinically and parasitologically.
      A total of 81 participants â‰¥5 years old with parasitological confirmation of P. falciparum
      monoinfection will be treated under supervision with artemether-lumefantrine for three days,
      with doses according to the Brazilian guidelines for malaria control. The clinical and
      parasitological parameters will be monitored for a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate the
      efficacy of the combination therapy. Patients will be asked to come back on Days 2, 3, 7, 14,
      21 and 28 for clinical evaluation and blood tests using microscopy. A blood sample will be
      collected on filter paper on the first day and on the day of suspected failure to try to
      differentiate the parasite genotypes using techniques based on polymerase chain reactions,
      this will allow us to determine if the recurrent infection was reinfection or failure or
      recrudescence. Results of this evaluation will guide treatment policies in Brazil.
