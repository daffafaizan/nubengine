      Protocol states at chapter 9.7 that a week 24 analysis may be provided (not mandatory as per
      protocol), all data has been analyzed at week 52.

      Some of the secondary endpoints include the whole study period up to week 52 (to address
      questions on switching placebo to active drug)
