      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drugs are still being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab (MEDI4736) or
      tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved oral decitabine (ASTX 7272)
      for the participant's specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      This is a first in human study evaluating the safety of combining these different drugs.
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is part of a family of proteins that make up the immune system. The
      body generates these proteins, or antibodies, in response to foreign substances (particles
      not typically found in the body such as bacteria and viruses) and these antibodies can
      protect against infection. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is an antibody that is being studied in
      several other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to
      recognize and eliminate abnormal cells in the body.

      Investigators hope that decitabine may increase the chance of the immune system to recognize
      the cancer cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest effective dose of
      decitabine in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) to improve the natural ability of the
      immune system to recognize and target head and neck cancer cells.
