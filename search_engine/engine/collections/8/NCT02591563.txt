    
      A prospective evaluation of bacterial pathogens Streptococcus. pneumoniae, Haemophilus
      influenzae, Moraxella. catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus and their antibiotic
      susceptibility when colonizing the nasopharynx and/or causing acute otitis media in the years
      2015-2025. The goal will be to recruit children into a prospective group beginning at 6
      months of age and followed to 36 months of age in suburban Rochester, New York.
      Nasopharyngeal and nasal wash samples will be obtained at each well child visit and at acute
      otitis media (AOM) episodes. Middle ear fluid will be obtained from every child with an acute
      otitis media episode who undergoes a tympanocentesis procedure. All of the nasopharyngeal and
      middle ear fluid samples collected will be tested by standard microbiologic techniques to
      identify the presence of 4 potential otopathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M.
      catarrhalis and S. aureus). All S. pneumoniae will undergo serotyping and antibiotic
      susceptibility testing. All samples that are culture negative will be evaluated with a
      multi-locus PCR test to examine for presence of potential otopathogens.
