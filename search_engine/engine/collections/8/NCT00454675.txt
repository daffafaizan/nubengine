      decreasing in the US population. Smoking cigarettes is the leading risk factor for COPD.
      Smokers with chronic bronchitis may show early or late changes of COPD on pulmonary function
      tests. It is imperative that we define this patient population to determine whether early
      intervention will alter pulmonary function over the years.
