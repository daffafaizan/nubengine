    
      This trial will be a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group design study
      of treatment with metformin on the primary outcome of safety/tolerance with secondary outcome
      measurements of the effects on cognition (encompassing social and repetitive behavior),
      attention, anxiety, and physiological and biochemical biomarkers of patients with FXS. FXS
      represents a well-defined population of ASD in which to test a specific targeted treatment
      looking at a well-defined set of cognitive and bioassay measures.

      Trial length is designed to have a chance at seeing if the medication can improve cognitive
      outcome measures. The study duration includes the screening period and a 24-week single-blind
      drug/placebo phase.
