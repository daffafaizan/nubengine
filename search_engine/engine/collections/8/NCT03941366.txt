      time interval between neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and transanal local excision will increase
      the percentage of patients with pathologic complete remission.

      This is a prospective pilot study to examine the impact of two variables: 1) addition of
      neo-adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy, and 2) increasing the time interval between completion of
      chemo-radiotherapy and subsequent surgery, on the rate of achieving pathologic complete
      remission with avoidance of radical resection while maintaining an excellent local control
      with improvement of quality of life.

      All procedures in this study are standard of care, the study question relates to the use of
      neo-adjuvant FOLFOX and the timing between the end of radiation and surgery.
