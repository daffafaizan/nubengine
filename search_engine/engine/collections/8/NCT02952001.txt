    
      This is a non-interventional, observation extension study of up to 6 months for subjects
      completing the Parent study. The Parent study is a Phase 3, multicenter study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of 4 mg of CLS-TA administered via suprachoroidal injection compared to a
      sham procedure in the treatment of subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious
      uveitis.

      The study design of the Extension study includes 4 clinic visits over a maximum of 24 weeks.
      Subject eligibility will be established at Visit 1 during the crossover day from the Parent
      study to the extension study (Day 0). Follow-up visits will be conducted every 6 weeks up to
      24 weeks (Visit 4). At Visit 4, subjects will have a final evaluation conducted 24 weeks
      following study entry (48 weeks from Parent study randomization).

      This study was initiated prior to the completion of the parent study, therefore treatment
      assignment was masked prior to study entry.
