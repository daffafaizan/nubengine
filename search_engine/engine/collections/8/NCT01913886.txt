      world. Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem
      cells to treat heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into
      endothelial cells and participate in the development of new blood vessels in the heart
      damaged. Therefore, MSCs has shown promise for heart repair. The investigators study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      to repair heart function in patients with myocardial ischemia.
