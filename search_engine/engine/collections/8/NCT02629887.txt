      of 2500gms will be approached for consent to randomize their infant to resuscitation with
      mask or non-inflatable supraglottic airway (NISGA) if resuscitation is required. Study
      personnel in delivery will open sequential envelopes with randomized code to indicate which
      device is to be used if necessary. The resuscitator will be blinded until determination of
      need of respiratory support. At that time, the appropriate randomized device (face mask or
      NISGA) will be handed to the resuscitator for use along with T-Piece resuscitator. Video data
      capture will be used to record type, length and response to resuscitation. This information
      will be translated to a database prior to destruction of video.
