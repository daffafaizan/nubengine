      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence of catheter-related infections (Staphylococcal and Candida) in
           patients at high risk for a catheter-related infection treated with heparin vs
           minocycline hydrochloride and edetate calcium disodium (M-EDTA).

      Secondary

        -  Compare the incidence of catheter occlusions in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to type of catheter (tunneled central venous catheter [CVC] vs
      nontunneled percutaneous CVC) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive minocycline hydrochloride and edetate calcium disodium (M-EDTA)
           flush solution into the CVC once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive heparin flush solution into the CVC once daily. Treatment in
           both arms continues for up to 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or until
           the removal of the catheter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
