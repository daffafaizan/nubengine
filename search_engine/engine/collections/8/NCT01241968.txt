      ischemic tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a
      shockwave applicator device. The treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment.
      The shockwaves are delivered in synchronization with Patient R-wave to avoid arrhythmias. The
      treatment is painless.

      At first, the patient undergoes Stress-Echocardiography testing to identify the hypokinetic
      areas (ischemic areas). Following that, the ischemic areas sre treated with shockwaves.
      Several treatments are required for optimal results.
