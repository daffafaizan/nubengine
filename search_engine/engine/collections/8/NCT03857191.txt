      obese are independent risk factors for OSA, and the prevalence increases with body mass index
      (BMI). Weight loss after bariatric surgery is one treatment for OSA, 75% of patients having a
      reduction in OSA severity or becoming non-apneic. OSA and obesity both induce type 2
      diabetes, hypertension and/or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A randomized study
      (Chirinos et al. NEJM 2014) demonstrated a better improvement in blood pressure, triglyceride
      levels or insulin resistance with weight loss alone or weight loss associated with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) than with CPAP alone. We hypothesize a similar effect of
      nutritional and psychocomportemental rehabilitation on OSA. However, weight loss and blood
      pressure improvements could be lesser in untreated OSA patients than in treated OSA or
      non-OSA patients. It has been demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduces medication use such
      as antihypertensive or antidiabetic drugs, and thus a secondary objective is to determine
      whether nutritional and psychocomportemental rehabilitation similarly reduces medication use
      by the overweight and obese.
