      completing the survey, the participants will be randomized into an intervention or a control
      group. The intervention group will be invited to attend a group meeting at weeks 1, 6 and 12
      (3-month mark) which will take place at the EPIC center. These meetings will help
      participants create effective goals and methods on maintaining their motivation to exercise
      regularly. The participants will then receive a monthly phone call follow-up at months 4-6.
      The purpose of these meeting/follow-ups is to serve as a review of the worksheet, address any
      questions and help make any modification plans if necessary. Participants in the control
      group will be simply encouraged to exercise at the EPIC center and complete the online
      surveys. Participants in the control group will receive the skills/tactics at the end of the
      study. As members of the EPIC center, all participants will have access to four weekly
      supervised sesssions for three months.
