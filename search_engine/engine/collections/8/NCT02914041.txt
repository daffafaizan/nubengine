    
      1. To further develop an innovation to measure kyphosis using distance from the wall, a
           Kyphosis wall distance tool (KypDisT).

        2. investigate validity of the measurements in terms of 2.1 Concurrent validity of
           conventional C7WD and KypDisT as compared to a gold standard (Cobb's method).

           2.2 Discriminative ability of conventional C7WD and KypDisT on functional abilities in
           elderly with different severity of kyphosis.

        3. To investigate the reliability of the measurements in terms of 3.1 Test-retest
           reliability of conventional C7WD and KypDisT. 3.2 Reliability of conventional C7WD and
           KypDisT comparing among physical therapy, VHS and caregiver.

        4. To explore the distance to indicate risk of spinal fracture to indicate a risk of spinal
           fracture.
