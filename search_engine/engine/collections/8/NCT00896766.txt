        -  Identify regions of copy number abnormalities (CNA) and uniparental disomy in leukemic
           lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
           using Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 500K array sets. (Pilot project)

        -  Identify regions of CNA and loss-of-heterozygosity using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays.
           (Expansion project)

        -  Define gene expression profiles for leukemic lymphoblasts using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0
           arrays.

        -  Assess the global expression of microRNAs in leukemic lymphoblasts using microRNA gene
           chips.

        -  Utilize array-generated gene expression data and data for CNAs and uniparental disomy to
           prioritize candidate genes and genomic regions for resequencing.

        -  Characterize epigenomic profiles using the HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by
           Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay. (Expansion project)

        -  Discover candidate therapeutic targets for these patients by identifying genes that are
           consistently mutated in leukemic lymphoblasts using high-throughput focused gene
           resequencing. (Pilot project)

        -  Discover candidate therapeutic targets for these patients by next generation sequencing
           technologies, including whole genome, whole transcriptome, and whole exome. (Expansion
           project)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Banked biological samples (bone marrow and peripheral blood) are analyzed using gene
      expression profiling, single-nucleotide polymorphism and genotyping assays, DNA copy number
      and loss of heterozygosity estimates, epigenetic profiling, and gene resequencing.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patient samples will be accrued for this study.
