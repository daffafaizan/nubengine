      literature on the use of budesonide in the prevention of altitude sickness. It will be
      conducted using healthy participants overseen by experienced wilderness medicine and altitude
      researchers from the Altitude Research Center at University of Colorado Denver. Participants
      will be recruited from the Denver community and prescreened for eligibility via phone. 100
      participants, after consenting, will have baseline data and blood collected and will begin
      budesonide therapy 72 hours prior to being taken from Denver to Pikes Peak, where they will
      be observed at altitude for 18 hours. Patients will have the opportunity to withdraw consent
      at any time and will be monitored continuously by physician-researchers. Data collection and
      blood draws will be performed at specific time points and analyzed for efficacy of budesonide
      vs. placebo in the incidence of altitude sickness.
