    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled, single blind, superiority trial
      that will include 25 international sites. The investigators aim to enroll 784 subjects with
      true coronary bifurcation lesions in native coronary arterial segments.

      All patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions suitable for angioplasty will undergo 1:1
      randomization either to PS (provisional stenting)-DCB or PS-NCB (noncompliant balloon) group
      using a randomization schedule blocked by site.

      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
      per protocol and will further undergo angiography after successful stenting of the main
      vessel with ostium side branch visually estimated stenosis â‰¥70%. Data and images will be
      collected during the index procedure, during re-intervention in the case of clinically driven
      revascularization, and at the predefined 12-month clinical follow-up visit. All subjects will
      also undergo angiographic follow-up at 13 months.
