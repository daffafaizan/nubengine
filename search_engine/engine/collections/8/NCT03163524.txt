      reproductive health (SRH) services among clients who call into Marie Stopes Uganda's free
      hotline. The study seeks to achieve this goal by using behavioural economics to design
      interventions to increase redemptions of e-coupons distributed to hotline clients. The
      intervention will include modifying the text message sent to e-coupon recipients as well as
      sending follow-up texts reminding clients to use their coupons. The impact of the
      intervention will be evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The intervention
      will be implemented and data will be collected regularly over a period of approximately 12
      months. Strict confidentiality procedures in line with Marie Stopes International's best
      practices will be put into place to ensure that information made public or otherwise
      distributed outside the principle investigators and other key personnel cannot be linked to
      any individual respondents. Results from the study will be published in a report, among other
      outputs, and the outcomes will be shared within MSI as well as with the wider SRH community.
