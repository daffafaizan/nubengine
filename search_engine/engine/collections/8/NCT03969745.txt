      physical activity and dietary patterns. This was done using food diaries, interstitial
      glucose monitors and a combined heart rate + accelerometer device. Participants consumed a
      standardised evening meal ~12h before visiting the laboratory to assess their metabolic
      response to a liquid test meal (1g/kg bodyweight dextrose and 0.4g/kg bodyweight protein)
      using the arterio-venous forearm balance model. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans,
      indirect calorimetry measurements and fasted and postprandial vastus lateralis biopsies were
      also obtained.

      From the next day, participants either restricted their daily energy intake window to between
      8 am and 4 pm or were prescribed a caloric deficit diet (~400 kilocalories/day) for two
      weeks. Physical activity, interstitial glucose concentrations and dietary patterns were
      monitored throughout. After this, participants visited the laboratory again to assess changes
      in metabolism and body composition.
