      recurrent vascular events, poor functional outcomes, and long-term mortality. Despite its
      high prevalence, OSA often remains underdiagnosed after stroke. While in-laboratory
      polysomnography studies are the gold standard for diagnosing OSA, their use is limited by the
      lack of availability, patient unwillingness to sleep overnight at a laboratory and high
      costs. Home-based PSMs can accurately diagnose OSA and are much more accessible, convenient
      and low-priced compared to in-laboratory sleep studies.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether broad screening for OSA using PSMs,
      as compared to usual care, increases the proportion of patients diagnosed with treatable OSA
      after stroke or TIA. Secondary aims include whether screening with PSMs increases the
      proportion of patients treated for OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and
      whether functional outcomes and sleep-related outcomes are improved. Finally, the study will
      also determine whether this approach is cost-effective.
