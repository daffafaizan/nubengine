      the world's adult population. Individuals with this condition have twice the risk of
      cardiovascular disease and die from it, compared with those who do not and 5 times more
      likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). For this reason, it is appropriate to
      develop better tools for prevention and management of MS, with more emphasis on lifestyleÂ´s
      changes. Chia has been studied in the past 10 years due to its high concentration of omega-3
      alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and 6 linoleic acid (LA) showing beneficial effects in some
      components of MS in rodents and individuals. The addition of chia to the conventional
      treatment of MS for the modification of metabolic disorders provides us a tool for easy
      incorporation into daily life, inexpensive and accessible in our environment.
