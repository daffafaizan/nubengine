      between benign and malignant tumors in breast tissue. These studies demonstrated an increase
      in the choline metabolite peak that reflects an increase in choline-containing metabolites in
      70-80% of breast carcinomas, as compared to 14-18% of benign breast tumors.The objectives
      would be to determine sensitivity/specificity of MRS in the context of breast CA, We will use
      normal volunteers to test software and to develop and optimize MR scan sequences prior to or
      during the testing of target subjects with suspicious breast lesion.
