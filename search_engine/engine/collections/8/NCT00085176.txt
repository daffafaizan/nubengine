        -  Compare neurobehavioral functioning, specifically memory, attention, executive function,
           visual-motor integration, and processing speed, in children previously treated with
           steroids (prednisone vs dexamethasone) and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate alone vs
           methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone) for childhood acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia.

        -  Correlate non-treatment risk factors, such as gender, age at diagnosis, and time since
           termination of prior therapy, with impaired neurobehavioral function in these patients.

        -  Correlate neurobehavioral complications with quality-of-life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, cohort study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts (prior
      treatment per CCG-1922 [prednisone vs dexamethasone] vs prior treatment per CCG-1952
      [intrathecal (IT) methotrexate vs IT methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone]). Patients
      in each cohort are stratified according to age at diagnosis, gender, and time since prior
      treatment termination.

        -  Cohort A (CCG-1922): Patients undergo physical and neurological examination,
           neurobehavioral evaluation, and quality of life assessment. Neurobehavioral evaluations
           assess memory, attention, and executive function.

        -  Cohort B (CCG-1952): Patients undergo evaluation as above. Neurobehavioral evaluations
           assess visual-motor integration and processing speed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 448 patients (224 per cohort) will be accrued for this study
      within 4 years.
