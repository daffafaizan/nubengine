      sildenafil, an FDA approved drug for pulmonary hypertension, will decrease inflammation in
      the lung. Even if a smoker stops smoking, the harmful effects caused by previous smoking may
      recruit inflammatory cells to those affected areas, leading to lung injury. In about 30-40%
      of smokers, this inflammation combined with irregular blood flow in the lungs may lead to
      emphysema. The study goal is to measure and compare individual responses to smoking
      cessation, Sildenafil and placebo used three times per day, and imaging of the lungs using
      non-contrast and contrast CT scans to see if there is a possible decrease of inflammation and
      an increase of blood flow in the lungs. The study also intends to see if using Sildenafil
      three times per day, in addition to smoking cessation will restore blood flow to the possible
      injured areas of the lungs. Sildenafil is an FDA approved medication for pulmonary
      hypertension but will be used off-label to study the effects it may or may not have on the
      blood flow in possible injured areas of the lungs. Non-smokers will be enrolled to compare
      lung imaging and the effects of Sildenafil on their lungs with that of smokers undergoing a
      smoking cessation program with placebo or Sildenafil. Non-smokers will complete identical
      measurements as smokers, with Sildenafil used three times per day or no medication across a
      similar 90 day period of time. Vascular measurements of pulse wave velocity, carotid artery
      compliance/stiffness and pressure wave reflection will be done at baseline and 90 day visits.
