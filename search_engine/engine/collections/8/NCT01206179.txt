      problematic. The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in
      a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third
      and sixth month after the fracture. Nonunion is a serious complication of a fracture,
      occurring in 2-10% of patients, as it is associated with high economic and health burden.
      Many cases are subsequently approached by multiple surgical and nonsurgical modalities.
      Various devices, under the name of "bone growth stimulators" have been used to enhance
      healing of the fracture. Recent studies, demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      in regeneration of bone and cartilage tissue. In this study percutaneous injection of
      mesenchymal stem cells to the site of fracture is performed as an outpatient procedure or
      during an operative exposure to evaluate its efficacy in enhancing bone regeneration. In the
      case of small size of bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the callus of
      fracture site through an outpatient procedure under the guide of fluoroscopy. If there is a
      large bone gap, through a surgical management, mesenchymal stem cells seeded on bone matrix
      are placed at the site of fracture. Patients are followed by X-Ray examination 1,2,6, and 12
      months after treatment.
