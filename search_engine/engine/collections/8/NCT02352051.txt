    
      The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Atomoxetine(ATX) and osmotic
      release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) therapies on executive functions, activities,
      treatment response time and adverse effects based on discernible clinical effects in children
      with combined type attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      In this study, the functional capabilities of the patients who clinically responded well to
      therapy were assessed simultaneously with clinical response that may appear at different time
      periods and the treatment groups were compared in patients who responded to therapy by
      excluding patients with insufficient clinical response.
