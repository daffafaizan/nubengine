    
      One hundred and fifty patients with Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum or the
      colon, in clinical remission defined by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index below 150 and
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index below 5, with or without endoscopic activity defined by simplified
      endoscopic activity score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) will be included in this study (75
      patients with a complete mucosal healing defined by SES-CD below 3 and 75 with endoscopic
      activity defined by SES-CD above 6) in multiple centers specializing in the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel diseases in Brazil; Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap
      electronic data capture tools hosted at the Clinical Hospital of University of S達o Paulo.
      REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to
      support data capture for research studies. All thrombin generation tests will be performed at
      the Clinical Hospital of University of S達o Paulo, S達o Paulo, SP through automatically
      calibrated Thrombogram (CAT- Calibrated Automated Thrombogram速, Maastricht, The Netherlands),
      with and without thrombomodulin. Those patients will be followed for at least one year after
      the colonoscopy with measurement of the D-dimer and clinical evaluation every 3 months to
      verify the developing of deep vein thrombosis.
