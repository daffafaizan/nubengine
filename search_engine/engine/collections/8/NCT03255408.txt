      and ventilatory chemoreflexes i.e. Acute Ventilatory Response to Hypoxia (AHVR) and Acute
      Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response (HCVR) before, during and after sleep under normoxic
      conditions and sleep accompanied by isocapnic Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) among healthy human
      study participants.

      A pharmacological intervention will be utilized to manipulate the CBF in a randomized order.
      The study participants will also be randomly assigned the order to sleep either under
      normoxia or IH exposure. The experiments will be separated from one another with an interval
      of sufficient drug and IH exposure washout period. The venous blood samples and urinary
      samples will be collected for the vascular biomarkers.
