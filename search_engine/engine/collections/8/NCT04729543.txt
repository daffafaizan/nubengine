      (MC2), and use T cells with a young phenotype. MC2 is highly expressed in melanoma (MEL) and
      head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSSC), but not in healthy adult tissues. The
      investigators isolated MC2-specific TCRs from MEL patients who showed clinical responses
      following vaccination that were accompanied by significant frequencies of anti-MC2 CD8 T
      cells in blood and tumor without apparent side effects. Following extensive evaluation of in
      vitro anti-tumor and self-reactivities, the investigators have selected a TCR that recognizes
      the ALK epitope in the context of HLA-A2 for clinical development. Furthermore, preclinical
      studies showed that epigenetic pretreatment of tumor cells, but not normal cells,
      up-regulated MC2 gene expression and resulted in enhanced recognition of MC2 by the selected
      TCR. In parallel to the above studies, the investigators renewed their GMP protocol to
      process T cells, using stimulating antibodies and cytokines, to generate T cells with a young
      phenotype.

      In the current phase I/II study, the investigators explore the safety and anti-tumor efficacy
      of T cells engineered with the selected TCR in patients with MC2-positive MEL and HNSSC. The
      study contains the following unique elements:

        -  CGA not targeted before by T cell therapy

        -  New T cell processing method to generate young T cells

        -  Pretreatment of patients with epigenetic drugs

        -  No chemotherapy prior to T cell infusion
