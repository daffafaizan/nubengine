    
      Currently two different brands of modified-release formulations are providing 50% immediate
      release beads/pellets and 50% extended release beads/pellets, resulting in a rapid onset and
      dual peak concentrations of plasma methylphenidate. One is manufactured by Novartis, the
      other one by Medice (Germany).

      The objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that the Novartis product is superior to
      placebo and is clinically not inferior to the formulation manufactured by Medice.
