      people who have Advanced Malignancies.

      The study enrolled approximately 198 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the
      following dose regimens in the Dose Escalation Phase to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD):

        -  MLN0128 QD

        -  MLN0128 QW

        -  MLN0128 QDx3dQW

        -  MLN0128 QDx5dQW

      MLN0128 capsule, orally, once daily (QD) or Once weekly (QW) in the Dose Escalation Phase
      until MTD was established.

      Once MTD was determined, participants were then enrolled in the Dose Expansion Phase to
      receive:

        -  MLN0128 5 mg QD

        -  MLN0128 30 mg QW

        -  MLN0128 40 mg QW

      This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was approximately 244 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
