        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine in combination with trastuzumab
           (Herceptin) in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing unresectable or metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer (closed to accrual as of 4/16/01) or refractory locally
           advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of this regimen in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vinorelbine.

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8, and trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 8 and 15 of course 1 and days 1, 8, and 15 of all
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
