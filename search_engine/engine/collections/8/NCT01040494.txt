      have favorable neurohumoral effects in patients with heart failure (HF) Objective：To study
      the effects of add-on aliskiren treatment in patients with HF on components of arterial load,
      from central aorta to peripheral arterioles and biomarkers Methods：Patients with NYHA Class
      II to IV HF, who have been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and beta-blocker are randomized to 6 months of treatment
      with placebo or aliskiren (150mg per day) treatment. Components of arterial load, from
      central aorta to peripheral arterioles as well as a wide-range of biomarkers, including
      inflammatory biomarkers, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, arterial remodeling
      markers (procollagen, matrix metalloproteinase) will be measured before, 2 months and 6
      months after treatment.

      What is New or Innovative in this study? The importance of central hemodynamics and biomarker
      changes in patients with HF has been shown in observation studies. This is the first
      randomized control trial that examines comprehensively the effects of a direct rennin
      inhibitor on central hemodynamics and biomarkers in HF patients who are receiving standard
      heart failure therapy.
