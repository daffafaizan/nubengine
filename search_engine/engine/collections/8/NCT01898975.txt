      outcome and organ function. Many reports have focussed on evaluation of fluid responsiveness
      using various parameters such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation
      (SSV) derived from invasive or semi-invasive monitoring. Recently developed, non invasive
      cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous
      cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on thorax. Moreover, CO and SSV
      derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a
      predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal
      inconclusive patients using gray zone approach.
