      study visits at Week 1, Week 8, and Week 15. The study visits involve at-home surveys, voice
      recordings, physical measures (height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure), EEG
      recordings (including recordings of electrodermal activity and heart rate variability),
      computer tasks, in-lab saliva collection, overnight urine collection, 2-day saliva collection
      at bed waking, 30 minutes post-waking, afternoon, and bedtime, and a small handheld device
      that randomly administers eight short assessments in the subjects' natural environment.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive a 6-week mindfulness meditation course either between
      the first and second study visits or between the second and third study visits. Participants
      who receive training during the first and second visits will continue meditating until the
      third visit. The one-on-one instruction occurs once a week for 1 Â½ hours, and participants
      are asked to listen to guided meditations and do other mindfulness-based tasks on a daily
      basis between sessions.
