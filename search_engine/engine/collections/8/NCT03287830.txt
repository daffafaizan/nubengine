      effectiveness trial and the 2nd (September 2018-April 2019) as a replication study. This
      approach tests that the intervention effects can be replicated across seasons, during which
      the severity and incidence of influenza disease may vary. Eligible parents will have a child
      who received his/her first vaccine dose and is in need of 2 doses that season. Current
      recommendations require 2 doses for certain children 6 months through 8 years old. Within
      each practice site, parents will be randomized to receive either: 1) text message reminders
      embedded with influenza vaccine health-literacy promoting information, or 2) usual care.
      Randomization is to be stratified by practice site, age (6-23 months, 2-8 years) and language
      (Spanish, English).
