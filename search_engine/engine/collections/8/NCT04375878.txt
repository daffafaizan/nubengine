    
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2, 2x2 crossover study assessing the safety and
      efficacy of MS1819, 2240 mg/day vs porcine PERT, and 4480 mg/day vs porcine PERT given at the
      same dose and dosing regimen that was being administered during the pre-study period. MS1819
      will be administered in enteric capsules.

      MS1819 will be assessed in a 2x2 crossover including approximately 30 patients completing
      both periods. Fifteen patients will be randomized to the MS1819 2240 mg/day vs PERT arm, and
      15 patients will be randomized to the MS1819 4480 mg/day vs PERT arm. Patients in each arm
      will further be randomized to receive either the sequence consisting of MS1819 for 3 weeks
      followed by PERT for another 3 weeks or the opposite sequence of treatments, PERT for 3 weeks
      followed by MS1819 for another 3 weeks.The coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) will be
      measured at the end of each 3 week study period. Patients enrolled into the extension phase
      (EP) will be composed of patients who have completed the crossover phase of OPTION 2.
