      versus oral vinorelbine and carboplatin in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. The purpose is to
      explore the role of TKI in neoadjuvant therapy, and to further improve disease-free survival
      (DFS) and pathologic complete remission (pCR) in EGFR-mutant populations; and reduce surgical
      complications and mortality.

      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of oral gefitinib versus neoadjuvant vinorelbine and
      carboplatin in operable stage II-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-squamous NSCLC patients, with a 2-year
      disease-free survival rate. 2yDFS).

      Secondary objective: To evaluate pCR, 0RR, and other efficacy measures (safety, complete) for
      oral gefitinib vs. neoadjuvant vinorelbine and carboplatin in patients with operable stage
      II-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-squamous cell carcinoma NSCLC. Resection rate, tumor regression,
      mediastinal lymph node clearance, perioperative complications, and mortality rate).
