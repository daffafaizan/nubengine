    
      A retrospective review of medical records for eleven (11) premenopausal women who had been
      treated with the new hysteroscopic morcellator was conducted at four hospital or ambulatory
      surgical center sites. Four physicians performed hysteroscopic operative procedures to remove
      intrauterine polyps, type 0 (completely within the uterine cavity), type I (mostly within the
      cavity) and type II (< 40% within the cavity) submucous myomas. Percent pathology removed,
      total morcellation time, total fluid used, fluid deficit and treatment-related adverse events
      were assessed. Each of the four treating physicians also evaluated device performance using a
      10 point scale (1 = "poor" and 10 = "excellent").
