      risk for clinically postoperative inflammatory complications as a basis for future
      mechanism-based intervention studies.

      Combining detailed immune assessment from cell-receptors to cell expression, cytokines, and
      complications with a temporal aspect is innovative and provides highly warranted novel
      multidimensional immunological insight.

      METHODS Adult patients scheduled for PD on the suspicion of pancreatic cancer excluding
      patients receiving immunomodulating treatment 1 month properatively and/or autoimmune
      diseases. Patients scheduled for simultaneous procedures on major blood vessels, and/or
      adjacent organs (spleen, liver) are also not included. Inoperable patients, for instance, due
      to carcinosis, circulatory/ventilatory instability hindering procedure completion and/or
      concomitant surgery on major blood vessels, spleen, or liver, are excluded post-inclusion and
      will not be part of the primary analysis. Patients eligible for inclusion will be identified
      before their appointment at the Gastrosurgical Dept., Rigshospitalet which is the largest DK
      and North-European center with about 200 PD/yr annually.

      Primary outcome:

      Persistent postoperative hypotension, defined as need for vassopressor infussion on the
      morning after surgery to maintain middle arterial bloodpressure >65 mmHg
