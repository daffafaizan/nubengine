      neuromuscular block. The conventional MMG measures the exact force of muscle contraction in
      response to electric stimulation of the ulnar nerve. MMG quantifies the neuromuscular
      function by measurement of the force displacement. However the equipment is rather bulky,
      takes time to set up, requires a rigid support of the arm in an often-crowded operating room.
      This limits its clinical use in the daily anesthesia practice. Acceleromyography is based on
      the acceleration of a piezo-electrode. A new NMT module from (Shenzhen, People's Republic of
      China.) claims to measure 3 directional accelerography. The aim of the study is to compare
      the neuromuscular block of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (twice the 95% effective dose, ED95)
      monitored by the NMT to that monitored by the Relaxometer Mechanomyograph in Group 1, and
      versus TOF-Watch Acceleromyograph in Group 2 to clinically evaluate the new system for its
      diagnostic accuracy.
