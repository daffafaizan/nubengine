      evidence suggests that stress may hasten HIV disease progression by increasing viral
      replication and suppressing the immune response. Stress management intervention studies using
      more complex combinations of cognitive and relaxation therapies have shown improvements in
      both psychological and physiological measures in HIV infected persons. However, no studies
      have focused on only one intervention or have addressed the spiritual component using a
      comparable control group to determine which of these interventions is most effective.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a spiritually-based cognitive
      intervention to an educational control group. The intervention will be given over a 10-week
      period, with 5 weekly classes, 4 weekly automated phone calls, and one final class meeting.
      Assessments will be conducted at pre-intervention, fifth class midpoint, tenth week
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Time commitment can vary from 6 months to 9 months,
      depending on when participants are screened.
