      survival, reduced treatment tolerance and reduction in QoL. In recent studies, low-normal BMI
      have worse outcome (overall mortality) in cardiovascular, malignant, chronic disease (So
      called "obesity paradox") BMI is simple method but hard to define body composition because
      BMI is based on only weight and height. Skinfold thickness is strongly associated with body
      fatness than BMI. In this study, the ivestigators aim to demonstration of relationship
      between triceps skinfold thickness and overall survival of pancreatic cancer,
      cholangiocarcinoma and GB cancer.
