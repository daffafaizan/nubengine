    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Propel mometasone
      furoate implant when used following Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) in patients
      with Chronic Sinusitis (CS). The Propel implant is designed to provide a mechanical spacing
      function within the sinus anatomy to separate mucosal tissues, provide stabilization of the
      middle turbinate, and thereby prevent tissue adhesions from forming. The implant is coated
      with a small amount of mometasone furoate (a corticosteroid) in order to help minimize post
      surgical inflammation within the supported tissues.

      The study utilizes an intra-patient control design to assess the safety and efficacy of the
      drug-coated implant compared to the non-drug coated implant that is identical in appearance.
