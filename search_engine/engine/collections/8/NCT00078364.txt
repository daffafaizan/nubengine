      involved in the perception of pain. It has made it possible to identify areas of the brain
      that are involved in the perception of experimental pain but very few studies have evaluated
      the sites in the brain that are activated during clinical pain and the effects of analgesic
      drugs. The proposed study will use the surgical removal of an impacted third molar as a model
      of acute clinical pain to identify sites that are activated following the offset of local
      anesthesia and to examine the effects of the NSAID analgesic ketorolac on attenuating sites
      that are activated as pain is relieved. Scans will be performed under non-pain baseline
      conditions, and again immediately following surgery as the local anesthetic wears off,
      clinical pain occurs, and following administration of the NSAID ketorolac. Differences among
      subjects in the amount of pain reported and brain activation will be compared to subjects'
      prior ratings of experimental pain and the presence of any genetic polymorphisms that are
      related to pain perception, inflammation, known pain pathways, or psychological factors
      related to pain. The findings from this research may help to reveal how pain is appreciated
      in the central nervous system, pharmacologically modified by NSAID analgesics and differs
      among individuals due to genetic factors.
