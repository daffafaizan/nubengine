        -  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of docetaxel and vandetanib relative to docetaxel
           alone in patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent, refractory, or
           progressive/persistent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer,
           as measured by progression-free survival.

        -  To evaluate the response rate (complete and partial) and duration of overall survival of
           these patients.

        -  To evaluate the response (complete and partial) and time to treatment failure after
           treatment with single agent vandetanib following progression on single agent docetaxel.

        -  To evaluate the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common Toxicity
           Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v4.0.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of single agent vandetanib following docetaxel as assessed by
           CTCAE v4.0.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with antiangiogenesis agents
      (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who progress
           also receive oral vandetanib once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in
           the absence of a second disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral vandetanib once
           daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
