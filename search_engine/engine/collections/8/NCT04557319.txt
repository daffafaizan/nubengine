    
      Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare potentially life-threatening genetically determined
      disease associated with a deficiency or impairment of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 inhibitor)
      functional activity. Main clinical manifestations of HAE are recurrent mucous membranes edema
      and localization of the derma deep layers. Attack persist from several hours to several days
      and disappear without a trace in most cases, without additional therapy.

      The prevalence of the disease in the world is from 1:10 000 to 1: 150 000. The
      plasma/recombinant C1 inhibitor use to compensate for its deficiency or insufficient
      functional activity in patients with HAE is recommended both for severe and for long-term and
      short-term (before surgical interventions and dental manipulations) prophylaxis.

      GNR-038 is a recombinant C1 inhibitor (rhC1-inh), which is a complete structural and
      functional analogue of the plasma C1 inhibitor.
