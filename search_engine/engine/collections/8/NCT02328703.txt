    
      Sixty participants will be randomized to either receive three 30-minute standardized
      treatments per week for two weeks of Reiki therapy (n=30) or a placebo intervention (n=30).
      All participants will complete the same outcome measures (Brief Pain Inventory, Neuropathic
      Pain Scale, Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep
      Scale, and McGill Pain Questionnaire-SF) at established times. Any opioid and other analgesic
      requirements will also be collected.

      Aim 1: Test the efficacy of a 2-week course of Reiki therapy on pain outcomes (present,
      average and worst pain intensity levels and perceptions of pain relief from the Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement-PGI-I) compared to placebo Reiki
      interventions in combat-injured service members with major limb trauma experiencing
      neuropathic pain.

      Aim 2: Examine effects of a 2-week course of Reiki therapy compared to placebo Reiki
      interventions on the quality of sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
      pain interference (BPI), character and quality of pain (Neuropathic Pain Scale and McGill
      Pain Questionnaire-Short Form) in combat-injured service members with major limb trauma
      experiencing neuropathic pain.

      Aim 3: Describe the differences in pattern of responses to Reiki therapy and placebo Reiki
      interventions for pain outcomes (pain intensity, perception of relief and PGI-I) based on
      neuropathic pain type, pain duration, and the presence or absence of a diagnosis of PTSD.
