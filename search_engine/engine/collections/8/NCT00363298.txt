      compared to caffeine as an active placebo when used to augment treatment for
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and whether tolerance (loss of therapeutic effect) to
      the medication will develop over a period of several weeks

      D-amphetamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Because of the effects that
      d-amphetamine has on the brain, Dr. Koran believes it may be helpful in treating OCD. A
      positive finding in this study may stimulate research aimed at improving OCD treatment and
      understanding of the neurochemistry involved.

      This research study will enroll 24 people who are taking medication for their OCD but are not
      receiving sufficient benefit. The research will be performed only at Stanford University.
