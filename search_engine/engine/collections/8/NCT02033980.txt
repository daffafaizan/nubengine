      in predicting the histology and invasion depth of colorectal polyps. In China, however, the
      magnifying endoscope is not used in some medical centers. Even in centers equipped with this
      technique, the magnifying colonoscope is not sufficiently used in daily practice. Recently, a
      simple category classification (NICE classification) using non-magnified NBI has been
      proposed, which classifies colorectal tumors into types 1-3 based on different
      characteristics of color, surface pattern, and microvessels. Type-1 is considered an index
      for hyperplastic lesions, type-2 is an index for adenoma or mucosal/SM scanty invasive
      carcinoma and type-3 is an index for deep SM invasive carcinoma. The new classification has
      soon arouse attention and been validated in some centers on the efficacy of differentiating
      adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. However, most studies enrolled diminutive polyps less
      than 5mm and the efficacy of non-magnified NBI in differentiating type-2 and type-3 lesions
      has not been reported. To promote this simple classification, we design this multicenter
      study to evaluate the predictive validity and performance characteristics of the
      non-magnified NBI in diagnosing polyps during both image and real-time process.
