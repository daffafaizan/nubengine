the convergence and interaction of visual,auditory, and tactile responses in humannonspecific cortexthe relation between the electrical responses in the human brain andmental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quiterecently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological conceptsby electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be recedingbecause of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, andthis difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and atthe same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect totime, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the threedimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display ofsuch a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yetgiven entirely satisfactory results.the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty asto whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essentialto understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that itwould be sufficient.
