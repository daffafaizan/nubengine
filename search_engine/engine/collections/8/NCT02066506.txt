      heart defects: congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and complete
      transposition of the great arteries palliated by atrial switch. In these patients, increase
      of afterload leads to hypertrophy and late RV dilatation. The stress exercised on RV walls
      could play a role in adaptative mechanisms to systemic afterload. Beyond a remodelling
      threshold, it could cause fibrosis damage and RV systolic failure. Magnetic resonance
      imaging, which has a major potential in estimation of RV remodelling, wall stress and
      fibrosis, could shed light on RV adaptation to systemic afterload and evolution towards
      failure. Systemic RV remodelling and function could also depend on the neuro-hormone
      secretion and mechanical arterial properties, that have a direct influence on patients
      afterload. The first purpose of the study is to determine the adaptative mechanisms of RV to
      systemic afterload, and the mechanisms of RV failure, in patients with congenital heart
      disease and subaortic RV, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).The mechanisms are
      evaluated by measures of RV remodelling and RV wall stress using CMR. Second objectives are
      to evaluate these mechanisms using echography, arterial properties study and neurohormonal
      levels
