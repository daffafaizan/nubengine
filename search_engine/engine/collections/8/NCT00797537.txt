      rheumatologists.

      Chondrocalcinosis, which can promote joint inflammation and cartilage degeneration, is highly
      prevalent in elderly subjects.

      Osteo-articular echography is currently reconized as an important development among
      rheumatologists and can efficiently use to detect Chondrocalcinosis.

      The aim of this study is to find a correlation between radiography and echography in
      detecting CPPD crystal deposition, on a sample of patients and more important with a new
      generation of ultrasound with a probe superficial performance.

      166 patients will be enrolled in this trial and an echography and a radiography of the 2
      knees (front and profile) will be done for each patient.

      Ih the echography show a calcification, further exams with wrists, hips shoulders
      echographies will be conducted.

      In case of liquid epanchement, analysis of the liquid will be carried in order to eliminate
      the differential diagnostic including septic arthritis
