      the "third compartment" is now well justified and achievement of supra-normal oxygen delivery
      values is likely not necessary in most surgical patients. Therefore,it would be tempting to
      adopt fluid restriction protocols given the potentials of better wound healing, faster return
      of bowel function and shorter hospital stay after major surgical procedures.

      Although dynamic flow indices of volume responsiveness have been validated in critically-ill
      patients, concerns have been raised regarding the risk of overzealous fluid administration in
      non-critically-ill patients undergoing elective surgery.

      To date, RCTs comparing fluid regimen ("liberal" versus "restrictive" or "liberal" versus
      "GDT") have yielded controversial results with no consensus regarding appropriate fluid
      administration in the perioperative period. Interestingly, restrictive protocols have been
      associated with more frequent adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting) following minor
      surgical procedures and concerns have been raised regarding the possibility of tissue
      hypoperfusion leading to end-organ dysfunction.
