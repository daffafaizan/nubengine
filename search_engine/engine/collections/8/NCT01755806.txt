      coronary multislice computed tomography, including 52 patients with aortic valve
      calcification as the study group and 52 subjects without evidence of calcification in their
      aortic valve, who served as a control group. Data were reconstructed at each 10% of
      RR-interval during the cardiac cycle and reconstructed images at 30-35% and 70-75% of R-R
      intervals were obtained, representing systole and diastole, respectively. For diastolic
      phase, in most cases images at 70% were acquired. Thereafter, acquired images were
      transferred to a single remote workstation for post-processing and subsequent off-line
      analysis.
