      I. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess progression free survival (PFS)
      with upfront local consolidative therapy (LCT) versus (vs.) no LCT among randomized patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess overall survival (OS) with
      upfront LCT vs. no LCT among randomized patients.

      II. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess time to next line systemic
      therapy with upfront LCT vs. no LCT.

      III. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess time to new lesion failure with
      upfront LCT vs. no LCT.

      IV. To assess safety/tolerability of upfront LCT in patients with oligometastatic
      malignancies.

      V. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess quality of life with upfront LCT
      vs. no LCT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify predictive/prognostic biomarkers that are associated with a benefit to LCT
      across disease sites.

      II. To investigate the systemic immune activating effects of radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive up-front standard of care LCT including but not limited to surgical
      resection, cryotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Patients then receive routine drug
      therapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive routine drug therapy. Patients may later receive LCT at the
      discretion of doctor.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 18 weeks.
