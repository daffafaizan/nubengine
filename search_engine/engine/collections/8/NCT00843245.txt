      and mortality. The lack of sensitivity of symptoms and signs used to make the diagnosis of
      the exacerbation of HF, and the knowledge in recent years about the relevance to detect
      congestion before consulting a specialist or go to the emergency department, support the need
      of more aggressive management of these patients.

      Bioimpedance monitoring devices for bioimpedance can provide useful data for the detection of
      congestion onset and help the decision-making in treatment.

      Because patients with heart failure suffer alterations in body composition, mainly due to the
      amount of extracellular water, the bioimpedance can objectify these variations. In heart
      failure, bioimpedance has been tested in two studies with small samples of patients
      estimating total body water. In other studies , the monitoring of intrathoracic impedance has
      been performed by measurement systems implanted in cardiac defibrillators or in cardiac
      resynchronization devices. They have proven to be useful for early detection of
      decompensation in these patients and to detect changes in impedance before the patient begins
      the clinical manifestations. Furthermore, it has been correlated the detection of
      decompensation by these devices with significant increases in NT- proBNP (diagnostic and
      prognostic marker for HF).

      The purpose of our study is to observe these changes in impedance from the patient's skin
      surface and non-invasively.
