      pulsed electromagnetic fields have many clinical effects. Pulsed electromagnetic fields have
      shown to reduce pain in different groups of patients. This concerns patients with
      osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, distal radius
      fractures, pelvic pain and postoperative patients.

      A marathon is a muscular strain. Physiologic effects of a marathon involves muscular and
      connective tissue damage which initiates an inflammatory response as well as release of
      metabolic factors like lactate and free radicals, intracellular metabolites and by-products
      of proteolysis.

      The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pulsed electromagnetic fields
      compared to placebo in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness in marathon runners.
