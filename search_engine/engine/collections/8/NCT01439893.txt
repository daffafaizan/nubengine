      normal structure and function of it.Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail
      have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively improved the heart function, and is tolerated in the
      effective dosage groups. The aim of this phase III trial is to further confirm in large
      population that rhRNG-1 administration can effectively improve the cardiac remodeling and is
      tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure.
