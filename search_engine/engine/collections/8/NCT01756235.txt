      single-arm format. Data were collected prospectively. Adult participants with diagnosis of RA
      who were assigned for treatment with adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) were eligible for participation.
      During this period four follow-up visits were planned for observation of the participant and
      documentation of data. Ideally, these visits should have been performed approximately 3 (V1),
      6 (V2), 9 (V3) and 12 (V4) months after the baseline visit (V0).
