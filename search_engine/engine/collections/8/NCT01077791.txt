      patients for various cognitive functions and skills, though not yet for the social cognition
      ability specifically dedicated to infer others' intention when not explicit.

      Main hypothesis : Abilities to infer other's intention can improve in schizophrenic patients
      following specific practice.

      Primary aim : To demonstrate this improvement, as quantified by improvement of V-SIR scores
      (V-LIS scores in French literature).

      Procedure : Ten weekly sessions of a novel cognitive therapy that makes use of videos aimed
      at learning a better use of contextual information to infer others' intentions. Group of 5
      patients trained by 2 therapists. Comparison with a non-cognitive psycho-educational training
      (same organisational design).

      Study design : Controlled randomized simple blind study (equivalent to a Phase IIb
      therapeutic trial). Matched pair design. 40 patients (20 per arm).
