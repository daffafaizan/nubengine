      mechanical changes and accordingly determine the dosage of its biomechanical parameters:
      preload force, rate of force application and peak force. In recent years, our research team
      showed, using an apparatus to deliver specific dosage SMTs, that SMT-related
      neurophysiological responses depend on the dosage of these parameters. Beside determining the
      SMT dosage, clinicians have to select the spinal level to be treated which is partly done by
      applying a light pressure to each spinous process (spinal stiffness assessment). This study
      consist of a randomized controlled trial including 75 participants with chronic thoracic pain
      who will be randomized in one of three groups. Based on their group assignment, participants
      will receive a specific dosage SMT delivered at T7 three times over 2 weeks. These SMT
      dosages are distinct regarding their speed and/or their peak force in order to generate
      either a high vertebral displacement or a high muscle reflex response. T6, T7 and T8 spinal
      stiffness will be measured just before and after treatment and clinical status will be
      assessed at each session beginning through questionnaires. Session four will include the
      questionnaires and the spinal stiffness measurement procedure. Both SMT and spinal stiffness
      measurement will be performed using an apparatus aiming at simulating force-time profiles.
      Surface electromyography electrodes and accelerometers will be positioned over the upper back
      skin in order to measure the muscle response and vertebral displacement during SMT and spinal
      stiffness measurement procedures.
