    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and feasibility of particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED)
           immunization comprising mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine in patients with stage IIB, IIC,
           III, or IV melanoma.

        -  Compare the immunologic response induced with PMED vs intramuscular jet injection
           methods of vaccination in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Observe patients with measurable tumor for evidence of any antitumor response generated
           after vaccination.

        -  Assess for disease relapse in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine by particle-mediated epidermal
           delivery on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 22, 24, 26, 29, 43, 45, 47, 50, 64, 66, 68, and 71.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine by intramuscular jet injection
           on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 22, 24, 26, 29, 43, 45, 47, 50, 64, 66, 68, and 71.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
