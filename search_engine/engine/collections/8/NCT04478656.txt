    
      A phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised (intra group) clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two-doses of
      three-sequentially escalating cohort (2.5 µg, 5 µg and 10 µg) of BBV121 (inactivated adsorbed
      Zika Virus Vaccine) compared with Placebo (Alum) administered intramuscularly on Day 0 and 28
      in healthy adult Dengue Sero-Negative (Group 1) and Dengue Sero-Positive (Group 2) male and
      female volunteers.

      Participants will be assigned to sequential escalating dose level groups to receive
      vaccinations at 2.5 µg, 5 µg, or 10 µg or Placebo on Day 0 and 28 with follow-up for 12
      months from initial administration of the investigational product.

      Immunogenicity testing on Day 0, 28 and 56, and post-study at the end of Month 6, 9 and 12
      after the initial administration of the investigational product.

      Safety tests (laboratory and clinical investigations) will be done during Screening, Day 0,
      28, 56, and post-study at Month 6, 9 and 12 months after the initial administration of the
      investigational product.
