      burden of disease, and current treatment options all suffer from critical deficiencies of
      efficacy, capacity, or tolerability, especially given the current COVID-19 pandemic. rTMS and
      aLFR in particular has the potential to overcome many of these deficiencies, and is safe and
      well-tolerated. Taken together with the reported findings of other groups, aLFR may be
      feasible, tolerable, and capable of achieving comparable and potentially better remission
      rates than longer 20 to 30-day courses and it may also be beneficial to taper treatments and
      use symptom-based relapse prevention treatments in an aLFR protocol. Importantly, our pilot
      data in two patients previously responsive to ECT and data from the Cole et al. study suggest
      that accelerated rTMS may be a potential substitute for ECT as it may be possible to achieve
      remission in patients with severe depressive symptoms who would otherwise receive ECT.
      Furthermore, there is a burden of being able to provide care to as many people as possible
      based on severity of illness during the pandemic.
