      severe cases requiring intensive care hospitalization due to respiratory failure. The disease
      mostly infects the lower respiratory tract. Typical computed tomography findings of lung
      involvement are bilateral, peripherally located ground glass density and consolidations.
      There is a close relationship between tomography findings and clinical severity. It is not
      known whether there will be complete recovery in the lungs.

      Investigators will evaluate pulmonary structures with chest computed tomography, respiratory
      capacity with pulmonary function tests (PFTs), exercise capacity with six minutes walk test
      and quality of life with short form-36 (SF-36) im patients who survivors of COVID-19 at least
      6 months after hospital discharge.
