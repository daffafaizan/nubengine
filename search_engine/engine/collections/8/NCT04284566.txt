    
      This is a two-arm RCT focused on the safety and potential efficacy of the multicomponent
      program FIBROWALK as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) vs. TAU alone. FIBROWALK combines
      multicomponent approach based on Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE), therapeutic exercise,
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness training.

      The main objective of this RCT was two-fold: (a) To analyse the effectiveness of a 12-week
      multicomponent treatment as an add-on to Treatment (FIBROWALK) as Usual (TAU) to improve
      functional impact (primary outcome), as well as pain, fatigue, kinesiophobia, physical
      function, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) compared to TAU; and (b) to
      explore the baseline differences between responders and non-responders in terms
      sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
