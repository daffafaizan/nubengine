      either accelerated RT-CT delivering to the primary tumor 62-64 Gy / 5 weeks in 31-32
      fractions of 2 Gy BID or very accelerated RT delivering 62-64 Gy in 31-32 fractions of 2 Gy
      BID and 22-23 days. In the accelerated RT-CT arm, 3 cycles of CDDP 100 mg/m2 were delivered
      at day 1, 16, 32 and 2 cycles of 5 Fu 1000 mg/m2 day 1 to 5 and 31 to 35. One month after
      completion of the concomitant RT-CT, 2 additional cycles of CDDP-5FU were given in patients
      responding (> 50%) to the initial course of RT-CT. The end points were event free survival
      and survival.
