      1983. Many patients have been relieved of allergy and allergy-related disease by this
      treatment.

      Lack of well-controlled clinical study prevents NAET from being accepted as a treatment
      option in current medical system.

      The aim of this project is to conduct a double blind-placebo controlled study of applying
      NAET to treat crab or shrimp allergy.

      The parameters to be measured are allergic symptom, crab- or shrimp-specific IgE and skin
      test before and after NAET treatment
