      including proprioception, and investigate the relationship of these findings with
      improvements in epidermal and dermal innervation. In this pilot project, we will pursue 2
      specific aims: 1) determine the effect of an exercise intervention on nerve function in
      people with diabetic neuropathy, and 2) assess changes in cutaneous innervation following
      participation in an exercise program.
