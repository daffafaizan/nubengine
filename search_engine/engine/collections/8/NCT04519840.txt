      delivery, measurement values and presence or absence of DRA as well as general health
      information collected in the health screening questionnaire. All identifiers will be kept
      separately , and password protected only accessed by Primary Investigator. Unless required by
      law or in the event of medical emergency, MRN of any subject will not be disclosed to anyone
      by the investigator. Under no circumstances will the personal identity of any subject be
      revealed in any form of a publication or presentation.

      With the exception of the subject's medical record number as well as signed forms (consent
      and health questionnaire), all recorded study data will be identified using only a unique
      number for each subject. A paper master list will be kept that matches each medical record
      number to their identification number and kept in a separate locked and secured cabinet from
      the rest of the data. Other than that, the signed forms, all other data will be recorded
      initially on a paper sheet then transferred to an electronic spreadsheet. When not under
      direct supervision of the investigator, all paper records will be kept secure in locked
      filing cabinets, accessible only to the investigator. All data stored electronically will be
      maintained and backed up in an encrypted format with the password known only to the
      investigator. Subjects will be provided with a photocopy of the signed consent form.
