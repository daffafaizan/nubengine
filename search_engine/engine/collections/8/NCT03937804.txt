    
      Asthma is a complex disease where the interplay between genetic factors and environmental
      exposures controls susceptibility and disease progression. In the U.S., there remains an
      epidemic of asthma that disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and creates a
      major public health burden, especially among children. Asthmatics of African ancestry
      continue to have more severe asthma and more severe clinical symptoms than their non-African
      counterparts, but few studies have focused on this vulnerable group. The purpose of this
      study is to expand our previous study, the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry
      Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) to integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in
      African Diaspora populations and by recruiting new participants. The protocol described
      herein refers to the recruitment that will take place at the NIH Clinical Center as part of
      the expansion of CAAPA (CAAPA2).
