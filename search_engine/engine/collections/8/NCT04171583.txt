      In many patients, S. aureus persists for decades in spite of antibiotic treatment and host
      defence. During persistence in the airways, S. aureus needs to adapt to this hostile niche.
      Just recently, the investigators described mucoid S. aureus isolates as a so far not reported
      phenotype recovered from the airways of CF patients. These mucoid isolates carried a
      5bp-deletion in a part of the "intercellular adhesion operon (ica) leading to
      hyper-expression of biofilm. So far, neither the prevalence of mucoid S. aureus nor the
      impact on lung disease in CF patients is known. The investigators plan to perform a clinical
      study to determine the prevalence of mucoid S. aureus isolates in a cross-sectional study and
      the impact of identified mucoid S. aureus on the clinical course of the lung disease by
      observing patients with mucoid S. aureus for 12 months in comparison with a group of age-,
      gender- and P. aeruginosa-positive/negative matched group of S. aureus-positive patients
      without mucoid isolates.
