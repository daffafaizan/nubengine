      are no changes to the drug product formulation, manufacturing site, manufacturing process, or
      container closure.

      An agalsidase alfa bioreactor manufacturing process (agalAF1) utilizing animal component-free
      media replaced the previous roller bottle (RB) process.

      This study is designed to provide PD/PK and safety data. The assessment schedule is designed
      to capture the PK profile of drug uptake in the blood as well the pharmacologic effect which
      manifests over the course of weeks. Each patient will serve as his own control.
