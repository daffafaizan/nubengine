    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Phase I: To determine the safe dose of alisertib when given in combination with
           abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) and prednisone in metastatic castration resistant
           prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with disease progression on abiraterone and prednisone.

        2. Phase II: To determine the proportion of patients who have no disease progression after
           alisertib is added to abiraterone and prednisone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Phase II: To determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after alisertib is
           added to abiraterone and prednisone regimen (this includes the proportion of patients
           with PSA progression free at 3 months, proportion of patients with 50% PSA reduction
           after study treatment, maximum PSA decline from baseline during the first 12 weeks).

        2. Phase II: To compare baseline circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enumeration to 12 week
           post-therapy CTC enumeration.

        3. Phase II: To compare baseline neuroendocrine marker (chromogranin A and neuron-specific
           enolase [NSE]) levels to 12 week post therapy neuroendocrine marker levels.

        4. Phase II: To further assess overall safety of combination of alisertib with abiraterone
           and prednisone in the phase 1 portion of the study.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of alisertib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, abiraterone acetate PO
      daily, and prednisone PO BID. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
