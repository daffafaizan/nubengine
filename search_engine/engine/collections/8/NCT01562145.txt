      altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors. It is unclear if
      this altered expression can be traced as changes in plasma protein levels. We measured the
      plasma level of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in patients with rotator cuff tears.

      Material and methods: Blood samples were collected from 17 patients, median 61 (range 39-77)
      years, with sonographically verified rotator cuff tears (partial- or full-thickness). These
      were compared with 16 gender and age matched control persons with sonographically intact
      rotator cuffs. Plasma levels of MMPs and TIMPs were measured simultaneously using Luminex
      technology.
