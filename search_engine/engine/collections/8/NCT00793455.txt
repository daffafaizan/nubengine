      for colonoscopy, yet have exhibited some barriers to screening as demonstrated by a lack of
      screening completion. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a
      multicomponent intervention (patient reminder, print and multimedia materials) on colorectal
      screening completion among this target population.
