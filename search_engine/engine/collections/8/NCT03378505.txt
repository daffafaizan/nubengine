      randomly assigned to one of two conditions and asked to complete either online reflections or
      engage with a mobile app over the course of the semester. Students who elect to not
      participate will be provided an alternate assignment to complete, to be coordinated by their
      teaching assistant. Participants will additionally be asked to complete (1) a pre-survey, (2)
      post-survey, and follow-up survey 14 days after the class concludes. The study will examine
      changes in health-related behaviors, resiliency, well-being, and self-efficacy reported
      between the start and conclusion of semester/study.
