      for renal calculi < 3.0 cm and is recommended by the European Association of Urology due to
      its minimally-invasive nature and satisfactory result.

      However, high perfusion rate leads to renal pelvic pressure increase, resulting in absorption
      of liquid, bacteria, and endotoxin into blood, followed by short-term complications such as
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS , 8.1%), sepsis (0-4.5%), renal pelvic and
      ureteral tumor spread, and long-term complication of renal function impairment. Currently the
      commonly used flexible ureteroscope sheath (ureteral access sheath, UAS) reduces the renal
      pelvic pressure to a certain extent, but still can not control and monitor the renal pelvic
      pressure to reduce the incidence of complications, which, limit the clinical application of
      ureteroscopy.

      Recently, the investigators present a novel technique of SF-URS with automatic control of
      renal pelvic pressure. In this study, transverse comparison is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the suctioning flexible ureteroscopy with automatic control of renal
      pelvic pressure for the treatment of renal calculi.
