    
      Aim of the study: is to conduct an RCT to compare the effectiveness of a new personalized
      caries-control treatment protocol with standard caries treatment protocol for reducing caries
      incidence in high caries risk patients

      Hypothesis: This project will be designed to test the null hypothesis that there is no
      significant difference between the new personalized caries-control treatment protocol and
      existing standard caries treatment protocol, and to test the alternative hypothesis that the
      new personalized treatment protocol will be superior to the standard preventive measures

      Primary objective: is to measure the incidence of new caries lesions
