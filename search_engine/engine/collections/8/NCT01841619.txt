      treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can replace current systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy in cutaneous lupus erythematosis (CLE) patients. This project has
      relevant clinical implications due to the severe side effects of and lack of response to
      current therapies.

      From the review of literature, it can be postulated that:

        1. the beneficial effects of IVIg for patients with CLE should be prompt, with marked
           improvement within a few weeks;

        2. clinical improvement should last several weeks after the last infusion; and

        3. remission may be prolonged by maintenance IVIg therapy.

      Although this is only a non-controlled study, the investigator expects that IVIg will improve
      CLE, including those resistant to standard treatments. It is anticipated that treatment with
      IVIg will facilitate healing of extensive cutaneous lesions and achieve rapid remission.
      Maintenance therapy with repeated monthly pulses of IVIg is expected to keep the disease in
      remission during the treatment-free follow up observational period. The results will provide
      the basis a multicenter randomized controlled study to identify which CLE subsets will
      benefit the most and which protocol will provide the optimal clinical outcome.
