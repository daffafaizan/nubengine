      with over 40% of patients failing their first attempt of unassisted breathing. Persistent
      ventilator dependence predisposes patients to nosocomial complications and increases the
      economic burden of critical illness. Ventilator-dependence results from an imbalance between
      the load and capacity of the respiratory muscle pump. Patients who fail a trial of
      spontaneous breathing commonly exhibit excess respiratory loads secondary to weaning-induced
      pulmonary edema, atelectasis or dynamic hyperinflation. Many patients who are dependent on
      the ventilator also show a striking loss of pump capacity due to diaphragm dysfunction.
      Though each of these mechanisms respond to specific interventions, it is often difficult for
      physicians to discern which mechanisms are at play at the bedside. Bedside ultrasound is a
      potentially useful means of evaluating cardiac, pulmonary and diaphragm function during
      weaning failure. It is readily available, highly feasible and already widely employed in
      clinical practice. As yet, no study has evaluated the accuracy and feasibility of combining
      echocardiography with lung and diaphragm ultrasound to comprehensively evaluate the
      physiological mechanisms of weaning failure. The objectives of this study are to establish
      the utility of a rapid thoracic ultrasound exam to diagnose mechanisms of ventilation
      liberation failure and to assess the relationship between cardiothoracic variability during
      spontaneous breathing and different physiological mechanism of weaning failure.
