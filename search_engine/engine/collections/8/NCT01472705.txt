      enrolled between 2007 and 2010, of which 527 were treated with EES and 287 with BES
      implantation. Clinical outcome was compared in 200 pairs using propensity score matching. The
      primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and target vessel
      revascularisation (TVR) at two-year follow-up.
