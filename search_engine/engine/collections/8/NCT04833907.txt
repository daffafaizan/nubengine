    
      rAAV-Olig001-ASPA is the first gene therapy designed to target the oligodendrocytes, which
      are critical for myelination and brain development.

      This study is a Phase 1/2 First-In-Human protocol designed to obtain safety,
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data following neurosurgical administration of a single dose
      of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA delivered intracerebroventricularly in up to 24 children with Canavan
      Disease.

      Patients with a diagnosis of typical Canavan Disease who meet all eligibility criteria may be
      enrolled in this open-label, sequential cohort study of a single dose of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA.
