    
      Prospective randomized study in hospitalized patients for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease exacerbation (COPD). In one group, early exercise training (aerobic and strength)
      during hospitalization for COPD exacerbation followed by exercise training at home until 30
      days to discharge and in the other the intervention is usual care. In both group, usual
      respiratory physiotherapy techniques during hospitalization and adequate physical activity
      recommendations have been included. The main variable is the increase in moderate or vigorous
      daily physical activities at 30 days after discharge.
