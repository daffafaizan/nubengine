      throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have
      seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was
      associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral
      treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of
      clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care
      for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic
      approach to COVID-19.

      Tannins have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial properties and
      a regulatory effect on the gastrointestinal metabolism.

      The investigators will realize a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to assess the
      effect of treatment with a dietary supplement (ARBOX), a molecular complex of quebracho and
      chestnut tannins extract and Vit B12, compared with placebo. 140 COVID-19 patients will be
      recruited in a single center in Buenos Aires Argentina. 70 patients will receive conventional
      treatment plus ARBOX (treated group) and 70 patients will receive conventional treatment plus
      placebo (control group). The effects will be evaluated during the 28 days follow up. The
      primary end point will be the time of discharge from the hospital. A panel of 27 cytokines
      level, intestinal microbiota composition and its metabolites will be assessed at day 1 and
      14.
