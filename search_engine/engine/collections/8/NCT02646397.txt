      months were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD).China has a high prevalence of
      CKD.The prevalence, awareness, and treatment of hypertension (HTN) in non-dialysis CKD
      patients were 67.3%,85.8%, and 81.0%, respectively. The renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
      (RASI) including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1
      receptor blocker (ARB) have been deeply confirmed to have apparent reno-protective effect in
      patients with CKD.Co-administration of diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with
      ACEIs or ARBs are the most common combinations. Hydrochlorothiazide plus RASIs are another
      widely used combination according to the synergetic function of antihypertensive action and
      offset mutual adverse effects. Until now, no large scale studies have compared the effect of
      initial treatment with two different combinations of antihypertensive drugs in CKD patients
      on the progression of kidney disease in China. Studies in the subsets of CKD (diabetes and
      non-diabetes, micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria) are urgently needed.We aimed to
      conduct a large scale study to compare L/T-type CCB and diuretic on the basis of ACEI in CKD
      with HTN on renal progression of CKD in China.
