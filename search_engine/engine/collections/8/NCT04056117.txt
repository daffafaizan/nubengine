    
      Shigella4V is a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine including O antigen-polysaccharides of the
      most predominant Shigella serotypes.

      The study will be conducted in two steps. In Step1: safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine
      will be evaluated first in adults and subsequently in children and infants through an
      age-descending and dose escalation approach. In Step 2: in order to further evaluate safety
      and to identify the optimum immunogenic dose, infants will be randomised to receive 1 of 4
      different vaccine doses or control vaccine.

      Adults will receive a 2 dose schedule, children and infants will receive a 3 dose schedule.
      For each vaccine dose, formulation with and without Aluminium adjuvant will be tested.
