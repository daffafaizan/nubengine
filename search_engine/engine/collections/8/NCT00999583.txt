    
      Rationale:

      A recent pilot study showed encouraging results regarding the potentially beneficial effects
      of high dose epoetin alpha (an analogue of erythropoietin) when administered early after
      cardiac arrest. In this open label and non randomized trial, a high proportion of patients
      survived without significant cerebral disability and without experiencing severe adverse
      events (CARIOU et al. Resuscitation 2008). Efficiency of this treatment should now be
      evaluated in a randomized trial.

      Hypotheses:

      An early administration of a high dose of epoetin alpha (Epo) after cardiac arrest
      resuscitation could improve the neurological outcome of these patients by comparison with
      standard treatment. The proportion of patients reaching the level 1 of the Pittsburgh CPC
      scale (i.e., no or minor cerebral disability) at day 60 could attain 45% in the
      interventional group versus 30% as expected in the control group.

      Design:

      Multicentre, randomised, controlled, simple blind trial ("add on study").

      Main goal:

      To test the efficiency of a high dose of Epo administered at the early stage of the
      post-cardiac arrest period regarding its ability to improve the neurological outcome of these
      patients, when compared with standard care (including hypothermia when indicated).
