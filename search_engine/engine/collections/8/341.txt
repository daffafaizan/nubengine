4010. studies of nickel carcinogenesis.the subcellular partition of nickelin lung and liver following inhalation of nickel carbonylwistar rats were exposed by inhalation tonickel carbonyl either once onlyat a concentration of 80 ppm for 60 minutes(0.60 mg ni(co)4/l.air), orrepeatedly at 4 ppm (0.03 mg ni(co)4/l. air)for 30 minutes 3 times weeklyfor 1 year.  they were killed 24 hours after(the final period of) exposure.nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal and supernatantfractions were isolatedfrom lung and liver homogenates and measurementsof the nickel, nitrogenand rna-content of each subcellular fractionwere made.  the greatest ratiosof nickel to nitrogen were in the nuclearfractions of both liver and lung,but increased amounts of nickel were also foundin the microsomal andsupernatant fractions of both liver and lungand in the mitochondrialfraction of lung.
