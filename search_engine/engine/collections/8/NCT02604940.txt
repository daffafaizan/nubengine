      single bolus dose intraoperatively. Dexmedetomidine is an agonist of Î±2-adrenergic receptors
      sedative medication used by intensive care units and anesthesiologists and is unique in its
      ability to provide sedation without causing respiratory depression. Recently, it has received
      attention for its potential for additive analgesia. The study population will be patients
      undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The study population of bariatric surgery patients was
      chosen due to high prevalence of sleep apnea and Pickwickian component that can be worsened
      with opioid analgesia in the postoperative period. The purpose of the study is to test
      whether the use of a single bolus dose dexmedetomidine in addition to standard dose pain
      regimen decreases postoperative narcotic requirements when compared to standard dose pain
      regimen alone. The secondary purpose is to study whether single bolus dose dexmedetomidine
      reduces respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressure, patient PCA demand
      bolus requests and VAS pain scores in the postoperative period. The overall goal of the study
      is to establish evidence of dexmedetomidine's role in multimodal pain relief in the bariatric
      surgery population with the possibility of other patient subgroups to follow
