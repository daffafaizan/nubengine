      previous studies, recruiting of 80 simple overweight or obesity girls, aged 6 to 10 years
      old. After the informed consent, they will be randomly divided into intervention group and
      control group, intervention group will be given tea polyphenol capsule (400 mg,
      epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) accounted for 50%), the control group given placebo capsule.
      Participants need take it once a day after breakfast. All of them will receive similar health
      advice on proper diet and exercise. The intervention will last 12 weeks, followed by
      telephone every 3 months until 3 months after menarche. The researchers will measure children
      obesity index (using artificial detection), youth development index (secondary sex
      characteristic clinical manifestations, serum sex hormone, B ultrasonic examination uterus
      ovarian and breast volume, etc.) in three stages: at the baseline, after 12 weeks
      intervention and the end of three months after menstruation. The liver and kidney function,
      blood and urine routine and serum trace elements will be detected before and after the
      three-month intervention. Through the above detection of the indicators related to obesity
      and sexual precocious puberty, it is explored whether the decaffeinated tea polyphenol has
      preventive effects on precocious puberty.
