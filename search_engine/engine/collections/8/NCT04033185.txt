      management and treatment protocols, stroke remains one of the most common causes of adult
      disability, representing a serious global health problem. Sensory motor dysfunction,
      proprioception deficits and hypertonus may develop in stroke patients depending on the
      location and severity of the brain damaged areas. Virtual reality application, which has been
      widely used in recent years, is a three-dimensional, computer-generated technology that gives
      the patient a sense of reality and allows the patient to interact with it. Virtual reality
      application can be used as a suitable method for proprioceptive rehabilitation due to its
      ability to manipulate visual feedback of virtual objects. In recent years, another
      technological method that has been used in the field of neurorehabilitation is robotic
      rehabilitation. Robot-assisted gait training, which requires repetitive tasks, can enhance
      neuroplasticity and motor learning, which focuses on the rearrangement of brain tissue. Both
      technology-based rehabilitation approaches have been shown to be particularly effective in
      improving the sense of position in the upper extremity. However, studies investigating the
      effects of these two applications on lower extremity position sensation seem to be
      insufficient. We think that both methods will be effective in improving the sense of
      position.
