    
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in
      B cell activation via the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. BTK is important for
      normal B-cell activation and the pathophysiology of B cell malignancies. A few BTK inhibitors
      have demonstrated clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma represents a diverse set of diseases, of which more than
      60 subtypes have been identified and classified by the world health organization.
      JNJ-64264681 is a second-generation, orally active, selective, and irreversible covalent
      inhibitor of BTK and JNJ-67856633 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective first in
      class mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) inhibitor
      that binds to an allosteric site on MALT1 with a mixed-type mechanism. JNJ-64264681 and
      JNJ-67856633 inhibit BTK and MALT1, respectively, and both BTK and MALT1 are involved in
      transmitting the pro-survival BCR signal. The study will consist of Screening Phase (28
      days); Treatment Phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to end of treatment, each cycle is a 21-day
      cycle) and a Follow-up Phase (from end of treatment visit until lost to follow-up, withdrawal
      of consent, death, 6 months after start of first subsequent antineoplastic therapy). The
      total study duration is estimated at 2 years and 2 months. Safety assessments will include
      physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical safety laboratory
      assessments, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, echocardiogram and
      adverse events monitoring.
