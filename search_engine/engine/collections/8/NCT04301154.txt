      HIV reservoir markers as a result of vaccine-induced immune responses. The effects may be
      superior with the addition of TLR4 agonist as immune adjuvant.

      In addition, there is also the hypothesis that vaccination with HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR
      several years after the initial HIVIS DNA vaccination in the PEDVAC study will result in
      strong immune responses.

      The study will enroll up to 45 perinatally HIV infected children and youth â‰¥ 9 years old who
      are on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).
