      patients recruited. Adverse effects of malnutrition include increase of infection
      complication, increase hospital length of stay, and increase mortality. Prescription of oral
      nutrition supplement (ONS) have been proved to provide patients more calorie and protein
      intake and can improve patients' outcome.

      Despite the proved benefits of oral nutrition supplement(ONS), prescription of it in Thai
      hospitalized patients are far less than it should. The main reason of this under-practice is
      the limitation of health policies which considered ONS as an optional from main meals.
      Additional cost for ONS has to be paid by patients themselves, therefore the patients who
      have no willing to pay usually refuse to receive ONS. Unawareness of physician regarding its
      benefits is also a problem. In order to convince Thai authorities to allow for reimbursement
      of ONS and encourage prescription of ONS among physicians, an evidence based benefits of ONS
      in large Thai population is needed.
