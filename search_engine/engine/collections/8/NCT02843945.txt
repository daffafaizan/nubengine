      device that provides unidirectional radiation which utilizes active components
      (Palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration.This pilot study may benefit
      pancreatic cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to adjacent critical structures,
      while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin. The
      appropriate dose and local control rate will be recorded the primary endpoint in order to
      provide an efficacy assessment.
