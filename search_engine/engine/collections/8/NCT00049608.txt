        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and mistletoe in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic effects of gemcitabine with and without mistletoe in these
           patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to neutrophil count recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and mistletoe subcutaneously
      daily starting on day 8 of course 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and mistletoe in 2 stages.

        -  Stage I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mistletoe in combination
           with a constant dose of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mistletoe
           is determined.

        -  Stage II: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination
           with the MTD of mistletoe as determined in stage I until the MTD of gemcitabine is
           determined.

      In both stages, the MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
