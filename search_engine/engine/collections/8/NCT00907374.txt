      urine sample were entered into a one to three month run-in phase before randomization. (50
      mg/g was used as the lower limit to allow room for improvement to reach normal.) Since
      hypertension and uncontrolled hyperglycemia will cause MA, blood pressure (BP) and hemoglobin
      A1c (AIC) levels were reduced to <130/80 mm Hg and <8.0%, respectively, during this period.
      All patients had been on various doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)
      which were reduced to 10 mg benazepril and BP controlled with other classes of
      anti-hypertensive drugs (except for angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB's]). Glycemia was
      treated with intensification of their current therapy. MA and BP were measured monthly.

      When goal levels of BP and AIC were achieved and MA was still present, patients were
      randomized to either low dose RAS inhibition (10 mg benazepril) (Standard) or aggressive
      inhibition of the RAS (Aggressive). MA continued to be measured monthly and the progressive
      increase in doses of an ACE-I and an ARB was as follows. Benazepril (the ACE-I) - 10 mg to 20
      mg to 40 mg to adding losartan (the ARB) -25 mg to 50 mg to 100 mg to increasing benazepril
      to 80 mg with the goal of returning albumin excretion to normal. Other classes of drugs were
      reduced as necessary to keep systolic BP > 100 mm Hg. Serum creatinine and potassium[K+] were
      measured monthly, AIC levels every 3 months and CIMT by ultrasound and endothelial function
      by post hyperemia and nitroglycerine (NTG) - induced peripheral artery tonometry (PAT) via
      finger plethysmography every six months.
