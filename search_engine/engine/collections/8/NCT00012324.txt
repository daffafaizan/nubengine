        -  Compare the overall survival in patients with unresectable or recurrent hepatocellular
           carcinoma treated with nolatrexed dihydrochloride vs doxorubicin.

        -  Compare time to progression, time to treatment failure, and response rates in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the probability of survival at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety and clinical benefit of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the response rates and survival of patients who have received prior therapy or
           no prior therapy after treatment with these two regimens.

        -  Compare the rates of conversion from unresectable to resectable lesions in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to CLIP score (0-1 vs 2-3) and Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive nolatrexed dihydrochloride IV continuously on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1. Treatment continues in both arms every
           3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 446 patients (223 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 12 months.
