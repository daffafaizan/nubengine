      more effective glucose management and reductions in overall CVD events and hospitalization
      for heart failure with SGLT-2 inhibition demonstrated in recent trials, and the capability of
      cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in assessments of myocardial fibrosis and inflammation,
      the investigators propose to conduct a staged research program using adaptive study design to
      investigate the effects of SGLT-2 inhibition with dapagliflozin on myocardial fibrosis and
      inflammation as assessed by cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in patients with type-2
      diabetes.

      A total of 60 subjects with >=18 years of age, type-2 diabetes history >=5 years and HbA1C
      7-10% will be randomized at 1:1 to Dapagliflozin 10mg or matching placebo once daily for 1
      year. All subjects will be followed every 3 months for clinical and laboratory evaluations
      and assessments. All subjects will undergo CMRI at baseline and 1 year.

      The primary myocardial fibrosis endpoint is change in extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as
      assessed by T1-mapping over 12 months. ECV combines native and contrast-enhanced T1 mapping.
      The change of the T1 relaxation rate (i.e., 1/T1) in blood between pre- and post-contrast
      imaging is converted with the blood hematocrit into a reference for plasma T1, which serves
      as reference for the T1 changes in tissue.
