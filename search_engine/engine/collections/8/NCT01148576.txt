      common cause of liver disease and affects over 10% of the general population in China.
      Hepatic steatosis is the main hepatic presentation of non- alcoholic fatty liver disease that
      is becoming another important liver disorder both in China and worldwide with economic
      development. It would be expected that hepatic steatosis might occur in CHB patients and
      recent studies show the frequency of steatosis in CHB ranges from 27% to 51%. However, the
      effect of steatosis on the anti-viral treatment in CHB patients is still vague. The aim of
      this RCT is to investigate the effect of steatosis on the therapeutic effect of entecavir in
      chronic hepatitis B patients. We will compare the anti-viral effect of entecavir among four
      groups: CHB group with entecavir therapy, CHB + steatosis group with entecavir therapy, CHB +
      steatosis group with entecavir + essentiale therapy and CHB + steatosis group with entecavir
      + vitamin E therapy. The speculated points are set as 3 months, 12 months and 15 months.
      Liver biopsy will be carried out at beginning and the 12th month. Other serum biochemical and
      viral markers are recorded as well as CT or ultrasound scan are repeated.
