      disease. Drug-eluting stents (DES) have dramatically reduced the rates of restenosis and
      target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with bare-metal stents (BMS). Newer-generation
      DES with a durable polymer such as Xience (Abbott, US) and Resolute (Medtronic, US) were
      widely used. However, the concern about late stent thrombosis due to hypersensitivity
      reaction from the polymer is still existed. Recently, DES with a biodegradable polymer such
      as Biomatrix (Biosensors, Switzerland), Nobori (Terumo, Japan), Orsiro (Biotronik,
      Switzerland), and Synergy (Boston Scientific, US) was rapidly adopted and it is expected to
      reduce the late stent thrombosis.

      Recently, new biodegradable DES with thin struts was developed in South Korea. The Genoss DES
      (Genoss, Korea) has an L-605 cobalt chromium (CoCr) platform with a strut thickness of about
      70 µm and the stent is coated a combination of Sirolimus drug with concentration of
      1.15µg/mm2 and an abluminal biodegradable PLA and PLGA polymers.

      This study is conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of Genoss DES in the treatment of
      patients with coronary artery disease.
