      Participants will participate in three, non-consecutive 5-d controlled energy deficit
      periods, each separated by a 14-d washout period (i.e., sufficient time to restore nitrogen
      and metabolic homeostasis after moderate weight loss). Post-exercise (whole-body exercise
      model) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and whole-body protein turnover responses to varying
      EAA-containing protein formats will be determined the morning after completing the 5-d energy
      deficit.
