    
      40 ppm of either nitric oxide for inhalation or N2 (placebo) will be continuously
      administered to the patient starting at least 5 minutes prior to initiating the first weaning
      attempt from CPB and continue until the patient is either extubated, has reached failure
      criteria, or has been treated with study drug for 48 hours following discontinuation of CPB,
      whichever come first.

      All patients will be monitored peri-operatively with a pulmonary arterial line, central
      venous line, and systemic arterial line. Baseline data collection by a designated clinical
      staff member will begin following induction of anesthesia and prior to skin incision.
      Following a successful wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, post-op data will be collected
      within 1 hour following end time of surgery. Data will then be collected at 6, 12, 18, 24,
      and 48 hours from post-op or until extubation, in which case weaning from study drug will
      begin.

      Open label investigational nitric oxide for inhalation may be administered once a patient
      meets a minimum of two of the failure criteria or fails to wean at least once due to
      hemodynamic failure from cardiopulmonary bypass.
