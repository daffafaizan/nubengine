      injury in the basis of chronic liver disease. The main cause of chronic acute liver failure
      in China is hepatitis b virus infection.Previous studies on the prognosis of acute on-chronic
      liver failure mainly focused on the short-term survival rate and the follow-up time was
      relatively short, while the study on the long-term prognosis of patients with spontaneous
      recovery of chronic acute liver failure was still lack-ing. Thus,this study mainly
      retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with chronic hepatitis b related acute
      liver failure admitted to the department of infectious diseases, the third affiliated
      hospital of sun yat-sen university, and con-ducted telephone follow-up survey to analyze the
      long-term prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis b related acute on-chronic liver
      failure.
