    
      This is a confirmatory, prospective, open-label, multi-centre phase 3 study to evaluate
      sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography
      (PET/CT) imaging to non-invasively detect clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) in adult
      patients with indeterminate renal masses (IRM), scheduled for partial or total nephrectomy.

      Patients, will be recruited in 12-15 renal cancer care specialist centres, who have access to
      state-of-the-art PET/CT imaging equipment.

      The study involves a single administration of 89Zr-TLX250. Imaging will then be conducted 5
      +/-2 days post administration. The partial/total nephrectomy will then be performed at
      institutional discretion any time following the PET/CT imaging visit, but no later than 90
      days post administration of 89Zr-TLX250. Histological tumour samples will be prepared and
      used for histological diagnosis of the renal mass (ccRCC or non-ccRCC) read by a central
      laboratory.

      On Day 5 +/-2 post study drug administration, an abdominal PET/CT imaging will be obtained.
      In patients, in which unexpected evidence for disseminated disease is observed, PET/CT
      imaging may be extended to complete whole body imaging(vertex of skull to toe) at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. Qualitative visual
      analysis (presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250 uptake inside or in vicinity of renal
      lesion, as seen on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI), will be used to assess test performance or
      89Zr-TLX-250 PET/CT imaging to non-invasively detect ccRCC, using histological results from
      the central histological reference laboratory as standard of truth.
