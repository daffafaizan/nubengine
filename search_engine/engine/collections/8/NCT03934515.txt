      gastric level, including different clinical techniques (such as gastric auscultation,
      aspiration of the NGT), ultrasound techniques, etc. Actually, the diagnostic gold standard is
      the thoraco-abdominal anterior-posterior radiography, which is considered the only
      non-invasive method capable to confirm the correct pose of the NGT at intra-diaphragmatic
      level. This method, however, even if it is non-invasive, requires the use of ionizing
      radiation (4 micro-Sievert (uSv) for radiography) which could be repeated multiple time for
      the same patient; NGT may need to be repositioned several times during the same hospital
      stay, increasing patient exposure to ionizing radiation and, potentially, also the health
      workers exposure.

      The aim is to identify into the group A the threshold value between tracheal and esophageal
      etCO2 and into the group B the theshold value between gastric and esophageal pH.

      Phase A: etCO2 measurement will be collected 1. after intubation, when the tube is inserted
      into the endotracheal tube, before proceeding with the aspiration of secretions and 2. once
      the NGT has been inserted, by a probe located at the end of the tube.

      Phase B: pH measurement will be collected at the end of the procedure, once the NGT is
      inserted, at 1.a distance of 25 cm from the mouth (oesophageal site) and at 2. a distance of
      40 cm (gastric site), aspirating the gastric contents and measuring on specific litmus paper.
