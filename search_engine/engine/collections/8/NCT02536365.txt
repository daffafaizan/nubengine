      estimated costs of treatment across the lifespan of $3.2 million. A common feature of ASD is
      over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information
      together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now
      included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive
      Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on
      functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for
      individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks to extend
      understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve
      functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in
      comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, the investigators will
      explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and
      phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a
      commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis
      for improved independence over the lifetime. A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory
      issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan area will complete this study.
