      detect delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in
      delirium and control groups. In this study, the investigators will use ActiGraph
      accelerometers to record each subject's movement patterns. Also, a processed video using a
      commercially available camera interfaces with a specialized program to identify patient
      facial expressions and movement patterns. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled with
      delirium, and 30 patients without delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles
      will be compared in the motorically defined subgroups (hyperactive, hypoactive, normal) based
      on accelerometer and facial recognition data. Then, differences in facial expression, number
      of changes in postures, and percentage of time spent moving will be compared between
      motorically defined subgroups and in delirium and control groups. EMR data will also be used
      to assess the feasibility of detecting delirium by including additional information on
      related risk factors.
