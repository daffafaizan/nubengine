      seconds was reported. On the basis of these findings, a 30% difference in performance time
      would represent an effect size of 0.82 and would require 20 patients per group to achieve an
      alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.1. For dropped cases; 5% will be added. So a total
      sample size of 64 patients (32 per group) will be required.

      Statistical Analysis: will be performed using SPSS version 22 statistical software. For
      quantitative data, normality will be first assessed with the Shapiro test and then analyzed
      with the Student t-test. Data that will not have a normal distribution, as well as ordinal
      data, will be analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. For binomial data, Fisher exact test
      will be used. All P values presented will be 2-sided and values of less than 0.05 will be
      considered significant.
