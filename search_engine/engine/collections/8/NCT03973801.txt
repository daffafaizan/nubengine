      exposure to opioids and/or other substances ingested by the mother. The condition has
      significantly risen over the past 20 years. First line treatments for NAS involve the
      maximization of non-pharmacologic therapies. NAS management focuses on reducing or
      eliminating the need for medication management to prevent further developmental
      complications, promote maternal bonding, and reduce hospital length of stay.

      Auricular acupuncture has been used for the treatment of addiction and has demonstrated
      efficacy in the adult population. Current evidence suggests that acupuncture is safe and
      beneficial for multiple conditions that impact neonatal and pediatric populations including
      NAS. Acupressure is a less invasive therapy and may serve as an additional
      non-pharmacological adjunct to ease the severe discomfort of withdrawal in neonates at risk
      for NAS.

      This study will assess the feasibility of implementing auricular acupressure as an additional
      non-pharmacologic therapy for neonates at risk for developing neonatal abstinence syndrome
      (NAS) at Monroe Carrell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
      (VUMC).
