    
      This study will enroll 180 hospitalized patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate to end
      stage renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate is < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 or
      dialysis) in the Chicagoland area. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 2 protocols
      after hospital admission. Blood glucose levels will be obtained before meals, at bedtime and
      whenever necessary for any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia. The primary endpoint will be
      the percentage of blood glucose levels reaching goal of 80-180mg/dl. A secondary endpoint
      will be the percentage of hypoglycemic events, defined as blood glucose values < 60 mg/dl. In
      addition the percentage of glucose levels within the goal range of 80-180mg.dl will be
      further separated into excellent control (80-140mg/dl) and acceptable control (141-180mg/dl).

      The 2 study groups will be:

        1. Glargine & glulisine. The total daily insulin dose will be 0.6 units/kg. Half of this
           will be given as glargine once daily. The other half will be given as glulisine, divided
           equally between breakfast, lunch, and dinner with correction factor dosing as needed for
           elevated premeal hyperglycemia.

        2. Glargine & glulisine The calculation for the total daily insulin dose will be 0.3
           units/kg. Half of this will be given as glargine in the morning. The other half will be
           given as glulisine, divided equally between breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with
           correction factor dosing as needed for elevated premeal hyperglycemia.

      All oral agents will be discontinued on admission.
