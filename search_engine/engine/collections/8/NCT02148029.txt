      short term focus on preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT. Despite standard
      care, 25% to 50% of patients with DVT progress to the chronic post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)
      resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. The
      investigators postulate that a supervised exercise program in patients with acute DVT could
      increase lower extremity venous flow, accelerate thrombus resolution, and thereby decrease
      the risk of PTS. If the patient is unable to perform exercises, NMES (neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation) will be used to induce contraction of the muscles of the lower
      extremities.

      Aim 1 will test whether a 3-month exercise program has long-term clinical benefits in acute
      DVT. The primary outcome measures will be Villalta score for PTS and VEINS-QOL score (Venous
      Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-QOL) for venous quality of life at 2 years
      of follow-up. Aim 2 will evaluate whether exercise therapy in patients with acute DVT
      enhances thrombus resolution. Aim 3 will assess the relationship between PTS, venous
      hemodynamics and exercise capacity.
