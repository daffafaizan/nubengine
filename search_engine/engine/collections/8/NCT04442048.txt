      cancer that may also help in preventing severe respiratory and COVID-19 infections.
      Laboratory tests show that IMM-101 works by activating parts of the immune system that are
      also involved with protecting against viral and bacterial infections, so that if you are
      exposed to these types of infections your body may be able fight off the infection better.
      That could help prevent severe symptoms from respiratory and COVID-19 related infections. It
      has been studied in over 300 cancer patients who have also been receiving other cancer
      treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, and seems promising, but it is not clear if
      it can offer better results than not having the immunization at all.
