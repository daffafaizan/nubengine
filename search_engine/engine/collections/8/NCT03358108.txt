      OSST,COST,Endeavor, Anchor NPGV studies, were included in the observational study after they
      finished. The patients entered the following two observation groups based on previous
      studies: Group A: formerly interferon group (including interferon alone or interferon
      combined with other drugs); Group B: formerly nucleoside analogue treatment group. Each group
      was followed for five years.All patients were followed up for physical examination (vital
      signs, whole body examination) and laboratory assessment (HBsAg quantification, HBeAg
      quantification, HBV DNA, HBV immunology marker, blood routine, blood biochemistry, alpha
      fetoprotein, Fibroscan, liver Doppler) in every six month.
