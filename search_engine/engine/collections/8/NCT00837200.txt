      Oncaspar (PEG-asparaginase), Doxil (PEG-liposomal doxorubicin), and Decadron (ODD) in terms
      of disease response against refractory lymphoid malignancies. Asparaginase is an enzyme that
      depletes asparagines, a key amino acid for survival and growth of malignant lymphocytes. Its
      depletion results in death of the neoplastic cell. Asparagine depletion has induced a
      significant improvement of clinical outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and
      L-asparaginase has been a mainstay for more than 30 years in the treatment of ALL. Although
      this drug has been used primarily in ALL, promising results have been reported even in other
      non-ALL lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic
      leukemia, refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). One of the main
      goals of this trial is to measure the asparaginase level as a surrogate marker of asparagine
      depletion with Oncaspar, a PEG-enhanced version of E. coli L-asparaginase. The therapeutic
      value of the simple, non-pegylated form of L-asparaginase is limited by its short half-life
      and propensity to cause allergic reactions.
