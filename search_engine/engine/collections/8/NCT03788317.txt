      having Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels IV or V. Improvement in
      sitting balance may positively effect the performance and caregiving of vital tasks of daily
      life in these children and may furtherly improve the quality of life of both the child and
      family. BoNT-A is an important treatment in children with CP because it is safe in young
      children and allows combined treatment. In the current literature its efficacy on body
      functions and structures by hypertonia management is well known. However there is
      inconclusive evidence for improvement in activity and participation domains of ICF with
      BoNT-A. CP is a very heterogenous population and in most of the studies the inclusion
      criteria do not adress level of underlying motor control and the primary efficacy assessment
      methods were usually chosen to cover hypertonia. Besides generally the efficacy endpoints
      were so soon to detect changes in activity or participation domains of ICF. Lack of
      association of rehabilitation programs is another important concern for the current clinical
      studies.

      In this present study a well defined subpopulation of CP children having GMFCS levels of IV
      or V who each received integrated BoNT-A treatment with a primary goal of improved sitting
      balance will be recruited to identify the probable changes in activity and participation
      domains of ICF as well as changes in quality of life of the family and the child.
