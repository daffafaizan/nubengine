      advantages compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Currently, no reports have described
      the effects of HFNCO in postoperative patients after thoracic surgery. The primary objective
      of this study is to determine the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia (defined as a
      PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300) in patients with lung cancer after pulmonary lobectomy.

      In the postoperative period after extubation, patients will be randomly assigned to either:

        1. standard oxygen therapy group (control group) or

        2. HFNCO group (study group).

      In the control group, patients will receive oxygen treatment by means of a conventional face
      mask, with a level of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set to maintain peripheral oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) = 92% - 98%. Patients in the study group will be given HFNCO treatment with
      a gas flow level = 50 L/min and a FiO2 set to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) =
      92% - 98%. After 48 hours from study entry, all patients will be evaluated for possible
      interruption of oxygen treatment on the basis of their clinical conditions.
