      France, mortality due to HCC on viral C cirrhosis is going to increase of about 150% for men
      and 200% for women until 2020. Consequently, HCC is a problem of public health.

      The current treatment for HCC is mainly palliative with chemoembolization or intra-arterial
      radiotherapy, and intra-arterial targeted radiotherapy being the best tolerated method
      (iodine-131-labelled lipiodol being the most commonly used).

      However, since 2007, a new therapeutic approach can be considered with oral sorafenib, an
      anti-angiogenic drug which increases slightly the survival of patients.

      The key for an efficient treatment of HCC is presumably a co-treatment of sorafenib and
      intra-arterial radiotherapy. The 131I-lipiodol is a good candidate but presents
      disadvantages: it requires hospitalization in a radionuclide therapy room for one week.
      Therefore, it is necessary to find new radioactive labellings for lipiodol. In this
      objective, 188Re-SSS lipiodol, a new radioactive labeled stable complex has been developed.
      It has a short half-life and a tiny amount of gamma radiation compared to 131I-lipiodol, so
      it allows to reduce hospitalization in a protected room from 8 days to only one day.

      The aim of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and thus the recommended
      activity of 188Re-SSS lipiodol by intra-arterial injection in patients with HCC.
