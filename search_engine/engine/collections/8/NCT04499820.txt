    
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide and is a major public
      health problem.

      In Western countries, the prevalence of DR is estimated to be 35% in diabetic patients, while
      diabetic macular edema (DME) affects 5% of them.

      Currently, apart from the balance of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, no
      specific treatment is given for the minimal and moderate non-proliferative forms.

        -  DHA concentration in the retina can be modified according to the patient's diet.

        -  Minimal diabetic retinopathy does not currently benefit from specific treatment outside
           of diabetic control.

        -  Omega 3 are already known for their beneficial effects on the retina, brain and
           cardiovascular system but their effectiveness has not been tested on diabetic
           retinopathy.

        -  It is therefore a question of evaluating whether an omega 3 supplementation, at a dosage
           of 1000mg per day, can treat a minimal or moderate stage of diabetic retinopathy.

      A study by Salavila et al. has shown that the intake of LCÏ‰3PUFA, via a Mediterranean diet,
      improved the stage of DR in diabetic patients.
