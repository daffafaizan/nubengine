    
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease characterized by the rapid growth of
      myeloblasts that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal
      blood cells.

      In this study, the patients' own T cells will be genetically modified with lentiviral vectors
      expressing chimeric antigen receptors. The multi-CAR T cells recognize specific molecules
      such as CD33, CD38, CD123, CD56, MucI, and CLL1, which are often found expressed on the
      surface of AML cells. The engineered CAR T cells will be infused into patients.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the
      multi-CAR T cell therapy against AML. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the
      function of the multi-CAR T cells and their persistency in the patients.
