      surgery using ultrasound to discover if the diameter remains the same, and hence if the
      assumptions made by the oesophageal monitor are reliable. Assessing the aortic diameter
      involves a noninvasive ultrasound measurement taken in patients electively having
      laparoscopic procedures at the Royal Surrey County Hospital.

      Recruitment: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic procedures at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital. Recruitment done by Dr M Dickinson or Dr M Scott (COnsultant Anaesthetists). No
      therapeutic promises are to be made as this is purely an observational study.

      Inclusion / exclusion: Patient refusal, Surgical refusal, Conversion to an open procedure.

      Consent: Informed consent will be gained from each participant.

      Risks, burdens and benefits: This is an observational study using a non invasive technique in
      patients undergoing elective surgery. There is very little in the way of risks, burdens and
      benefits to the patient.

      Confidentiality: Caldicott principles will be adhered to.

      Conflict of interest: None.

      Use of tissue samples in future research: None.
