      cohort will consist of 10 subjects. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to
      clinical trial material (CTM) (PRTX-100 or placebo) such that 8 subjects receive PRTX-100 and
      2 subjects receive placebo. The PRTX-100 doses to be assessed in an ascending fashion are:
      0.30 mcg/kg and 0.45 mcg/kg. Dosing of Cohort 2 will occur after the Investigator reviews Day
      0-14 safety data and confers with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.

      Subjects will be confined to the clinical pharmacology research unit for 5 days following
      dosing. Each cohort will have safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic assessments over
      the 5-day post-dose period. Subjects will also have follow-up assessments at 6, 7, 10 (±1),
      14 (±1), 30 (±2), and 60 (±2) days post-dose.
