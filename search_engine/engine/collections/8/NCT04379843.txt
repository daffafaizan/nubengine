      population has been the source of thorough research for decades. Common treatment pathways
      include supportive care, pharmaceutical treatment (via indomethacin, ibuprofen, or
      acetaminophen), and surgical correction. Many PDAs self-resolve, some are not detected to
      adulthood, and others may never be discovered. However, determining which neonates with PDAs
      require pharmaceutical versus surgical management, and which can be managed with supportive
      care, can be difficult to differentiate. A standardized neonatal PDA treatment algorithm, one
      that assesses clinical significance, echocardiogram findings, and systemic PDA effects, and
      one that recommends the optimal treatment course based on these findings, would be helpful in
      medical management of neonatal PDAs in the ELBW (extremely low birth weight) population.
