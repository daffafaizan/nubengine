      departments (ED). The frail subset of elderly patients with ADHF is challenging to treat, use
      a large proportion of available resources, and are at higher risk for complications,
      including readmission to hospital after discharge. The investigators believe that by
      improving access to follow-up, optimizing self-care, and addressing the various cognitive and
      physical limitations of frailty, it will be possible to improve quality of life and reduce
      readmission rates for frail patients with ADHF.
