    
      Patients with limited disease recurrence, known as oligometastatic or oligorecurrent disease
      (defined here as 5 or fewer sites of metastatic disease) will benefit in terms of overall
      survival and disease progression from reduced tumor burden and improved local control via
      radiation to oligometastatic sites.
