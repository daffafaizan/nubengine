      sentinel lymph node biopsy only group (Group II) and routine central neck dissection group
      (Group III). At first, to know the necessity of routine central neck node dissection for
      micro PTC,the investigators will compare the result of group I and group III. Additionally,
      the investigators can analyze the usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy for substitution
      of routine central neck node dissection for micro PTC.
