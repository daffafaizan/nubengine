    
      A double-blind two-phase cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in West
      Java, Indonesia to determine whether daily consumption of MEC from 14 weeks' gestation to
      delivery improves birth length compared to placebo (Phase 1) and whether daily consumption of
      MEC from 14 weeks gestation to 5 months post-partum improves attained linear growth of
      infants at age 5 months and linear growth velocity of infants from birth to age 5 months
      compared to placebo (Phase 2). A total of 308 pregnant women will be recruited through
      midwives/public health centre from 28 clusters (villages) in Sumedang district. Clusters will
      be randomly assigned to receive placebo or micronutrient- enriched crackers (MEC) daily,
      distributed by cadres from 14 weeks gestation to 5 months post-partum. Women who fulfil trial
      criteria (20 pregnant women from each cluster) will be randomized and the first 11 eligible
      pregnant women will be invited to participate in the RCT. We will have 2-3 rolling
      recruitments to obtain the number of participants required.

      Placebo and MEC (based on powdered eggshells and chicken liver) will be manufactured locally
      according to Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), so they are identical in size, color,
      and packaging, with a code known only by the local production manager. The code will not be
      shared until the primary outcome has been analysed statistically or if requested by the
      Ethics Committee and/or Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
