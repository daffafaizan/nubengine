      low-side-effect oral iron in the UK.

      To achieve this objective we aim to determine:

        1. Pattern of prescribing to oral iron in primary care in GP practices in England: estimate
           prescription rates, efficacy and intolerance of treatment with all forms of currently
           prescribed oral iron.

        2. Health economics of the use of ferrous iron salts in primary care: estimate patterns of
           individual response to treatment; determine the costs of ferrous iron (sulphate,
           fumarate and gluconate) therapy in pre-menopausal women in primary care, and develop a
           cost-effectiveness model for alternative treatments with minimal side-effects.
