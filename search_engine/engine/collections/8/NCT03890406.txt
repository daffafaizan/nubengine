      divided into 2 groups: Group D will receive deep neuromuscular blockade, and Group M will
      receive moderate neuromuscular blockade using continuous infusion of rocuronium.
      Acceleromyography(TOF-watch SX) will be used to monitor the depth of blockade. In both
      groups, the anesthesia will be maintained with TIVA(total intra-venous anesthesia) including
      continuous target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. During the surgery, the
      number of patient movement and restoration of self respiration will be recorded. At the end
      of anesthesia, the dose of propofol and remifentanil used will be assessed and compared
      between the groups. Also, the satisfaction score of surgeons regarding the surgical
      condition, the anesthesia time, the operation time will be documented. After the patients are
      discharged, their charts are going to be reviewed and whether any pulmonary or surgical
      complications occurred will be documented.
