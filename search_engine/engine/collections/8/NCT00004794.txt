    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Cidofovir is administered intravenously.
      Treatment ideally begins within 24 hours of randomization.

      In the first group, therapy is deferred until disease progression. Patients are then treated
      according to best medical judgement, which includes the option of cidofovir therapy.

      The second group receives induction with cidofovir every 7 days for 2 weeks, then begins
      maintenance with a low dose given every 14 days until dose-limiting toxicity or disease
      progression occurs.

      The third group receives the same cidofovir induction followed by a high maintenance dose
      given every 14 days until dose-limiting toxicity or disease progression occurs.

      Probenecid and intravenous hydration are administered concurrently with cidofovir.

      Patients are followed for progression and survival every 2 weeks for 23 weeks, then every 12
      weeks. At disease progression, patients may be re-treated with another course of induction
      and maintenance.
