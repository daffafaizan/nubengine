      orthopaedic surgeon both in terms of fixation, healing, and final extremity axial alignment.
      Multiple methods of fixation are well accepted, and each has its own advantages and
      disadvantages. The common occurrence of periprosthetic supracondylar femur fractures adds
      another level of complexity, and the universal goal when treating these patients is to obtain
      and maintain acceptable alignment, allow mobilization and early weight bearing, and achieve
      union. To a degree, mobilization and weight bearing compete with maintenance of axial
      alignment, and any final outcome is a race between healing and loss of fixation. As a result,
      any intervention that can accelerate healing would be of great benefit. As the vast majority
      of these injuries heal with secondary bone healing (callous), the determination of "healing"
      is reliably determined using the modified Radiographic Union Score for Tibia Fractures
      (mRUST), and thus this patient population offers an ideal population in which to evaluate an
      accelerant of fracture healing.

      Pulsed dosing of parathyroid hormone derivatives (Forteo) has been shown to increase bone
      mass, and several studies in Europe have demonstrated its benefit as an adjuvant for fracture
      healing. Abaloparatide represents a new compound which similarly offers great potential for
      accelerating fracture healing, especially healing associated with callous formation. This is
      a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial to compare a group of patients being
      treated for supracondylar distal femur fractures who receive abaloparatide (n=38) with a
      control group of patients who receive a placebo (n=38).
