        -  measurement of microcirculation in the operated limb by laser flowmetry using portable
           device (laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) registration will be performed on leg anterior
           surface (lower third) for 10 minutes)

        -  assesment of blood laboratory parameters of endothelial dysfunction: homocysteine, von
           Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), E-selectin, P-selectin,
           soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular endothelial cell
           adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)

        -  flow cytometry analysis of circulating cells expressing surface markers (clusters of
           differentiation (CD)): CD 45-, CD 34+, CD 146+, CD 31+, CD 105+ and CD 309+

        -  surgical treatment is performed as endovenous laser ablation of GSV and microphlebectomy
           of varicose branches according to a standard protocol

        -  patients' randomization (method of random numbers) into 2 treatment groups of 20
           subjects each with sulodexide treatment (250 LSU bid for 30 day) for the active
           treatment group and without any additional pharmacotherapy for the control group

      Visit 3 (day 4 after intervention)

      - ultrasound angiography of the operated limb (evaluation of the venous ablation and
      examination of endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT))

      Visit 4 (day 32 after intervention)
