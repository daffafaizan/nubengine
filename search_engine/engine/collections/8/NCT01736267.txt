      improve hearing in patients who are deaf and cannot receive a cochlear implant. The ABI is a
      surgically placed bionic implant that converts sounds into electrical signals that are
      directly transmitted to the cochlear nucleus, the first auditory center of the brain. For
      many years, ABIs have improved the hearing of patients who are deaf due to brain tumors
      associated with a genetic syndrome called Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). However, a number
      of recent studies suggest that deaf patients who do not have NF2 and are not eligible for a
      cochlear implant may also benefit from placement of an ABI. These preliminary studies suggest
      that these non-NF2 or "nontumor" patients may actually have better outcomes after ABI surgery
      than patients suffering from NF2. Patients who do not have NF2 and are deaf due to damage to
      the hearing nerves or inner ears from infection, disease or injury are not cochlear implant
      candidates and there are no other options to improve hearing in these cases except for the
      ABI. Thus, the purpose of our study is to carefully analyze whether ABI surgery improves the
      hearing and quality of life of non-NF2 patients based on subjective and objective measures of
      their hearing before and after ABI surgery. In particular, we plan to study ABI outcomes in
      non-NF2 patients, characterize the parameters used on their devices, and determine the safety
      profile of ABIs in these patients.
