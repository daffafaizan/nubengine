      carcinoma recurrence after front-line treatments, i.e. to show significant modifications
      before clinical diagnosis of disease relapse.

      Prospective multicentre open-label study

      During visits in the frame of management of the disease, blood samples will be collected at
      diagnosis, after each cycle of eventual neoadjuvant chemotherapy, every 6 months during the
      following 2 years, and every year during the remainin time of follow-up. Tumor samples will
      be collected at surgery or through a biopsy.

      Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years.
