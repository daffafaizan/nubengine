      or being generally unwell, were considered to have a possible diagnosis of COVID-19. This was
      extremely relevant to the subgroup of patients who suffered from fractured neck of femurs
      during this time, with most of them elderly, frail, and more likely to have multiple
      co-morbidities. COVID-19 was considered a precipitating factor for falls, but also
      anecdotally, an indicator of potentially poor recovery and rehabilitation.

      With regards to orthopaedic and trauma surgery, a limited amount of literature is available
      pertaining to COVID-19 and specifically it's potential effects on patient outcomes in
      patients requiring surgery.

      We performed a multi centre observational study across London, United Kingdom, looking at the
      demographics and details of patients admitted with fractured neck of femur during the
      evolving pandemic. All data collected was non identifiable. Data was also collected as to the
      COVID-19 status of these patients, either positive or negative. Data was analysed to assess
      the morbidity and mortality of this patient group and search for any prognostic factors.
