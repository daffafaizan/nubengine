      evidence-based practice for improving quality(EPIQ) method is not only to improve the quality
      of individual, but also to improve the quality of breast-feeding of the whole neonatal
      intensive care unit(NICU), so a hospital was chosen as a cluster. The supervision unit is
      used for the quality control , coordination and technical support in the whole study
      process.The two NICU with similar number of premature infants, the same scale of NICU and
      little difference in the recognition of breast-feeding quality improvement measures that meet
      the inclusion criteria are taken as the a floor, and then randomly divided into two groups,
      taking the NICU as intervention group or the control group can avoid the individual influence
      of the intervention. In this study, recruited 12 NICUs. The purpose of study is to to
      increase the consumption of mother's own milk of premature infants through the existing
      measures of improving the breastfeeding quality, and then to improve the quality of life of
      the premature infant, and to further evaluate whether this model of improving the
      breastfeeding quality can be promoted in other NICU.
