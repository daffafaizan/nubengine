      such as psychosocial problems, behavioral disturbances, and decreased quality of life (QOL).
      Their parents face economic, social and emotional challenges. In addition, management of the
      CHC and the involvement of the child in that management can severely challenge both child and
      parent. Effective coping has been shown to moderate the negative impact of CHC. This study is
      a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of adapting a Coping
      Skills Training (CST) intervention developed for children with diabetes. The CST intervention
      will be adapted for an integrated sample of school-aged children 8 to 12 years of age with
      four health conditions (Rheumatologic Conditions, Epilepsy,Spina Bifida, and Asthma). The
      study will be a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control group. Each arm will
      consist of 25 families. CST is a 6-session group intervention based on cognitive behavioral
      and learning theory. The impact of CST on both outcomes (child: depression, QOL; parent:
      depression, Child QOL, CHC impact on family) and protective factors (child: health
      motivation, attitude, self-management efficacy; parent: family conflict) will be measured.
