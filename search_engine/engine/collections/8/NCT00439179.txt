      optimal tolerated regimen of GW572016 when combined with gemcitabine and with the combination
      of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level to
      assess toxicity. To better assess the safety at the final dose level in both Stage I and
      Stage II, the number of patients in the cohort at the Maximum Tolerated Dose for both Stages
      will be expanded to 10. Therefore approximately 34-37 patients will be treated on this study.

      Trial finished and no further data will be collected.
