      demonstrate that primed neutrophils are activated by ANCA and generate C5a that engages C5a
      receptors on neutrophils. Patients with ANCA-related disease have elevated plasma and urine
      levels of C5a in active disease but not in remission. IFX-1 is as a monoclonal antibody
      specifically binding to the soluble human complement split product C5a, which results in
      nearly complete blockade of C5a induced biological effects. Therefore, IFX-1 may be effective
      in the treatment of subjects with AAV.

      In this Phase II study of 20 to 55 subjects with GPA or MPA, IFX-1 will be administered in
      combination with reduced dose glucocorticoids or a placebo glucocorticoid compared with
      standard dose glucocorticoids.
