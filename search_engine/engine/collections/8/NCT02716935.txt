      acknowledged, albeit not fully understood. Gut microbiota composition imbalances have been
      found in malnourished children, which were not restored by nutritional interventions as
      currently conducted. Therefore, the necessity to design more complete nutritional
      interventions that include gut health has been advised by expert committees.

      Prebiotics are compound that selectively enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. They
      have been recommended and used in infant formula and weaning cereals resulting in gut
      microbiota resembling that of breastfed infants in formula fed infants in developed
      countries. A healthy gut microbiota was shown to be associated with enhanced growth patterns
      and decreased morbidity in children in developed countries. Evidence of such outcome is
      lacking in developing countries, yet such results would be particularly valuable for children
      from these settings, living in rather poor sanitary conditions in an environment
      characterized with high infectious disease load, conditions that mostly explain the high
      prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This study aims to assess the effect of a 6 months'
      supplementation with a lipid based nutrient supplement fortified with fructo-oligosaccharides
      and inulin on microbiota diversity and functionality in rural Burkinabe infants, and to
      explore its subsequent effects on linear growth velocity and morbidity.
