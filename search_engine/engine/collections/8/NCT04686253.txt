      presumed to be related to the occurrence of cryptogenic stroke (CS), transient ischemic
      attack (TIA) or migraine. In addition, the main hypothesized pathophysiologic mechanism is
      paradoxical embolization, namely microemboli or metabolites from the venous circulation to
      enter the systemic circulation. The morphological characteristics of PFO have the potential
      to predict risks and screen the appropriate candidates for transcatheter closure. The
      structure features for predicting risk included atrial septal aneurysm, a large right-left
      shunt, long-tunnel PFO and so on. However, the in-vivo internal microstructure of PFO is
      still unclear. The microstructural features might provide important information for better
      understanding the PFO and risk stratification.

      The aim of this study is to (1) investigate the internal microstructure of patent foramen
      ovale related to cryptogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack or migraine and determine the
      effectiveness of transcatheter closure in these patients; (2) evaluate the microstructural
      features of asymptomatic patients with PFO and make a follow-up.

      This study will enroll subjects with PFO, and enrollment will be divided into three phases.

      Phase 1: PFO patients with CS or/and TIA (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed). A
      minimum of 100 patients is reached.

      Phase 2: PFO patients with migraine (transcatheter closure of PFO was performed). A minimum
      of 100 patients is reached.

      Phase 3: PFO patients without symptom (5-year follow-up). A minimum of 100 patients is
      reached.
