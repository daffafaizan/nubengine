      metastases (BM) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients with 4 or more BM. The
      interim analysis from the QUARTZ study showed that WBRT did not provide benefit in quality of
      life nor survival over best supportive care. WBRT has significant side effects, such as hair
      loss, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction which may impair quality of life. A recently
      published study showed that SRS in patients with 5 up to 10 BM had a comparable survival to
      patients treated with 2 up to 4 BM. Many systemic therapies do not have a satisfactory
      intracranial response, because of the blood-brain barrier. The potential advantages of SRS
      i.e, limiting radiation doses to the uninvolved brain and a high rate of local tumour control
      by just a single treatment. Next logic step would be to compare WBRT with SRS alone in
      patients with 4-10 BM and evaluate whether SRS is superior to WBRT with regard to QOL.
