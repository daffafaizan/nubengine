      affecting 10-15% of the approximately 20 million patients with diabetes and a similar number
      of patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Dermal leg and foot ulcers can result from
      compromised arterial inflow, microvascular perfusion or venous outflow which can lead to
      amputation unless vascular perfusion is improved. FGF-1 for topical administration offers the
      possibility of improved microvascular perfusion by promoting the formation of new blood
      vessels in the wound bed resulting in enhanced development of granulation tissue and
      accelerated healing.
