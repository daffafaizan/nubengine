      most previous trials used potassium chloride. Whereas, potassium in fruits and vegetables is
      not a chloride salt, but a mixture of potassium phosphate, sulphate, citrate, and many
      organic anions, most of which are precursors of potassium bicarbonate. It is unclear whether
      non-chloride salt of potassium has greater or lesser effect on blood pressure compared to
      potassium chloride.

      Experimental studies in animals and epidemiological studies in humans suggest that a high
      potassium intake may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and the kidney,
      independent of its effect on blood pressure, and also reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

      We propose to carry out a randomised double-blind trial to compare potassium bicarbonate with
      potassium chloride looking at their effect on blood pressure, and also to determine whether
      these potassium salts have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, kidney and bone
      health.

      Comparisons: potassium chloride vs potassium bicarbonate vs placebo.
