    
      Aim 1. To adapt the Moving Forward weight loss intervention for overweight/obese Hispanic BCS
      using an iterative process engaging Hispanic BCS and a community advisory committee.

      Aim 2. To conduct a randomized pilot with 40 overweight/obese Hispanic BCS to establish the
      feasibility of the adapted Moving Forward program based on recruitment, adherence, retention
      and efficacy.

      Aim 3. To explore the effects of the adapted Moving Forward program (Avanzando Juntas) on
      anthropometric (weight, % body fat, lean mass), behavioral (dietary intake, physical
      activity) psychosocial (quality of life) and biological (cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c,
      adiponectin, leptin, inflammation, insulin resistance) outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Women in the weight loss program will exhibit improvements in outcomes compared
      to women in the wait list control group.

      Avanzando Juntas supports BC & GC survivors in adopting physical activity and eating patterns
      to promote weight loss, bolster QOL and reduce the risk for comorbidities and, potentially,
      BC & GC recurrence. A strong, multidisciplinary study team provides expertise in culturally
      competent programs for Hispanic BCS, cognitive behavioral lifestyle interventions, body
      composition, breast cancer and program adaptation.

      This study is novel in its focus on weight loss among Hispanic BCS and the incorporation of
      anthropometric, behavioral, biological and psychosocial outcomes. An additional strength is
      the foundation of community partnerships that will support the current study's efforts, as
      well as those for a larger trial, and, if successful, the dissemination of the program.
