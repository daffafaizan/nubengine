      populations. This generally does not become problematic in most patients. However, certain
      populations cannot be assessed by standard means. These populations would include patients
      who are quadriplegic and those who are being treated with neuromuscular blocking agents. The
      current norm is to use a sedation scale such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale to
      assess the patient's level of sedation. An alternative to this would be to use an EEG based
      method that monitors brain activity. New methods of monitoring brain activity, using cerebral
      state monitors may provide an effective means of monitoring sedation. The cerebral state
      monitor, however, and the parameters it provides, the cerebral state index, has not been
      tested in an ICU setting. Correlating the measurements gained from the cerebral state monitor
      with the RASS assessment from sedated ICU patients may allow us to develop a method of
      monitoring sedation in populations that were impossible to monitor previously. Accurately
      monitoring the level of sedation in these patients may help decrease the incidence of
      over-sedation and under-sedation.
