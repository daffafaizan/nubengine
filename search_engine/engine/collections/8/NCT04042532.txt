      criteria to recruit the biomarker-defined, young-onset AD patients with intermediate-to-high
      levels of biological evidence. This is a randomized, sham-controlled, 2-way crossover study,
      and combined neuroimaging study of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to further explore the potential mechanisms.
      This study will consist of two intervention periods. A total of 50 young-onset AD patients
      will be consecutively recruited and be randomized into one of two groups: active and sham
      stimulation (n = 25 per group) in every intervention period. Besides, 20 cognitively normal
      subjects will be recruited for neuroimaging comparison. Cognitive evaluation will be
      performed before and immediately after treatment at 2 weeks of TBS intervention, and 4 weeks
      after TBS. Data on functional neuroimaging will be also collected before and after TBS
      protocol.
