      consume a disproportionately large amount of the health resource burden attributed to asthma.
      Treatment options in this group are extremely limited; the development of effective
      treatments for this group of patients should be a priority, not only for increasing
      individual patient quality of life but for long term reduction of health spending.

      This randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, cross over trial will investigate the
      efficacy of a soluble TNF receptor, etanercept, in severe, steroid dependant asthma.
