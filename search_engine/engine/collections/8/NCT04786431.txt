      outlined in Table 1. Control (n = 85) were taken from the population of the Coimbra and
      Lisbon, Portugal, regions. They satisfied the criterion that they had never had any CVD- or
      SLE-related health complaints. The CVD patients (n = 238) were divided into 6 groups. CVD1 (n
      = 61) contains individuals who went to the hospital with chest pain but had no indicators for
      stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. CVD2 (n = 82) are
      patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP). CVD1 and CVD2 are defined according to the
      ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guidelines. CVD3 (n = 20) contains patients with unstable
      angina pectoris, CVD4 (n = 34) are patients who suffered an acute myocardial infarction with
      no ST-elevation in ECG, and CVD5 (n = 20) are patients who suffered acute myocardial
      infarction with ST-elevation in ECG. CVD3, CVD4, and CVD5, together, may be classified as
      patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). CVD1 through CVD5 groups were all obtained
      from Hospital Santa Cruz, Carnaxide, Portugal. Acute ischemic stroke (IS) (n = 21) were
      patients admitted at the emergency room of the Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon,
      Portugal, who suffered from acute ischemic stroke. The SLE cohort (n = 104) were patients
      from Hospital Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal. The inclusion criteria were all
      patients diagnosed with the pathology and above 18 years old. The exclusion criteria were the
      existence of serious renal and hepatic pathologies, cancer or existence of infectious
      diseases.
