      sickle cell anemia (SCA). MitoQ, the most extensively studied mitochondrial-targeted
      antioxidant, has been shown to be protective against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the
      heart, endothelial damage due to hypertension and ROS in animal models. MitoQ is commercially
      available as a dietary supplement to reduce overall oxidative stress and anti-ageing.
      However, MitoQ has not been tested either as a platelet antagonist or as an endothelial
      protectant in SCA patients. Investigators propose to conduct a small clinical trial of MitoQ
      in subjects with SCA to test the hypothesis that MitoQ scavenges platelet mtROS to prevent
      platelet activation and attenuate vascular dysfunction in SCA.

      Investigators will test whether MitoQ decreases basal platelet activation in SCD patients and
      attenuates vascular dysfunction in subjects with SCA. Investigators will administer MitoQ
      orally to patients and healthy controls for 14 days. Investigators will obtain platelet
      count, hemolytic markers, platelet mtROS levels and activation markers, clinic BP
      measurements before and after MitoQ.

      Adult male and female SCA subjects in steady state (n=10) and 5 healthy African-American
      volunteers will be recruited after obtaining informed consent.
