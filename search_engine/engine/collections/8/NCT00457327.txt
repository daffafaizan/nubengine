      with rectal cancer of the middle or lower third of the rectum could be improved
      significantly. There is no valid data about the need of protective ileostomy in these
      patients. About 10% of the patients develop insufficiency of the anastomosis and might
      benefit from ileostomy whereas about 90% would not have required protective ileostomy
      retrospectively. Aim of the study is to show that protective ileostomy is not required if
      several criteria are fulfilled and early measures in case of clinical impairment are defined.
      Therefore eligibility criteria include safely performed stapler anastomosis with complete
      rings and control of impermeability by air insufflation. In the event of clinical impairment
      in the postoperative course CT scan with KM filling of the rectum to exclude insufficiency of
      the anastomosis will be performed. In case of insufficiency protective ileostomy will be
      created. 40 patients will be included.

      Comparison: Patients with resectable rectal cancer of the middle or lower third will be
      intraoperatively randomized to either protective ileostomy or no ileostomy at all.
