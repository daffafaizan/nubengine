      pulmonary impedance, and invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to:

        1. Comprehensively phenotype patients with scleroderma ILD-PH and pulmonary vascular
           exercise limitation (PVL) relative to scleroderma ILD-PH without PVL.

        2. Compare the efficacy of chronic Macitentan therapy in improving 1) right ventricular
           hemodynamics 2) exercise capacity and 3) symptoms in scleroderma ILD-PH patients with
           and without PVL.
