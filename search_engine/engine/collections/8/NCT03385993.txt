      to research the feasibility and clinical potential of an immersive digital reality-augmenting
      system in reducing the occurrence of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences of
      critical illness (e.g. pain, anxiety and insomnia) and environmental exposures (noise &
      light) that are risk factors for the development of delirium, a common and devastating
      complication in the intensive care unit (ICU).
