    
      Patients will be stratified according to age in a first step, with a cut-point of 65 years
      old. For patients younger than 65 years old who achieve complete response, a second
      stratification will be made before first consolidation treatment. This second stratification
      will be performed according to the follow parameters: MDR at the end of induction, karyotype
      and molecular findings, including FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and NPM1 mutations.
      The following groups can be identified according to these parameters:

      Group A:

      Patients aged 65 or younger who are candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

      Group A1:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), good prognosis karyotype
      and, in the case of t(8;21) or inv(16), absence of mutations in the exon 17 of c-kit.

      Group A2:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), intermediate-risk karyotype,
      NPM1 positive and FLT3 negative.

      Group A3:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), intermediate-risk karyotype,
      absence of NPM1 mutations and who are negative for FLT3-ITD or FLT3-ITD positive with a ratio
      less than 0.8, regardless NPM1 status.

      Group A4:

      Patients who are in first CR with positive MRD (greater than 0.1%), t(8;21) or inv(16) with
      mutations in the exon 17 of c-kit, intermediate risk karyotype with positive FLT3-ITD and
      ratio greater or equal to 0.8 or high-risk karyotype.

      Group B:

      Patients over 65 years who are able to receive intensive chemotherapy.

      TREATMENT SCHEDULE:

      Treatment is tailored for each of the previously defined groups:

      Group A:

      Induction with Idarubicin and ARA-C in "3 +7" schedule (IDA 12 mg/m2 x 3 days and ARA-C 200
      mg/m2 x 7 days).

      Group A1:

      Two consolidation cycles with ARA-C at a dose of 3 g/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5. Collection of
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after the first consolidation. Autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) with Busulphan 1 mg/kg/6 VO or 0,8 mg/kg/6 h IV (Busilvex®) from day
      -8 to -5; Etoposide 20 mg/kg/d from day -4 to -3 and ARA-C 3 g/m2/12 h from on days -3 and -2
      (see criteria for HiDAC modification); and G-CSF 10 µg/kg/d from day -9 to -2 (BEA schedule).
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is not recommended in first CR
      in this group of patients.

      Group A2:

      First consolidation with Idarubicin and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2
      at day 1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3
      g/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA conditioning. It is not recommended to
      perform Allo-HSCT, especially from alternative donors, in first CR.

      Group A3:

      First consolidation with Ida and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2 at day
      1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3 g/m2 on
      days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA schedule if no HLA-identical sibling is available.
      Patients in this group are candidates for allo-HSCT in first CR if HLA-identical sibling is
      available. Allo-HSCT will be performed after first consolidation.

      Group A4:

      First consolidation with Ida and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2 at day
      1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3 g/m2 on
      days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA schedule if no donor is available. Patients in this
      group are candidates for allo-HSCT in first CR, including alternative donors. Allo-HSCT will
      be performed after first consolidation or later if no donor is available at this time.

      Group C:

      Induction with Idarubicin and ARA-C "2 + 5" (IDA 12 mg/m2 x 2 days and ARA-C 200 mg/m2 x 5
      days). Two consolidations with GO 3 mg/m2 day 1 and ARA-C 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion days
      1 to 5.

      AML CHARACTERIZATION AND SAMPLES COLLECTION:

      To achieve a complete characterization of AML, inmunophenotype analysis (defining the pattern
      for MRD studies), cytogenetics, FISH for inv(16), t(8;21) and t(15;17), and molecular study
      for AML1/ETO, CBFβ/MYH11, NPM1 and FLT3-ITD will be performed in all cases. For FLT3-ITD, the
      ratio between the mutated and not mutated allele will be calculated.

      During the phase of samples collection, DNA, RNA and viable cells will be stored.
