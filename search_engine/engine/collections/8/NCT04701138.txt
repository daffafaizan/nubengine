      predominantly derived from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). Previous research has established that obese mice and humans
      have lower circulating levels of SPMs relative to lean controls. In this study, SPMs will be
      administered as a dietary supplement to obese human subjects to establish: 1) their
      bioavailability in plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2) their
      effects on immune cell abundance and in vitro antibody production. The rationale for focusing
      on immune cells is that SPMs may be targeting their abundance and phenotype. This study does
      not intend to make any health or health-related claims.

      Participants: A total of 24 (n=12 men + 12 women) obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) euglycemic and
      pre-diabetic subjects (fasting glucose 70-125 mg/dL or HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%) aged 50-65 years
      will be recruited by Dr. Erik Butler from the UNC Family Medicine Center in Chapel Hill.

      Procedures (methods): This is a non-randomized uncontrolled clinical trial. The study will
      provide the intervention 'SPM Active' provided by Metagenics. All subjects will be advised to
      take 4 capsules per day (2 capsules with breakfast and 2 capsules with dinner) of 'SPM
      Active' for 4 weeks total. Each capsule contains 145 mg of SPMs for a total daily dose of 580
      mg. Fasting blood will be drawn pre- and post-intervention using phlebotomy available under
      the direction of Dr. Butler. The scientific approach will rely on mass-spectrometry based
      metabololipidomics, immunophenotyping with flow cytometry, and anthropomorphic/blood
      pressure/BMI measurements (anthropometric measures are only intended for use in statistical
      analysis for confounding variables).
