      the mobile mammography unit is an acceptable and feasible method to increase access to
      cervical cancer screening for under-screened women in rural Virginia. The procedures will be
      recruitment of under-screened women in rural Virginia to complete HPV testing using
      self-collection kits distributed through the mobile mammography unit. Regardless of HPV
      positivity, all women will be provided with information about cervical cancer screening
      (locations, cost, etc.), and will be encouraged to complete Pap screening by a clinician.
