      treatment. Epirubicin is an anthracycline that was used widely in the treatment of cancer.
      Our previous study of an epirubicin and paclitaxel combination in non-small cell lung cancer
      patients showed a response rate of 52.6% and good median survival. However, most patients
      suffered from paclitaxel-related neurotoxicity.

      Chemotherapy may increase an average of 1 to 2 months of median survival in inoperable
      non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy may not
      provide a cure for these patients. Reduction of side effects and enhancement of life quality
      of the patients are as important as life prolongation for these patients. We designed a
      combination chemotherapy using gemcitabine with epirubicin in the treatment of inoperable
      non-small cell lung cancer. The treatment will be compared to gemcitabine and cisplatin
      combination.
