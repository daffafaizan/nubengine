      Sleep study and pulmonary evaluation Hormone levels Determination of up to 6 key
      ROHHAD-related symptoms to be followed Hyperphagia questionnaire
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
      scan Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

      Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg (ideal body weight)/dose daily for 4
      days, with Mesna and hydration as prophylaxis against hemorrhagic cystitis. Supportive care
      will include mucosal care, transfusions, infection prophylaxis, and empiric treatment for
