      addiction. To model this behavior, we will refine the parameters of a modified Monetary
      Incentive Delay (MID) task that will allow us to investigate neural substrates of
      approach-avoidance conflict resolution. We will then use this task to investigate functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activation during pursuit of reward in heavy and
      light drinkers.

      Study Population: Healthy non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and healthy light drinkers
      aged 21 to 60.

      Design: The study will require 1 to 2 visits. Subjects will play a modified MID task called
      Reward Incentive Delay with Shock (RIDS) to measure motivation to earn cue reward points in
      conditions that are signaled to be safe or associated with a threat. After playing the RIDS
      task subjects will be able to self-administer alcohol and/or food based on the reward points
      earned during the task.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures are differences in behavioral task performance and in
      blood oxygenation dependent level (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and
      analyzed using AFNI software.
