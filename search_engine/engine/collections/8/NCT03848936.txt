      determine the functional level and to determine the effect on quality of life. In this
      survey, age, gender, demographic information of the patient, as well as additional diseases
      which can be seen together with cerebral palsy will be questioned. There are studies about
      the functional status of adults with CP in the literature; However, there is no study
      conducted on this subject in our country. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the
      functional status and mental functions of adults with CP who applied to our hospital.
