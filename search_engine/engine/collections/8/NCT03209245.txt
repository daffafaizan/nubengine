      allergens in elderly patients with allergic rhinitis and a confirmed HDM allergy. The study
      with double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted in one centre. A total of 92
      patients ranging from 65 to 73 years of age were recruited from the outpatient allergy clinic
      to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the study. First, there was a need for pre
      screening approximately 157 patients with inhalant allergies and the right age. Additionally,
      the patients included in the study all had a positive skin prick test (SPT), were positive
      for specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), and had positive nasal provocation tests (NPTs) with
      D.pteronyssinus and D. farinae allergens. Patients with a clinical allergy and/or a positive
      skin prick test and specific IgE to other inhalant allergens (including other pollens) were
      excluded from the study. A careful examination of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat was
      performed on all patients. The severity of perennial allergic rhinitis (AR) was assessed
      using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines. The patients were
      randomly selected to receive PURETHAL Mites (20,000 AUeq/ml, HAL Allergy BV, Leiden, The
      Netherlands, containing major allergen equivalents of 14.0 μg/ml group 1, and 20.0 μg/ml
      group 2, measured by ELISA in the extract prior to modification and adsorption on aluminium
      hydroxide) or a placebo (Figure 1). The recruitment period was limited to three months
      (April-June). Purethal Mites were administered as perennial therapy using the following
      regimen: 1 dose- 0.1 ml, 2 doses - 0.2 ml, 3 doses - 0.5 ml every week, and 0.5 ml every four
      weeks during 24 months.
