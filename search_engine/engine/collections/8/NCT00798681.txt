      the gold-standard for parenteral nutrition in opposition to industrialized ready-to-use
      parenteral nutrition (RTU). Although CNF is possibly associated with elevated infection
      rates, delay in the start of enteral nutrition and worse clinical outcomes there is no strong
      scientific evidence in the literature to support that the use of RTU is indeed associated
      with better clinical outcomes.

      The use of closed ready-to-use parenteral nutrition systems is probably associated with less
      infection rates and better clinical outcomes including less time at the hospital and at the
      intensive care unit, less consumption of hospital resources and most likely lower mortality
      rates as well as early initiation of parenteral nutrition support. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate all the above mentioned parameters in contrast with those observed when using CNF
      parenteral nutrition.
