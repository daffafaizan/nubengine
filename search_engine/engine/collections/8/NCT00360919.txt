      activity, as has been demonstrated with other craved foods, particularly chocolate. Like
      other dairy products, cheese contains casein, which is the major protein in cow's milk. This
      is unlike human milk, in which the primary protein is whey. Casein includes αs1-, αs2-, β- ,
      and κ-casein, with αs1 and β forms predominating. Human and bovine casein molecules are
      cleaved during digestion to release opioid peptides that are believed to have biological
      properties relevant to infant physiology and behavior. Specifically, β-casein is cleaved to
      form β-casomorphins. Like other opiate agonists, β-casomorphins prolong gastrointestinal
      transit time and have an antidiarrheal effect.

      Casomorphin receptor binding has been demonstrated in opiate receptor assays and bioassays.
      Duodenal aspirates from human volunteers given cow's milk have demonstrated the presence of
      several casomorphins, particularly β-casomorphin-7. Few studies have assessed the presence or
      action of casomorphins in humans. The ability of casein-derived opioid peptides to pass into
      the bloodstream is not well characterized, and is the subject of the present study.
