        -  Compare the survival of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated
           with cisplatin and irinotecan vs cisplatin and etoposide.

        -  Compare the objective response rate and progression-free survival of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the association between UGT1A1 polymorphisms and irinotecan-associated toxic
           effects in these patients.

        -  Determine the association between ERCC-1 and XRCC-1 polymorphisms and non-response of
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of metastatic sites (single vs multiple), lactic dehydrogenase (no greater than upper limit
      of normal (ULN) vs greater than ULN), and weight loss in the past 6 months (5% or less vs
      more than 5%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin
           IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3 and cisplatin IV
           over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks.

      Treatment in both arms continues for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 620 patients (310 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
