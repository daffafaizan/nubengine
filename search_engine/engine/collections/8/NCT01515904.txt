    
      The primary objective is to conduct an evaluation of the STOMP clinic as a model of care with
      a specific focus on: (i) patient outcomes (anthropometric, metabolic, and psychosocial); and
      (ii) care coordination and care satisfaction.

      Patient outcomes will be compared against baseline evaluation data over time, and to a
      control group of patients not enrolled in the program, but who expressed interest in the
      program and were unable to attend.
