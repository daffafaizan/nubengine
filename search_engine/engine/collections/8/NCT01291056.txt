      taking clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective setting.

      Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation,
      correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for
      unexplained infertility1. While clomiphene citrate is generally well tolerated, common side
      effects have been reported including vasomotor flushes, breast tenderness, pelvic discomfort,
      and mood swings. Visual changes, such as palenopsia are rarely reported2. The side effect
      profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is similar to symptoms of
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms of PMDD include tension, irritability,
      depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and physical
      symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain. Several
      validated scales have been used to record symptom occurrences and to characterize the timing
      of symptom occurrence relative to the menstrual cycle3.

      The psychological and mood side effects of clomiphene citrate in women undergoing infertility
      treatment have been studied to a limited degree. One study reported mood swings in 9 out of
      14 women surveyed4. Another small study found a higher frequency of irritability, mood
      swings, feeling down and bloating in women undergoing fertility treatment who were taking
      clomiphene citrate compared to no medication.
