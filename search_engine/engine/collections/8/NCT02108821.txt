      are 2 to 22 years of age will be enrolled in the trial over 3 years. The fecal donors,
      preferably a parent or sibling, will be extensively screened for infectious diseases prior to
      providing stool for the transplant. Patients who are failing primary therapy, are in a flare,
      and require restaging of their IBD by an endoscopy and colonoscopy will be approached for the
      study. Standard of care endoscopy and colonoscopy will be performed on each subject and 2
      additional biopsies will be taken for analysis. Microbiota analysis will also be performed on
      both the donor and recipient stool sample prior to transplantation, and on the recipient
      sample at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post transplantation. The primary objective will be
      to study the safety of FMT in all enrolled subjects. The study will also correlate efficacy
      and patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to, and after FMT. The secondary
      objectives are to examine the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of children with IBD using the
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity
      Index (PCDAI) analysis. Correlate the patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to,
      and after FMT.
