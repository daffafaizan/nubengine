      ,erectile dysfunction is one of the most common manifestation of sexual dysfuncion whitch has
      been reported to be as high as 70 -80 %of hemodialysis patients .

      Testosterone deficiency and insufficiency are frequent findings in hemodialysis male patients
      that were found to be 66% and 24% respectively The Probleme is multifactorial , the most
      important factor is due to testesterone deficiency. total and free testosterone levels are
      typically reduced , that is usually accompanied by elevation of serum Gonadotropins
      concentrations due to hypothalamic -pituitary-gonadal -axis disturbance(uremic hypogonadism)
      .

      Alterations in the pulsatile release of GnRH, which leads to a hypogondal state due to
      uremia, which occurs due to inadequate nutrient intake, stress, and systemic illness . Excess
      LH secretion is thought to result from the diminished release of testosterone from the Leydig
      cells, because testosterone normally provides a feedback inhibition of LH release. The
      metabolic clearance rate of LH is reduced due to reduction of kidney clearance ,Follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also increased in men with chronic kidney failure.

      Elevated plasma prolactin levels are commonly found in dialyzed men, it is thought to be due
      to increased its production , extreme hyperprolactinemia has been associated with
      infertility, loss of libido, low circulating testosterone levels, So,due to testosterone
      deficiency and hyperprolactinemia in ESRD as one of most important factors and exclusion of
      other factors , men on chronic hemodialysis shows different degrees of subfertility or
      infertility due to Erectile dysfunction , testicular damage and impaired spermatogenesis.
