    
      Study Design:

      This is a comparative, prospective, interventional, multicenter, randomized study of
      micropulse laser treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy with 2 treatment arms:

        1. < 6 months. Treatment: Minimal vs. Panmacular (randomized)

        2. > 6 months. Treatment: Panmacular only

      Treatment arms - description of laser settings:

      For "Minimal / PLACE" treatment (Mainster contact lens with magnification of 1.05x):

      Wavelength 810nm or 577nm, Power 0.75 Watt for 810 nm or 0.15 Watt for 577 nm, Duty Cycle 5%
      for both wavelenths, Spot size 125um for 810 nm and 100um for 577 nm, Duration 0.3 sec 0.3
      sec for both wavelenths, Number of spots 100-120 for both wavelenths

      For "Panmacular" treatment (Mainster lens mag 1.05x):

      Wavelength 810nm or 577nm, Power 1.70 Watt for 810 nm or 0.425 Watt for 577 nm, Duty Cycle 5%
      for both wavelenths, Spot size 50um for both wavelengths, Duration 0.3 sec 0.3 sec for both
      wavelenths, Number of spots 400-450 for both wavelenths

      All treatments will be performed following informed consent and under topical anesthesia
      using eyedrops 3x before procedure in the treatment eye(s). Follow-up will be every 6 weeks
      with final one in 6 months. Each follow-up visit will include visual acuity measurement,
      intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examination, VF and OCT examinations.

      Primary Endpoints:

        1. Visual Acuity as measured by ETRDS chart (number of letters before and after treatment

        2. Complete subretinal fluid resolution as assessed by OCT examination (microns of central
           retinal thickness before and after treatment; presence/absence of subretinal fluid)

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Visual Field - Humphrey 10-2 protocol (dB value before and after treatment)

        2. Number of treatments required for vision/structure improvement (number of laser
           sessions)

        3. Rescue rate - number of eyes requiring intravitreal injection of anti-angiogenic agents
           or oral eplerenone

      Risks: Non-response to therapy in which case alternative rescue treatments (intravitreal
      injection or oral eplerenone) will be offered to patient.

      Benefits: Patient participating in the study will receive standard of care. Participation
      will be entirely voluntary and in case of withdrawing from the study patient will be
      receiving alternative approved methods of treatment.
