    
      Procedure: Prospective trial which randomly assigns patients to either separate- or same-day
      preoperative consultation for Mohs surgery. A phone consultation will take place, which will
      assist in determining whether the patient is appropriate for enrollment into the study. If
      so, the patient will be randomized to either separate-day or same-day preoperative
      consultation.

      Materials: Patient survey

      Methods of data collection: The patient-specific data obtained from the medical record will
      include: Patient age, number of previous skin cancers, preoperative size, history of
      cutaneous surgery, employment status, and distance between home address and dermatology
      facility. Outcome measures that will be obtained from the medical record will include: Time
      between cancer diagnosis, removal and defect repair, rate of proceeding with Mohs as opposed
      to other treatment options, and rate of cancelling surgery (due to site discrepancy,
      anticoagulation issues). A survey will be used to assess patient satisfaction.
