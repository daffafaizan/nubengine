      having no embryos or embryos not-fully expanded available for transfer. Slower but
      non-arrested embryos are frequently found to have progressed to blastocyst stage by the time
      of a day 6 transfer. In the absence of a receptive endometrium, embryo selection for fresh
      transfer may be futile, and cryopreservation could be a better option. The objective is to
      determine which transfer strategy will result in a higher probability of pregnancy in
      patients whose single best day 5 embryo resulting from an IVF cycle is classified as
      expansion grade <4 by Gardner and Schoolcraft classification. The investigators hypothesize
      that in bad prognosis patients with slow-developing blastocysts, vitrified-warmed embryo
      transfer will result in higher implantation, clinical and ongoing pregnancy and live birth
      rates than fresh embryo transfer.
