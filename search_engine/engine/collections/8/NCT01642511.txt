        -  Compare the visualization rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph node in breast cancer
           patients with different injection technologies.

        -  Evaluate the metastasis rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes in patients with
           clinically axillary node -negative in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the risk factors for internal mammary sentinel lymph node metastasis

        -  Evaluate the success rate and the safety of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

        -  Draw the learning curve of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      OUTLINE:

      3~18 hours before surgery, 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was injected under ultrasonographic
      guidance in different patterns and injection methods were classified according to the number
      of injection quadrants. Subsequently, lymphoscintigraphy was performed 0.5~1.0 hour before
      surgery. During surgery, the sentinel lymph nodes (axillary or internal mammary) were
      identified by combining the use of intraoperative gamma detector and blue dye. The sentinel
      lymph nodes (axillary or internal mammary) were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and
      immunohistochemistry for future therapy planning.
