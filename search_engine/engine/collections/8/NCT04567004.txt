      online consent, participants will be randomly assigned to view different labels (explained
      below) on food and drink packaging. Participants will answer self-reported responses to the
      content (e.g., elaboration, beliefs, perceived healthfulness). After being randomized to one
      of the four groups and answering questions (e.g. which product is healthier, which product
      would you buy), the participant will see all three labels and select which is most dissuading
      from consuming a product high in a nutrient. At the end, the participant will answer
      demographic questions.

      Participants will be randomized to see either a no-label control or 1 of 3 nutrient labels.
      The participants will see 5 types of products with the labels (fruit drinks, yogurt, sliced
      bread, cookies, and breakfast cereal).

      Nutrient labels:

        1. Guideline Daily Amount label

        2. Nutriscore label

        3. Adapted Peruvian nutrient warning label (high in sugar, high in saturated fat, high in
           salt/sodium)
