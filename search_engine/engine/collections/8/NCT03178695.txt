      demonstrated efficacy of intraovarian injection of autologous PRP for resumption of menses,
      hormone stabilization, and conception after IVF in multiple women following PRP+natural cycle
      IVF (i.e., without gonadotropin stimulation). The use of stimulation (gonadotropins) and
      targeted pre- and posttreatment hormone monitoring during this clinical trial aims to
      characterize more fully the transition from PRP dosing, embryogenesis, IVF and conception.

      The current study seeks to describe how PRP works to rejuvenate immune system and ovarian
      stem cells, restore menses, provide hormone stability, and generate successful IVF sequences
      and conceptions. The quality of all embryos generated will be studied via PGS, with the goal
      of generating euploid embryos. Hormone stability and biomarkers of aging will also be
      evaluated to understand the extent of any observed benefits, and to estimate how long such
      effects may be sustained with a single PRP treatment.

      Autologous activated PRP used in this clinical study is isolated from patient derived (blood)
      samples collected on-site, using FDA-approved Regenlab [Lausanne, Switzerland] BCT-1 PRP Kit
      and RegenLab Drucker Centrifuge (FDA 510(k)-Approval #BK110061; ISO#13485).
