      I. To estimate major pathologic response (mpCR) in patients with newly diagnosed and
      untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage I-IIIA treated with three courses of
      induction nivolumab added to either cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/gemcitabine prior to
      surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Complete pathologic response at all sites of disease. III. Major pathologic
      response rate at primary site. IV. Clinical complete response rate. V. 1 year progression
      free survival (PFS). VI. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc.) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.

      IV. To explore the predictive value of serial cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels
      and response.

      V. PD-L1 assessment in tumor.
