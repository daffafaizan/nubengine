    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the rate of recurrence at the surgical site in patients with brain
           metastases treated with neoadjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with
           historical data documenting recurrence at the surgical site after surgical resection and
           whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the rate of salvage WBRT, SRS, or surgery in patients treated with
           neoadjuvant SRS alone.

        -  To determine the volume of adjacent normal brain parenchyma irradiated in these
           patients.

        -  To estimate the rate of new brain metastases outside of the neoadjuvant SRS site in
           these patients.

        -  To estimate the quality of life of these patients after neoadjuvant SRS alone.

        -  To assess the effect of SRS and surgical intervention on the preservation of
           neurocognitive functioning in these patients.

        -  To determine the clinical significance (mass effect, cognitive functioning, and other
           symptoms) of locally recurrent brain metastases at the time of their occurrence in these
           patients.

        -  To estimate the rate of death due to neurologic causes, defined as death attributable to
           the progression of neurological disease, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery over 30 to 90 minutes. Approximately 2-4
      weeks later, patients undergo surgical resection of brain metastasis.

      Quality of life and neurocognitive function are assessed periodically using the FACT-Br
      subscales and Mini-Mental State Exam.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
