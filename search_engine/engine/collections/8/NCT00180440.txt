      ICD therapies in ICD patients before & after their first elective ICD replacement. For this
      purpose all consecutive ICD patients will be included in the study, whose first implanted
      device is replaced due to ICD battery depletion (i.e. arrival at battery indicator ERI). ICD
      replacements due to other reasons can be included if duration of first ICD implantation was >
      3 years. All patients included in the trial are regularly followed up until delivery of their
      first adequate ICD therapy. The collected data shall provide statistically valid information
      about the risk to patients who never have experienced adequate ICD therapy before the ICD
      replacement investigated in this study. In the future, these statistical risk data can give
      additional information to implanting physicians, such as whether an ICD replacement can
      eventually be omitted in those patients who are at very low risk for the occurrence of ICD
      therapies. All actually available GUIDANT ICDs with CE certificate can be implanted in this
      trial.
