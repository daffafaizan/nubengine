      IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung carcinoma treated with concurrent radiation, carboplatin,
      and etoposide followed by consolidation with paclitaxel. II. Evaluate the response and
      toxicities associated with this regimen in this group of poor risk patients.

      OUTLINE: This is nonrandomized study. Chemotherapy on cycle 1 starts on day 1 with concurrent
      initiation of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is given prior to radiotherapy on those days when
      both treatments are given. Cycle 2 begins on day 29. Carboplatin is administered by 15 minute
      IV infusions on days 1, 3, 29, and 31. Etoposide (VP-16) is administered after carboplatin by
      30 minute IV infusions on days 1-4, and 29-32. Radiation therapy begins within 24 hours of
      day 1, cycle 1 of chemotherapy. The primary tumor, the adjacent mediastinum, and other
      targeted lymph nodes are administered radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. After
      the 2 cycles of chemotherapy and chest radiotherapy, patients who have stable disease,
      partial response, or complete response receive 3 cycles of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is
      administered by 3 hour IV infusions starting 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy and repeated every 3-4 weeks (approximately days 71, 92, and 103) for a total of
      3 cycles. Patients are followed every month for the first year, every 3 months for the second
      year, every 6 months for the third year, and then annually thereafter while on treatment.
      After treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 80 patients accrued in this study over 16 months.
