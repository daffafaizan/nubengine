      morbidity and mortality. Although autopsy studies have documented that the heart is affected
      in most SLE patients, clinical manifestations occur in less than 10%. QT dispersion is a new
      parameter that can be used to assess homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and autonomic
      function. We compared the increase in QT dispersion in SLE patients with high disease
      activity and mild or moderate disease activity.

      Methods: One hundred twenty-four patients with SLE were enrolled in the study. Complete
      history and physical exam, ECG, echocardiography, exercise test and SLE disease activity
      index (SLEDAI) were recorded. Twenty patients were excluded on the basis of our exclusion
      criteria. The patients were divided to two groups based on SLEDAI: 54 in the high-score group
      (SLEDAI >10) and 50 in the low-score group (SLEDAI <10).
