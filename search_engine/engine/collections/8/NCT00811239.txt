      the burden of snakebite on the public health stimulated Calmette to conduct original studies
      at the Vaccine Institute in Saigon over a hundred years ago and to develop the first snake
      antivenom ever.

      In northern Vietnam, a vast majority of the most severe envenomed patients are bitten by
      Bungarus multicinctus, which is the only krait species giving rise to significant morbidity
      and mortality in the area. Its venom contains toxins which can cause severe neuromuscular
      blockade but which do not give rise to swelling or necrosis at the site of the bite.

      Supportive care is an important part of the management of snakebites, but antivenom
      administration is the mainstay therapy in the majority of medically significant envenomings.
      Such specific therapy may dramatically reduce the consequences of the envenomation. In
      Vietnam, no specific antivenom against B. multicinctus has been available until recently when
      it has produced for clinical use.
