      often destined for lives dependent on disability insurance and disengaged from community
      life. The personal and societal costs of not helping these veterans re-integrate into
      civilian life are enormous, including suicides, addiction, family problems, and rapidly
      increasing costs to the Veterans Disability Compensation Program (VDC).

      The current project is an evaluation of the National Career Coach Program to assist veterans
      as they transition to civilian life. Instead of existing veteran services (including the VDC)
      that emphasize brokenness and pay veterans small amounts based on what they cannot do, this
      innovative program emphasizes strengths and abilities by front-loading intensive support,
      motivation, human-capital investment, and incentives to help veterans become permanently
      engaged in meaningful work, thereby boosting morale, positive identity, and community
      integration.

      The design of this study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an intensive employment
      model (National Career Coach Program) to usual community employment services available to
      unemployed veterans recently separated from active duty (Local Community Resources). The
      investigators will enroll 250 participants over an 12-month period, randomly assigning them
      to the two conditions and following them over a three-year period. The primary outcome
      domains are competitive employment and VDC disability benefits.
