      behavioural problems also known as mental health problems. Unfortunately, parents and doctors
      rarely identify mental health problems in young children in order to begin treatment. We are
      testing a short five-minute questionnaire completed by parents to see if this may help a
      doctor notice if a child has social, emotional and behavioural problems.

      In addition, we also hope to find out if the presence of feelings of stress and depression in
      on or both parents may be associated with mental health problems in their preschool child.

      This study is being conducted by researchers at SickKids and St. Michael's Hospital.
