      hypothesis of monoamine deficit. The most used antidepressants in everyday clinical practice
      act by inhibiting the reuptake of monoamines. However, meta-analyzes evaluating the efficacy
      of antidepressants suggest that they are ineffective in 30 to 40% of patients. Inflammatory
      mechanisms might be related to the deficiency of monoamines, compromising the effectiveness
      of conventional antidepressants. Newly developed specific radiotracers allow the use of
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques to evaluate neuroinflammation. It has
      recently demonstrated the relevance of the [18F] DPA- 714 as a biomarker of neuroinflammation
      in humans in several neurological diseases.
