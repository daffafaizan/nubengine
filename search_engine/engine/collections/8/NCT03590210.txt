      advanced soft tissue sarcomas. While immune oncology treatment approaches like inhibition of
      immune checkpoints by administration of anti PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies displayed very promising
      clinical activity in several types of tumors, current data points out to only limited
      activity of mono-agent immunotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas (especially in leiomyosarcomas)
      - although this type of tumor demonstrably displays a certain grade of immunogenicity. That
      means, STS patients are currently not able to benefit from the advancements in cancer
      immunotherapy which led to remarkable improvements in outcome in some other tumor entities in
      the last few years.

      Interestingly, most recent data indicates that trabectedin could enhance the activity of
      immune-modulating agents via its influence on the tumor micro-environment and the reduction
      of tumor associated macrophages. Furthermore, first clinical data obtained from a feasibility
      study on combined nivolumab/trabectedin therapy in STS patients did not report on significant
      toxicities when combining the two agents, thereby justifying combination of nivolumab and
      trabectedin utilizing standard dosages.

      Therefore, this phase II study will examine if combination of nivolumab with trabectedin is
      feasible (safe and well tolerated) and efficacious by utilizing potential synergistic effects
      of both agents. In the long run, the results of this phase II trial could build the basis for
      further evaluation of the efficacy of the trabectedin / nivolumab combination in a randomized
      clinical trial involving larger patient numbers. Finally, this could render patients with STS
      accessible to immunotherapeutics - a promising new class of drugs for anti-cancer treatment.
