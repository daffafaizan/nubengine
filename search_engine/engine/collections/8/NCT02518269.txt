    
      DESIGN: Prospective 3 Arm Randomized controlled trial.

      PURPOSE:To compare three commonly used contemporary bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).
      In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the G7 Cups and Echo BiMetric Stem
      in THA.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Osteolysis, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction,
      intraoperative/surgical data, implant positioning, survivor ship, and adverse events.

      POPULATION: 360 hips (240 will have CT scan for analysis of osteolysis).

      ELIGIBILITY: Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.

      DURATION: All patients will be followed at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 year postoperatively.
      Assuming the enrollment will be completed 18 months. The total study duration will be 11.5
      years.

      STUDY GROUPS/TREATMENTS

      Group 1 - G7 Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (Arcom XL) + Echo BiMetric Group 2 - G7
      Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (E1) + Echo BiMetric Group 3 - G7 Ceramic-on-Ceramic (CoC) + Echo
      BiMetric The study's primary efficacy endpoint will include the difference in osteolytic
      volume at 5 years postoperatively measured by Computertomografi (CT) scan.
