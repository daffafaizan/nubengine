        -  Correlate immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcÎ³R) polymorphisms with response, response
           duration, and time to resistance in samples from patients with follicular lymphoma (FL)
           treated with single-agent rituximab on ECOG-E4402.

        -  Identify gene expression profiles that correlate with response, response duration, and
           time to rituximab resistance in these patients.

        -  Determine whether the FL microenvironment is predictive of initial response and duration
           of response to rituximab.

      OUTLINE: DNA and RNA from banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples are analyzed for
      immunoglobulin-receptor polymorphism, gene expression profile, and follicular lymphoma
      microenvironment by real-time PCR, microarray hybridization, and IHC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 259 PBMC samples and 300 FFPE blocks will be accrued for this
      study.
