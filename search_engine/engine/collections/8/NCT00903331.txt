      the primary endpoint evaluation (Month 12 or earlier in case of premature discontinuation of
      study drug) and Period 2 (variable duration) from the primary endpoint evaluation visit up to
      the end of study (EOS). EOS occurred when the last patient randomized and not prematurely
      discontinued completed Period 1.
