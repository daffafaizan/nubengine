    
      There will be three distinct cohorts of patients which will vary the timing of the MEDI6469
      dose, starting three weeks before surgery and decreasing the interval before surgery by one
      week with each cohort, as long as no dose-limiting toxicity attributable to the anti-OX40 are
      observed.

      Immunohistochemistry will be used to measure the immune cells within primary and metastatic
      tumors when resected tissue is available, and surgically ablated tumors, giving each specimen
      an "immune score". The primary endpoint of the study will be the difference in immune scores
      of patients treated with anti-OX40 compared to historical controls (immune scores of
      untreated patients). Secondary endpoints will include both clinical (survival) and
      immunological data (specific measurements of immune cell populations based on flow cytometry
      and immunohistochemistry).
