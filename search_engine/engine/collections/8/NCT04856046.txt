      I. To isolate plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation panel from the peripheral blood
      of treated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that will correlate with disease
      progression or measurable residual disease.

      II. To correlate the mutations/ DNA methylation in peripheral blood with those identified in
      parallel tumor samples from the same patients with hepatocellular (HCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at 4-6 weeks prior to surgery/ablation and at 12
      weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation. Patients' previously collected tissue
      samples are analyzed. Patients' medical records are also reviewed at baseline, 4-6 weeks
      prior to surgery/ablation, 12 weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery/ablation, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
