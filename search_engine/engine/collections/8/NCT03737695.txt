      I. To create a comprehensive registry that includes patient demographics, clinical and
      histopathological data, blood samples, and tissue specimens from the primary tumor and
      metastatic sites of patients with metastatic breast cancer to improve our understanding of
      the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and therapeutic resistance.

      II. To conduct genomic studies of paired primary tumors and distant metastatic sites.

      III. To conduct genomic studies of paired distant metastatic sites obtained during the course
      of an individual?s disease.

      IV. To conduct genomic studies of cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), circulating tumor
      cell (CTC) derived DNA, germline DNA, and immune based markers in the peripheral circulation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the concordance between DNA sequencing results obtained from a clinically
      available assay and those obtained specifically for research purposes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' archival and newly collected tissue and blood samples are collected periodically
      for genetic testing. Patients also undergo collection of clinical information within 30 days
      of biopsy procedure and every 4 months.
