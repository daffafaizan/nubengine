    
      Groups 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 8 patients each with mild, moderate, or severe renal
      disease, respectively, based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated
      by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation). Each of these patients
      will receive a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.

      Group 4 will consist of 8 patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis who have been on a stable
      dialysis regimen for at least 6 months. In this cohort only, patients will participate in 2
      treatment periods, Dialysis and Inter-Dialysis, separated by a 14-day period between
      pacritinib administration. In the Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of
      pacritinib will be administered 4 hours prior to each patient's normally scheduled
      hemodialysis. In the Inter-Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib will
      be administered immediately after the end of the patient's normally scheduled hemodialysis
      session.

      Group 5 will consist of 8 healthy subjects enrolled to match the sex-, age-, and weight of
      the patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and patients with ESRD enrolled
      in the study. Healthy subjects will be administered a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.
