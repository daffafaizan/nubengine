      cholesterol lowering drugs. It is of interest how ezetimibe alone or in combination with
      statin may influence atherogenic dense Low Density Lipoprotein (dLDL) in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

      The primary objective of this study will be whether there is a change of the concentrations
      of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in dLDL from baseline in each of the 3 treatment groups. The
      comparison between treatment groups is exploratory due to insufficient power to detect any
      change between treatments.
