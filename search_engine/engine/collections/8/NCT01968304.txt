      samples used in the study will be taken at blood samplings scheduled by the hospital practice
      of the reference institution. Only small amounts of blood will be taken for this study and
      they will have no repercussion on the patient's general status.

      Evaluation of the expected results Improved knowledge of ID epidemiology in patients
      receiving chemotherapy would enable more effective targeting of potential patients
      specifically requiring management by injectable iron.

      Expected benefits

      Through the medium of this study :

        -  We hope to optimize ID screening, increase our knowledge of ID characteristics and
           enhance patient management.

        -  Management of anemia in the cancer setting could thus be modified, i.e. via injectable
           iron treatment involving no EPO, the dangers of which (increase in the number of
           thromboembolic events, and even its potentially negative impact on survival) are being
           more and more fully documented.

        -  Patients included in this study will benefit from the detection of ID, which otherwise
           would not have been discovered.
