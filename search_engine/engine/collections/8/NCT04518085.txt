      Hospital. The patients will be randomized into two groups. One group will receive a 20 minute
      pre-surgical hypnosis session delivered by an experienced clinical psychologist plus a
      post-surgical internet-based acceptance and commitment intervention. The control group will
      receive a 20 minute pre-surgical mindfulness session delivered through an audio recording
      plus treatment as usual. The primary outcomes of the study are quantitative measures of
      post-surgical pain and fatigue. In addition, relationships between biomarkers of stress and
      subacute post-surgical pain and fatigue will be analyzed using using blood- and hair samples.
      The study uses a longitudinal design with baseline measures obtained pre-surgery and follow
      up measures obtained 3 and 12 months post-surgery.
