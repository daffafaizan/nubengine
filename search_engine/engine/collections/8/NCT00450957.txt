      I. Compare the toxicity and safety of 2 different doses of oral lycopene in healthy male
      participants.

      II. Compare the pharmacokinetics of 2 different doses of this drug in these participants.

      III. Determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics needed to proceed to a large phase II/III
      study in men at high risk for prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Participants receive high-dose oral lycopene once or twice a day for 14 days. After 2
      weeks of a lycopene-free period, participants crossover and receive high-dose lycopene at the
      alternative daily schedule (once or twice a day) for 14 days.

      Arm II: Participants receive low-dose oral lycopene once or twice a day for 14 days. After 2
      weeks of a lycopene-free period, participants crossover and receive low-dose lycopene at the
      alternative daily schedule (once or twice a day) for 14 days.

      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Participants adhere to dietary
      restrictions for 2 weeks at baseline, 2 weeks during study treatment, and 2 weeks during
      pharmacokinetic sampling.

      Blood samples are collected periodically at baseline and during study treatment for
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 participants will be accrued for this study.
