    
      This study is an open-label and dose escalation study aimed at exploring the safety and MTD
      of HLX22.

      Four dose levels are designed for HLX22 in this study: 1, 3, 10, and 25 mg/kg/3 weeks. The 3
      mg/kg/3 weeks will serve as the starting dose. The study will use a BOIN design to assign
      doses to the patients, and thereby determine the MTD of HLX22.
