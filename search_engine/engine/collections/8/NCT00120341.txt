      patients with diabetes mellitus have been well described in the medical literature.
      Peripheral sensory neuropathy is one of the strongest risk factors for both foot ulceration
      and amputation in this population. In the absence of neuropathy people rarely develop foot
      ulcers. Because of the lack of painful feedback, peripheral neuropathy provides a permissive
      environment that allows repetitive tissue injury to occur such that a person may wear a hole
      in the bottom of his or her foot much in the way that he or she may wear a hole in a
      stocking. Certainly, the early detection of a level of peripheral neuropathy sufficient to
      contribute to the development of foot wounds or "loss of protective sensation" is one of the
      most important criteria to identify high risk patients for foot complications and is
      paramount when instituting a structured treatment plan to prevent lower extremity
      complications.

      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of the application of a series of
      Anodyne in-home treatments over a 90-day period to improve peripheral sensation and
      self-reported quality of life in persons with diabetes mellitus. This pilot study should
      provide preliminary data to determine if additional clinical evaluation is warranted and to
      determine an appropriate sample size. The hypothesis is the Anodyne therapy will improve
      sensory function over the course of therapy compared to sham therapy.
