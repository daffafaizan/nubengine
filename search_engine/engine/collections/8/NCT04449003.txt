    
      Tourette syndrome (TS) is a multi-faceted neurodevelopmental disorder with wide-ranging
      impact on adolescent quality of life (QOL). Comorbid psychiatric and psychological factors
      exert greater influence on QOL than tics in TS, but the specific role of stress, family
      dynamics, and peer relationships has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that these
      factors are known to impact QOL in those with chronic disease. Investigators propose a
      cross-sectional, observational pilot study to examine the contribution of stress, family
      dynamics, and peer relationships to QOL in adolescents with TS. The primary goal of this
      study is to collect sufficient data for hypothesis-generation and power analysis refinement
      in planning of a larger scale study.

      Investigators will recruit adolescents aged 13-17 years of age with TS presenting for regular
      care at the Vanderbilt Pediatric Neurology Clinic. Adolescents without any neurologic or
      psychiatric diagnoses will be recruited as a control population. Participants and one of
      their parents/caregivers will complete a series of questionnaires screening for and
      quantifying the extent of stress and mental health symptoms, including anxiety, depression,
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      Participants will also complete instruments characterizing family interactions and peer
      relationships. The scale battery can be completed by the adolescent and caregiver in parallel
      and is anticipated to take 60-75 minutes total to complete. Adolescents with TS will also
      undergo a semi-structured interview assessing the severity of their tics. The study plans to
      enroll subjects over a 12-month time frame.
