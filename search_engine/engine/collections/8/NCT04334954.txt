      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-COV2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to
      current and future pandemics. In this natural history study, we will collect blood from
      individuals to identify those who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies present despite no confirmed
      disease or known exposures.
