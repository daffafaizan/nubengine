    
      Right handed healthy individuals aged 18-40 will be eligible to participate. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive real or placebo 2mA tDCS delivered for 20
      minutes while performing a 3 hour computerized cued Stroop task. Groups will receive real or
      sham stimulation during the first 20 minutes or 90-110 minutes into the task. Groups will be:
      1) Sham (sham given at both time points); 2) Prevent (real will be given during first 20
      minutes to try to prevent or delay fatigue and sham given at second time point); or 3) Rescue
      (sham will be given initially and real given at 90-110 minutes to see if performance can be
      rescued after fatigue has set in). The primary outcome measure will be the slope of change
      for intra-individual variability of response time for correct items and regression models
      will be used to determine whether real preventative or rescue tDCS alters the rate of
      performance change relative to sham stimulation. Accuracy and mean response time will also be
      examined as secondary outcomes.
