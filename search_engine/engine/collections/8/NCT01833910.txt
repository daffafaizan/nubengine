      maximize resuscitation skill retention, and promote willingness to act while addressing major
      barriers to training including time and cost. To accomplish this, the study team will train
      student volunteers from the University of Pennsylvania using one of three methods: 1) a
      video-only method with no psychomotor skill practice, 2) a video-only method with psychomotor
      skill practice on a household object or 3) a video self-instruction (VSI) kit. Volunteers
      will be young, healthy students from the University of Pennsylvania with no CPR Training
      within the last 24 months. The investigators will use the American Heart Association's CPR
      Anytime Video Self-Instruction Kit which comes equipped with a DVD and inflatable manikin.

      For the groups receiving the Video-Only methods, the investigators will remove the inflatable
      manikin and train the subjects with the DVD. The investigators will randomize the
      participants to one of the video-only methods or to the VSI kit method of training when they
      are scheduled for training. Immediately following the training, the investigators will
      conduct a CPR skills test to measure the effectiveness of the training method. Three (3) to
      twelve (12) months post-training the investigators will schedule and conduct an in-person
      interview with subjects. As part of the interview, subjects will be asked to complete a
      survey measuring their comfort level and willingness to use their CPR skills. Subjects will
      also be asked to complete another CPR Skills test.
