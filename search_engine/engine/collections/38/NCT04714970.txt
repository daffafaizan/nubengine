      schizophrenia. The cognitive function deficit has also been a major symptom for
      schizophrenia. However, metabolic dysfunction could further impair the cognition. rTMS is a
      promising novel intervention, which have strong potentials on moderating increased appetite
      and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, as it has been proved for the treatment of
      depression.

      Therefore, the investigators designed this randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of rTMS, using iTBS pattern, on prevention of the elevated appetite
      and cognitive deficiency in individual with schizophrenia. The intervention will last for ten
      continuous days and the follow-ups are scheduled at baseline, 10days and 30days. The primary
      outcomes include the change of MCCB score, AEBQ score and EEG data. Secondary outcomes
      include the change of serum metabolic indexes and anthropometry indexes.
