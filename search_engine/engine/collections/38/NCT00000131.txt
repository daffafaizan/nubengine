      complications. The two major complications are reduced central vision caused by macular edema
      and neovascular glaucoma caused by iris neovascularization. Other clinical trials have shown
      that laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment for complications found in diabetic
      retinopathy and branch vein occlusion, which have some features in common with CVO:
      neovascularization and reduced visual acuity caused by macular edema occur in all three
      disorders. Evidence from small-scale studies suggests that a grid pattern of photocoagulation
      reduces macular edema in CVO patients, although the associated changes in visual acuity are
      variable. The CVOS is a detailed investigation of grid pattern photocoagulation in a larger
      randomized group of patients.

      Eligible patients were divided into four groups:

      Group N: Eyes with extensive retinal ischemia (at least 10 disc areas of nonperfusion) were
      randomly assigned to receive panretinal photocoagulation or nontreatment unless iris
      neovascularization developed.

      Group M: Eyes with visual loss ascribable to macular edema were randomly assigned to receive
      grid-pattern photocoagulation or nontreatment.

      Group P: Eyes with relatively perfused retinas were followed to provide information about the
      natural history of the disease.

      Group I: Indeterminate eyes in which the retina could not be visualized accurately because of
      hemorrhage were followed in a natural history study.

      Green argon laser with a slit lamp delivery system was used for all treatments. Photographic
      documentation of retinal changes was obtained at entry, post-treatment, and at specified
      followup visits for a period of at least 3 years. The frequency of followup visits varied
      according to the group to which the CVO patient was assigned. Visual acuity, the primary
      outcome factor in the group with macular edema, was measured according to a modified Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol at each visit.
