    
      Purpose: The investigators aim to determine whether geniculate artery embolization is a safe
      treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and confirm published reports of sustained
      post-procedural pain relief, improved physical function and investigate potential
      improvements in joint function quantitatively through imaging and targeted assessments.

      Participants:Twenty patients with moderate to severe knee pain, pain refractory for 3 months
      of conservative therapies, imaging features of symptomatic osteoarthritis and ineligible for
      arthroplasty for 1 year.

      Procedures (methods): Patients will undergo a brief clinical evaluation to verify eligibility
      through inclusion and exclusion criteria in addition to a comprehensive joint pain treatment
      history will be recorded including active analgesic and anti-inflammatory use. A
      pre-procedural MRI will be completed to assess the extent of their osteoarthritis, signs of
      active synovitis and vascular anatomy of the knee. Evaluations post geniculate artery
      embolization will occur at 24 hours, 1, 6 and 12 months to assess for changes in knee pain
      and joint function and monitor adverse events. An MRI will be performed at the 6 month visit
      to detect changes in synovitis and exclude complications.
