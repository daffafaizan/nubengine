      feasibility in providing patient education and reminders for self-monitoring for cesarean
      delivery patients. The investigators will measure the extent of patient engagement with our
      application through in-app usage data, as well as receive quantitative and qualitative
      feedback regarding feasibility. By understanding user behavior and needs through
      questionnaires and application usage data, the investigators could design more effective and
      tailored interventions for patients. Results of this study will help further development and
      implementation of an interdisciplinary mobile monitoring and communication platform for
      perioperative care.

      This study is funded by the Dalhousie University Department of Anesthesia, Pain Management &
      Perioperative Medicine.
