      (Ketalar速, 10 mL inj., 50 mg ketamine hydrochloride/ml, Pfizer Drug Company, USA). The Group
      2 (Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine
      0.5% (Marcaine速, 20 mL inj. 5 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride/ml, AstraZeneca Drug Company,
      Turkey). The Group 3 (Ketamine+Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of
      ketamine 1 mg/kg (Ketalar速) plus subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine
      0.5% (Marcaine速). The Group 4 (Placebo, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 30 mL
      placebo (0.9% saline solution). All medications were diluted with sterile 0.9% saline
      solution to 30 ml solutions in the similar volume and shape syringes and were infiltrated
      subcutaneously along the skin wound edges and close to the fascia prior to skin closure.
      There were four separate syringes which were prepared by an anesthesiology technician for
      four different treatment groups labeled G1, G2, G3 and G4 containing the ketamine,
      bupivacaine, ketamine plus bupivacaine and normal saline solution. Patients, anesthetist,
      surgeon, and other medical and nursing staff were blinded to the contents of the medications.
