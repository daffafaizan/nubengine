      between PROMPT treatment and outcome measures and predict how much improvement can be
      expected from this therapy. This study is being conducted as a part of a multicenter clinical
      trial in the province of Ontario, Canada with three sites: The John McGivney Children's
      Centre in Windsor, The ErinoakKids Centre for Treatment and Development in Mississauga, and
      The Speech and Stuttering Institute in Toronto.

      The study integrity will be monitored by an arms-length, external agency, The Applied Health
      Research Centre (AHRC) at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The study is coordinated by the
      Department of Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto and funded by the PROMPT
      Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
