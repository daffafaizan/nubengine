      factors, but chief among them is the lack of patient involvement in prevention decisions. We
      undertook this study to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored, computerized
      decision aid about CHD on patients' discussions with their doctor and their plans for CHD
      prevention.

      Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized trial in a convenience sample of adults with no
      previous history of cardiovascular disease to test the effectiveness of an
      individually-tailored, computerized decision aid about CHD prevention against a risk factor
      list that patients could present to their doctor.
