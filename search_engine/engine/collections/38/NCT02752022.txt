    
      Established smokers will completely stop smoking for 4 weeks and instead transition to
      nicotine use through an electronic cigarette as required. They will be free to purchase the
      e-cigarette and e-liquid/cartridges of their own choice.

      Eligible subjects will be asked to visit St George's Clinical Research Facility to provide
      the following samples. Blood, saliva and buccal cells to be collected on screening day. 24hr
      urine, blood, saliva and buccal cells will be collected at baseline and on days 3, 7, 21 and
      28 after the first transition to e-cigarette use.

      Moreover, subjects will be breathalysed with carbon monoxide (CO) oximeter and their urine
      analysed for anatabine to assess compliance to the study protocol (complete refrain of use of
      tobacco cigarettes for 4 weeks while they use e-cigarettes).

      Subjects will be monitored for craving, mood, social anxiety, sleep profile and quality of
      life on every visit to St George's Clinical Research Facility (quality of life will be
      assessed only at baseline and day 28 of e-cigarette use). The subjects will be followed up
      with a telephone call 6 and 12 months after the end of the e-cigarette intervention to
      monitor their smoking/e-cigarette use behaviour and participants craving, mood, social
      anxiety, sleep profile and quality of life.
