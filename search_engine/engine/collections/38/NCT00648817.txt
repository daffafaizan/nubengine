    
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study using a two-sequence two-period crossover
      structure. Sixteen HIV-1-negative males will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms.

      Group 1:

        -  Tenofovir DF 300 mg QD (equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil) for the first 14
           days of the study.

        -  Tenofovir DF placebo tablet QD for the last 14 days of the study.

      Group 2:

        -  Tenofovir DF placebo tablet QD for the first 14 days of the study.

        -  Tenofovir DF 300 mg QD (equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil) for the last 14
           days of the study.

      Physical examinations and laboratory analyses are conducted at screening, baseline, Day 14,
      and Day 28. A euglycaemic clamp protocol and an ECG are performed at the baseline, Day 14 and
      Day 28 visits.

      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is insulin-mediated glucose disposal during a
      hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study. Endothelial function will be monitored by Selectin
      P/E and PAI-1 levels; adipocytokine levels will be monitored by measuring adiponectin and
      leptin levels; and lipid subfractions, including cholesterol (large and small subfractions of
      HDL and LDL) triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids will be measured. Safety will be
      evaluated by adverse event and clinical laboratory test reporting.
