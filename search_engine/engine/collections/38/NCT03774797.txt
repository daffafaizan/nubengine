      of immediate postpartum LARC services into widespread clinical practice. In the proposed
      work, this toolkit will be used to initiate immediate postpartum LARC services in a single
      site with low baseline immediate postpartum LARC uptake (Michigan Medicine). The
      investigators will conduct a feasibility study using mixed methods to assess acceptability
      and appropriateness of toolkit items; patient experience of care; immediate postpartum LARC
      utilization rate; and prenatal contraceptive counseling rate.
