      disease, manifested mainly by fever, respiratory problems, muscle pain, and fatigue. However,
      despite the publication of hundreds of papers in the literature, fundamental information
      about the spread and course of the disease is still lacking in COVID-19. One of such key
      pieces of information is the prevalence of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2
      infection, which has a significant effect on the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in the
      Czech Republic and within individual regions and localities.

      The SARS-CoV-2-CZ-Preval study is aiming at quantification of the prevalence of individuals
      with a history of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in the Czech population, except for those
      diagnosed with COVID-19 by methods based on direct detection of SARS-CoV- 2, including
      individuals with a subclinical course of the disease.
