      combination with early intensive behavioral intervention on social interaction, and
      secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and global function in children
      with autism in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also
      examine whether response to treatment can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic
      functioning, such as pupillary light reflex and heart rate variability, and whether anxiety
      predicts treatment response. The investigators' hypothesis is that propranolol will augment
      the effects of behavioral therapy on social functioning and language abilities. The
      investigators have demonstrated benefits of propranolol on social functioning and language in
      previous single-dose studies in adults and adolescents with autism. The investigators also
      predict that those with the greatest degree of autonomic dysregulation will demonstrate the
      greatest benefit from the drug.
