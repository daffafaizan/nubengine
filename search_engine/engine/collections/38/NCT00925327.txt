      cross-linking (CXL) procedure. Corneal collagen cross-linking is performed as a single
      treatment. Depending on the patient's condition, the CXL procedure may be performed under
      sedation or anesthesia. Subjects are followed for 12 months after the procedure to evaluate
      the long term effects of corneal collagen cross-linking.
