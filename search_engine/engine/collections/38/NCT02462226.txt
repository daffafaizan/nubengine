      long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from daily pain and other
      distressing symptoms related to lymphedema, i.e. abnormal accumulation of lymph fluid in the
      ipsilateral upper limb or body.

      The purpose of this research study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of the web-based The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ system for managing chronic pain and
      symptoms related to lymphedema focusing on primary outcomes of pain reduction, secondary
      outcomes of symptom relief, limb volume difference by infra-red perometer, body mass index,
      quality of life related to pain.

      Recruitment includes 120 patients who will be randomized according to pain/aching/soreness,
      and tenderness. Participants in the intervention group will be provided the web-based
      The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow ™ intervention and encourage to access and learn about the program
      during the 1-4 weeks of the study. Participants in the control group will receive the
      web-based arm precaution program. All the participants will have monthly online assessment of
      pain and symptoms at 4 and 8 weeks post-intervention as well as two in-person research
      visits, that is, prior to intervention and 12 weeks post-intervention. The study length for
      patients is 12 weeks.
