    
      After a pilot/implementation study consisting of 10 patients with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (AF); 20 patients with paroxysmal AF will be included in a within-patient trial.
      This study will be followed by a similar comparison in 20 patients with persistent or
      longstanding persistent AF.

      The AF driving sources will be visualized by a novel sequential bi-atrial panoramic contact
      mapping technique. Unipolar signals will be recorded by a 64-polar basket catheter (FIRMap®,
      Topera. Inc.), then processed and the activation patterns visualized (RhythmView® 3D
      Electrophysiologic Mapping System, Topera, Inc.).

      Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) will then be performed with standard irrigated
      radio frequency catheter ablation until rotor or focal impulse elimination is confirmed by
      repeat FIRM mapping.

      Treatment efficacy will be assessed with continuous heart rhythm monitors (Reveal XT®,
      Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) implanted 3 months prior to ablation, and freedom from AF
      defined as AF burden <1% at follow-up at 12, 24 and 30 months.
