      general anesthesia with interscalene block during surgery and intravenous (IV) hydromorphone
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and oral opioid analgesics given after surgery. Side
      effects, such as motor blockade, may impair participation in physical therapy and diminish
      patient satisfaction. In order to prepare for a future study that will examine what mixtures
      of adjuncts/additives will best prevent recovery room pain and minimize motor blockade, the
      investigators are conducting this pilot study to collect preliminary data on current
      practice. The investigators believe the current regimen will provide adequate pain relief,
      but may cause extensive motor blockade and reduce patients' muscle strength after surgery.
