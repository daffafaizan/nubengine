    
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group multicenter Phase 3
      study of the efficacy and safety of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for 24 weeks
      compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. A total of
      approximately 810 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio
      (ie, 270/group). The randomization will be stratified by index joint (hip or knee), and most
      severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade (of any knee or hip joint) at study entry (grade 2, 3 or 4).
      Subjects will receive up to three SC doses of one of the following treatments at an 8-week
      interval between each injection:

        1. tanezumab 2.5 mg;

        2. tanezumab 5 mg;

        3. Placebo to match tanezumab. The study is designed with a total (post-randomization)
           duration of 48 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to 37 days),
           Double-blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks). The Screening Period
           (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting a
           minimum of 2 days for all prohibited pain medications), if required, and an Initial Pain
           Assessment Period (the 7 days prior to Randomization/Baseline).

      Week 24 is the landmark analysis in this study. Subjects who do not complete the Double-blind
      Treatment period will enter and complete the 24-week Early-termination follow-up period.
