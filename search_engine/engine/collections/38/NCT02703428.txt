    
      The LUCY Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      post-market study to evaluate the Ovation Abdominal Platform when used in the endovascular
      treatment of female patients.

      The primary endpoint is freedom from access-related vascular complications and freedom from
      AAA-related mortality through 30 days.

      Secondary endpoints of the study will be achieved by demonstrating the benefits in female
      patients despite the fact that historically fewer female patients have been eligible for
      EVAR, and they have experienced a higher rate of access-related complications and higher
      mortality rates. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated through 1 year (365 Â± 60 days)
      post-procedure.
