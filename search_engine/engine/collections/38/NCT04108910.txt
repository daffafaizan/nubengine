      for detection and identification of pathogens in UTI, and antimicrobial susceptibility
      information, affords more efficacious treatment of UTI, thereby reducing UTI-related
      morbidity and costs in a patient population that is served by House Call Physicians. House
      call physicians attend elderly and other adults patients who are suffering from illness or
      chronic conditions in the safety, privacy, and comfort of their home or assisted living
      location. In making house calls, physicians ease the burden and difficulty of these chronic
      patients from traveling to the doctor's office.
