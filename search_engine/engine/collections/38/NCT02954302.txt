      occurring in 20% to 70% of the patients. DGE is usually not a life-threatening complication,
      but it contributes significantly to increased length of hospital stay, health care costs, and
      patient discomfort. In a recent study by Sakamoto et al, proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal
      anastomosis is associated with a reduced incidence of DGE after pylorus-resecting
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PrPD); however, these results may have been biased because of the
      retrospective nature. Therefore, the investigators conducted the present randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal
      anastomosis on reducing DGE following PrPD.
