      defined as first clinical fracture) is reached and all participants have had the opportunity
      to receive a minimum of at least 2 doses of study drug, whichever occurs later. The primary
      analysis data cut-off date (PADCD) is defined as the time at which the required number of
      events is reached and all participants have had the opportunity to receive at least 2 doses
      of study drug. When the PADCD is reached, all participants will discontinue study drug.

      Following the study PADCD, participants will be followed every 12 months starting from their
      last study visit until a maximum of 66 months after PADCD.

      After approval of Amendment 4, willing and eligible participants randomized to placebo during
      the double-blind phase may participate in an open-label phase (OLP) and receive denosumab 60
      mg Q6M for up to 36 months (maximum of 7 doses).

      After approval of Amendment 6 in 2019 a zoledronic acid (ZA) substudy was added to the
      protocol. Willing and eligible participants who participated in the OLP of the study and
      completed open-label denosumab may opt in to this ZA substudy and either receive a single
      dose of ZA (Therapy Arm), or be managed according to the current standard of care for this
      patient population (Control Arm).
