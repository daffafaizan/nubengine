      hospitalization and after discharge. Research in pediatric patients with cancer as well as
      geriatric patients suggests that psychosocial burden might be decreased by humor therapy.
      Studies addressing the impact of humor therapy in adult patients with cancer are lacking.

      This randomized controlled trial primarily aims at assessing the effect of therapeutic humor
      on global distress in patients during their hospital stay for allo-HSCT. In addition, the
      study investigates hope, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and pain as secondary outcomes. The
      outcomes are measured via questionnaires.

      Study results may be beneficial for patients who experience distress during hospitalization
      for allo-HSCT.
