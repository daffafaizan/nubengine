      no standard of care for treatment of these patients. Therefore, we want to combine two
      chemotherapy drugs to see if they are safe and will help treat these patients. The first
      agent, L-asparaginase, is used in most patients during their initial treatment for ALL. The
      second agent, sirolimus, causes death in human leukemia cells in the laboratory. Sirolimus is
      also used in children who have received kidney or heart transplants to prevent organ
      rejection. Therefore, the safety and side effects are well known in children.

      There are many steps that allow cancer cells to grow in humans. L-asparaginase and sirolimus
      block two different steps in cell growth. Because of this, we anticipate that these two drugs
      will work together to lead to more cancer cell death.

      The first part of the study will last 1 month for each patient. If the patients have a good
      response to these two drugs, they will be allowed to continue these drugs for up to 12
      months. They will continue on the dose of sirolimus that they received during the first month
      for the remaining time on the study.

      We will also look at the way leukemia cells are responding to these medications in the
      laboratory. We will not draw any blood or bone marrow samples from the patient unless they
      already need the procedure done for other tests. The amount of extra blood or bone marrow
      drawn will not cause the patients any harm. As we do not know what these laboratory tests
      mean, we will not tell the patients the results during the study.
