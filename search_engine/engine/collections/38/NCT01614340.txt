      patients admitted with activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM
      techniques. The project also will examine differences in the effectiveness of the
      intervention among different race/ethnicity groups and individuals with different pain types,
      as well as the fidelity of intervention-group PTs to the CBPSM program.

      The specific aims of this CER study that will include sizeable numbers of Hispanics,
      non-Hispanic African Americans and non-Hispanic white patients ages 55 and older are: (1) to
      compare the effectiveness of usual care provided to older home health patients admitted with
      activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM techniques; and (2) to
      examine the heterogeneity of CBPSM treatment effects among patients with different pain
      conditions and minority group status.
