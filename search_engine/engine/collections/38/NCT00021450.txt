        -  Compare the potential beneficial impact of radiotherapy with or without adjuvant
           bicalutamide and goserelin on the long-term outcome of patients with localized prostate
           cancer.

        -  Compare the acute and late radiation-induced side effects of these regimens in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the biochemical/clinical disease-free survival, overall survival, and time to
           local progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to clinical biological failure or death in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      class (T1b-c vs T2a), initial prostate-specific antigen level (10 ng/mL vs 10-20 ng/mL vs
      greater than 20 ng/mL), Gleason score (2-6 vs 7-10) and participating center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7-7.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant oral bicalutamide once daily on days 1-30 and
           goserelin subcutaneously on days 8 and 98. Beginning on day 8, patients undergo
           radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at months 6, 12, 24, and 36.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (400 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
