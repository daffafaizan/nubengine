      Within the environmental factors, the exact role of psychological stress and life events on
      the onset of the disease is still under question. In clinical practice, patients usually
      report the occurrence of a stressing life event before the diagnosis of the disease
      (mourning, dismissal, divorceâ€¦). Nevertheless, literature reviews present some discrepancies
      and did not lead to a clear identification of the role of psychological stress in RA onset.
      This is mainly due to the evaluation methods of stress within those previous studies,
      considering stress as a unique response of the organism without taking into account personal,
      sociological, biological or environmental history. The aim of the study is to analyze the
      impact of stress on the RA onset within an integrative model, to evaluate patient assessment
      of the stress, and to present strategies to fix it.
