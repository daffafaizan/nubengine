      aim of the present observational study was designed to further to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of lung ultrasound (LUS) in detection of postoperative atelectasis in adult
      patients undergoing general anesthesia. Results of LUS as the experimental method will be
      compared to the results of computed tomography (CT) as the reference technique for the
      detection of atelectasis. The investigators want to confirm former findings of the appearance
      of perioperative atelectases and to prove that ultrasound is a valid tool for detection of
      atelectases.
