      degrees) Trendelenburg's (head lower than feet) position. This helps the bowels to move
      towards the patient's head, making surgery in the pelvis safer. During surgery, if patients
      slide a great deal toward the head of the bed, nerve injury and hernia risk may be increased.
      Several techniques are in use to prevent patients from sliding on the bed during surgery, and
      of these, increasing the friction between a patient's skin and the bed surface appears to be
      the safest technique. Two materials are in use to increase this friction: a gel pad or an
      egg-crate foam mattress upon which the patient lies with bare skin. This study is comparing
      these two materials to see which material is associated with the LEAST amount of patient
      slide. Our hypothesis is that the two materials will be equally good at preventing slide on
      the table and that slide will be less than 5 cm (<2 inches) on average.
