      pacifier exposure on breastfeeding we plan to conduct a multicenter, randomized, single
      blind, active control, parallel assignment, efficacy study to assess the impact of offering a
      pacifier on breastfeeding during the first days of life our hypothesis is that the
      introduction of a pacifier during the first days of life does not interfere with lactation

      A research assistant will approach all eligible mothers during the first 6 hours after birth
      and will invite them to be randomized to one of the two groups:

      Unrestricted pacifier ( the pacifiers can be offered liberally to infants to suck on during
      their stay at the facility providing maternity and newborn services) and Restricted pacifier
      group: ( avoid pacifier use until breastfeeding is well established) Women will be followed
      up at 1, 3, 4, ,6, 8, and 12 months after birth or until breastfeeding ended by a research
      assistant blinded to the group assignment. Interviews will be conducted by telephone using
      structured questionnaires designed to assess breastfeeding (exclusive or partial) prevalence
      and duration, and whether or not the baby had rejected a pacifier the night before the
      telephone interview. Rates of exclusive, partial, and any other occasional random
      breastfeeding will be tracked at all these time points.
