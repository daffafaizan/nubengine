      of leukocytes towards specific chemoattractants. Comparisons of cells from different subjects
      will be compared. In addition, the effects of various pharmaceutical interventions on this
      mechanism will also be addressed and compared within subject groups. In some experiments,
      cells will be differentiated in vitro and their cellular expression and regulation of
      inflammatory mediators and chemoattractants examined. Again comparisons will be made between
      subject groups and the efficacy of various pharmacological agents on these cells
