      acceptable toxicity is technically demanding even with modern radiotherapy techniques.
      Raster-scanned carbon ion therapy with highly conformal dose distributions may allow higher
      doses at comparable or reduced side-effects.

      Methods/ design:

      The IMRT-HIT-SNT trial is a prospective, mono-centric, phase II trial evaluating toxicity in
      the combined treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and carbon ion (C12)
      boost in 36 patients with histologically proven (≥R1-resected or inoperable) adeno-/ or
      squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity or paransal sinuses. Patients receive 24 GyE
      carbon ions (8 fractions) and IMRT (2.0 Gy/ fraction).

      Study objectives:

      Incidence of mucositis ≥ CTC°3 will be assessed as the primary endpoint of the trial, local
      control, disease-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity (incl. mucositis CTC °I-II and
      late toxicity at 2 years post RT)are secondary endpoints.
