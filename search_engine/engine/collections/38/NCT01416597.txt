    
      The research question of this project is: "what is the cross-protection afforded by
      vaccination (using an LAIV, TIV, or other type of vaccine) against influenza A or B and their
      subtypes and lineages?" The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement will be used to guide the reporting of this review. Studies
      reporting cross-protection data after vaccination with approved formulations of influenza
      vaccines with influenza A or B will be included. Inclusion will not be limited by publication
      status, or year of dissemination but will be limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and
      quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccine(s) with placebo. Only RCTs written in English will be
      included. A meta-analysis will be conducted if there is sufficient data.
