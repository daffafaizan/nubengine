      Older obese adults suffer disproportionately from walking mobility limitations. Sedentary,
      obese older adults are at an increased risk for having or developing difficulties with
      mobility. These individuals are often excluded from studies due to their advanced mobility
      limitations. A number of studies have compared the effects of weight loss alone, exercise
      alone, or weight loss in combination with exercise on functional performance in older adults,
      but none of the studies have specifically targeted subjects who use walking assistive
      devices. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a 12 month multi-modal exercise
      rehabilitation intervention with a nutrition program versus a nutrition program only on
      fitness, functional performance, mobility, and muscle mass. The results of this study will
      lead to new and more effective interventions that could reduce disability, fall risk,
      injury-related hospitalization and death in older Veterans.
