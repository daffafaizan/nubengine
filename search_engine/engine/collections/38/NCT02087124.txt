      a fat-rich meal. The test meals contain three different amounts of whey protein. Blood
      samples are collected before consumption of the pre-meal and after consumption of the
      fat-rich isocaloric meal during 360 minutes. The fat-rich isocaloric meal is a breakfast
      containing 1043 kcal (15 E% protein, 65 E% fat and 20 E% carbohydrates). The main-meal is
      composed of white bread, rye bread, butter, cheese (45 %), salami, egg, bacon, milk (1.5 %
      fat) and coffee (decaffeinated) and should be consumed over 15 min. Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      will be used for determination of subjective satiety feeling.
