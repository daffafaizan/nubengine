      with standard care IVIg in patients with GBS.

      The study will recruit approximately 30 patients who are eligible for IVIg treatment based on
      current practice (i.e. GBS disability score >3 and within 10 days of onset of weakness). All
      patients will receive imlifidase (Day 1) prior to standard care IVIg.

      Data from each patient enrolled in this study will be compared with a control group
      consisting of up to 4 subjects from the International Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome Outcome Study
      (IGOS) database (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01582763) fulfilling a subset of the
      eligibility criteria in the current imlifidase GBS study protocol. Matching will be done on
      geographical locations, age, presence of diarrhoea, and severity of condition.

      There is growing body of evidence suggesting that GBS is an antibody-mediated disorder. In
      addition to supportive care, IVIg and Plasma Exchange (PE) are the two main immunological
      treatment options aimed at attenuating the autoreactive humoral immune response. Imlifidase
      is an IgG degrading enzyme with strict specificity. The hypothesis is that reduction of
      pathological antibodies may result in aborted progression, quicker recovery and less severe
      disease.
