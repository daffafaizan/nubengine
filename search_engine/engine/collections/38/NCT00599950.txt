      de C.V. Mexico D.F. Reg. 136M92 SSA), and 10 eyes for the same patients underwent PRK without
      intraoperative mitomycin C. A central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken with the
      confocal microscope (Confoscan 4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) after surgery, and 1 week, 1
      month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Corneal epithelial thickness and the Anterior
