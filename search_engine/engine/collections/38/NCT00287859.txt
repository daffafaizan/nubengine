      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly topotecan in patients with progressive or
           recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer and a
           poor performance status.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the response rate of women with poor performance status for use in future
           clinical trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive topotecan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29.
      Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 6 patients will be treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
