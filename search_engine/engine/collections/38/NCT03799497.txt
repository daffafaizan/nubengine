      level) are recruited in medical care facilities in Lille's Metropolis. They are asked to
      identify their body shape when being presented with 3 different stimuli, i.e.real (RBS),
      estimated (EBS) and neutral body shape (NBS), in a functional magnetic resonance imaging or
      functional MRI (fMRI) machine. While answering to this identification paradigm, we hoped to
      identify modifications in the self body-recognition network.
