      equating to 60 eyes. All eyes will receive bilateral iLUX MGD Treatment System. The most
      symptomatic eye will be selected to receive DEXTENZA® insertion on the day of the procedure
      (study eye). In group 1, the other eye will be assigned to receive prednisolone acetate 1% on
      a 4,3,2,1 month taper schedule (active comparator). In group 2, the other eye will receive
      punctal "sham" dilation (control eye). If there is no obvious symptomatic difference, the
      right eye will receive the intracanalicular insert. The study group will consist of 30 eyes
      receiving DEXTENZA® insertion. The control group will consist of 15 eyes receiving
      prednisolone acetate 1% and 15 eyes receiving sham punctum dilation. Thus, for every eye in
      the study group, there will be a paired eye with similar baseline characteristics in the
      control group sourced from the same participant. This fellow-eye design allows for greater
      control of potential confounders tied to participants' systemic and ocular health.
