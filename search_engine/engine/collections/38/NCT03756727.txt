      follows: 1 Ascorbic acid as a first-line antioxidant in plasma can reduce stress by
      eliminating excess Reactive oxygen species and reduce damage. 2 provides rapid electron
      transfer to react with superoxide and hydroxyl group to scavenge reactive oxygen released
      into the circulation. 3 Ascorbic acid can reduce lipid peroxidation and reduce lung injury
      caused by ischemia-reperfusion by scavenging oxygen free radicals. 4 Vitamin C can promote
      the production of cytokines by immune cells to reduce local inflammatory reactions and
      improve tissue microcirculation.The study aims to explore whether daily used Ascorbic acid in
      the perioperative period has a preventive effect on PPCs in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, and through short-term and long-term follow-up, to investigate the effect on
      post-hospitalization Prognosis .
