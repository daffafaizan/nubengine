      to patients with advanced gastric cancer is unknown, and let alone which drug is most
      suitable. Our study is designed to prove whether the maintenance treatment of Apatinib or
      Capecitabine are better than observation after fluorouracil/platinum based first-line
      chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer
