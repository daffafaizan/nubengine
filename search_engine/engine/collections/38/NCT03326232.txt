      pregnant women with GDM. First, most studies only use CGM for 48 - 72hours at a time, while
      the investigators will be using CGM for 7 day intervals. Both groups will use the same Enlite
      sensor (Medtronic). The blinded CGM group will be using the Medtronic iPro2 system (Enlite
      sensor + transmitter). The real-time CGM group will be using the 530g system (iPro2 (Enlite
      sensor + transmitter) + inactivated 530g pump set only to display glucose values, no insulin
      will be administered). This CGM system has been FDA approved to for up to 7 days between
      sensor changes.26,27 Second, no previous study has used real time CGM in pregnant patients
      with GDM in the US. The investigators will be the first to describe the use of this
      technology in this patient population. Third, most of these trials have been performed on
      populations that are not representative of the investigators' patient population at EVMS.
      This will be the largest US study of CGM in GDM. Fourth wearable medical and fitness
      technology is already popular, but as both the technology and the demand continues to grow,
      it will become the future of diabetes management. Studies have already shown that real time
      CGM is an effective educational and motivational tool in type-1 and type-2 DM.28,29
