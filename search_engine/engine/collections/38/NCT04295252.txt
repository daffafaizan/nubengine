    
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) is the most severe form of acute heart failure. Data on epidemiology
      of CS have been drawn from previously published registries focussing on acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction (AMI). Indeed, CS occurs in 5-7% of patients
      presenting with ACS and ACS has been reported as the most prevalent cause of CS, accounting
      for about 80% of cases.

      However, recent evidences in a contemporary cohort in North America have shown that more than
      two-thirds of all cardiogenic shock cases were related to causes other than AMI and that
      these patients had outcomes at least as poor as patients with AMI-CS.

      Given the high short-term mortality of these patients and the need for developing dedicated
      cardiac shock centres and systems of care to time our interventions, it is of utmost
      importance to achieve a better clinical phenotyping of the heterogeneous causes and
      presentations of CS patients and carefully perform research outcome.

      Accordingly, the Altshock-2 registry will represent a unique opportunity to evaluate the full
      spectrum of CS admitted in Intensive Coronary Care Units and to collect a selected number of
      variables related to aetiology, clinical presentation, ongoing pharmacological treatments,
      use of mechanical support devices and outcome.
