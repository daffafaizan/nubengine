      (COPD). It is characterized by muscle fiber-type redistribution and oxidative stress.
      Classical training does not improve these features.

      Objectives: To investigate whether electrostimulation program following exacerbation can
      modify muscle structure and function in COPD patients.

      Method: We propose to conduct a controlled and randomized clinical trial comparing the
      efficacy of muscle electrostimulation training of the lower limbs to sham training in 15
      patients with COPD. Patients are included in either 6 weeks of electrostimulation training
      (active treatment group) or 6 weeks of sham electrostimulation. Primary outcomes were changes
      in muscle structure, muscle oxidative stress and their relationship with quadriceps force and
      exercise tolerance.
