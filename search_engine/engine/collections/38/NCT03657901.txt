      problems, poor sleep and insomnia symptoms. For instance, increased amount of REM, and
      decreased amount of slow wave sleep may result. Also, the function of sleep in memory
      consolidation may suffer. They also affect the sleep structure and continuity during the
      night. They are highly prevalent phenomena among the entire population, including healthy
      adults and children. However, at the physiological level, the concept of evening alertness is
      still understudied and often neglected.

      Recent advances show that breathing exercise is an efficient tool to reduce stress. However,
      its use specifically prior to sleep onset and with measurement sleep stages and their
      microstructures with sleep EEG has been little been studied before. The overall objective of
      this study is to explore interrelations of stress, learning and sleep quality.
