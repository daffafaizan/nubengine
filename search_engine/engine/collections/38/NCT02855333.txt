    
      Between 2004 and 2013, 14 pts had transhiatal resection of median 8 (6-10) cm of distal
      esophagus including the gastroesophageal junction. Locoregional lymphadenectomy was performed
      in all patients with (suspected) early adenocarcinoma. In case of vagus nerve resection,
      pyloromyectomy and cholecystectomy were done. A pediculated isoperistaltic jejunal segment of
      15-18 cm length was interponed between esophageal stump and remaining stomach by end-to-side
      anastomoses. At least one postoperative contrast examination of the anastomoses was done in
      all pts. Quality of life was assessed by using the EORTC QLQ-OES18 survey, recording
      patients' general activity and condition and specific gastrointestinal symptoms.
