      light therapy utilizing blood samples, buccal swaps and right atrial myocardium. In addition,
      we will examine the correlation of PER2 levels and PER2 related metabolism and perform a
      whole genome microarray screen from the collected tissue/blood samples.

      Patients will be enrolled 10 to 1 days prior to surgery and will either receive an intense
      (bright light) box or a placebo/control device (dim/night light box). The patient will start
      using the light box 7 days prior to surgery every morning from 8.30 to 9.00 AM. The patient
      will need to keep the box as close as possible to their eyes and not walk away during the
      treatment period.

      Blood /buccal swabs will be collected on the day of enrollment (10-1 days prior to surgery)
      between 7 and 10 AM without any light therapy and on the day of surgery between 7 and 10 AM
      before anesthesia induction after one week of light/placebo therapy.

      A small piece of the right atrial myocardium (which stems from cardiac cannulation and is
      otherwise discarded) will be put in liquid nitrogen in the OR and stored for further
      analysis.

      In addition, we will draw a blood sample 72 hrs. after surgery and determine Troponin I
      levels.

      Investigating this patient population will give the necessary evidence if light could also be
      effective in a perioperative setting to prevent or decrease damage to the myocardium during
      high risk cardiac surgery. In addition, it will help us understand if light could be used in
      general to prevent or treat heart ischemia.
