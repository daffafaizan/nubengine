      intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is effective in alleviating cardiogenic shock. In
      others, the use of intra-aortic balloon pump has no effect at all. The investigators believe
      this is dependent on the presence of persisting ischemia after successful epicardial
      reperfusion, known as no-reflow.

      In the presence of persisting ischemia, the investigators believe us of the intra-aortic
      balloon pump will relieve ischemia and improve outcome.
