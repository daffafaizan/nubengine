      pregnant women with primary CMV transmit the virus to their fetus. Many of these women are
      referred to amniocentesis and many elect to terminate pregnancy without knowledge about fetal
      infection or damage. Currently it is assumed that transmission is dictated by variety of
      factors including maternal and fetal immune system. Efforts to find correlation between
      maternal immune system and fetal infection which can be used as a diagnostic marker were
      unsuccessful.

      Our hypothesis is that there is a correlation between cellular immune response of the mother
      to CMV infection and viral transmission to the fetus.

      Pregnant women with primary CMV infection (40% of whom are expected to be transmitters)and
      with pre-conception immunity will participate in this study.

      Blood from these women will be incubated with CMV peptides and T cell activation will be
      measured by the secretion of various cytokines.
