      well-preserved liver function. Although overall survival after resection has been increasing,
      the median 5-year disease-free survival rate after resection remains at only about 37% for
      early-stage HCC. In fact, the 5-year recurrence rate is as high as 74% for intermediate and
      advanced HCC. Postoperative recurrence may be due to intrahepatic metastasis arising from the
      primary tumor or it may be de novo metastasis (multicentric) that arises spontaneously in the
      residual liver. Intrahepatic metastasis is the primary mechanism of early recurrence, which
      occurs <2 years after resection; multicentric metastasis is the principal mechanism behind
      late recurrence, which occurs at least 2 years after resection.

      In the past few years, some observational studies with small sample size found metformin and
      celebrex (selective cyclic oxidase-2 inhibitors) may reduce the rate of HCC after surgery.
      However, no prospective study compare their efficacy in preventing HCC recurrence. This trial
      aims to compare the role of celebrex alone, metformin alone, and celebrex plus metformin in
      preventing HCC recurrence after hepatic resection.
