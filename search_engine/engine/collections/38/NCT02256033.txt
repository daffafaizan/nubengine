    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel group, single-dose study to determine the
      single-dose PK of istradefylline in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (HI) (Child-Pugh
      Class A) and in subjects with normal hepatic function. Ten subjects with mild HI (Child-Pugh
      Class A) and 10 subjects with normal hepatic function (matched for age, gender, race, and
      BMI) will be enrolled. Enrollment of the subjects with normal hepatic function will be
      subsequent to the HI subjects.
