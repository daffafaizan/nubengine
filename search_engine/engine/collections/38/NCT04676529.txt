    
      The study consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and a cohort expansion phase. The
      dose escalation phase will follow a 3+3 design with a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily,
      and a treatment duration of 4 weeks. Patients will be able to participate in more than one
      dose level.

      During the cohort expansion phase, 24 patients will be treated at the dose determined
      appropriate based on safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the dose
      escalation phase, for a period of up to 6 months. Patients from the dose escalation phase
      will be able to participate in the cohort expansion phase.

      There will be no washout period between dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.
