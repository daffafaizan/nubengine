      with an intra-corporeal anastomosis result in quicker return of bowel function and earlier
      discharge. The primary endpoint of this study will be return of bowel function as measured by
      passage of flatus and bowel motions. The secondary endpoints will be inpatient length of
      stay, incision length, postoperative narcotic use, surgical site infection (superficial, deep
      and organ-space), perioperative morbidity and operating room charges.
