      2 treatment sequences: prasugrel 10 mg daily for 10 days followed by clopidogrel 75 mg daily
      for 10 days or clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 10 days followed by prasugrel 10 mg daily for 10
      days. There will be a 14-day Washout Period between Active Treatment Period 1 (when subjects
      receive the first drug of the sequence) and the second Active Treatment Period 2 (Period 3)
      (when subjects receive the second drug of the sequence). All subjects will remain on the same
      dose of aspirin from baseline throughout the study.
