      on improving endothelial function, and thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
      Spirulina maxima (Arthrospira maxima) is a species of cyanobacterium, used as food additive
      because of its high levels of protein and essential nutrients, such as carotenoids, vitamins,
      and minerals. Various studies point to a possible beneficial effect of spirulina on the
      concentration of blood serum lipids and fasting glucose,body weight or blood pressure,
      however, the results of studies pertained to the effects of spirulina in individuals who, at
      the time of trial, were not taking medications. The aim of the study was to estimate an
      effect of Spirulina maxima supplementation on cardiovascular risk in obese Caucasians with
      treated hypertension. The anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity,
      plasma lipid levels, and stress oxidative biomarkers were measured at the baseline and after
      3 months of supplementation with spirulina or placebo in the group of obese, hypertensive
      patients receiving standard antihypertensive treatment.
