      will gave a recording of their walking parameters through an instrumented treadmill recording
      biomechanic parameters (surface electromyography, walking pace; force of the foot/treadmill
      interface, length of the step.. etc.) Analysis will be performed until walking is stopped due
      to usual claudication during a constant load 2 miles per hour 10% slope treadmill procedure.
