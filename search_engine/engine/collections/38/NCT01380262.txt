      develop the skin toxicity which can impair patients' quality of life as well as limit the
      treatment. We designed this trial to assess the effect of simplified protocol of pre-emptive
      treatment on the observed skin toxicities during cetuximab and panitumumab treatment of
      colorectal cancer.

      The study is a cohort observational, single center study which should result in estimation of
      particular types of toxicities, especially occurence of more severe (grade 2 and 3) side
      effects and assess the tolerance of doxycyline in the prolonged administration.

      The observation in the study is biweekly and is continued up to 8 weeks.
