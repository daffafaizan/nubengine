      framework that contain cerebral infarction, intra cranial haemorrhage & subarachnoid
      haemorrhage. Around the globe stroke is the chief cause of incapacity and passing.

      The trans-cranial direct current stimulations (tDCS) could be a non-invasive,low cost and
      capable brain stimulator utilised within the treatment of brain disorders.Two modes of tDCS
      is utilised is stroke patients,anodal stimulation (increased in excitability) of the lesional
      half of the globe and cathodal stimulation (decreased in excitability) of the contralesional
      hemisphere. The transcranial direct current stimulation induced polarity-dependent changes in
      membrane excitability, with Anodal-tDCS causing depolarisation and cathodal-tDCS causing
      hyper polarization of membrane potential in neurons of the stimulated area.

      The role of Trans-cranial Direct Current Stimulation as a catalyst of recovery in stroke
      population and found that it's a safe,portable,non invasive brain stimulation technique.
      T-DCS is able to modulate the excitability of specified brain areas by varying the neuronal
      membrane potentials that based on the polarity of the current transmitted through the scalp
      via sponge electrodes. Trans-cranial direct current stimulation is clinically potential for
      use in stroke recovery because of its ease of use, non invasive-ness and safety.
