      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS.Overgrowth
      of microbiota in the small intestine can cause excessive gas production and malabsorption
      with a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as diarrhea, gas bloating, abdominal pain and
      constipation.Glucose (GBT) and lactulose (LBT) breath test have been proposed as simple,
      inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tools for detecting SIBO with respect to the gold
      standard (the culture of intestinal aspirates). Many antibiotics have been proposed in the
      last years for SIBO eradication.Rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative with antibacterial
      activity caused by inhibition of bacterial synthesis of RNA and which is effective against
      both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including aerobes and anaerobes.As <0.1% of its
      oral dose is absorbed, rifaximin administration is associated to a very low side-effect
      incidence. However,there are still no effective and reliable treatment for IBS,so we intend
      to explore the prevalence of SIBO in IBS-D patients and evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin
      for IBS-D in Chinese population.
