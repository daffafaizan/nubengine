      lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models. The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this
      study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and
      availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to
      conversion to sirolimus. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus
      that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed
      ALL, LL or PTL. A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used. Response to
      treatment will be evaluated. Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease
      (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.
