    
      The purpose of this protocol is to continue the assessment of setmelanotide treatment in
      patients who have successfully completed all critical study evaluations in a prior trial
      (index protocol) of setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity associated with genetic
      defects in the leptin-melanocortin pathway upstream of the MC4 receptor. The primary
      objectives of this extension trial are to explore the long-term safety and tolerability of
      setmelanotide for up to 5 years or until drug is otherwise available through authorized use.
      Patients can enter this protocol immediately upon completion of their index protocol such
      that dosing of setmelanotide continues without gaps in therapy.
