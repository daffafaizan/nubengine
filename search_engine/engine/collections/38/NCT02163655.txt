    
      A placebo-controlled study that will be conducted including 120 postpartum women with severe
      preeclampsia . Women who are previosuly diuretic users, with renal impairment, hemodynamic
      instability or with contraindications to diuretic use will be excluded. Informed consent will
      be obtained from all participants . Patients will be randomized to receive furosemide ( 40mg
      orally every twenty-four hours ) or placebo for maximum of five days. The variables are
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, frequency of very high blood pressure, need for
      maintenance of antihypertensive therapy , number of antihypertensive agents used to control
      blood pressure , urine output , length of hospital stay , adverse effects and maternal
      complications . Except for the study drug, patients will receive all care and monitoring
      according to the hospital protocol and decision to initiate or modify antihypertensive
      therapy will be defined by the attending physician, as well as the decision to discharge. If
      the patient is discharged before five days of the protocol drug, this drug will be stopped.
      Teh patients may decide to leave the study at any moment. Data will be collected by
      researches daily. Plan statistical analysis will be performed using the public domain program
      Epi Info 7.0 and the mean and dispersion measures for numerical variables will be calculated.
      To compare means obtained every day and between groups will be used analysis of variance (
      ANOVA ) . Nominal variables were compared using the X2 test or Fisher if necessary. Be
      considered significant at p < 0,05. The risk ratio (RR) is calculated as a measure of the
      relative risk for the different outcomes , according to furosemide or placebo
