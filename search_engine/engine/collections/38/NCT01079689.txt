      somatosensory stimulation with acupuncture needles have an essential impact on the change of
      brain activity in healthy volunteers. For this, the investigators compare three different
      point locations (one acupuncture point and two non-acupuncture points) stimulated with
      acupuncture needles. Two measurements each with 20 subjects are planned.

        -  With the EEG measurements the impact of the stimulation's location on background rhythm
           especially in the somatosensoric cortex is evaluated.

        -  With the fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) measurements the impact of the
           stimulation's location on BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependency) signals and on functional
           connectivity is evaluated.
