    
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infections induce cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of
      cervix. To reduce incidence of invasive tumor associated with high grade CIN lesions, the
      standard treatment is the conisation of cervix (surgical act). A local treatment with
      antiviral would preserve the cervix of young subjects and reduce obstetrical morbidity
      induced by the conisation.

      This clinical study is aimed at:

        -  to evaluate the efficacy of a gel with antiviral directly applied on the cervix
           exhibiting high grade CIN lesions (CIN2/3): conisation is still indicated?

        -  to evaluate the safety and tolerance after local application.
