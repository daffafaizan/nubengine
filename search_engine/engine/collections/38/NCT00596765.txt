      motivational problems. About 50% of patients involved develop psychiatric illness, most
      likely in the first year following ABI, which is associated with reduced psychosocial
      functioning and less favorable rehabilitation outcome. Treatment of these complex conditions
      requires a combination of neuropsychological and psychotherapeutic intervention techniques.

      This study aims at evaluating a combination of neuropsychological intervention methods, which
      include developing and using compensation strategies for cognitive impairments (attention,
      memory and executive functions), and psychotherapeutic intervention focusing on emotion
      regulation, developing positive self-concepts and adjustment of life-goals. These therapeutic
      interventions are modularized and patients are assigned to intervention modules according to
      results of objective neuropsychological testing and interviews.
