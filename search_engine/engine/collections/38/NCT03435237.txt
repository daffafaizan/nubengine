      affected patient is continuously increasing. Approximately 10% of asthmatics have poorly
      controlled, severe symptoms.

      The exact mechanisms behind the development of asthma are unknown. However, the excessive
      contraction of airway smooth muscle leading to airway constriction is thought to be
      responsible for the majority of the symptoms of asthma. A new treatment option, termed
      bronchial thermoplasty, can offer relief for individuals with severe asthma. Bronchial
      thermoplasty works by reducing smooth muscle with thermal energy.

      This new imaging technology, called optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the first imaging
      modality that is capable to visualize airway smooth muscle in humans. In this study the
      investigators will examine the asthmatic airways before and after bronchial thermoplasty to
      learn about how airways respond to this treatment. The long term goal of this study is to use
      OCT to look at the airways with the hope of helping clinicians monitor and predict the
      response to bronchial thermoplasty.

      During the scheduled bronchial thermoplasty procedure, OCT imaging will be performed. The
      study imaging will add less than 10 minutes to the time required for the standard
      procedure.Twelve months following the completion of bronchial thermoplasty, the investigators
      will ask the participants to return to the hospital to undergo follow-up tests including a CT
      scan and a bronchoscopy procedure with repeat OCT imaging. The investigators expect these
      test to be accomplished in 2 additional visits.
