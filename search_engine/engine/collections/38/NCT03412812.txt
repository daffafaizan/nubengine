      Treatment involve five fraction stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors
      2.1-4.0 cm in diameter or 4.1-6.0 cm in diameter and dose escalation treatment is delivered
      only to the single largest tumor while all other tumors are treated with standard of care
      practices if they are present. A dose escalation schedule is proposed based on the monitoring
      of CNS toxicity and tumor size of the largest tumor, given it falls into the parameters set
      on diameter.
