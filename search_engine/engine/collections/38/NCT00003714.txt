      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with pyrazoloacridine (PZA). II. Determine the
      nature, degree, and duration of toxic effects of PZA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks. The minimum
      treatment period is 2 courses with tumor restaging at 6 weeks. Patients with complete
      remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) may continue on treatment until refractory (PR) or
      for at least 3 additional courses (CR). Patients with stable disease continue on therapy for
      at least 2 more courses. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
