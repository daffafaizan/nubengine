    
      Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold-standard diagnose tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
      However, the availability of PSG is limited, particularly in developing and / or least
      developed countries. Sub-mental ultrasonography is stepped forward with its practical and
      cheap nature and its widespread use.

      The investigators aimed to perform sub-mental ultrasonography to the patients who underwent
      to PSG by a blind-to-the-PSG-results radiologist and analyse the correlation between
      ultrasound measures, Apnea-Hypopnea Index (measured by Polysomnography) and subjective OSA
      scales.
