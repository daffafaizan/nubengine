      year. Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is considered nearly incurable with less than 10% of
      subjects alive 5 years after diagnosis. Therefore, new treatment regimens are needed for
      subjects with AGC.

      S-1, a new oral fluoropyrimidine which consists of the 5-FU prodrug tegafur (ftorafur, FT)
      and two enzyme inhibitors, CDHP (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine) and OXO (potassium oxonate),
      in a molar ratio of 1(FT):0.4 (CDHP):1(OXO) is commercially available since late 90'in Japan.
      Phase II trials have demonstrated that S-1 is active, as a single agent, for the treatment of
      gastric (RR 44.6%), colorectal (RR 37.4%), head and neck, breast, non-small cell lung, and
      pancreatic cancers. In gastric cancer, phase III trials (JCOG 9912) comparing 5-FU alone and
      CPT-11/CDDP combination are currently underway and these results are awaited. Despite of JCOG
      9912 study is ongoing, 80% of patients of AGC are already treated by S-1, because of high RR
      and convenience use for out-patient basis. P-II studies S-1/CDDP, S-1/CPT-11 and
      S-1/Docetaxel showed high RR(55-76%) and long MST(12-14M). Furthermore, P-III studies are
      already conducted S-1 vs. S-1/CDDP and S-1 vs. S-1/CPT-11 in Japan. The aim of this study is
      to compare S-1/Docetaxel vs. S-1 alone in the patients of AGC. This study is a prospective,
      multicenter, multinational, non-blinded, randomized phase III study.

      Patients: Inoperable or relapse gastric cancer. Informed consent must be obtained in writing
      before treatment. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria will
      be considered for enrollment into study. Then patients will be randomly assigned into two
      groups S-1/Docetaxel(Treatment Arm A) or S-1 alone(Treatment Arm B).
