    
      For patients with potentially resectable HCC (intermediate or advanced stage), upfront
      therapy with surgical resection is of high recurrence rate after surgery. The aim of the
      single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial is to evaluate whether
      preoperative lenvatinib treatment could improve resectability and therefore improve the long
      term survival.

      Participants who are recruited in this study in this study will be treated with lenvatinib
      and will be evaluated for the feasibility for surgical resection by a multidisciplinary team
      every 8 weeks. If the participants underwent curative resection, they will receive lenvatinib
      treatment for 48 weeks after surgery.
