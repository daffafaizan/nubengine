      patient is affected differently. Some develop symptoms in their 80's while others get sick in
      adolescence. Swallowing/speech are affected first in some patients, but most have weakness in
      their hands or feet at onset. Some individuals show very rapid progression, even as others
      live for decades. Finally, some patients have loss of mainly motor neurons in the brain (as
      in primary lateral sclerosis), while others lose mainly lower motor neurons in the spinal
      cord and brain stem (as in progressive muscular atrophy). Research has uncovered a few
      genetic factors that contribute to the variability of ALS/MND. For example, mutations in the
      superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene makes onset in the legs more likely and decreases the
      chance of developing dementia. Conversely, having a mutated C9ORF72 gene makes dementia much
      more likely. Uncovering additional factors causing ALS variability is an important research
      priority and is likely to provide clues about how to better diagnose and treat the disease.

      This study is called "Genomic Translation for ALS Care" (GTAC). The investigators will
      analyze the genome and gene expression patterns of people with ALS/MND and carry out research
      on that data, finding insights that the investigators hope will translate into better care
      for ALS/MND patients.
