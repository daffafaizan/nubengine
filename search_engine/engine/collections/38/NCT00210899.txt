    
      Ceftobiprole medocaril is a cephalosporin antibiotic with anti-MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant
      Staphylococcus Aureus) activity. Ceftobiprole medocaril is not yet approved for the treatment
      of complicated skin and skin structure infections. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      multicenter study of ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo versus a comparator to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of ceftobiprole medocaril in patients with complicated skin and skin
      structure infections. The patients will be randomized to ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo
      or a comparator. The patients can be treated as in-patient, out-patient, or through a home
      agency, at the discretion of the investigator. The primary endpoint is the clinical cure rate
      of ceftobiprole medocaril at the test-of-cure visit. The patients will receive either
      ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo or a comparator for 7 to 14 days (unless extended at
      discretion of medical monitor).
