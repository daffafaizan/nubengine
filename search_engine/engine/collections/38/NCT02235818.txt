      lateral epicondylosis/tennis elbow were recruited from a local community and were tested on
      single occasion (one time testing session) before and after a five minute upper extremity
      repetitive task first with control and then brace and kinesiotape assigned in cross-over
      design. The testing session was one hour long and there was no follow up of patients
      following the testing. The patients were recruited between Jan-June 2013.
