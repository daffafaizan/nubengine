      HER2 negative breast cancer are still under exploration. Therefore, it is imperative to find
      a novel therapy to treat these patients.

      This study explores the efficacy and safety of eribulin mesylate combined with anlotinib in
      metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer patients. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      progression free survival (PFS). The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the
      combination of eribulin and anlotinib.
