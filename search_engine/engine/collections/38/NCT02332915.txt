      associated with an established treatment for acquired apraxia of speech (AOS). Intensity in
      the form of dose frequency and total intervention duration was evaluated with Sound
      Production Treatment (SPT). The investigators examined the effects of intense dose frequency
      (nine, one-hour sessions per week) and traditional dose frequency (three, one hour sessions
      per week). Total number of treatment sessions was held constant allowing for comparison of
      total intervention duration (27 sessions over 3 weeks versus 27 sessions over 9 weeks). A
      two-phase, group cross-over design was used. Thirty-six participants with chronic aphasia and
      AOS were recruited. Twenty-four participants completed then entire study and were
      quasi-randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - intense first or traditional first
      (12 per group). One group received SPT applied with intense dose frequency (SPT-I) followed
      by SPT applied with traditional dose frequency (SPT-T). The other group received the
      treatments in the reverse order (SPT-T followed by SPT-I). A two week no treatment interval
      separated the treatment phases. The outcomes of interest addressed changes in trained and
      untrained speech behaviors.
