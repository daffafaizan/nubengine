      Investigators will compare "omic biomarkers" between patients with and without persistent
      chronic low back pain (CLBP).

      "OMIC" biomarkers investigated will be genetics, glycomics and activomic. Genetics through
      GWA studies has already obtained important results in pain research; however concerning low
      back pain, there is not yet suitable genotype-phenotype correlations helpful to stratify
      patients.

      Glycomics is an emerging field that has recently been identified as a priority for the next
      decade by the US National Academies of Science. Many common complex diseases will be
      associated with specific changes in glycan structures. In addition, common genetic
      polymorphisms influencing glycosylation and consequent differences in glycome composition
      could be important diagnostic and prognostic markers. The first studies reporting protein
      glycosylation in large human population samples have been recently published by partners in
      the consortium. Reliable identification of valid associations between specific
      glyco-phenotypes and predisposition for the development or progression of a specific disease
      requires analysis of thousands of patients.

      Activomics: combines data about enzymatic activity of numerous numerous post-translational
      modification proteins in an integrated model which provides dynamic characterization of the
      current state of an organism. In this project information about numerous proteases, kinases,
      phosphatases and glycosidases will be collected and used to complement the existing phenotype
      information.
