      schoolchildren remain at risk from malaria-specific morbidity and mortality. Each year
      between 20-50% of schoolchildren, aged 10-14 years, living in malaria-endemic areas will
      experience a clinical attack of malaria (Clarke et al., 2004). Malaria accounts for 3-8% of
      all-cause absenteeism from school, and up to 50% of preventable absenteeism (Brooker et al.,
      2000). In addition, asymptomatic parasitaemia contributes to anaemia, reducing concentration
      and learning in the classroom (Holding & Snow, 2001). Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
      delivered through schools is a simple intervention, which can be readily integrated into
      broader school health programmes. This study seeks to examine whether IPT can reduce malaria
      and anaemia amongst school-going children, and its consequent impact on school performance,
      in order to assess its suitability for inclusion as a standard intervention in school health
      programmes.

      The efficacy of IPT is being evaluated in schoolchildren with a high-level of acquired
      immunity and ability to limit parasite growth, in whom most infections are asymptomatic and
      may go untreated.

      The intervention: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria administered each school term
      with the purpose to reduce asymptomatic parasitaemia and prevent clinical attacks, thereby
      reducing anaemia and school absenteeism, with consequences for improved attendance and
      concentration in class.

      Schools are randomly allocated to one of two arms:

        -  Intervention schools: IPT given three times a year (once per term) + mass treatment with
           anthelminthics

        -  Control schools: mass treatment with anthelminthics only

      Mass treatment with anthelminthics is carried out in all study schools twice annually in
      accordance with national policy.
