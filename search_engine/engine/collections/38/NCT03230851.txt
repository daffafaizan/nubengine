      tendency, taking other nonsteroidal drugs, severe liver disease history, malignant tumor,
      active gastric mucosa bleeding, percutaneous coronary intervention history, coronary artery
      bypass surgery, cardiac function grade Ⅳ.The baseline values of platelet aggregation rate,
      plasma TXB2 and urinary 11-dh TXB2 are measured by LTA method and ELISA after aspirin 100 mg
      /d ≥5d. Then the patients are randomly divided into 7 groups: Group1: aspirin 100 mg/d;
      Group2: aspirin 100 mg /2d; Groups3: aspirin 100 mg / 3d; Groups4: morning 50mg evening 50mg;
      Group5: aspirin 75mg / d; Group6: aspirin 50mg / d; Group7: indobufen100mg bid. One month
      later,arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation rate , plasma TXB2 and urine 11-dh TXB2
      are analyzed again. All patients are followed-up for 1month,6months and1 year. The stomach
      Intestinal reactions, small bleeding events ,whether to take proton pump inhibitors are
