    
      Inclusion criteria Clin A

        -  Age ≥18 < or =60 years (patients older than 60 years are excluded because of the
           intensive chemotherapy and transplant procedures)

        -  Histologically proven diagnosis of PTCL, including the following categories: PTCL-U
           (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified), AILD-T (angioimmunoblastic-like T-cell
           lymphoma), ALKneg ALCL (ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma),intestinal T - NHL

        -  Advanced stage disease (stage II-IV) or stage I and aaIPI score ≥ 2

        -  Written informed consent

      Inclusion criteria Clin B

        -  Age >60 and ≤75 years (patients older than 75 years are excluded because of the
           intensive chemo-immunotherapy program)

        -  Histological proven diagnosis of PTCL, including the following categories: PTCL-U
           (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified), AILD-T (angioimmunoblastic-like T-cell
           lymphoma), ALKneg ALCL (ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma), intestinal T - NHL

      In clinical study A (Clin A) we are planning to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of
      an intensified chemo-immunotherapy program including auto-SCT or RIC allo-SCT in advanced
      stage PTCL pts ≥ 18 and < or = 60 years.

      In clinical study B (Clin B) we intend to verify the efficacy and the feasibility of a
      combined immuno-chemotherapy approach in a subset of elderly pts aged > 60 and < or = 75
      years.
