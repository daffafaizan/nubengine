      is a disorder of unknown etiology. Although previous reports suggest that some individuals
      with rheumatoid arthritis have a genetic predisposition to the development of fibrotic lung
      disease, genetic factors have not been clearly identified. It is the intent of this clinical
      protocol to identify genetic polymorphisms in individuals with pulmonary fibrosis and
      rheumatoid arthritis.
