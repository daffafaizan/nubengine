      level. The pharmacokinetic profile of AT13387 following a one hour intravenous infusion will
      be determined and the effect of AT13387 on predefined biomarkers in blood plasma and
      circulating white blood cells will be established. Patients will be closely monitored for the
      development of side effects which would preclude further dose escalation.
