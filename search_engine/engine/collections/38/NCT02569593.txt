      occasions (two times before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after RYGB). During each visit the
      following information will be collected:

        -  General information concerning sociodemographic and medical background

        -  The medical history

        -  Anthropometric measures

        -  Physical activity by questionnaire

        -  Food frequency by questionnaire

        -  Information about menstrual blood loss.

      Following an overnight fast, subjects will come to the clinical research center. An
      intravenous catheter will be inserted to collect blood samples. Before the oral
      administration, blood samples will be collected for the determination of the serum
      concentration of different iron status markers. The volunteers will receive first an
      iron(II)sulfate supplement, followed by a Fe-chelate supplement (at least 7 days between both
      supplements). After the administration of the supplement, blood samples will be taken at
      various time points to determine the amount of iron absorption and to investigate if there
      are any changes in the iron metabolism (at 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes and 2; 2.5; 3; 3.5; 4 and 5
      hours after oral administration). There will be a one-week washout period between the tests
      with each iron supplement. The volunteers will be asked to repeat the test before surgery and
      1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery for each iron supplement.
