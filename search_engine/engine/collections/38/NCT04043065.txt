      2 diabetes (T2D) can only in part be explained by alterations in the plasma concentrations of
      known peptides. Thus, other - yet unknown - signals or hormones elicited from the endocrine
      cells of the small intestine may play an important role for the remission of T2D observed
      following RYGB. In a recent study, a predicted sequence of liver-enriched antimicrobial
      peptide 2 (LEAP-2) was shown to induce a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated
      human pancreatic islets. The fragment was subsequently identified to be circulating in human
      plasma in concentrations comparable to the circulating levels of other known gut secreted
      hormones, hereby validating that LEAP-2 is an endogenous circulating peptide.

      The investigators hypothesise that LEAP-2 increases insulin secretion during a graded glucose
      infusion as assessed by plasma insulin and C-peptide compared with saline (placebo) in
      healthy subjects. The study is designed as a clinical, placebo-controlled, double-blinded
      cross-over study involving two experimental study days and ten young healthy male
      participants. The co-primary endpoints are the difference in plasma insulin levels during a
      graded glucose infusion and beta-cell secretion assessed by plasma C-peptide concentration
      relative to plasma glucose concentration between the two study days with either saline
      (placebo) or LEAP-2 infusion.
