      severe. Chest wall deformities occur when the cartilage that connects the ribs grows
      unevenly. It is not clear why this happens, but the condition tends to run in families. The
      two most common types of chest wall deformity are Pectus excavatum and Pectus carinatum,
      Pectus carinatum goes far beyond a simple esthetical problem. It can be responsible of
      physical signs and symptoms and also has significant psychological impact. Defects tend to
      worsen during pubertal growth spurts and even during adult life. Recent evidence shows that
      these patients are at risk for a disturbed body image and reduced quality of life and many
      patients refer feelings of discomfort, shame, shyness, anxiety, anguish, and even depression,
      which can lead to social isolation. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone
      position, intolerance to physical exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic
      position are some of the physical signs and symptoms.Non-invasive treatment approaches for PC
      include compression orthosis and exercises that target the deformity itself and concurrent
      postural impairment and scoliosis. In addition, the formation of muscles can help close the
      deformity. Most evidence of non-invasive treatment is retrospective or prospective case
      series. In a prospective case series, patients were instructed to perform chest wall
      strengthening exercises, but the effects of the exercises were not investigated . Although,
      exercise training is recommended, there is no randomized study showing its effectiveness in
      the literature. Therefore, in our study, the investigators aimed to investigate the
      effectiveness of exercise therapy in addition to compression orthotics.
