      energy for cavitation-based cellular destruction. The planned duration of a single target
      tumor will be 60 minutes or less in a single session and adjusted intra-procedurally as
      necessary per investigator discretion. Subjects in this study must have an adequate acoustic
      window in the abdominal space in order to be eligible for enrollment. All patients who
      undergo ablation with the investigation device will be treated in a hospital environment
      under general anesthesia not to exceed four hours.
