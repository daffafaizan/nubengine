      deprivation therapy (ADT) each year. ADT is an important part of treatment, because it
      improves survival for men with metastatic or high-risk localized disease, and reduces rates
      of biochemical progression for men with intermediate-risk localized disease who receive
      radiation. The most common ADT agents modulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone to suppress the
      downstream testosterone production, resulting in testosterone levels similar to those
      observed following surgical castration (<20 ng/dL). Since male sexual interest is highly
      correlated with serum testosterone levels, loss of sexual interest is nearly universal among
      men who receive ADT.Sexual dysfunction is the most common complaint among men with prostate
      cancer and contributes to lower overall quality of life (QoL) experienced by men receiving
      ADT. Furthermore, the loss of sexual interest experienced during ADT is highly distressing
      for men with prostate cancer and their partners, which contributes additional psychological
      morbidity in these patients.

      Flibanserin is approved for treatment of female hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the
      safety profile of 100mg daily flibanserin is well described in premenopausal women.The safety
      profile of flibanserin in healthy men has been assessed in multiple phase I clinical trials,
      but has not been evaluated among men receiving ADT for prostate cancer.

      This is a phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to
      provide an initial estimate of the efficacy of flibanserin to promote sexual interest in men
      with prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy and to confirm the safety
      profile. This study will take place at a single academic comprehensive cancer center.

      Following confirmation of eligibility, participants who are enrolled in this study are
      randomized to receive daily flibanserin 100mg or placebo for a 12-week period.
