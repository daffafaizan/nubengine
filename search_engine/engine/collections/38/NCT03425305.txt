      with increased incidence of several cardiovascular diseases. Associations with specific
      initial presentations of cardiovascular diseases have not been studied in large cohort from
      the general population, but may be of interest for use in risk prediction or to guide
      therapeutic strategies.

      The aim of this study is to estimate associations between serum uric acid level and initial
      presentation of a range of cardiovascular diseases.

      The study will use data from the CALIBER dataset of clinically collected electronic health
      record data from England. Patients enter the study when they have a blood urate measurement
      recorded in the dataset, and they are followed up until they experience one of the
      cardiovascular endpoints, death or transfer out of the participating primary care practice.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Clinical disease research using linked bespoke studies and
      electronic records) programme funded from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
      and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Inpatient
      Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and
      other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and
      prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly
      where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has
      received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009
      CALIBER dataset).
