      special physical properties of particles (protons and C12 carbon ions), in particular the
      steep lateral dose drop, an improved protection of adjacent risk organs is e.g. Intestine,
      kidneys, liver etc. during the process of applying radiotherapy is possible.

      The primary study objective is to demonstrate the safety and conduct of study treatment and
      the incidence of Grade 3-5 NCI-CTC-AE toxicity and / or termination of preferred therapy for
      any reason. Further target parameter is the proportion of applied therapies without the
      occurance of degree 3-5 NCI-CTC-AE(s).

      The patients are randomized 1: 1 into the two arms (carbon ions vs. protons). Patients
      receive 39 Gy in (SD 3.0 Gy) in 6 fractions per week.

      Secondary study objectives are local control (LC), local progression-free survival from the
      start of therapy (LPFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of
      life (QoL) determined according to the EORTC-Quality of Life Questionaire (QLQ)- C30
      questionnaire.
