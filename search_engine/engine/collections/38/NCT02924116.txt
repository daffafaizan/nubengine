      productivity, poor health and higher use of healthcare. The use of non-pharmacologic
      treatments for insomnia has gained much attention in recent years. The investigators are
      conducting this research because a safe, non-pharmacologic treatment would benefit patients
      with insomnia, and to see if the Bioboosti device is an effective treatment for insomnia.

      Subjects will include patients from the clinics who have the diagnosis of insomnia. Study
      staff will notify the treating physician of a potential subject. If the subject gives
      permission and would like to obtain more information, study staff will approach them and
      provide them with the consent form to review. Study staff may also contact them by phone to
      explain the study and recruit.

      Subjects will be asked to make 5 visits:

      Visit 1-- consent form, physical exam, vitals, pregnancy test, sleep log

      Visit 2-- sleep questionnaires, urine test for hormones associated with sleep, sleep log,
      placement of EEG

      Visit 3-- remove EEG, beginning of treatment with Bioboosti device, sleep log Treatment
      phase-- subjects use the Bioboosti at home for two weeks

      Visit 4-- return of Bioboosti, sleep questionnaires, urine test for hormones associated with
      sleep, sleep log, placement of EEG

      Visit 5-- remove EEG, collect sleep logs
