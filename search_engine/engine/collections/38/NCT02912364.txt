      6 visits over a 21 week period. Forty six (46) normal healthy subjects will be treated with
      both Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, 800 mg/day) and Carbamazepine (CBZ, 800mg/day) for 6 weeks
      and 3 days each (maintenance 4 weeks and taper 3 days). Each antiepileptic drug (AED)
      treatment period will be followed by a four day taper and washout period off AED for the
      remainder of the month. Cognitive and behavioral testing along with safety testing will be
      conducted at pretreatment baseline, the end of each randomization AED maintenance period, and
      after the final washout period.
