      fertilization rate in women undergoing IVF treatment.

      Oocytes from each woman will be allocated to one of three groups, depending on the aspirate
      or flush they are recovered from:

      Group I= egg retrieved in the follicular fluid of the first aspirate (no flushing) Group II=
      egg retrieved in the 1st-2nd flush Group III= egg retrieved in the 3rd-5th flush

      development and utilization. Pregnancy rates will be reported as a surrogate outcome.
