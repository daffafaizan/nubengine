    
      A1ATD- associated liver disease is a progressive Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Deficiency Associated
      Liver Disease condition resulting in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
      The lack of functional A1AT in individuals with PiZZ genotype, in conjunction with other
      precipitating factors, can lead to unchecked activity in neutrophil elastases in the alveoli;
      causing emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This loss-of-function
      mechanism can be addressed with intravenous augmentation therapy, which aims to substitute
      the missing A1AT by infusing alpha1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI), purified from pooled human
      plasma.

      While augmentation therapy can address the loss of A1AT in the lungs, no treatment exists for
      the associated liver disease.

      Given the severity of the disease, with approximately 10% of affected patients developing
      liver cirrhosis and a subgroup of those patients in need of liver transplantation, and lack
      of an effective treatment that addresses the toxic hepatic "gain-of-function" mechanism,
      there is an urgent unmet medical need to develop a therapy that can help in this particular
      patient population.
