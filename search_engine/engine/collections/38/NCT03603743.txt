      recording, an echocardiography, a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

      The RP consisted of 2 types of exercise training according to the randomization:

        1. a short-high intensity interval exercise with passive recovery

        2. a classical moderate and continuous exercise training at 60% of peak power output

      The RP lasted 4 weeks.
