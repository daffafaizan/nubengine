      adults with asthma on the adults' asthma health. To this end, the investigators aim to study
      40 adults with asthma that are 18-50 years of age and live in Baltimore. Participants will
      receive either true air cleaners or sham cleaners in a blinded, randomized manner for one
      month, and then, after a washout period, participants will cross over and receive the other
      intervention (sham or true cleaner). All participants will have environmental monitoring
      (personal and in-home) to determine participants' particulate matter exposure, and be
      followed repeatedly during the 3 month study period for markers of asthma disease, including
      respiratory symptoms, medication and health care utilization, pulmonary function, systemic
      markers of inflammation, and bronchoscopic evidence of airway inflammation or epithelial cell
      dysfunction.
