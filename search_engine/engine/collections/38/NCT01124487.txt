      olein vs olive oil vs lard. Volunteers were asked to participate in three postprandial
      challenges, separated by at least 3-days. Subjects were provided a low fat meal(<10g fat) the
      day before the intervention. Fasting blood was collected the next day and the subjects were
      instructed to consume test meals (50g high fat meal). Further venous blood was collected at
      30 min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 4h postprandially.

      Primary outcome variable: Triacylglycerol (TAG) Secondary outcome variables: Insulin
      sensitivity (glucose, insulin), non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), inflammatory markers
