      thoracic manipulation versus targeted supine thoracic manipulation on cervical spine pain and
      flexion range of motion. There is evidence that thoracic spine manipulation is an effective
      treatment for patients with cervical spine pain. This evidence includes a variety of
      techniques to manipulate the thoracic spine. While each of them is effective, no research has
      compared techniques to determine which produces the best outcomes.

      METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with cervical spine pain were randomly assigned to either a
      seated thoracic manipulation or targeted supine thoracic manipulation group. Pain and flexion
      range of motion measures were taken before and after the intervention.
