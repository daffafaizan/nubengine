      10% per day contrast-increment that was designed for short-term intervention studies lasting
      1-4 weeks; i.e., after 18 days of successful game play, both eyes viewed 100% contrast (no
      contrast-rebalancing).This study will investigate two alternative protocols designed to
      extend the game treatment period beyond 4 weeks to allow for more complete recovery of visual
      acuity. The new protocols will be compared with the original 10% contrast-increment game
      protocol in an 8-week 3-arm RCT to determine whether one or both of the new protocols is more
      effective than the current 10% increment.

      Based on pilot data, we expect about 40% of amblyopic children to achieve normal visual
      acuity in 8 weeks. In an effort to also promote recovery of binocular vision, children who
      attain â‰¤0.4 logMAR at 8 weeks will be enrolled in stereoacuity training at the 8-week visit
      for the next 4 weeks. Children with residual amblyopia (BCVA >0.4 logMAR) at the 8-week visit
      will be provided with dichoptic movies for additional amblyopia treatment for another 4
      weeks.
