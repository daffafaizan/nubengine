    
      Emergency Department care is marked by long delays, lack of efficacy, and conflict. A
      sub-specialty Infusion Center staffed by expert clinicians and delivering individualized care
      can improve care quality while reducing costs. The study will examine whether care provided
      in an Infusion Center (IC) is more patient centered and efficient than care provided in an
      Emergency Department (ED) for adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and uncomplicated
      Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC).

      Sites will prospectively enroll patients in VOC seen in participating centers from either the
      EDs or the ICs. Specific data from the acute visits (e.g. Times of arrival, time to first
      dose of analgesic, etc) will be captured. This study will compare: pain management,
      disposition of subjects (home or admission) and patient experiences of care delivery in both
      settings. Subjects will complete surveys/questionnaires to asses subjects' experiences in the
      setting where care was provided.

      The four sites to participate in the study are Baltimore, Maryland (Johns Hopkins Hospital),
      Cleveland, Ohio (Cleveland Medical Center), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Medical College of
      Wisconsin), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Our Lady of the Lake Hospital). A maximum of 500
      subjects will participate in the study. Participants will be enrolled for 18 months.
