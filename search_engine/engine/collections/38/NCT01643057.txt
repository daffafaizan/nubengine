      and/or is accompanied by oxygen desaturation or a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia).
      Because apnea presents itself within a variety of diseases in newborns, its diagnosis is
      based largely on the exclusion of other findings. The difficulty in relating the
      manifestation of apnea to its cause can lead to issues regarding appropriate medical
      management and delays in treatment.

      Our exploration of physiological interventions for Apnea of Prematurity begins with
      stochastic resonance. Stochastic resonance is the introduction of noise to a system, to alter
      the system's behavior. This technology has been examined in previous medical applications.
      The hypothesis for this work is that stochastic resonance stimulation, in the form of gentle
      vibrations, will stabilize immature breathing patterns in infants.

      In this research study, we will use an apnea mattress developed by engineers at the Wyss
      Institute, Harvard University, which provides gentle vibrations to the infant. We will
      closely follow the research protocol from UMass Medical School. Whilst the infant is on the
      mattress, clinical care data will be collected to determine effect on breathing patterns. We
      also hope to collect enough baseline and intervention data signals to be able to identify
      candidate biomarkers for apnea. This will assist in development of predictive algorithms for
      apnea in infants.
