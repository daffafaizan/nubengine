      find the level of oral supplementation with propionate that increases plasma propionate
      levels to 10x the current normal plasma level and use this dose of propionate in a
      randomised, placebo controlled double bind study. This study will compare propionate with
      fermentable and non fermentable carbohydrate. The outcome measures for this study will
      include assessments of appetite with feeding studies, measurement of insulin sensitivity
      using hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps and assessment of adipose tissue distribution
      using MRI scans and adipose tissue biopsy to determine changes in proliferation and
      differentiation of adipocytes.
