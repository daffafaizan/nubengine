      inserted at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, Emory University, between January
      1st, 1998 and July 30th, 2004. The goal of our study is to establish the prevalence of
      beneficial and adverse effects in the AICD and BiV patient population.

      Demographic, clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics during the hospitalization as
      well as at follow-up will be obtained from the medical records and are summarized in the
      following tables Note: We defined infection as elevated temperature above 38.1 C associated
      with elevated WBC and positive cultures.
