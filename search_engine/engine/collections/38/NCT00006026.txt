      metastatic urothelial tract tumors. II. Determine the response rate in these patients when
      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the duration of objective response in these
      patients when treated with this regimen. IV. Characterize the toxicities of this treatment in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days
      1-5. Treatment continues weekly every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
