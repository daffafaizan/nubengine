    
      The main objective of this phase II randomized trial is to identify, among 3 combinations of
      Azacitidine and another drug evaluated simultaneously, the most promising combination(s) for
      the treatment of higher risk MDS (IPSS Int-2 and High) compared to Azacitidine alone. The 3
      tested drugs in combination with Azacitidine are: Valproic Acid, Lenalidomide and Idarubicin.

      The aim of this trial is to identify, in a situation where several potentially interesting
      drugs tested in combination with AZA exist, the most promising combination(s) based on
      efficacy compared to azacitidine alone, based on a two-stage design that allows a formal
      efficacy comparison between the K=3 investigational treatment groups and the control group.
