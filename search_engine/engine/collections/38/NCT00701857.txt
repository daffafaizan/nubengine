      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of pemetrexed disodium in combination with
           cisplatin and standard-dose radiotherapy in patients with stage III or IV esophageal or
           gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To specifically characterize the toxicity profile of this regimen.

        -  To investigate, preliminarily, the anti-tumor activity of this regimen, as measured by
           standard response criteria (RECIST criteria), in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and cisplatin
      IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo external beam
      radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for up to 6 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 1 year.
