      outside of the clinic. The refraction devices require the user to perform a series of tests
      while looking through it to view a visual display. The current devices do not currently
      account for accommodation and therefore may present inaccurate results for the younger
      population where the accommodation effect is quite significant. This study is aimed at
      enabling future EyeQue refraction measurement products to overcome this issue and provide the
      required tools to allow for accommodation measurement, correction and control. Control of the
      user's accommodative state will allow for measurement of near vision as well as far vision
      based on the refractive measurement.
