      certain structural changes in their brain. The purpose of this study is to look at those
      changes, as well as the assessment of risk factors for bipolar disorders, involving both
      social and psychological aspects of behavior, age, education, marital relations, nutrition,
      physical activity, etc., compared with persons not having bipolar disorder. These changes in
      the brain will be measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
