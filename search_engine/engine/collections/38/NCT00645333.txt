      which are characterized by their capacity to self-renew and divide indefinitely, and
      resistance to conventional therapies. The Notch pathway is important for stem cell renewal,
      and is a potential target for BCSC-directed therapy. Experimental Design-Using human breast
      tumorgraft studies, we evaluated the impact of gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) on the BCSC
      population and the efficacy of combining GSI with docetaxel treatment. The mouse experimental
      therapy paralleled a concurrent clinical trial in advanced breast cancer patients, designed
      to determine the maximally tolerated dose of the GSI, MK-0752, administered sequentially with
      docetaxel, and to evaluate BCSC markers in serial tumor biopsies.
