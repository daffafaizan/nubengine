      motion and muscle force, gait rehabilitation, patient education and socio-professional
      reintegration.The non-pharmacological and non-surgical methods include certain types of
      physical therapy: massage, heat, ultrasound, laser, shockwave therapy. Among them, shockwave
      therapy is not a new treatment method, and seems to be effective in rotator cuff pathology,
      tennis elbow, and also on knee osteoarthritis, but few studies have been conducted so far for
      outcome measurement in symptomatic hip osteoarthritis.
