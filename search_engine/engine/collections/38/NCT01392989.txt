    
      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the rate of conversion to FDC following infusion of allogeneic CIK cells among
      patients with MDS, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, or MPD who receive non myeloablative
      preparative regimen of TLI / ATG followed by allogeneic HCT and consolidation with allogeneic
      CIK cells.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the 2 year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS)

        -  To determine the incidence of acute GVHD following infusion of allogeneic CIK cells

        -  To assess the pre-transplant expression of NKG2D ligands in patients' bone marrow
           aspirates.
