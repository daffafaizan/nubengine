        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in patients with
           advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on absorption in the fasting and non-fasting states
           in these patients.

        -  Determine any anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate clinical outcomes with histone acetylation in circulating mononuclear cells
           and tumor biopsy samples in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to disease (solid
      tumor vs multiple myeloma or lymphoma vs leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes).

      The initial 15-20 patients (in the solid tumor or multiple myeloma or lymphoma stratum)
      receive suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) IV over 2 hours on day 1 of week 0 and then
      orally once or twice daily beginning on day 1 of week 1. All remaining patients receive oral
      SAHA once or twice daily beginning on day 1 of week 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to
      1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In each stratum, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for resolution of adverse events.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 114 patients (42 with solid tumors, 36 with lymphoma or
      multiple myeloma, and 36 with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes) will be accrued for this
      study within 1 year.
