    
      This is a local, non-interventional, multi-center, single-cohort study using primary data of
      patients treated with Xofigo for the indication of castration resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) with bone metastases. A total of 300 patients (valid for safety analysis) are enrolled
      within 18 months.

      During the observation period (i.e. up to 6 months), safety and effectiveness information is
      collected. Since patient's visit occurs under the routine clinical practice, the study
      protocol does not define exact referral dates for those visits. The physician records patient
      data as defined in the protocol.

      The extended follow-up period is to collect bone fractures and survival with post-treatment
      information after Xofigo under the real-world in Japan.

      The results of this study (except of extended follow-up period) have to be submitted to the
      Japanese regulatory authorities as a part of the reexamination period (8 years). This study
      is conducted in accordance with Article 14-4 (re-examination) of the Pharmaceutical Affairs
      Law, and Good Post-marketing Surveillance Practice from a ministerial ordinance of Ministry
      of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan.
