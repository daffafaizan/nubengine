      through administration of a GnRH antagonist during three subsequent days prior to the start
      of gonadotropin stimulation in a GnRH antagonist protocol. This regimen, after normalisation
      of the progesterone value, allows controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Since this
      regimen is valid in case of elevated progesterone, GnRH antagonists pretreatment may prove to
      be a valid tool for scheduling IVF treatment in patients with normal progesterone values on
      day 2 of the cycle. In this prospective randomised trial, the investigators study the impact
      of administration of a GnRH antagonist during 3 consecutive days at initiation of the cycle.
