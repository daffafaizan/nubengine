      failure of a surgically implanted tissue valve. Sometimes TAVR displaces the diseased aortic
      valve leaflets outwards, causing life-threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that
      supply blood to the heart. This is more common in surgically implanted tissue valves that are
      designed to achieve the largest aortic valve orifice area. Despite attempts to protect the
      coronary arteries from obstruction in these patients using coronary stents, the mortality of
      TAVR-associated coronary artery obstruction remains prohibitively high.

      The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing aortic valve
      leaflet and enable TAVR in such patients. The procedure is called Bioprosthetic or native
      Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction
      (BASILICA).

      The purpose of this study is to perform BASILICA in patients who have no good options to
      prevent coronary artery obstruction during TAVR.
