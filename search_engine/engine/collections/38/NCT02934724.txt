      programme globally. The women will be recruited through Facebook ads. The study will enable
      us to measure differences in the prevalence of HPV types in vagina and the mouth between
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated young women in Norway.

      The womens vaccination status will be validated by linkage to the Norwegian Immunisation
      Registry (SYSVAK) and their residence status will be validated through linkage to the
      Norwegian Population Registry.
