      clinic visits in pediatric gastroenterology. Constipation is defined by the Rome III
      criteria. The symptoms are difficult to treat in part of the patients and cause frustration
      to the patient and family.

      Probiotics are increasingly used in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders,
      including chronic constipation in adults and children. A recent study revealed that the
      administration of Lactobacillus reuteri had a positive effect on bowel frequency in infants
      with chronic constipation.

      The study goal is to evaluate Lactobacillus reuteri (Biogaia) for treatment of chronic
      constipation in children 4-10 years of age, and to examine the influence of Lactobacillus
      reuteri (Biogaia) on constipation in different age groups of school aged children between
      4-10 yrs of age.
