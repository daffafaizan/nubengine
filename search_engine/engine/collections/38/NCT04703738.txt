      with approximately 10-subjects per Investigator. Power analysis based on 80% power, past
      Thoma, Zeltner and Gonz√°lez-Martin studies 1,2,3 and a one-sided confidence interval of
      0.025, indicates that with a volume change standard deviation between 0.5 and 0.7 mm, 17-31
      subjects are required per group (test and control), so 50-60 subjects are an acceptable
      estimate, with a preference for 60, given potential loss to long-term follow-up.
