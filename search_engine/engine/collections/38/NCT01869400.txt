      December 2009 for the treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer relapse. Based on the
      outcomes of study OVA-301, this non-interventional study will investigate the role of a
      platinum-free treatment regimen in patients with progressive ovarian cancer relapsing > 6
      months after completing previous platinum-based chemotherapy. In particular, this study aims
      at collecting the "real-life" data with regard to the response and the influence of the
      mentioned therapy on the "tumor related events", to objectify the value of palliative care.
