      mixture stimulates whole body protein synthesis (and in this way protein anabolism) to a
      larger extent than a regular balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino
      acids in NSCLC patients with and without recent weight loss. The principal endpoint will be
      the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate as this is the principal mechanism by
      which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle anabolism. This project will provide
      important clinical information, based on novel fundamental basic knowledge on the process and
      the specific underlying mechanisms of muscle wasting in patients with NSCLC, and the role of
      EAA as a potential anabolic substrate. In this way, it will provide preliminary data for the
      development of nutritional strategies that will prevent or even stop this process of ongoing
      muscle loss in NSCLC.
