    
      This study is designed as a multicenter, phase I/II, prospective, open-labeled, single
      intravenous (IV) dose, clinical trial in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      The study population will be men who have been offered curative therapy (radical
      prostatectomy; cryotherapy; brachytherapy; External Beam RadioTherapy (EBRT), and refused.
      Patients must have already had a previous biopsy showing a histologically proven carcinoma of
      the prostate. The identification and the location of the tumor will be done using both
      dynamic contrast Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) and biopsy.

      Only unilateral treatment with WST11-medicated VTP will be performed during the study.
      Treatment will consist of a single, 10 minute, IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2mg/kg,
      4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg, followed by either light activation delivered through transperineal
      interstitial optical fibers for 20 minutes using 753 nm laser light at escalating fixed
      energy doses of 200 J/cm or 300 J/cm by escalating power at each energy to 167 mW/cm or 250
      mW/cm respectively. A brachytherapy-like template is used for the placement of the
      transparent implant catheters which are positioned in the prostate under transrectal
      ultrasound image guidance. The illumination fiber(s) are then inserted into the implant
      catheters.

      If the safety profile for a given WST11 and light dose is acceptable, additional patients may
      be treated with multiple fibers at that WST11 treatment dose.

      For cases where the Month 6 biopsy is positive, the patient will be offered the opportunity
      to be retreated with WST11
