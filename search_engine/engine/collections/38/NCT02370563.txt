    
      Subjects with various types and grades of primary brain tumors or brain metastasis will be
      recruited. The brain tumor needs to be either histologically or clinically confirmed.
      18F-FSPG will be injected intravenously into the subjects, and PET/CT imaging performed.
      Images will be assessed visually and quantitatively.

      Available tumor specimens will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for example for
      expression of components of the system xc- and associated biomarkers.
