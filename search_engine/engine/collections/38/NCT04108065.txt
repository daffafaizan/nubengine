      pregnancy is a strong predictor of future type 2 diabetes. Patients with GDM exhibit severely
      reduced postprandial responses of the insulinotropic and satiety-promoting gut hormone
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which normalise alongside remission of GDM after delivery.
      Ingested nutrients and bile acids constitute potent stimulators of GLP-1 secretion. Reduced
      postprandial GLP-1 responses likely contribute to the pathophysiology of GDM, but the
      mechanisms are unknown. Based on previous studies studying gallbladder emptying during
      pregnancy, we hypothesize that reduced postprandial GLP-1 responses in GDM is due to
      incomplete gallbladder emptying during third trimester. If our hypothesis proves right,
      reduced gallbladder emptying and ensuing attenuation of postprandial GLP-1 secretion will
      constitute an obvious and druggable target for the treatment of GDM.

      Fifteen women with gestational diabetes mellitus and 15 age and body mass index (BMI)-matched
      pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance will be enrolled in the study. For each subject,
      the study encompasses one screening visit and two experimental days; one during third
      trimester of pregnancy and one 3-9 months post partum. On experimental days, a standardised
      liquid mixed meal test (added 1.5 g of paracetamol for evaluation of gastric emptying
      according to paracetamol absorption) with repeated ultrasonographic gallbladder scans and
      blood samples will be performed.
