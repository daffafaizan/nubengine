      safety and tolerability study of IGSC 20% in subjects with primary immunodeficiency.
      Approximately 50 subjects were to be enrolled in order to have approximately 30 adult
      subjects and 12 to 18 pediatric subjects (age 2-16 years) completing treatment with
      subcutaneously administered IGSC 20%.

      This study included 3 treatment phases: Run-In Phase, IV Phase (IV administration of IGIV-C
      10% treatment), and SC Phase (SC administration of IGSC 20%).

      Subjects, depending on their current IgG treatment regimen, might be required to enter the
      Run-In Phase to receive IV IGIV-C 10% treatment (Sponsor provided) to achieve an
      approximately steady-state condition prior to entering the IV Phase. They then entered the IV
      Phase to determine the AUC profiles of IV infusions of IGIV-C 10%.

      Subjects with a qualifying IV IGIV-C 10% treatment regimen (on stable IGIV-C 10% doses of
      300-800 mg/kg) entered the IV Phase directly where they will receive IGIV-C 10%. In the IV
      Phase, steady-state IV PK assessments, including AUC, were to be performed.

      After completing the IV Phase, subjects entered the SC Phase to receive weekly SC doses of
      IGSC 20% for at least 24 weeks.

      The PK profiles of total IgG following administration of both IV (IGIV-C 10%) administration
      and SC (IGSC 20%) administration were determined and compared after reaching approximate
      steady-state conditions.
