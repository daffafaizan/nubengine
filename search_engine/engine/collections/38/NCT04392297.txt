    
      -  evaluate the immune status main indicators that characterize the activation of immune
           system, immunosuppression and anergy (myeloid suppressor cells, T-regulatory cells,
           T-cells according to the stages of differentiation (naive - effector - memory),
           activated T-cells);

        -  identify and characterize immunological disorders in patients with CMV infection
           complicated by thromboembolism of various localization;

        -  determine the presence and quantitative content in plasma / serum and neutrophils of the
           CMV genetic material by real-time PCR;

        -  study humoral immunity to CMV (IgM / IgG antibodies to CMV in serum);

        -  determine the content of CMV specific T-cells in peripheral blood;

        -  develop a method for the early detection of immunological and clinical signs of
           thromboembolic complications of CMV infection in immunocompetent persons and treatment
           of patients in this category.
