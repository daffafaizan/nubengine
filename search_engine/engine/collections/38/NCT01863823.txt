      pylori) of the oral cavity with the success rate eradication of gastric H. pylori infection.

      Study Design and Setting: 202 symptomatic and 148 asymptomatic individuals were recruited and
      tested using Saliva H. pylori antigen tests (HPS), H. pylori flagellin (HPF), the urea
      breathe test (UBT) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Test subjects also received
      various treatments.

      We collected data of HPS, HPF , PCR and UBT before treatment on 202 symptomatic patients and
      148 asymptomatic individual groups. After drug treatment, we run HPS, HPF, PCR and UBT tests.
      If the tests of HPS, HPF and PCR show negative that indicate success of oral H.pylori
      eradication. If the test of UBT show negative that indicate success of stomach H.pyloi
      eradication. We also compare the suceess rate of eradication on stomach infection with and
      without oral H. pylori infection.
