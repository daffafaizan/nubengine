      I. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of intensified systemic treatment with delayed central
      nervous system (CNS) irradiation in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and isolated
      CNS disease.

      II. Determine the efficacy of systemic thiotepa in reducing or clearing blasts in the
      cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity of single dose thiotepa followed by dexamethasone, vincristine,
      daunorubicin, and triple intrathecal therapy in these patients.

      IV. Determine the response rate of intrathecal sustained release cytarabine (DTC101) in
      patients with first bone marrow remission with first isolated CNS relapse.

      V. Assess the safety and toxicity of DTC101 in these patients.
