      state of acute exacerbation and in stable state, patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)
      in state of acute decompensated cardiac insufficiency, and patients newly diagnosed with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a control group.

      In the acute setting of COPD and CHF, the questionnaire will be given at the day of hospital
      admission and at the day of discharge. The patients will additionally fill the Severe
      Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) Questionnaire (in COPD) or the Physical Activity
      Questionnaire 50+ (in CHF).

      In stable state of COPD, the questionnaires will be given once during a routine control visit
      at the hospital or the medical practice.

      In OSA, the questionnaire will be given once during the first visit in the sleep laboratory.
