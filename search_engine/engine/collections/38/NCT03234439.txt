      namely the chronic pain focus area, on study participants' functional well-being over time.
      The research questions to be answered include the following:

        1. Do study participants who are randomized to the myStrength intervention arm experience
           change in their self-reported ability to function, outlook on pain, and/or perception of
           prescription opioids.

        2. Do study participants who are randomized to the myStrength intervention arm experience
           change in terms of their behavioral health, such as anxiety and depression levels,
           during the study period.

      The study team hypothesizes that myStrength study participants will achieve a higher level of
      functioning and adopt a more positive outlook toward their pain management as compared to the
      waitlist control group. Self-assessments will be repeated throughout the study period to
      capture the inflection point of change as well as the sustainability of these changes over
      time.
