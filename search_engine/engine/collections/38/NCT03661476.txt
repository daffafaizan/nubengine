      Oculo-motor home exercise protocols were given to all participants for 2 sessions per day for
      6 weeks, and regular phone calls were made once a week. Participants were assessed
      cycloplegic refraction by autorefractometry, corrected and uncorrected visual acuity by
      snellen chart, ocular motility test, near and distant alternating prism cover test, streopsis
      test and patient satisfaction levels by intermittent exotropia survery.
