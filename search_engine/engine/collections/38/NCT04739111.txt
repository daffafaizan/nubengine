    
      This is an open, dose-escalation and dose-extension exploratory clinical study for patients
      with advanced malignancy who have failed standard therapy. In the dose-escalation phase, a
      fixed dose of CDP1 will be given once a week, while LDP will be given every two weeks with
      dose climbing. Then, cohort studies (cohorts 1 to 5) will be conducted during the
      dose-expansion phase. The purpose is to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDP
      combined with CDP1 in the treatment of patients with advanced malignant tumor, and to
      determine the recommended dose for clinical trial.
