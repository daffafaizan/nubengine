      dose of alcohol on immune biomarkers, neurobiological measures, and cognitive functioning.
      The study recruits healthy adults (ages 21-45) from the community to complete the
      experimental protocol. Participants complete magnetic resonance imaging scans, blood sample
      collection, and cognitive testing in the context of alcohol consumption.
