      sites can be obtained through intensive injection technique training, education and follow up
      of patients. Furthermore, this has significant beneficial effects on daily glycaemic
      variations, hypoglycaemic events, long term blood glucose levels, and insulin dose
      requirements. This is however frequently not done appropriately in every day practice.

      At a small workshop at Nordsjællands Hospital in November 2017 with patients with type 1
      diabetes the value of a device to registrar time, dose and rotation of insulin injections
      were discussed. All patients considered their own injection patterns as satisfying - although
      only one in four used a systematic approach. Most patients relied on their healthcare
      provider to identify side effects like lipohypertrophy, half of the patients re-used needles
      more than once and two took injections through the clothes now and then. All subjects would
      prefer a simple and small device to be used with the pen for the lifetime of the pen to
      minimize time used for injections and attraction of attention from other people.

      The hypothesis is that the ROTO track® can reduce the number of insulin injections in the
      same subcutaneous skin area as compared with standard insulin injection instructions in
      patients with type 1 diabetes. The reduction of injection in same skin area will be
      quantified by a rotation score
