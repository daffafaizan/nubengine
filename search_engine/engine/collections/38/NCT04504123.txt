      low dose, oral doxycycline 50 mg once a day versus placebo in patients with wet age-related
      macular degeneration who are incomplete responders to anti-VEGF extended treatment regimens.

      The study will be conducted over 9 months with every 3 month assessments; 6 months
      administration period of doxycycline versus placebo (double masked, randomized) and a 3 month
      follow up period. The participant visits will occur during clinic visits for standard-of-care
      intravitreal injections (IVI).

      Medical information will be acquired from the standard of care optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), visual acuity (VA), and IVI administered (number, frequency and type of drug).

      Blood plasma and aqueous fluid (anterior chamber tap) samples and study drug tolerability
      will be obtained at baseline, 6 months and 9 months. Plasma will be obtained to assay for
      inflammatory markers: MMP-9 levels and questionnaires will be obtained on 1) vision quality
      of life, and 2) study drug tolerance at Baseline, 6 months and 9 months.
