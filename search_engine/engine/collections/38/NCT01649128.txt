      were assayed to estimate pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), alpha-fetoprotein ,
      unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotrophin , and inhibin-A. Women screened for Down
      syndrome were offered UtA Doppler at 20-24 weeks of gestation and then collected serial serum
      samples for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at two time points (24-27 and 34-37 weeks' gestation).
