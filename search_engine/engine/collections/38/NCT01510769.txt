      patients with gout. Although febuxostat has been demonstrated to be superior to allopurinol
      in lowering serum urate (sUA) to < 6mg/dL in 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials,
      proportions of subjects experiencing a reduction in tophus area and gout flares were not
      significantly different compared to allopurinol. Although this study will allow subjects who
      are naÃ¯ve to ULT to enroll, it is anticipated that the majority of subjects will currently be
      taking or have previously experienced XO Inhibitor therapy. This trial will enroll a
      population of subjects with high uric acid body burden, as all must demonstrate the presence
      of tophi.
