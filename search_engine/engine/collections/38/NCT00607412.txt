      disorders among female victims of intimate partner violence. The hypothesis is that women who
      receive present-focused, integrated treatment will have greater PTSD symptom reduction and
      have less substance use post-treatment than women in the control condition who will receive
      supportive therapy based on a 12-step approach.
