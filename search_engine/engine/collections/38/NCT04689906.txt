      within 10 years in one medical center. Patients undergoing interval or incidental
      appendectomies will not be included. The endpoint to be evaluated is complicated appendicitis
      (gangrenous, abscess, perforated). The independent variables will include mainly sex, age,
      patient time (time from symptom onset to registration), hospital time (time from registration
      to operation), and missed diagnosis.
