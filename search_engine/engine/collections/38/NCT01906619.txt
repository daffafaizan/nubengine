    
      The aim of the study is the continuous non-invasive monitoring of

        -  body temperature

        -  respiratory rate

        -  transcutaneous pCO2

        -  heart rate

        -  pulsoxymetric SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) during a febrile illness

        -  in children without febrile seizures and

        -  in children who had suffered a febrile seizure during the actual febrile illness.

      Children will be recruited from the emergency units of the Charit√© University Hospital and a
      large Community Hospital, matched according to age, gender and the cause of their febrile
      illness and their data will enter final analysis if their body temperature rose at least once
      to or above 38.0 degree C and changed more than 1.0 degree C during the observational period.
