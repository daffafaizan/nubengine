      which neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled, parallel (a medical research study comparing the response in
      two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments), multicenter of
      ustekinumab in adolescent participants with moderate to severe psoriasis. The total duration
      of study will be 60 weeks. The study will consists of 2 parts; a Screening period and a
      Treatment period. In treatment period participants will receive either ustekinumab half
      standard dosage, ustekinumab standard dosage or Placebo. Participants receiving ustekinumab
      half standard dosage and ustekinumab standard dosage at Week 0, will receive placebo at Week
      12 and participants receiving placebo at Week 0 will be randomly assigned to either
      ustekinumab half standard dosage or ustekinumab standard dosage Weeks 12, 16, 28, and 40.
      Primarily efficacy will be evaluated by physician's global assessment (PGA) score of cleared
      or minimal disease. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
