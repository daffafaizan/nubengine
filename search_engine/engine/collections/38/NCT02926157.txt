    
      96 community-dwelling older adults with sleep complaints will be randomized into either a
      6-month life style and sleep activation intervention program or a waitlist control group
      (participants in this group will be offered an abbreviated version of the program upon
      completion of the 6 month study). There are 3 measurement sessions to measure cognition,
      sleep, and physical activity at the onset of the study, the midway (3 month) point, and
      completion (at 6 months).
