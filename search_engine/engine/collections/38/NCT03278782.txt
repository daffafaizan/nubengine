      I. Evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with romidepsin. II. Estimate the
      response rate of the combination therapy in refractory or recurrent peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma (PTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate progression free survival (PFS). II. Estimate overall survival (OS). III.
      Estimate complete response (CR) and duration of response (DOR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess activation of T-cells after treatment in peripheral blood and tumor
      microenvironment.

      II. Correlate features of peripheral blood T-cell activation with toxicities, clinical
      response, and PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 8 or day 8 of
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 8 of subsequent cycles and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks.
