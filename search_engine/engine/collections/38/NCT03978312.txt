      Project A: Validation of a NLit tool for UK population.

      NLit tool is a measurement tool developed at Kansas University to measure nutrition health
      literacy. It assesses the following functional literacy skills: numeracy & literacy and the
      following nutrition knowledge fields: macronutrients, food labels, portion sizes, food groups
      and consumer skills.

      This project has two phases:

      Phase A: Nominal consensus groups x 2 - consumer adaptation and tool review for UK use and
      pilot testing of electronic tool.

      Phase B: Testing adapted tool in a group of cancer patients for statistical validation.

      Project B: A survey to measure experiences of getting, using and understanding nutrition
      information during cancer treatment for patients and their friends or family.

      This survey is a combination of validated and unvalidated questions built on models of
      nutrition health literacy. With validated fields being used to evaluate and understand
      responses to unvalidated questions.

      It explores access to nutrition information, self-efficacy, confidence, health care
      infrastructure and support with nutrition information, population demographics, food
      security, sources of nutrition information, perceived practical skills and knowledge base.
