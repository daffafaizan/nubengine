      I. To determine acceptability of non-endoscopic balloon brushing of esophagus.

      II. To demonstrate successful performance of the methylation of vimentin (mVIM) assay in
      balloon brushings from subjects with and without Barrett's Esophagus (BE).

      III. To examine molecular and histological factors that might lead to false negative and
      false positive mVIM assays in BE screening.

      IV. To assay additional methylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biomarkers that might improve
      the sensitivity and specificity of mVIM in balloon brushings.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo non-endoscopic brushing of the esophagus using a non-endoscopic inflatable
      balloon for the esophagus over 30-60 minutes followed by a standard
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

      After completion of study, patients with serious adverse events are followed up until
      resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or
      participation is not the cause.
