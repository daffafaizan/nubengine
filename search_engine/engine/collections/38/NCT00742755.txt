    
      The purpose of this study is to design an intervention to assist Korean American women who
      have been identified with a potential breast abnormality through the Breast Cancer Early
      Detection Program and who have missed their first follow-up appointment (at risk women).
      Intervention activities will include reminder phone calls or home visits by a trained peer
      navigator to explain the importance of follow-up procedures, emotional support, help with
      transportation to follow-up appointments, translations, organizing care for children or
      grandchildren during medical appointments, and other assistance to overcome barriers to
      follow-up identified during the initial phase of the study. The investigators will collect
      extensive process measures including number and type of intervention activities requested and
      delivered in order to estimate the feasibility for institutionalizing intervention
      activities. The investigators will conduct chart reviews and a follow-up survey to evaluate
      the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing adherence to follow-up procedures.
