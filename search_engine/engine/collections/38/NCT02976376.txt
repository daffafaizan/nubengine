    
      Rationale: Smart technology could improve quality of care in patients after acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) with either ST or non-ST elevation.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to measure the effect of a smart technology
      intervention on patients after AMI.

      Study design: The design of the study is a single-center, open randomized-controlled trial.

      Study population: The study population consists of patients who have been discharged from the
      ward of the cardiology department of the Leiden University Medical Center after primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for either ST or non-ST elevation myocardial
      infarction.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to either "The Box" or regular follow-up. Patients
      who have been randomized to The Box will receive a box containing a smartphone compatible
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, a weight scale, an activity tracker and a blood pressure
      monitor. If patients are randomized to The Box, two of the four outpatient clinic visits will
      be replaced by an e-consult, in which a patient does not have to go to the hospital, but
      talks with his or her doctor or nurse practitioner via a secured video connection.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study will be the percentage of
      patients with controlled blood pressure in both groups.
