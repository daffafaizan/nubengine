      was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib
      in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and Sintilimab, an
      programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody, was effective and tolerable in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus. No study has evaluated HAIC plus
      Lenvatinib and Sintilimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm
      study to find out it.
