    
      Patients with congenital TTP have an inherited lack of function or amount of a protein in
      plasma called ADAMTS13, that otherwise is responsible for cleaving large von
      Willebrand-molecules into smaller parts. The patients suffer recurrent attacks of clotting of
      small blood vessels, that can cause damage to major organs, including the central nervous
      system. Acute attacks can be treated successfully with infusions of human plasma, and some
      patients also receive regular plasma therapy for prevention of acute attacks. A small group
      of patients receive preventive plasma infusions twice or more weekly, indicating a much
      higher need for plasma than what is otherwise recommended for preventive therapy. Do these
      patients have an ongoing activity of their disease despite a stimulus? Or a higher turn-over
      of transfused ADAMTS13? Have these patients developed antibodies against transfused ADAMTS13?
      Are any symptoms correlated with signs of disease activity?
