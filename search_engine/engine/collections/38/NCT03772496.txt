      staging, prognosis and follow-up in several types of cancers and some mRNA markers are
      helpful in differentiating patients with benign versus malignant thyroid disease. However,
      the lack of sensitivity and specificity of mRNA measurements restricted their clinical
      application. The aim of this study is to see if optimizing test method combined with
      ultrasound can get similar diagnostic performance. 200 patients with thyroid nodules (â‰¤2cm)
      which need to undergo FNAB will be enrolled in four centers of northern China. Patients will
      simultaneously undergo CTCs tests and FNAB. And following treatments will be performed
      according to the previous standard. Allowed by the patients, the investigators will obtain
      10ml peripheral blood samples from the participants to make a CTCs test before any FNAB. The
      primary end point is the pathologically confirmed benign versus malignant thyroid disease,
      which including surgical pathology and diagnostic results of FNAB.
