      Before, correcting only prolapsed part, now, we can measure anatomical and functional results
      more objectively by using different tool such us MRI, perineal ultrasonography, PISQ-12,
      IIQ-7 (Incontinence impact questionnaire). Hence pelvic organ prolapse surgery is important
      in terms of anatomic and functional results. Unilateral abdominal sacral hysteropexy can put
      vaginal axis to right side slightly. Therefore investigators hypothesized that bilateral
      sacral hysteropexy which mimic sacrouterine ligament can be more suitable in terms of
      anatomic results.
