    
      This is an investigator-initiated multicentre non-randomized prospective interventional trial
      to validate the performance of a novel state-of-the-art computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool
      in polyp detection implemented as second observer during routine diagnostic colonoscopy and
      to evaluate its feasibility in daily endoscopy. Patients referred for a screening
      surveillance or therapeutic colonoscopy will undergo a colonoscopy performed by an
      endoscopist with moderate to high adenoma detection rate (ADR > 20% and < 50%) while a second
      observer will follow the procedure on a bedside AI-tool to count the number of detections
      made by the AI system and categorize the results into positive or negative results as follows
      (1) true positive, (2) false negative, (3) other positive and (4) obvious false positive.
      When a doubtful detection is made by the AI-system, the second observer will ask to
      re-evaluate the indicated region. When the detection is clear, the endoscopist and second
      observer do not communicate. The entire procedure is recorded.
