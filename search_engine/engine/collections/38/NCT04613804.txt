      advanced NSCLC, but most patients experience disease progression after 4 to 6 months. To
      extend the efficacy of first-line treatment, maintenance therapy is a logical clinical option
      for patients who are effective after 4 to 6 cycles of standard treatment. There is currently
      no standard regimen for maintenance treatment of NSCLC. We evaluated the effectiveness and
      safety of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (Toripalimab injection) followed by maintenance
      therapy in advanced NSCLC that was effective in the first-line standard regimen.Thereby
      improving the survival prognosis of advanced NSCLC.
