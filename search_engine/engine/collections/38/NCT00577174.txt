      compared to non-obese children. Determine whether children with pediatric obesity have
      impaired mitochondrial function based on 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy when compared to
      healthy non-obese control children.Examine the relationship between mitochondrial function
      and insulin resistance in obese and non-obese children. Determine the impact of pubertal
      stage on mitochondrial function in obese and non-obese children.

      Aim II:A prospective evaluation to determine in a longitudinal cohort study the timing and
      relationship of mitochondrial dysfunction to the development of insulin resistance in
      prepubertal/early pubertal obese children compared to prepubertal/early pubertal non-obese
      children. Determine in a longitudinal cohort study if obese children with mitochondrial
      dysfunction develop greater insulin resistance and/or impaired glucose tolerance at an
      earlier time point. Evaluate the relationship of obesity, timing of puberty and related
      changes in hormone levels to mitochondrial function and the development of insulin resistance
      and/or impaired glucose tolerance in longitudinal analyses.
