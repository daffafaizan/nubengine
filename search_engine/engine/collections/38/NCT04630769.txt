      expressing high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 (FT516). Enoblituzumab is an Fc-optimized
      monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 which is highly expressed on ovarian cancer. Based on
      data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of
      CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product
      containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK
      cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that
      binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely
      expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the
      immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with
      enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer.
