      a geographically targeted program led by salaried CHWs from three Medicaid health plans in
      collaboration with the Detroit Health Department and Joy Southfield Community Development
      Corporation. Beneficiaries who reside in the Cody Rouge neighborhood and had more than 3
      Emergency Department (ED) visits or at least 1 ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalization in
      the prior 12 months are randomized to the CHW program or to usual outreach from the health
      plans. CHWs reach out to eligible beneficiaries to provide a comprehensive assessment of
      health, behavioral, and social needs; link them to needed resources; and provide necessary
      follow-up. At 12- month follow up, health plan claims data on ED visits, ambulatory
      care-sensitive hospitalizations, primary care visits and all related costs will be compared
      between participants who participated in this program compared with other participants who
      would have been eligible but were not offered the program (with no effort to contact them).

      The investigators hypothesize that patients enrolled in the CHW intervention will experience
      a reduction in acute care usage resulting in cost savings compared to those receiving usual
      health plan CHW outreach. This study is among the first to evaluate the impact on health care
      utilization of augmented services delivered by health plan CHWs for high-utilizing health
      plan members. This study will provide important information on the sustainability of future
      health plan CHW programs and provide insights into effective implementation of such programs.
