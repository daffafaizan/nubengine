      and epigenetic profiles in cord blood leukocytes will be improved in the very-low energy diet
      (VLED) group compared to standard practice nutrition counseling and support (SOC) group and
      approach the profiles found in normal weight (LEAN) individuals. We will relate these changes
      to the changes in the offspring clinical profiles. With these data in hand, we will develop a
      model to understand the potential molecular markers associated with offspring size and
      adiposity at birth, risk factors for later onset non-communicable diseases. We will use these
      insights to define, adopt and implement future interventions that mitigate the downstream
      risk of adiposity and cardiometabolic diseases.
