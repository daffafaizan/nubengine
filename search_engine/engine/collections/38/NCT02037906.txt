      harm to kidney tissue. This clinical trial will be conducted at a tertiary care university
      hospital. All patients referred to the SWL unit will be evaluated for eligibility to be
      randomized. Randomization process "complete" or "unrestricted" randomization was used to
      allocate patients to the three arms of the clinical trial where one patient was randomly
      assigned to one of the three arms blindly.
