      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to
      current and future pandemics.

      This study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center, exploratory, natural
      history study to collect samples and data from individuals to identify the presence and rate
      of development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in North Carolina.
