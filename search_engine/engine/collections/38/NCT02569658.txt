      moderate to significant blood loss that can lead to transfusions. Average estimated blood
      loss has been reported in the range of 354 to 361 mL intraoperatively, not accounting for
      additional postoperative blood loss postoperatively in surgical drains. Transfusion rates
      have been reported to range from 2.4% to 9.5% in recent studies, with rates over 30% for
      revision cases. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that is an
      established method of reducing blood loss and transfusion requirement for patients undergoing
      total hip and knee arthroplasty. TXA can be administered intravenously, topically
      (intraarticularly), or orally, with most available literature addressing intravenous and
      topical administration. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the total hip and knee
      arthroplasty literature demonstrate approximately a 30% decrease in blood loss and 50%
      decrease in transfusion rate with topical or intravenous administration of TXA compared to
      placebo. Moreover, the literature demonstrates no increased rate of thromboembolic or other
      complications associated with TXA administration for hip and knee arthroplasty.

      Despite proven efficacy in the hip and knee arthroplasty literature, there have been no
      studies analyzing the ability of TXA to reduce blood loss and transfusion rate following TSA.

      Purpose of the study is to compare intravenous Tranexamic Acid (TXA) versus normal saline
      placebo to determine whether or not TXA administration reduces blood loss, decrease in
      hemoglobin, and rate of transfusions following anatomic and reverse total shoulder
      arthroplasty (TSA) surgeries. With the hypothesis that intravenous TXA will reduce blood loss
      following TSA.
