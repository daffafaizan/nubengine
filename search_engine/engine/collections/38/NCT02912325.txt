    
      The trial is designed as a multicenter, open label, non-comparative, 6 months, pilot study.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FaseMetS 速 administered for 6 months
      treatment combined with a health management plan in reducing the serum lipidemic profile
      (this includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, small density LDL
      particles, triglycerides, serum glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c), insulin, and
      pro-insulin, HOMA index, uric acid, body mass index (BMI), creatine phosphokinase) in
      patients diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome and with mild to moderate Hypercholesterolemia.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to evaluate the efficacy in reducing the serum lipidemic profile after a period of 3
           months of FaseMetS 速 速 treatment;

        -  to evaluate the safety of FaseMetS 速 treatment by recording AE/SAE (with particular
           regards for gastrointestinal symptoms);

        -  improvement of blood clinical laboratory parameters;

        -  improvement of weight control systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure
           control
