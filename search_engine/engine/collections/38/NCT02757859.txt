      I. Overall survival (OS) (18 to 27 months after resection).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Disease free survival (DFS). II. Complication rate. III. Site of first-recurrence (by
      site, and distant vs. local). IV. Clearance of malignant cells pre vs. post-lavage.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      Arm I (EIPL-S) extensive intraoperative peritoneal saline lavage: Patients undergo
      pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy. Immediately after
      removal of tumor, patients receive extensive intraoperative peritoneal saline (EIPL-S) lavage
      10 times over 15 minutes.

      Arm II (EIPL-D) extensive intraoperative peritoneal distilled water lavage: Patients undergo
      pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy. Immediately after
      removal of tumor, patients receive extensive intraoperative peritoneal distilled water
      (EIPL-D) lavage 10 times over 15 minutes.

      Arm III (NO LAVAGE): Patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or
      total pancreatectomy with no extensive lavage after removal of tumor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
