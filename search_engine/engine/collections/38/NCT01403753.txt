      studies have considered other "non-hedonic" beliefs about foods. In adults there is emerging
      evidence that expectations about the satiating properties of foods are an important
      determinant of meal size, and that these beliefs are learned over time.

      In the current study, we measured and quantified children's 'expected satiation' across
      energy-dense snack foods using a psychophysical technique known as method of adjustment.
      Participants changed a comparison-food portion (pasta and tomato sauce) to match the
      satiation that they expected from a snack food. We predicted that children who were
      especially familiar with snack foods would expect them to generate greater satiation, and
      that children who were unfamiliar would match expected satiation based on the physical
      characteristics (perceived volume) of the foods.

      In our study, seventy 11- to 12-year-old children completed computerised measures of expected
      satiation, perceived volume, familiarity, and liking across six snack foods. Our analyses
      focused on the associations between these measures. This approach enabled us to establish
      differences in healthy behaviours that are evident across individuals.
