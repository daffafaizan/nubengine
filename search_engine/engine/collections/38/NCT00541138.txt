        -  To evaluate the systemic and CNS response rates and progression-free and overall
           survival of patients with epithelial cancer and brain metastases treated with tamoxifen
           citrate, topotecan hydrochloride, and carboplatin.

        -  To evaluate the response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients with recurrent primary glial tumors treated with this regimen.

        -  To further assess the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

        -  To further evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan hydrochloride and tamoxifen
           citrate using paired specimens of cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (epithelial CNS metastases vs recurrent
      glial tumors).

      Patients receive topotecan IV on days 1-3 (72 hours), carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day
      4, and oral tamoxifen twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)
      may be treated for 2 additional courses after documentation of CR.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then periodically after the first
      dose of topotecan to obtain plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements of topotecan and
      tamoxifen. Some patients may also undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection to assess peak
      CSF levels of topotecan and tamoxifen during course 1.
