      However, there is a lack of benefit of therapies that tried to neutralize these mediators.

      Methotrexate has adenosine-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis and
      psoriasis. Methotrexate limits infarct size via this adenosine-dependent mechanisms in heart
      of dogs (J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2004 Apr;43(4):574-9). A recent trial showed that this drug
      reduced proinflammatory mediators in patients with heart failure (Am Heart J. 2006
      Jan;151(1):62-8).

      These data suggest that methotrexate may improve physical capacity in patients ischemic heart
      failure reducing inflammation, but a randomized clinical trial is necessary to prove it.
