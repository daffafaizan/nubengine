      In order to evaluate an appropriate role for chiropractic in managing these problems in the
      population, this pilot cohort study will take multiple measurements, both self-reported and
      functional, on a sample of older adults with chronic spine-related pain who are recruited
      from the local community and receive chiropractic care in the Cleveland Chiropractic College
      health center over a four-week period.
