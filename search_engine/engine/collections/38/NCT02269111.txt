      I. To correlate pre-treatment measures of biophysical parameters in metastases-obtained using
      advanced, quantitative MRI techniques in patients receiving standard-of-care (SOC) therapy
      for 1-4 brain metastases-with treatment-induced changes in lesion size, time-to-progression
      (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hybrid 3 Tesla MRI examination that includes standard MRI sequences,
      diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), and combined
      dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI/dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI at baseline.
