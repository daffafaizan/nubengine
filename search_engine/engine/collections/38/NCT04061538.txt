      issue, being between the main causes of morbidity and mortality, with an important load for
      the health systems. Consequently, there exists a necessity for the implementation of
      alternate strategies for this condition, nutrition being one of the pillars to strengthen.

      reduction and relapse. The recommendation of including zinc in the treatment of ADD is not
      part of the Mexican normativity. The evaluation of the efficacy of zinc administration in
      Mexican children is insufficient and a program or national strategy for zinc treatment does
      not exist.
