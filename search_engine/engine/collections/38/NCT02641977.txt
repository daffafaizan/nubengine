    
      Objective. 30-year follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with methotrexate
      (MTX) in the 1980s to analyze the association of the degree of response to MTX with long-term
      mortality.

      Methods. In this observational cohort study, 271 RA patients who had started treatment with
      MTX between 1980 and 1987 were included (mean age 58 years, mean disease duration 8.5 years).
      One year after baseline, the treatment response to MTX was evaluated. Responders were defined
      as patients with at least 20% improvement. Thereafter, assessments were performed at 10 and
      18 years after baseline. This re-evaluation was done to provide the data after 30 years of
      follow-up. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) are calculated, Cox regression and logistic
      regression are performed.
