      I. To evaluate in a phase II study the efficacy (the radiographic assessment of disease
      status after 2 cycles of therapy) of a combination of docetaxel and capecitabine in subjects
      with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are not candidates for surgery
      or radiation therapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety and toxicities of docetaxel and capecitabine in subjects with
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      III. To descriptively examine the effects of the combination of docetaxel and capecitabine on
      the quality of life of subjects with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and capecitabine orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter.
