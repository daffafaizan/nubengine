      with greater precision and accuracy than traditional frame-based and frameless methods. While
      the ROSA has never been used for the placement of intra-hemorrhage catheters, prior
      applications such as brain biopsies and abscess drainage represent similar surgical
      procedures which require the same planning, precision, and surgical technique. At the very
      least, ROSA offers an accurate image guided approach to deep lesions that should be
      comparable to competitive image guided platforms. At best, ROSA offers superior trajectory
      planning software, greater ease in planning multiple trajectories to large, irregular clots,
      and the potential for robot aided navigation into and out of the hematoma which is the
      greatest source of human error in these cases. For instance, the procedure often requires
      advancement of a larger aspiration catheter, slow aspiration as the catheter is withdrawn,
      and then re-advancement of a smaller catheter into the hematoma, which is left in place. The
      ability to advance and remove catheters in a fixed trajectory with robotic assistance may
      represent the greatest advantage of ROSA.
