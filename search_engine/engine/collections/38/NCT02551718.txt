      I. To test patient cells in a high throughput assay against individual drugs and drug
      combinations within 21 days to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.

      II. To test gene expression that reveals activation of druggable pathways or mutations in
      genes that confer susceptibility to specific agents may also be considered in choice of
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the response to the chosen therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Leukemia cells obtained from blood or bone marrow are analyzed for sensitivity to both
      individual drugs and drug combinations via high throughput chemotherapy sensitivity assay and
      next generation sequencing assays. Doctors will then recommend chemotherapy regimens based on
      the results.

      After completion of the chemotherapy regimen, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks for
      response, and then every 3 months for 2 years for duration of response and survival.
