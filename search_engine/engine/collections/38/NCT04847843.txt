    
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of MORE on weight loss maintenance.

      Hypothesis:

      MORE will result in less weight regain compared to CON after the 8-week intervention, and
      benefits will be sustained after 6-month of follow-up.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Determine the effect of MORE on reward-related behavioral processes (e.g., food cravings) and
      ad libitum energy intake.

      Hypothesis:

      MORE group will demonstrate changes in eating behaviors and energy intake associated with
      preventing weight regain compared to CON immediately after MORE and after 6-months of
