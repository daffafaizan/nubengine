    
      The MTD of Vorinostat in the treatment of Alzheimer's patients is to be determined by using
      an open, non-randomized, multicentric dose-finding study with adaptive design. This Clinical
      Trial will take place in 2 parts.

      The first part will be performed as a dose escalation part in cohorts of three subjects.
      Possible dosages will be: one, two, three or four capsules (100 mg per capsule) once per day.
      The first cohort receives a dose of 100 mg per day. After the treatment, a Vorinostat-free
      follow-up phase will take place. For the following cohorts, dose increases, a repetition of
      the previous dose or a dose reduction are possible.

      After the dose escalation with a determination of the MTD, a dosage confirmation is carried
      out with additional subjects. The subjects are given a dose of Vorinostat of MTD over 4 weeks
      followed by a Vorinostat-free follow-up phase.
