      metastases. However, treatment strategy which rely on Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) has
      becoming popular in Japan. It is not well understood if the Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy
      (WBRT) combined with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) resulted in improvements in survival,
      brain tumor control, functional preservation rate, and frequency of neurologic death. In orer
      to determine the role of WBRT, we conducted prospective randomized trial between WBRT+SRS and
      SRS-alone for 1-4 brain metastatic patients.
