      bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy before surgery may
      achieve promising improvements in pCR rates, we designed this Phase II study in patients with
      T3/4 or N1/2 loco-regionally advanced rectum cancer, to examine the efficacy and safety of
      the addition of bevacizumab to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with
      pre-operative radiation.
