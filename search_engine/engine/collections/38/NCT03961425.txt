      topic of discussion since the introduction of the heart-lung machine, and flooding the
      surgical field with CO2, which is heavier than Azote and Oxygen but over ten times more
      soluble seems a promising technique to minimize the presence of air microemboli. However very
      few studies have been conducted to ascertain what is the most efficient way to administer
      this treatment, or even of this treatment really impacts deairing time and clinical
      neurological events.

      This study aims at comparing the use of CO2 (administered in two different ways: a simple
      cannula, which might be prone to emulsioning air and CO2 not reaching a complete CO2
      saturation and a specific commercial diffuser which states promises complete filed
      saturation) to the no-CO2 standard approach.

      The primary end point will be Time to Complete deairing as measured by intraoperative
      transesophageal echo while the secondary end point will be the incidence of clinical
      neurological events the day after the operation.
