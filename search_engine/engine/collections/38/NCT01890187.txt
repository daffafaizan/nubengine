      consented subjects to determine further participation in the study. The study will be divided
      into two phases. In Phase 1, the inter-device variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of
      illumination areas under the RPE will be determined. In Phase 2, the inter-operator
      variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of illumination areas under the RPE will be
      determined. In each of these phases, the Macular Cube 200 x 200 scan and the Macular Cube 512
      x 128 scan will be evaluated.
