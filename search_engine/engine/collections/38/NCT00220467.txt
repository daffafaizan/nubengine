      for older adults with mild cognitive impairment, 2) to evaluate whether change in insulin
      sensitivity predicts cognitive performance for subjects in the aerobic exercise group, and 3)
      to relate exercise effects on insulin sensitivity and cognition to growth factor expression,
      inflammatory markers, catecholamines, beta-amyloid, and body-fat composition. Using a
      randomized controlled parallel group design, 40 sedentary older adults diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment will participate in a 6-month supervised protocol of either aerobic
      exercise or stretching. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, and
      months 3 and 6. Before and after the 6-month intervention, insulin sensitivity (via
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), maximum aerobic capacity (via respiratory gas exchange
      and cardiopulmonary fitness measures), and body fat composition (via DEXA scan) and
      distribution (via CT scan) will be assessed for all subjects. The results of this study may
      provide support for a relatively simple and inexpensive treatment strategy that specifically
      targets many of the health factors that directly influence risk of cognitive decline for
      older adults.
