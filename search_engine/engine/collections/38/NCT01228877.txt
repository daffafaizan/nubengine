      groups (n=8 per group) of healthy, non-resistance trained adult men and women (age 25-55
      years). Our aim is to determine if hip adduction and abduction resistance exercise is more
      effective than squat and deadlift exercise with respect to changes in the whole bone strength
      and density of the proximal femur and spine.

      Group A will do only hip adduction and abduction exercises. Group B will do only squat and
      deadlift exercise Group C will do a combination of hip adduction and abduction and squat and
      deadlift exercise

      Subjects will be imaged with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) of the proximal femur and
      spine, pre-training and post-training, to determine changes in spinal bone density and
      proximal femoral bone density and strength.

      Serum assays of bone formation (osteocalcin) and bone resorption (serum CTX type I) will be
      performed four times during the study at 4 week intervals.
