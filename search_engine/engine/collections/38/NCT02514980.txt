      common birth anomaly, second only to clubfoot [Strong & Buckmiller 2001]. Cleft lip surgery
      is associated with appreciable postoperative pain in children Alleviation of postoperative
      pain is important in these patients. The fear of respiratory depression using opioids has
      renewed the interest in regional anesthesia to provide safe and effective postoperative
      analgesia. Infra-orbital nerve block has been advocated as a suitable local analgesic
      technique for cleft lip surgery and superficial surgery on the mid face [Morton 2004, Takmaz
      et al. 2009, Rajesh et al. 2011, Jindal et al. 2011].The infra-orbital nerve supplies the
      upper lip, lower eyelid, and adjacent skin of the cheek and nose. Unilateral or bilateral
      infra-orbital nerve block has been performed with a very high success rate.

      The investigators designed this study to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of adding
      ketamine to bupivacaine in bilateral infra-orbital nerve block for relief of pain
      postoperatively following repair of cleft lip in children less than two years of age.
