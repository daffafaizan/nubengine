      Parkinson's disease (PD). The first postural trunk deviation in PD was first described by
      James Parkinson himself and recognized as stooped simian appearance, with flexion of the hips
      and knees, and rounding of the shoulders. Although the stooped posture is a typical feature,
      more severe spinal misalignment (and deformities) can affect people with PD. These postural
      deformities include Pisa syndrome (PS), camptocormia (CP), antecollis (AC), scoliosis (S) and
      striatal deformities related to hand (striatal hand) and/or toes (striatal toes). The
      prevalence of these postural deformities is variable because several diagnostic criteria have
      been used to characterize each deformity. Recently, a consensus of diagnostic criteria has
      been reached in literature permitting us to better mapping the presence of these deformities
      in people with PD.
