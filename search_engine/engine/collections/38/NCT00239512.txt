      infants. Delayed closure of PDA can impaired renal function with oligouria.The complications
      are correlated with the serum concentration of indomethacin, because the safe therapeutic
      range of serum concentration of indomethacin is very narrow. Therefore, if we could try
      another way such as Ibuprofen to close the PDA, then we can prevent more complications from
      indomethacin. We expect that, by using this treatment regimen according to the
      echocardiographic flow patterns, a high PDA closure rate can be achieved and the survival of
      premature infants may be increased.
