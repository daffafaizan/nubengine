      provides an unprecedented opportunity to implement a comprehensive cervical cancer screening
      and treatment program for women who, by virtue of having HIV, are at significant risk for
      cervical disease. Unfortunately, even if screening is offered free of charge to millions of
      women living with HIV, it is unclear which treatment modality for pre-cancerous cervical
      lesions will be most effective since HIV appears to affect outcomes of treatment by
      increasing the recurrence and severity of cervical disease. Cervical treatment may also
      increase shedding of HIV from the cervix which may put discordant couples at risk and
      possibly spread HIV more widely. This study proposes to randomize HIV-positive women with
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (CIN 2 and 3) to cryotherapy vs. loop
      electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and measure the recurrence of cervical disease in
      each group over 2-years of follow-up as well as HIV shedding from the cervix for 6 weeks
      after treatment.

      Our hypothesis is that compared to cryotherapy, LEEP is significantly more likely to prevent
      recurrence of cervical lesions over 2 years of follow-up and less likely to cause shedding of
      HIV-1 from the cervix over 3 weeks of follow-up.
