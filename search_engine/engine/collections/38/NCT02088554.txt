      each site following a common protocol. A maximum of 1300 subjects will be implanted at a
      maximum of 40 sites in the US, Europe and Canada. The trial will include male and female
      patients of legal age to provide informed consent in the country where they enroll in the
      trial, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic
      aortic valve. Subjects will be followed out to 5 years and select sites will follow subjects
      out to 12 years. Enrollment is currently open to capture additional data sets for the size
      29mm valve only.
