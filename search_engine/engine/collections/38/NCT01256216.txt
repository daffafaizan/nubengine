    
      The purpose of this prospective clinical data-collection is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of the Vanguard® Knee System using Signature™ Custom Guides and Computer
      Assisted Surgery.

      FDA has cleared the Vanguard Knee via premarket notification 510(k) K023546, K033489, and
      K050222. FDA has cleared the software for the Signature™ Custom Guides via premarket
      notification 510(k) K073449. The data gathered will be collated and used to provide feedback
      to design engineers, support marketing efforts, answer potential questions from reimbursement
      agencies, and will serve as a part of Biomet's Post Market Surveillance System.

      Function will be assessed through the Knee Society Score. Survivorship will be documented by
      asking the surgeon to document revisions and complications.
