    
      -  Assess the safety and tolerance of a weekly MEDI 522 regimen in patients with
           irinotecan-refractory advanced CRC.

        -  Determine a Phase II recommended dose based on acceptable dose-limiting toxicity. Other
           considerations such as pharmacokinetic parameters may also be factored into the
           determination of a Phase II dose.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to:

        -  Assess any antitumor activity of MEDI-522 in this patient population.
