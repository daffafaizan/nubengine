      heparin dose of 300 IU / kg to achieve an ACT (activating clotting time) target more than 400
      seconds. This empirical approach based on patient weight date from the 1960's and does not
      take into account materials improvement and different individual sensitivities; several
      studies have demonstrated than a result at least as effective could be obtained with heparin
      lower doses, and without increasing thromboembolic morbid events for patients.

      Patients are randomly assigned into one of 2 groups one day before surgery. First group
      receive unfractionated heparin conventional dose during the MECC, second group receive half
      of the conventional dose. All surgery is performed by the same team and using same equipment.
      Regular blood tests are carried out before, during and after surgery. Blood loss, transfusion
      needs, rhythm disorders, stay duration in intensive care and total hospitalization length is
      finally reported. The follow-up period through the 30th postoperative day.
