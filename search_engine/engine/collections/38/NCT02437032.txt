      is exposed to during the follicular phase. The role of gonadotropins has been especially
      important in improving the efficiency of in vitro fertilization. Several studies comparing
      the use of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone
      (rFSH) have found significant differences in the endocrinological profile and the follicular
      dynamics. These differences have been related to the human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG)-driven luteinizing hormone (LH) activity added to hMG. Moreover, differences in the
      proportion of acid residues in FSH molecules should be considered.

      On the other hand, the main physiological regulatory hormones of follicular survival are the
      gonadotropins. Suppression of serum gonadotropins leads to massive apoptosis of granulosa
      cells in developing follicles resulting in atresia; whereas, gonadotropin treatment of early
      antral and pre-ovulatory follicles prevents this unplanned apoptosis. However, studies using
      cultured rat granulosa cells have shown that treatments with FSH or LH/hCG are ineffective in
      preventing spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting neighboring theca cells and local factors
      produced in the ovary are important for regulation of follicle growth and atresia.
