    
      Part 1 of the study will be randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, and conducted in
      parallel for the 2 lower dose levels (Part 1a) followed by an unblinded safety review and
      escalation to the highest dose (Part 1b) dependent on the outcome of the safety review.

      Part 1a will consist of 30 participants who will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive 1 of the 2
      lower AZD1402 dry power inhaler (DPI) doses (Dose 1 or Dose 2) or placebo in parallel. Part
      1b will consist of 15 participants who will be randomised 2:1 to receive the highest AZD1402
      DPI dose (Dose 3) or placebo.

      Part 1a Lead-in Cohort

        -  AZD1402 Dose 1

        -  AZD1402 Dose 2

        -  Placebo

      Part 1b Lead-in Cohort

        -  AZD1402 Dose 3

        -  Placebo

      Part 2 will be randomised, double blind, placebo controlled and will include 360 participants
      to evaluate 3 inhaled dose levels of AZD1402 versus placebo.

      Part 2a, which includes the 2 lower dose levels (Dose 1 and Dose 2) will be started in
      parallel after the unblinded safety review for Part 1a. The higher dose of Dose 3 (Part 2b)
      will be included in Part 2 following the unblinded review of Part 1b, depending on the
      outcome of the safety review. Once Part 2b starts, all 3 dose levels (and placebo) will run
      in parallel. Part 2 will include:

        -  AZD1402 Dose 1

        -  AZD1402 Dose 2

        -  AZD1402 Dose 3

        -  Placebo
