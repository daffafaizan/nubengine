      study the possibility after genomic amplification to find, three to 12 months after genetic
      sequences of the infectious agent in the dental calculus of the person. The people will be
      recruited according to a large panel of infectious agent (gram + and gram bacterium,
      mycobacteria, parasite, fungus, DNA, RNA or retrovirus) and, of course, the presence of
      dental calculus.
