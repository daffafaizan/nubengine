      lower the pressure, the more reflux symptoms. This pressure can be augmented with deep
      abdominal breathing. This can be detected during esophageal manometry, when a pressure
      catheter is placed into the esophagus. Manometry is routinely done for swallowing disorders.

      This study will take place just after a routine manometry test, when the subject still has
      the catheter in place. All that is required for the research portion is to observe manometry
      readings while they breathe, then when they deep breath, then breathe after they have been
      cued or coached to deep abdominal breathing. This is done in sequence to establish how
      quickly this pressure can be improved.

      This coached breathing is then prescribed as a routine exercise and long term follow up
      performed via phone to see how their reflux symptoms have responded.
