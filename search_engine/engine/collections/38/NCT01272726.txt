    
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 10-12% of school-aged
      children in the United States, making it one of the most common psychiatric disorders in
      children. It is characterized as inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, which has
      persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with
      developmental level (DSM-IV-TR). ADHD is a non-fluctuating illness unlike many other
      psychiatric co-morbid conditions.
