      functional visual outcomes) of three doses of GT005 administered as a single subretinal
      injection in genetically defined subjects with Macular Atrophy due to Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD). Following consent, subjects will undergo a number of ophthalmic and
      clinical assessments to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study. Once eligibility is
      confirmed, subjects will be enrolled, receive treatment, and will be followed for 48 weeks.
