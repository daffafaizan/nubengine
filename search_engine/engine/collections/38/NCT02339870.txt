      I. To test whether one, or both, types of expressive writing impact spouses of cancer
      survivors' reported emotional wellbeing and reported ability to provide comfort as compared
      to a control group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms or assigned to a control arm.

      ARM I (EXPRESSIVE DISCLOSURE): Participants complete an anonymous 20 minute writing exercise
      at home on their computer once per week for 2 weeks (days 2, 9, and 16 for a total of 3
      sessions). Participants write about their emotions pertaining to managing and providing care
      for the cancer patient.

      ARM II (BENEFIT FINDING): Participants complete an anonymous 20 minute writing exercise at
      home on their computer once per week for 2 weeks (days 2, 9, and 16 for a total of 3
      sessions). Participants write about any benefits that have arisen because of the cancer
      diagnosis.

      ARM III (CONTROL): Participants complete an anonymous 20 minute writing exercise at home on
      their computer once per week for 2 weeks (days 2, 9, and 16 for a total of 3 sessions).
      Participants write about an emotionally neutral topic.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at day 17.
