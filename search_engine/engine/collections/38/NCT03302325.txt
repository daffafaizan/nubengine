      determine how cancer cells in patients react to treatment. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic
      acid. DNA contains information that determines in part the traits, such as eye color, height,
      or disease risk, that are passed on from parent to child. This reaction will be measured by
      studying patient blood that will be collected before and during treatment until there is
      disease progression.
