    
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a recently developed procedure whereby a
      prosthetic aortic valve is implanted percutaneously, and the procedure has demonstrated
      promising results in high risk surgical populations.

      TAVI currently requires the use of large bore (18-26F) catheter delivery systems that are
      often difficult to deliver to over the aortic arch to the aortic annulus. Available data
      indicate that TAVI is associated with a 4-12% procedural stroke rate and approximately 10%
      procedural mortality. It has been suggested that these strokes are most likely caused by the
      liberation of embolic debris either when the TAVI delivery catheter is advanced over the
      aortic arch or during the actual valve deployment. Given this situation, the availability of
      devices able to protect both hemispheres of the brain from potentially embolic debris during
      the TAVI procedure is an emerging clinical need.

      Claret Medical has developed a technology to provide protection to the neurovascular system
      during TAVI and other valve repair procedures.
