      next-generation-sequencing (NGS) -based methods in the routine molecular genetic diagnosis of
      genetic diseases.The aim of the retrospective data analysis is to create a solid data basis
      for further discussion regarding the development and mapping of diagnostic algorithms and
      subsequent supply routes. For the genome data, this evaluation is to be expanded to include
      the evaluation of the Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in the sense of an additional finding.
