      blood of healthy young and old participants as well as COVID-19 recovered. We will also
      measure general health factors using blood, saliva and urine samples. By analyzing the
      frequency, differentiation, and expansion of these SARS-CoV-2 recognizing CD8 T cells, we
      hope to shed light into the T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its change with age and
      post-infection.

      To identify SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in humans, and to determine their quantity and
      quality in recovered COVID-19 patients.
