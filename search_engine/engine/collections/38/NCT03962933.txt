      tumors, has the highest recurrence rate of all cancers, with around 70% of the patients
      developing local recurrences, despite elaborated treatments. Uromonitor is a completely
      Non-Invasive urine based IVD diagnosis test. ItÂ´s able to detect Non-muscle invasive bladder
      cancer with 100% sensitivity and 97,3 % specificity. Regardless of Tumor stage and grade
      (unlike Cytology). The rate of Uromonitor false positives (2,3%) is actually lower than the
      rate of Cystoscopy false positives (3,5%).

      Hypothesis:

      The study aims at evaluating the potential clinical impact of a highly sensitive urinary
      marker, Uromonitor, regarding possible reduction in number of cystoscopies.

      We hypothesize that the use of a sensitive urinary marker regarding recurrent tumor will
      enable us to reduce the number of follow-up cystoscopies without risk of delaying diagnosis
      of recurrence and progression cystoscopies compared to flexible cystoscopy alone.

      We hypothesize that number of tumors missed at follow-up cystoscopy alone or urinary marker
      alone is identical or in favor of a sensitive urinary marker that can detect sub-visible
      lesions and the examinations combined identify all tumor recurrences.

      Moreover, we hypothesize that tumors missed at follow-up at a given time point are very small
      and will be identified at next follow-up without increasing the risk of progression and that
      regular follow-up with cystoscopy alone therefore can be replaced by follow-up with a
      sensitive urinary biomarker alone - where cystoscopy only is performed if the biomarker is
      positive.
