    
      After an first medical visit to ensure that the adolescents have the ability to complete the
      whole study, the participants will have to complete several clinical examinations:

        -  anthropometric measurements

        -  Body composition assessed by DXA

        -  Maximal aerobic test

        -  Blood samples (appetite-regulating hormones)

        -  daily energy intake assessment during a 24h intake exploration.

      The adolescents recruited will then be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention
      groups:

      - High Intensity program or moderate intensity program. Those two physical activity programs
      will last 4-months and will be composed of 3 to 4 exercise sessions per week. The High
      intensity program will consists in High intensity interval exercises starting at 70% of the
      adolescents' capacities at the beginning to end around 95%. The moderate intensity program
      will propose continuous exercises set between 50-65% VO2max.

      No energy intake intervention will be performed.

      By the end of the 4-months intervention, all the clinical examinations performed before the
      intervention will be repeated.
