      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Some triple-negative breast cancers show expression of the Rb protein and are referred to as
      "Rb-positive." The Rb protein is important because it controls the way that cancer cells
      divide and grow. Drugs like abemaciclib work by changing the way that Rb functions. This can
      potentially stop cancer cells from dividing, and can also potentially lead to cancer cell
      death.

      In this research study, the investigators are are looking to see how safe abemaciclib is and
      how well it will work to help people with triple-negative breast cancer that is Rb-positive.
