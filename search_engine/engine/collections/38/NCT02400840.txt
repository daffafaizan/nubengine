      transplantation. It can lead to multiple cardiac injuries and sometimes to patient's death.
      Currently, acute heart graft rejection screening is based on invasive strategies. Gold
      standard is represented by endomyocardial biopsies which provide side effects risk, rare but
      potentially fatal for the recipient. Cardiac MRI is an imaging tool recently used in
      cardiology. It is a non-invasive without any X-Ray exposition method well adapted to assess
      cardiac function and cardiac muscle composition. Cardiac MRI is probably a great tool to help
      the screening of acute heart allograft rejection, by detecting changes in myocardium
      structure. MRI validation as a screening tool for heart allograft rejection detection could
      help to reduce endomyocardial biopsies realised after orthotopic heart transplantation.
