      balance and health to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions of the
      individual.Due to its therapeutic effects, yoga can be considered as an alternative approach
      for those with rheumatic disease. Because of Covid-19, which has changed the world and the
      lifestyle of people, tele-yoga practice can be considered as an alternative instead of
      traditional face-to-face yoga classes. The use of online platforms provides a good
      environment for yoga training at home. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      tele-yoga on functional level, disease activity, spinal mobility, balance, sleep quality,
      depression, mindfulness and quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

      50 AS patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to the tele-yoga or waiting
      list control group by the block randomization method. Patients in the tele-yoga group will
      participate in tele-yoga sessions with a maximum of 5 people in each group by
      video-conference method for 8 weeks, 3 days a week. Assessments will perform just before
      starting to study and after the 8-week tele-yoga program. Patients in the waiting list
      control group will be asked to continue their normal physical activities during the 8-week
      study, not to start a new exercise program, and to report any changes in the drug or dosage
      used. Control group's assessments will be performed when they are included in the study and
      at the end of 8 weeks. After these assessments, patients who wish will participate in the
      tele-yoga program.
