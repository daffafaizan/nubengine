    
      Patients diagnosed with Functional Movement Disorder presenting with a unilateral or
      asymmetrical bilateral hand tremor will be asked to participate in a series of hand exercises
      with and without a mirror box. The severity of the tremor will be rated subjectively by the
      subject and objectively by the neurologist after hand exercises with and without the mirror
      box.
