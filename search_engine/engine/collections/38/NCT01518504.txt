      glenohumeral and scapulothoracic mobility. Typically individuals will have limitations in
      shoulder range of motion, specifically, flexion (elevation) as well as external and internal
      rotation. Although the glenohumeral joint is the primary joint for shoulder motion adjacent
      joints such as the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic, and thoracic spine
      also contribute to maximal shoulder motion. Limited shoulder motion may be a result of joint
      hypomobility, muscle inhibition, or pain. Typically interventions such as stretching and
      joint mobilization/manipulation are directed at the glenohumeral joint to improve shoulder
      motion, but little is known about interventions targeting adjacent sites which may also
      improve shoulder range of motion. This study will evaluate the effect of thoracic spine joint
      manipulation on active and passive shoulder range of motion.
