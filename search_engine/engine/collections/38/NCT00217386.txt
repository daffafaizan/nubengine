        -  Determine the response rate in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic
           syndromes treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and etanercept.

        -  Correlate ex vivo and in vitro phenotypic, cytogenetic, and functional disease
           characteristics with in vivo response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine parameters that are associated with a high probability of response or
           non-response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours on days 1-4. Patients also receive
      etanercept subcutaneously on days 8, 11, 15, and 18. Treatment with etanercept repeats every
      28 days for at least 2 courses. Patients exhibiting hematologic improvement after course 2
      may receive up to 2 additional courses of etanercept in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with unresponsive disease or disease progression after course
      2 are removed from the study and offered other treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
