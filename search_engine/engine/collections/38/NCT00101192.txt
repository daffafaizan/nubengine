      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of cetuximab and cisplatin, in terms of objective tumor
           response (partial and complete), in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent
           carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor expression with progression-free survival,
           overall survival, and response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20
      months.
