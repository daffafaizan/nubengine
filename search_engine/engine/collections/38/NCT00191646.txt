      superiority, trial evaluating Gemcitabine and Carboplatin to the standard of care. Both
      treatment arms will be given the option to receive elective consolidation therapy of
      Paclitaxel 135 mg/m^2 given every 28 days for one year. Patients not achieving a complete
      response will crossover to the opposite single agent.
