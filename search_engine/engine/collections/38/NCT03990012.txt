      patients' breasts (i.e., thermograms) who have been referred for biopsy based on the results
      of their diagnostic breast exams. These patients may be later diagnosed with a malignant or
      benign breast condition. The infrared images and video collected will be used to construct
      and validate a computational biothermal engineering model of breast cancer.

      This research study does not involve any investigational drugs or treatments. This research
      study does not involve any FDA-approved drugs or devices.

      In this research study, the equipment used (IR camera, 3-D scanner) will no be tested nor be
      used to diagnose or treat. Further, medical decisions will not be based on the use of these
      devices.

      Infrared imaging (or digital thermal infrared imaging, DITI) is a non-invasive, non-contact,
      and harmless imaging procedure that measures the natural infrared radiation (body heat)
      emitted by the human body at normal 37Â°C body temperature. This procedure does not expose the
      patient to any radiation and is therefore entirely safe for the patient.

      IR images and video will be obtained by IR equipment provided by University of Texas (UT) at
      Dallas researchers. IR equipment consists of an IR camera and ancillary equipment (e.g.,
      tripod, computer, and vendor-provided IR image-processing software). The IR camera that will
      be used will be a commercial off-the-shelf product.

      Additionally, a 3-D scanner will be used to obtain a 3-D surface contour map of the patient's
      breasts. This 3-D scanner is also non-invasive, non-contact, and does not expose the patient
      any radiation, similar to the IR camera. The 3-D scanner outputs a file format that is
      compatible with 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) software for engineering analysis.
