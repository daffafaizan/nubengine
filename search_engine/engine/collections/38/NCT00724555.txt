      including transit time to hospital, paramedic and provider training, tPA standing orders, and
      provider guidelines. Among underserved populations, limited stroke knowledge, socioculturally
      determined attitudes, and beliefs and myths held by community members may serve as additional
      barriers that hinder these populations from receiving tPA and acute stroke care. Targeted
      multilevel interventions designed to overcome specific barriers may significantly increase
      the number of individuals with stroke who are appropriately treated with intravenous tPA (IV
      tPA) in underserved communities. Identification of the specific components of healthcare
      interventions that are the most effective is critical to improve delivery of acute stroke
      therapy.

      The goal of this study is to learn more about public knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and
      perceptions regarding stroke and stroke treatment in order to identify sociocultural and
      environmental barriers to receiving tPA and acute stroke care in an underserved community.
      This study will also determine if implementation of a multilevel intervention program can
      significantly increase the number of people with ischemic stroke who are appropriately
      treated with IV tPA in a predominantly underserved community.

      In the study, researchers will evaluate the different levels of the intervention to determine
      which efforts are most effective.
