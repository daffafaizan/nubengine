      surgery (Day 0) and 4 times daily (QID) beginning on the day after surgery (Day 1) for 14
      days followed by a tapering period of 14 days (dependent upon the Investigator's
      determination of adequate response to treatment). Patients were evaluated for safety and
      efficacy on the following visits: Day 0 (day of surgery), Day 1, Day 8 ± 1 day, Day 15 ± 2
      days and Day 29 ± 2 days (end of study drug treatment). Additional safety visits occurred at
      1 week after the last dose + 2 days and at 3 Months + 1 week. No inferential statistical
      analysis was planned for this study. Data was summarized using descriptive statistics.
