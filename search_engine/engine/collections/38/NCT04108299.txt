      disproportionately high type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden and have poorly controlled T2D. Given
      the high economic and societal burden of T2D and rapid population growth in Chinese
      Americans, there is an urgent need for research to develop effective interventions to address
      T2D burden in this population. Recent evidence suggests the importance of involving and
      empowering family members in diabetes intervention and calls for family intervention. A
      mobile health approach such as short message service (SMS) might be a promising way to
      deliver such family-oriented interventions to the target population given prior studies
      suggests that Chinese Americans often report challenges to attend in-person lifestyle
      counseling because of long working hours and lack of sick time from work. A SMS-based
      intervention provides the flexibility of allowing them to view the intervention at a time and
      place convenient to them. This study will serve as the first step to explore an alternative
      approach for managing T2D in this group.
