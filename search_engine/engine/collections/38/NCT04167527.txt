      either CT- or MR-angiography. However, acute ischemic stroke patients with low NIHSS who
      harbor a large vessel occlusion (LVO) later decline in 20-40% of cases, and/or have
      underappreciated impairments related to their relatively mild strokes. Similarly, LVO
      patients presenting with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are under increased risk of
      clinical deterioration. Such patients with apparent good collateral circulation, and hence a
      substantial perfusion of the vascular territory of the occluded large artery, likely have the
      most to gain from endovascular revascularization. At the same time, this collateral perfusion
      may allow for more frequent recanalization, either spontaneously or by intravenous (IV) rtPA.
      Experience with immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) in the LVO mild stroke target
      population is limited.

      This study will test the hypothesis that patients presenting within 8 hours of onset with
      cerebral ischemia in the setting of proximal large vessel occlusions (LVO) and low baseline
      NIHSS scores (0-5) will have better 90-day clinical outcomes (mRS distribution) with
      immediate mechanical thrombectomy (iMT) compared to initial medical management (iMM).
