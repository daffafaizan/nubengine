    
      This is a multi-center, blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects
      of booster doses of exogenous surfactant (InfasurfÂ®, calfactant) in addition to inhaled
      nitric oxide (iNO) on the outcome of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, or
      chronic lung disease of prematurity, characterized by chronic lung dysfunction) at 36 weeks'
      post-menstrual age (PMA) in extremely low gestational age (ELGAN) infants that are at high
      risk of the development of BPD. This multi-center trial, with a planned enrollment of 524
      infants, will also enable us to evaluate for any adverse effects of late surfactant treatment
      on short- and long-term outcomes, as we will be collecting data on effects of dosing of late
      surfactant, co-morbidities of prematurity and neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcome at 1
      year and 20 months corrected age. In addition, we will collect biological specimens for
      evaluation of the effects of late surfactant replacement therapy (administered as described
      in this trial) on surfactant function and inflammatory markers.
