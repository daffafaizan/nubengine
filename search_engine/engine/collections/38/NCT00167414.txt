      and blood tests will be done each week while you are receiving treatment, and at follow-up
      visits. You will be seen for follow-up evaluations 4 weeks after treatment is completed, and
      every three months thereafter. You will be asked to fill out a Quality of Life questionnaire,
      which should take 5-10 minutes to complete. This will be done prior to treatment and at your
      follow-up visits. You will receive high dose radiation therapy directed at the site of
      metastasis. This treatment will be given once a day, 5 times a week (Monday through Friday)
      for one to four weeks depending on the location and size of the disease to be treated.
