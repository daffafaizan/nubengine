      Physiological support, Physical independece, Pain), and is a proven method of reliability,
      consistency and validity for evaluating recovery from surgery and anesthesia.

      After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, patients experience various discomforts such as pain,
      nausea, vomiting, and placebo due to general anesthesia.

      Neostigmine has side effects such as crampy abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In addition,
      residual neuromuscular blockade was higher in neostigmine compared with sugammadex.

      Although sugammadex expected to improve patient's recovery, it is still controversial that
      sugammadex contributes to clinically meaningfull difference compared with neostigmine.

      Therefore, the aim of our study is comparison of quality of recovery through QoR-15
      questionnaire in patients who were reversed neuromuscular blockade by using sugammadex and
      neostigmine in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
