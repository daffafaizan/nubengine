        -  To describe the effects of a novel incentive intervention model on HIV-infected youths'
           patterns of antiretroviral medication adherence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of an outpatient incentive intervention model.

        -  To assess participant satisfaction with the incentive intervention model.

        -  To evaluate the effect of an outpatient incentive intervention model on targeted health
           behaviors (numbers of missed appointments and STI diagnoses).

        -  To measure the effect of the incentive intervention on HIV viral load and CD4+ count.

        -  To determine the overall and per patient cost of the incentive intervention model.

        -  To describe associations between adherence measures: real-time medication monitor data,
           pharmacy pill count, pharmacy prescription pick-up data, medication possession ratio,
           and self-report.

      Upon enrollment, participants will receive education and a real-time medication monitor.
      Participants will be followed monthly in the clinic and will be prescribed thirty-day
      supplies of medication. During weeks 1-4 participants will establish a baseline with the
      real-time medication monitor. During weeks 5-28, participants will receive remote incentives
      based on their level of medication adherence as measured by the real-time medication monitor.
      Additional lottery-style incentives will occur at regular follow-up visits. No incentives
      will be applied during weeks 29-48. Participants will complete the protocol at the week 48
      visit.
