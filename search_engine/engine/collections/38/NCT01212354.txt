      to assess toxicity of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus Cisplatin of head and neck
      cancers

      The main study is a multicenter phase III randomized trial on the effect of dose escalated
      radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy to treat local advanced head and neck cancer. The
      study compares two treatment arms:

      Experimental intervention (group A): 7 weeks standard radio-chemotherapy with 20 mg/m²/d
      Cisplatin in week 1 and 5 including simultaneous radiation dose escalation (5x2.3 Gy per week
      up to 80.5 Gy total dose) to the primary tumour and involved neck nodes ≥ 2 cm.

      The Dose Escalated tumour Volume (DEVPT) is defined by the macroscopic (Gross) primary Tumour
      Volume (GTVPT) minus a 3 mm margin at organs at risk or at mucosal sites to reduce the risk
      of high dose deposition at the surrounding normal tissue. All involved lymph nodes visualized
      by CT with a minimal diameter of 2 cm are also included for dose escalation (DEVLN). The
      DEVLN of the lymph nodes > 2 cm is determined by the involved lymph node volume (GTVLN) minus
      a margin of 3 mm at organs at risk or mucosal sites. The 3 mm margin as well as the part of
      the target volume with suspected microscopic tumor extension receives 2 Gy per fraction.

      Control intervention (group B): 7 weeks standard radio-chemotherapy with 5x2.0 Gy per week up
      to a total dose of 70 Gy and 20 mg/m²/d Cisplatin in week 1 and 5.

      In group A and B: The treatment of the elective cervical lymphatic areas is given in the same
      session as the GTV but with a single dose of 1.6 Gy up to 56 Gy (so called simultaneous
      integrated boost concept).
