      Investigating the effect of sugar reduction in apple juice on glycemic and insulin response
      to ingestion of this drink.

      Subjects/Methods:

      In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with cross-over design 30 male
      adults with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) received an oral drink of 500mL: 1. Verum: Apple
      juice, treated (low sugar content); 2. Control: Untreated apple juice (normal sugar content).
      Capillary blood glucose and venous plasma insulin were measured twice at baseline and then at
      times 0 (start of drink), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min.
