      which can cause a wide variety of infections. These range from a simple asymptomatic carriage
      up to 20 % of children , or minor illnesses such as sore throat or impetigo, to severe
      conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome .

      The pathophysiological mechanisms of invasive GAS infections are poorly understood. These
      mechanisms could involve not only virulence factors of the bacterium ( M protein determines
      the emm genotype , but also super- antigenic exotoxins SpeA , Spe C, Ssa, Sme z or other
      virulence genes , SilC , ... Sic ), but also in some cases, factors associated with host
      immunity in particular in the absence of risk factors for invasive skin infection such as
      cutaneous effraction ( wound , burn , chicken pox ) , corticosteroids or other
      immunosuppressive therapy and recent surgery .

      The investigators assume that in some invasive GAS infections, especially in children without
      risk factors, Mendelian susceptibility to infection may be involved . This hypothesis could
      be tested by studying the molecular characteristics of strains isolated SGA and innate and
      adaptive immunity in children hospitalised for invasive GAS infection with or without
      identified risk factors for infection.

      This study could not only lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms
      of invasive GAS infections but also to detect in children who underwent invasive GAS genetic
      susceptibility to infections requiring specific care . Finally, it could also identify
      specific strains of SGA or molecular profiles, whose detection in practice, lead to a
      suspicion of hereditary immune deficiency.
