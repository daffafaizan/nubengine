      may play in the development of NAFLD. This will be achieved by subjecting participants to two
      specific dietary interventions (high-fat, low-carbohydrate and low-fat, high-carbohydrate) in
      a randomized, crossover research design. Liver fat content, and whole-body and hepatic
      fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism will be assessed before and after the specific
      dietary interventions.
