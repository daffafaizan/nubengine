      and/or solid foods. Chewing dysfunction (CD) in children may cause restrictions in solid food
      intake, thereby may result in insufficient food intake and delay in growth. It is aim to
      evaluate chewing function in children with repaired esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal
      fistula (EA-TEF). Patients with repaired EA-TEF will be evaluated for age, sex, type of
      atresia. Each child will be required to bite and chew a standardized biscuit. Chewing
      function will be scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). The
      International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) will be used to determine the
      tolerated food texture of children.
