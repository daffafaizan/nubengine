      to improve medication reconciliation in healthcare transitions, and will validate a new
      integrated IT platform.

      Cancer patients receiving an oncologic treatment will be asked to choose a pharmacy
      participating to the trial, and to perform the pharmacological survey before every cycle of
      chemotherapy.

      This will be sent through the new IT platform to the electronic medical record of IRST, and
      the Oncologist will perform the reconciliation.

      Data about concomitant medications and possible interactions will be exensively analyzed.
