      perioperative period in paediatric patients remain unclear because many surgeries are being
      performed without muscle relaxation. In this retrospective study, the anesthesiology
      perioperative data from January 2016 till December 2016 in the tertiary center od Pediatric
      anesthesia will be searched for the percentage of surgeries with muscle relaxants
      administered. Type of surgery, age, weight, duration u surgery, muscle relaxants drug and
      percentage of block reversal will be identified.
