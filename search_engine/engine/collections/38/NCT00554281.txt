    
      Sixteen patients with Type 1 diabetes (as defined by: onset under the age of 25, lean at time
      of onset, continuous insulin use, and/or history of ketoacidosis and C-peptide negative),
      with a HYPO score over the seventy-fifth percentile (>423), will be approached and offered
      the study.

      The study will be conducted over a three month time-frame. The first month will be a run-in
      period for participants to collect four weeks of glucose readings and information about their
      hypoglycemic events. These records will be used to calculate the baseline modified HYPO
      score. Patients will be screened during the first month for thyroid disease, celiac disease
      and Addison's disease.

      During the second month they will meet with the study nurse for an intensive instruction
      period on the use of the Paradigm RT sensor. They will spend this month practicing to use the
      sensor and confirming they can use it adequately.

      During the final month they will wear the sensor and collect glucose and hypoglycemia records
      for calculation of the final modified HYPO score.

      The end point will be the change from the baseline modified HYPO score to the final four week
      HYPO score and this would be used to identify any improvement.
