      escalation through 18F-FDG-PET-based dose painting by numbers in 10 HPV negative patients
      with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. Treatment will be delivered
      with Helical TomotherapyÂ® or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Dose adaptation will be
      performed at 2 time-points with per-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans.
