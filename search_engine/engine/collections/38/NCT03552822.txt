      patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The purpose of the ERAS protocol is to optimize care
      provided to patients (patient education, nutrition, pain management, early ambulation, etc.).
      The anticipated date of protocol initiation is May 2018. Once this protocol has been in place
      for approximately 6 months to one year, the investigators would like to retrospectively
      review data on these patients and compare outcomes to a similarly-matched group of patients
      the year preceding protocol implementation. Specific outcomes the investigators will assess
      are: hospital length of stay, post-operative pain scores, opioid consumption, patient
      satisfaction [through IRB-approved survey (protocol X300001121)], surgical site infection
      rates, readmission rates, and unscheduled clinic and maternal evaluation unit (MEU) visits
      before the first scheduled postpartum visit. The investigators also plan to track compliance
      monthly with the adherence to the protocol. Since the investigators want to track compliance
      (both as a quality improvement project as well as research), the investigators are requesting
      (Institutional Review Board) IRB approval now.
