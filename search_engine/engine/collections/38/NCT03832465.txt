      (5mg/1ml/amp), the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected
      or if patient asks for termination. Patients will receive tests to evaluate H. pylori
      colonization in the gastric cardia (UFT300) and duodenal bulb (CLO). With endoscope
      apparatus, the gastric mucus is irrigated with acetylcysteine solution and the pH value of
      gastric juice will be measured with the pH test strips before irrigation and after
      irrigation.

      The investigators randomly assigned medicaments containing different formulation (powder or
      solution ) of levofloxacin to dispense on the surface of gastric mucosa and duodenal mucosa
      of duodenal bulb. After the intraluminal therapy, patients will rest for 30 to 60 minutes and
      go home if the effect of sedation subsided. Patients can take meal if no abdominal
      discomfort. C13-Urea breath test (UBT) will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6
      weeks after the intraluminal therapy. Patients failed to achieve intraluminal eradication of
      H. pylori will be randomly assigned to 7-day or 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy
      (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice
      daily). The C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the oral
      antibiotic therapy. The overall eradication rates of the intraluminal therapy plus the oral
      antibiotics therapies will be evaluated.
