      of care in VATS. However, this type of anesthesia has been associated with several adverse
      effects, which can trigger complications and increase the overall surgical risk. In order to
      avoid intubated-anesthesia related adverse effects, spontaneous ventilation strategies have
      been proposed in recent years.Encouraged by the satisfactory results with a preliminary
      experience of spontaneous ventilated VATS, the multicentre randomized controlled clinical
      controled study is established to comparatively analyze the outcome of patients undergoing
      either nonintubated intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation (SV) or SLV VATS
      lobectomy, especially in safety during operation, lymph nodes resection, complication rate,
      muscle recovery after surgery, the difference the postoperative hospitalization time.
