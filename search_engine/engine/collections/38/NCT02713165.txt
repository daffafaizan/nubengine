      Participants will be provided with a commercial raisin product for a 14 day period.
      Participants will consume 2 servings/day (84g of raisins). While participants will be told to
      substitute raisins for other diet ingredients, they will be free to choose what to substitute
      according to their preferences. Participants will keep daily food records and will be told
      that raisin consumption will be monitored in their fecal samples (qPCR). Fecal samples will
      be collected before the start (Day1), during (Day5-7) and at the end (Day 12-14) of the
      intervention using a stool collection kit (Sigma). Participants will complete a GI health
      questionnaire on a weekly basis to determine tolerance to increased raisin intake.
