      Weight Loss plus Non-Weight-Related VR app (i.e., Control Group) or Standard Behavioral
      Weight Loss plus Weight-Related VR app (i.e., Intervention Group). The Intervention's VR tool
      was designed to enable practice of behavioral skills taught in weekly group meetings,
      including managing social and home environmental cues for eating and activity.
