    
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare recessive genetic disease caused by a
      deficiency of Î±-L-iduronidase (IDUA) leading to an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
      in tissues of patients with MPS I. While currently available therapies, enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), provide clinical benefit
      over untreated disease progression, they still possess significant limitations. ERT does not
      cross the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, does not treat the central nervous system (CNS)
      effects of the disease, and HSCT has clinically relevant morbidity and mortality and is not
      able to completely treat the CNS effects. RGX-111 is designed to deliver a functioning gene
      enabling the production of IDUA in the brain. This is a Phase I/II, first-in-human,
      multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of RGX-111. Two, one time doses of RGX-111
      will be studied in approximately 5 subjects who have MPS I. Safety will be the primary focus
      for the initial 24 weeks after treatment (primary study period) whereupon, subjects will
      continue to be assessed (safety and efficacy) for up to a total of 104 weeks following
      treatment with RGX-111.
