      COPD will be monitored. In a group of patients with a comorbid course of COPD and
      atherosclerosis, systemic inflammation and its molecular mechanisms will be investigated.
      Also in this group, the role of non-coding miRNAs will be analyzed. The study also includes
      an analysis of the clinical and biochemical COPD phenotype with systemic inflammation and
      comorbidity.
