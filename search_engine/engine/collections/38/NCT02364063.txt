      age compared to typical developing children (Ozturk, 2006). The incidence of urinary
      incontinence during day and night, fecal incontinence and constipation is higher in this
      population.

      Incontinence in children is often treated with urotherapy. This is a nonsurgical,
      nonpharmacological treatment for lower urinary tract dysfunctions. Standard urotherapy is
      noninterventional and it includes giving information, instructions, advice regarding
      life-style, fluid intake and bladder diaries. Additionally specific interventions can be
      used, such as: various forms of pelvic floor training, behavioral modification, biofeedback,
      electrical stimulation and catheterization (Neveus, 2006). Recent research has proven
      urotherapy to be successful for the treatment of children with daytime incontinence (Mulders,
      2010).

      Despite the high prevalence of incontinence in children with CP the possible treatment
      strategies in this population are poorly investigated. Far too often, urinary incontinence in
      children with CP is considered a normal, unavoidable and even a minor problem.

      Aim: Investigate the influence of individualized urotherapy on the (in)continence of children
      with CP.

      The included children with CP will be randomized and stratified for type of CP and mental
      abilities into 2 groups: the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group
      will receive immediate therapy. After one year of therapy, a follow- up of 6 months will be
      applied. The control group will start 6 months later and information will be used as control
      group. Incontinent children without CP will receive therapy and will also act as control
      group.
