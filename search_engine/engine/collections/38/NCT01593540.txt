      periodontal diseases. Interdental cleaning is most efficiently performed through usage of
      interdental brushes. Commonly used metal-core interdental brushes can harbour the risk of
      hard tissue damage when used inappropriately.The aim of the study was to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction of a novel metal-free interdental brush. This was
      tested on healthy participants. The control group performed interdental cleaning with a
      commonly used metal-core interdental brush.
