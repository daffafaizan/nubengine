      human preterm uterine contractions of labor during electrical monitoring. The objective is to
      test a method for the inhibition of human preterm uterine contractions with an electrical
      pacemaker, electrical inhibition (EI). The study will investigate EI associated changes in
      preterm uterine contraction frequency as monitored by objective uterine tocodynamometry and
      adjunct electromyography (EMG) and electrohysterogram (EHG). The endpoint is the
      statistically significant EI induced decrease in the gold standard tocodynamometric monitored
      preterm uterine contraction frequency. The adjunct EMG and EHG monitoring provides valuable
      adjunct data about the electrical activity of the preterm uterine contractions and the effect
      of EI on this activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that human preterm uterine contractions can be safely and
      objectively inhibited with a weak electrical current provided by an electrical inhibition
      (EI)/uterine pacemaker device. This effect can be assessed by the use of a non-invasive
      tocodynamometer. It has been previously been shown that the frequency of contractions during
      preterm labor can be lowered by EI applied by the use of an intravaginal catheter carrying
      electrodes similar to a cardiac pacemaker (Karsdon et al). The investigators hypothesize that
      this effect relates to the timing and length of EI exposure.
