        1. Primary. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
           values for Niris 1300e OCT enhanced gynecologic examination (VIA-OCT
           vs.colposcopy-biopsy) for the detection of lesions equal or greater than cervical
           intraepithelial neoplasia II (CIN II) and cancer in a "real time" clinical evaluation.

        2. Secondary. To examine the ease of use of Niris 1300e OCT in a real time clinical setting
           in order to assess its potential application during a "see and treat" or "single episode
           of care" clinic visit.
