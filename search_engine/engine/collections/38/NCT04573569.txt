      tablet PC, as outlined above. Patients may elect to have electrodes to be implanted that are
      not used in standard-of-care at this institution, but are FDA-approved for the same
      indications. Patients who consent and complete enrollment will be asked to complete cognitive
      and behavioral tasks on a portable computer or tablet PC while the invasive electrodes remain
      implanted. Tasks typically require the patient to think or act and then respond by
      interacting minimally with the portable computer.

      The primary outcome for this study includes percentage of completed cognitive or behavioral
      tasks as a measure of the feasibility of the administration of these tasks. As this is a
      feasibility study, we are interested in the practical aspects of data acquisition.

      Secondary outcomes include the cognitive and behavioral tasks themselves and their
      relationship with electrophysiology.
