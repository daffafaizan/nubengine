      25(OH)D at enrollment. The study will take place in women with ovarian, primary peritoneal,
      and fallopian tube cancer.

      Patients who have given written consent to enroll in the study will have a serum 25(OH)D
      levels, serum leptin levels, and vitamin D receptor FokI single nucleotide polymorphism
      analyzed at the time of diagnosis. Patients with vitamin D deficiency will be prescribed
      vitamin D supplementation according to current guidelines. Treatment with cholecalciferol
      will not impact cancer therapy. Participants treatment course information will be collected
      prospectively, but will not be dictated by this study. Serum 25(OH)D and leptin levels will
      be collected again at the completion of primary therapy, 6 months after the completion of
      primary therapy, and at the time of disease recurrence. If patients remain vitamin D
      deficient at any of these follow-up time points, they will be referred to an endocrinologist
      for further work-up and treatment of their vitamin D deficiency. Data collection will
      continue for up to 1 year after enrollment.
