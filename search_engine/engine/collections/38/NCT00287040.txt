      treatment groups maintain comparable race composition. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the intervention groups or to usual care. Intervention Group 1 will receive, by
      mail, a DVD version of the interactive computer program; based on responses to its queries,
      the program will supply immediate feedback to promote mammography. Intervention Group 2 will
      receive a telephone version of the tailored intervention delivered by a counselor stationed
      at a computer. The counselor will use questions from the interactive program and deliver
      messages the program generates in response to each woman's answers. A third group will
      receive usual care. All women will be asked to participate in 6-month and 21-month follow-up
      telephone interviews querying stage of mammography adherence and beliefs.
