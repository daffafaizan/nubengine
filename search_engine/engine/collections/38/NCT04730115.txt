      treatment by using fractal dimension (FD) and cortical thickness (CT) analysis. The study
      will perform on 42 mandibular retrognathia cases. The treatment group (T), comprised of 30
      cases treated with functional appliance for one year in puberty. The control group (C)
      consists of 12 patients who had insufficient oral hygiene; didn't take any orthodontic
      treatment for one year. FD and CT analysis will evaluate for both sides. FD measurements will
      perform on processus condylar, antigonial notch, and ramus regions in the panoramic
      radiographs. Paired t-test will apply to analyze all between groups (before (T1) and after
      treatment (T2), before (C1) and after (C2) control). Also, independent t-test wişll use to
      determine whether there was any difference between the treatment group (∆T=T2-T1) and the
      control group (∆C=C2-C1).
