      Tranexamic acid versus placebo. Over the duration of the study, participating centres will be
      centrally and randomly allocated to receive either TXA or matching placebo at 1-month
      intervals for a total of 8 months. As our pragmatic trial is designed to define practice, we
      have selected co-primary outcomes that evaluate effectiveness in the context of safety.

      Our co-primary outcomes are the:

        1. Proportion of patients transfused RBCs

        2. Incidence of DVT or PE (collectively called venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 3 months
           of surgery.
