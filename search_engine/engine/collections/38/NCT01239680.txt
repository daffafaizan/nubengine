      dying of early hemorrhagic shock or from late septic shock.1 Shock is defined as circulatory
      collapse, when the arterial blood pressure is too low to maintain an adequate supply of blood
      to the body's vital organs and tissues. Specifically, hemorrhagic shock results when blood
      vessels are physically damaged while septic shock results when microbes or microbial products
      enter the blood stream. Despite advances in medical science, including the development of
      improved antibiotics, treatments for hemorrhagic and septic shock have changed little in the
      past 30-40 years. A wounded soldier bleeding on the battlefield, or a trauma victim in the
      United States, is treated today largely as he or she would have been treated in 1970.

      The overall aim of this work is to evaluate new methods of resuscitation that can be applied
      by front-line responders on the battlefield (medical corpsmen, combat medics), in civilian
      life (Emergency Medical System), or which can be used during initial resuscitation in the
      first fixed facility to which the injured patient is brought. This might be a Fire Support
      Specialist (FIST) team in a combat theater or a trauma center in the civilian health care
      system.
