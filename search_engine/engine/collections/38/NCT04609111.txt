    
      In the previous trial, 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) followed by clopidogrel
      monotherapy provided a net clinical benefit for the cardiovascular and bleeding events over
      12-month DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel after cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stent
      (CoCr-EES) implantation. However, even with very short DAPT, the rate of bleeding at 1-year
      remained very high in other trials that enrolled the patients with high bleeding risk (HBR).
      Notably, the risk of bleeding in patients with high bleeding risk (HBR) was particularly high
      within 1-month after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in previous chort data, when
      DAPT is implemented even in very short DAPT regimen. More recently, in another trial,
      prasugrel monotherapy without aspirin immediately after successful stent implantation was
      associated with no stent thrombosis in selected patients with low risk stable coronary artery
      disease. Aspirin-free strategy might be particularly beneficial in reducing bleeding in HBR
      patients. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are also reported to be associated with
      higher risk for bleeding.

      Therefore, we have planned a study to compare the cardiovascular and bleeding events at
      1-month after PCI using CoCr-EES between no DAPT strategy and 1-month DAPT strategy in
      patients with HBR or ACS.
