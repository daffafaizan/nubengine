      staff member will determine participants' group assignments. The randomization sequence will
      be created a priori by Dr. Keith Goldfeld (biostatistician) by using a computer-generated
      list of random numbers with stratification by antidepressant medication use and baseline
      levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ scores <10 and â‰¥10).

      UPLIFT: Eligible participants will complete 8 weekly group sessions by phone. The
      intervention builds cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness skills to help reduce depressive
      symptoms. Each hour-long weekly session consists of: check-in, instruction, skill building,
      discussion, and a home-based practice assignment.

      Usual care: Subjects randomized to UC will be advised to seek help from their primary care
      physician (PCP) or other sources as they normally would if they encountered symptomatic
      deterioration or other difficulties over the course of the study. All treatments received
      over the course of the study for the UC group and outside of the study (for the intervention
      group) will be assessed at each time point.
