      Primary

        -  Determine the safety, in terms of treatment-related mortality at 100 days
           post-transplantation, of a myeloablative preparative regimen comprising busulfan and
           fludarabine and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising tacrolimus and
           methotrexate in patients with hematopoietic disorders undergoing matched unrelated donor
           stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of overall survival at 1-year post-transplantation, in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine organ toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine neutrophil and platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6
           hours on days -7 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem
           cell or bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously beginning
           on day -2 and continuing until discharged from the hospital (may convert to oral dosing
           administered twice daily when tolerated) and methotrexate IV over 15-30 minutes on days
           1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
