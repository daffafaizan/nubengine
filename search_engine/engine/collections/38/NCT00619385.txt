    
      This is an open-label, single-center, outpatient, unblinded, multi-dose study of the safety
      and pharmacokinetic properties of Proellex®. Six female subjects will each receive seven
      daily doses of Proellex® in separate, rising doses. Dosing must be accomplished between
      menstrual periods. The first six women will complete the 100 mg visit schedule before the
      next six women will begin the 150 mg visit schedule. Blood will be collected at pre-dose, and
      at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24 and 36 (Day 7 only) hrs post-dose on Day 1 and
      Day 7. Subjects will be allowed to leave the clinic between the 12 and 24 hr and the 24 and
      36 hr PK blood draws. Subjects will be discharged from the study after a one month follow-up
      visit. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
