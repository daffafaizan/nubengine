      Indians/Alaska Natives with substance use disorders, providers serving AI/ANs with substance
      use disorders, and a Community Advisory Board. These focus groups are conducted in order to
      obtain feedback with regard to the initial DARTNA treatment protocol. These focus groups are
      then followed by a pretest of DARTNA among 10 AI/ANs with substance use disorders followed by
      a series of focus groups to finalize the development of DARTNA. During year 2, a randomized
