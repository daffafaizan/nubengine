      status (0 vs 1-2), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and participating center.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (A-FOLFOXIRI): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour, oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also
      receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours beginning on day 1.

      Arm II (A-FOLFOX/FOLFIRI): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour (or
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours), leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV bolus, and
      bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours
      beginning on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses. After the 12 cycle
      treatment finished, investigator decides whether to keep the study drug. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression, withdrawal consent, or unacceptable toxicity. If
      treatment with oxaliplatin or irinotecan is difficult due to side effects, treatment with
      bevacizumab, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium continues in the absence of disease
      progression, withdrawal consent, or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo serum extraction and blood sample collection periodically for genomic, ctDNA
      and translational study. Patients also undergo collection of tumoral sections from paraffin
      embedded primary and/or metastatic lesions periodically for immunohistochemical analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for survival and
      other treatments.
