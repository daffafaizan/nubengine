      and TG from drop-in centers in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chonburi and Songkhla. Each participant
      will have HIV testing at baseline and will be followed up for 18 months.

      HIV-negative participants will be asked to have HIV re-testing every 6 months. HIV-positive
      participants will have POC CD4 testing and ART initiation regardless of CD4 count will be
      offered. Those who accept ART will be followed up at week 2, week 4, month 2, month 3 and
      every 3 months thereafter. Those who deny ART will be followed up every 3 months.

      Uptake of HIV re-testing will be determined. Access to POC CD4 testing and acceptability of
      ART initiated at HIV diagnosis regardless of CD4 count along with ART adherence will also be
      determined.
