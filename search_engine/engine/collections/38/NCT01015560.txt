    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the urinary n-telopeptide (uNTX) response to anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody
           MLN1202 in patients with bone metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the feasibility of performing cross-disease site trials within the Southwest
           Oncology Group.

        -  To explore the effect of anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202 on markers of tumor cell
           proliferation, monocytes/macrophage trafficking, and osteoclast maturation.

        -  To estimate allele frequencies of defined SNPs occurring in the CCL2 and CCR2 genes in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo urine and blood sample collection at baseline and on days 15, 29, and 43 for
      correlative biomarker and polymorphism studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for â‰¥ 30 days.
