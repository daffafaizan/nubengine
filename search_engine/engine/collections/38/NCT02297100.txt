      injections for the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC). Specifically, we hypothesize that
      trigonal Onabotulinumtoxin A injections is an effective treatment for IC and will result in
      more subjective and objective symptom relief than posterior wall Onabotulinumtoxin A
      injections.
