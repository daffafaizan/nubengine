      on gut microbiota, and the mucosal inflammatory responses to a fermented milk in preterm
      infants. Preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 35 weeks and whose
      mother chose formula feeding were enrolled during their first three days of life. Both
      parents provided informed written consent. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either
      the fermented preterm formula (FPF) or, as a control, a formula adapted for preterm infants
      (PF). The PF was formulated to meet the nutritional needs of preterm infants. The FPF was
      identical, except for a manufacturing process including a fermentation step with two
      probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065, inactivated
      by heat at the end of the manufacturing process. This process conferred a probiotic/prebiotic
      activity.For each neonate, background information about the pregnancy and neonatal parameters
      were collected. Anthropometric parameters (weight, height, head circumference);
      gastrointestinal tolerance parameters (abdominal distension, gastric residuals, rectal
      bleeding, NEC); drug administration; and intake of formula and mother's milk were recorded
      twice a week until discharge. Stools were collected twice a week from diapers for
      microbiological analysis and measurement of fecal inflammatory markers. All samples were
      immediately stored at -80Â°C.
