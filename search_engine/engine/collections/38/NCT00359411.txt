      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease. These boys develop very severe disease associated with
      infectious mononucleosis; others develop hypogammaglobulinemia or B cell lymphomas. Recent
      studies have linked the disease to a region of the X-chromosome. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the function of the gene responsible for XLPD. Blood samples or discarded
      tissues (e.g. previous biopsy or autopsy material) from patients with XLPD and their
      relatives will be analyzed to determine the precise genetic defect associated with the
      disease. Blood samples or discarded tissues from other patients with EBV-associated
      lymphoproliferative diseases and blood samples from normal individuals will be obtained to
      serve as controls. Knowledge gained from this study should provide important insights into
      the immunologic control of EBV lymphoproliferative disease associated with congenital or
      acquired immunodeficiency. In addition, identification of the molecular mechanisms for these
      diseases may provide clues to other EBV-associated diseases including nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease.
