      spirometry is related to better patient associated outcomes compared to usual care which may
      or may not include the use of spirometry. To do this, we propose a comparative effectiveness
      trial of introducing a COPD assessment and management bundle targeted to primary care
      providers for patients suspected of having COPD versus usual care.
