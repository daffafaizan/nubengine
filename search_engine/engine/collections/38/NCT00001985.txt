      type-1-diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In this protocol we will draw blood samples from patients
      and normal control volunteers in order to analyze for the presence of CD152 genetic
      variations and to determine whether those variations are associated with measurable
      abnormalities in T cell function. Subjects with T1DM and homozygous CD152 gene polymorphisms,
      patients with T1DM but without CD152 polymorphisms, and control subjects with or without
      CD152 polymorphisms will be studied to determine whether the CD152 polymorphisms have
      measurable effects on T cell function and signaling. We will assess T cell function by
      measuring: proliferation, viability, apoptosis, cytokine production and T cell signal
      transduction. The identification and characterization of genes that are linked to T1DM may
      provide an explanation into the mechanisms by which individuals are predisposed to T1DM.
