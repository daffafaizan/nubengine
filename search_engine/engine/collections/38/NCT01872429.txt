    
      1. A retrospective chart review of dialysis patients including referred cases, receiving
           surgical PTX, which was performed by one surgeon at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, a
           1084-bed tertiary-care medical center in northern Taiwan will be performed.

        2. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone were routinely
           measured for three consecutive post-operative days and subsequent laboratory values were
           checked during out-patient follow-up period. Patients with postoperative 6-month
           laboratory data are included in the short-term group and those with more than 6-month
           available data are in the long-term one.

        3. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQIâ„¢)
           Clinical Practice Guidelines provided recommended target values for serum intact
           parathyroid hormone (iPTH)(150-300 pg/ml), phosphorus (3.5-5.5 mg/dl), calcium (8.4-9.5
           mg/dl) and the calcium-phosphorus product (<55 mg2/dl2). The Kidney Disease: Improving
           Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines suggested maintaining serum calcium
           in the reference range (8.5-10.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (2.7-4.5 mg/dl) and PTH values in
           the range of two to nine times the upper reference limit (130 - 585 pg/ml) in dialysis
           patients.

        4. The investigators evaluated the impact of subtotal PTX on the control of bone and
           mineral parameters in dialysis patients with secondary HPT as the percentages of cases
           achieving the recommended K/DOQI and KDIGO targets.
