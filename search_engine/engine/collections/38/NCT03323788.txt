      regulates how the body regulates how one metabolizes protein and carbohydrates) and exercise
      alter proteins involved in energy production and metabolism in skeletal muscle. By studying
      this, they hope to better understand the causes of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes
      Insulin is a hormone that is produced normally in the body and causes blood sugar to return
      to normal after eating. Insulin resistance is a state when the body is not using insulin
      correctly, and more insulin is needed to keep blood sugar concentrations normal. Insulin
      resistance can lead to Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar
      levels are too high. Our studies may help to find out why some people develop Type 2 diabetes
      and how exercise may prevent this disease.

      (Aim 4) We are asking patients from aims 1-3 to take part in this research study because they
      have high triglycerides that could be treated anyway with fibrates, and they do not have
      diabetes.

      Triglycerides and cholesterol are the two main kinds of fat that are in blood. People who
      have high triglycerides have some health risks and are sometimes treated with drugs called
      "fibrates". This drug turns on a protein in ones body that controls the activity of some of
      the genes that make it easier for their liver to get rid of triglycerides. We think that
      maybe this same gene, in ones muscle, can lower the ability of genes in ones muscle to
      respond beneficially to exercise, but we don't know if this is true.
