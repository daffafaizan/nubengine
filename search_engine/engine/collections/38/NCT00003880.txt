      progression free survival, overall survival, safety, response, and CA-125 levels in patients
      with newly diagnosed stage III ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive treatment of
      IV paclitaxel and IV carboplatin. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment groups: Arm
      I: Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 3 hours, immediately followed by IV carboplatin, on
      day 1. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Arm II: Patients receive IV paclitaxel over 3
      hours, immediately followed by IV carboplatin, on day 1. Patients receive intraperitoneal SCH
      58500 on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients are followed every 6 weeks
      for 36 months, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
