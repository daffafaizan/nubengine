    
      This is a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, expanded access study of talimogene
      laherparepvec for the treatment of subjects with unresected stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma in
      select European countries. Subjects with unresected stage lllB-IVM1c melanoma who are not
      eligible for or cannot access ongoing talimogene laherparepvec clinical trials and who meet
      the eligibility criteria outlined will be considered for participation in this protocol.
      Eligible subjects will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec until the subject has
      achieved a complete response, all injectable tumors have disappeared, clinically relevant
      (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change of therapy) disease progression
      beyond 6 months of therapy, intolerance of protocol treatment, or until talimogene
      laherparepvec receives marketing authorization approval in Europe for the treatment of
      melanoma, whichever occurs first. Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+7)
      days after the end of treatment. Thereafter, subjects who provide consent will be followed
      under an ongoing separate registry protocol for the long-term survival follow-up of subjects
      treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials. The registry protocol will also
      monitor for late and long-term adverse events thought to be potentially related to talimogene
      laherparepvec.
