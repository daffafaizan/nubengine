    
      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy (as measured by residual cancer burden [RCB] class 0/1 rate) of
      Talimogene Laherparepvec with Atezolizumab given to subjects with operable early breast
      cancer who present residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To assess the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast (pCRB) and
           breast and axilla (pCRBL) at definitive surgery after neoadjuvant treatment with T-VEC
           and atezolizumab.

        -  To determine the clinical and radiological ORR of breast tumors to TVEC- atezolizumab
           given in the neoadjuvant setting.

        -  To assess RCB index in continuous variable and by the 4 RCB class (RCB0, RCB1, RCB2 and
           RCB 3) after treatment with T-VEC and atezolizumab.

        -  Comparing the expression of a gene signature tracking activated CD8 T-cells at surgery
           after treatment with T-VEC and atezolizumab with residual disease after NAC.

        -  To evaluate the safety of T-VEC in combination with atezolizumab as assessed by
           incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events.

        -  Translational and exploratory objectives are included.
