      noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related health services, including diabetes and hypertension.
      Employing low-cost innovative eHealth interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth), may
      help improve NCDs prevention and control among disadvantaged populations.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of employing low-cost mHealth tools on the
      accessibility to health services and improvement of health indicators of individuals with
      NCDs in rural areas and refugee camps in Lebanon.

      This is a community trial study in which centers were allocated randomly into control and
      intervention sites. The effect of an employed mHealth intervention is assessed through
      selected quality indicators examined in both control and intervention groups. Sixteen primary
      health care centers (eight controls, eight interventions) located in rural areas and
      Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon were included in this study. Data on diabetic and
      hypertensive patients-1433 in the intervention group and 926 in the control group-was
      extracted from patient files in the pre and postintervention periods. The intervention
      entailed weekly short message service messages, including medical information, importance of
      compliance, and reminders of appointments or regular physician follow-up. Internationally
      established care indicators were utilized in this study.
