      regimen with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Flu/Cy/TBI) prior to
      haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition the pre-transplant
      conditioning will include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 6Gy.
      Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis will include cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on Day +3 and 4
      along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.
