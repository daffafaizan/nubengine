        -  To determine the association between regulatory T-lymphocyte (Treg) subsets present at
           engraftment and at day 28 with the incidence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD)
           in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  To identify gut-homing and skin-homing Treg subsets and determine their role during
           engraftment and at day 28 as a predictor of gut and skin aGVHD, respectively.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection at the time of neutrophil engraftment prior
      to stem cell transplant (SCT) and post-SCT on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation. Blood samples are analyzed for T-cell subsets and for the
      percentage of regulatory T-lymphocyte (Treg) or other T-cell subsets expressing specific
      homing receptors for the gut or skin via flow cytometry.

      Patients' medical records are also reviewed periodically.
