      or without external pancreatic stent. With an anticipated PF rate of 30%, based on literature
      experience, it was calculated that a reduction to 10% of PF rate would require the inclusion
      of 75 patients in each group (statistical significance P < 0.05 and power 80 per cent with a
      two-tailed test of proportions). We'll enroll 158 patients to take into account the
      possibility of 5% being lost to follow-up.

      PF was defined, according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula, as amylase
      rich fluid (amylase concentration more than three times serum concentration) collected from
      the drainage placed intraoperatively from day 3 or by needle aspiration of an intraabdominal
      collection. PF were graded according to the clinical impact on the patient's hospital course
      (grades A,B,C).
