        -  Determine the toxicity of erlotinib, mFOLFOX6, and bevacizumab in patients with
           metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of escalating the dose of erlotinib in order to maximize the
           likelihood of developing a grade 2 skin rash in select patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Single-agent erlotinib: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-14 (course
           1).

        -  Erlotinib, modified FOLFOX6, and bevacizumab chemotherapy: Patients receive oral
           erlotinib* once daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium
           IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2
           in course 2. Beginning in course 3, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30
           minutes. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients who do not develop grade 2 toxicity after the first 3 courses (6 weeks) will
      have their erlotinib dose escalated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study.
