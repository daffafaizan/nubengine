      cardia arrest. Neu2000KWL, a N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and an
      antioxidant, attenuated cerebral neuronal death and reduced hypoxic injury of brain in
      preclinical studies. Phase I clinical study has revealed that Neu2000KWL is very safe for
      treating human. In current study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of Neu2000KWL to
      compare the neurological biomarker, brain imaging, and clinical outcomes of patients
      successfully resuscitated from out-of-cardiac arrest treated by 3-day infusion of Neu2000KWL
      with patients assigned to placebo arm.
