      virtual reality exercise during the first two hours of the hemodialysis session. The second
      group will perform a virtual reality exercise during the last two hours of the hemodialysis
      session. The exercise program will last for 9 months.

      The virtual reality exercise will undertake up to 30 minutes of exercise. After warming up,
      participants will play to an adapted 'treasure hunt' game. Their legs movements will be the
      players projected into an individual tv that will give them feedback regarding their
      achievements. The aim of the game will be to achieve the higher possible score. They will
      move their legs to pick up coins and to avoid bombs. An adapted Kinect technology will be
      used for game development. The exercise session will end-up with a cool-down period that will
      include simple lower limb stretching exercises. Two more games will be introduced
      progressively for patients not to get bored, 'Air Hockey' and 'Simon'.
