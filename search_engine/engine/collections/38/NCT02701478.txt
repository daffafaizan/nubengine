      inhalation by the pain index ANI following a standardized electrical forearm stimulus in
      patients undergoing laparotomies under general anesthesia and with an intraoperative active
      epidural analgesia. Comparison to the new NoL analgesic index.

      Objectives: To observe the variations of the intraoperative pain indexes ANI and NoL after a
      classical and standardized electrical stimulation of the forearm (applied with the commonly
      used nerve stimulator we use for muscle relaxation monitoring) at different concentrations of
      inhaled Nitrous Oxide (N2O) (from 0% to 50%, concentrations that are commonly used in daily
      anesthesia). This will allow a quantification of the analgesic effect of N2O.

      Study Design: Prospective, open label, observational and descriptive study Subject
      Population: Adult patients scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery by laparotomy under general
      anesthesia with an active intraoperative epidural analgesia Sample Size: 40 patients will be
      evaluated in this study Study Duration: 1 year Study Center: Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital,
      Montreal, Quebec, Canada Adverse Events: None expected
