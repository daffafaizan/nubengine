    
      Primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of a wearable hip assist robot
      on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults.

      Fifteen elderly adults participated in this study. The stair ascent trials were designed to
      climb stairs from the first basement level to the fourth floor of the Proton Therapy Center,
      Samsung Medical Center, Korea. The metabolic energy expenditure was measured using a portable
      cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4bÂ², Rome, Italy) while participants performed
      randomly assigned two different conditions consecutively:, free ascent without the GEMS
      (NoGEMS) or robot-assisted ascent with the GEMS (GEMS). Participants rested for 10 minutes
      between the two trial conditions.
