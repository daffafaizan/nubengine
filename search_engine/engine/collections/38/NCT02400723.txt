      of life. The proposed CDA-2 study will examine the efficacy of a brief psychosocial
      intervention for anxiety in older Veterans with anxiety disorders. The psychosocial
      intervention is called BREATHE (Breathing, Relaxation and Education for Anxiety Treatment in
      the Home Environment) and teaches diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation
      via DVD videos that can be viewed in Veterans' own homes. The BREATHE treatment includes
      age-appropriate vignettes of anxiety-evoking situations. This project is aligned with older
      adults' preference of psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety. BREATHE is
      expected to benefit older Veterans ( 60 years) by reducing anxiety and avoidance and thereby
      increasing their engagement in activities and improving overall functioning. This aim will be
      tested in a randomized control trial of DVD-based BREATHE compared with DVD-based
      psychoeducation in 60 older Veterans with anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder,
      Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, and unspecified/other specified anxiety
      disorder). The study is 12 weeks long with both treatments lasting 4 weeks followed by an 8
      week follow-up period. It is hypothesized that BREATHE will result in a statistically and
      clinically significant reduction of anxiety symptoms as measured with the Geriatric Anxiety
      Scale compared with psychoeducation. Improvements in functioning (Activity Card Sort) are
      expected for participants randomized to the BREATHE condition compared with those randomized
      to psychoeducation. Hypotheses in will be addressed with mixed effects models.
