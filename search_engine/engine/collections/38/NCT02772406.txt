      general population. The association between duration of the disease and development of CRC is
      the rationale for endoscopic surveillance. Colonoscopic surveillance of ulcerative colitis
      patients has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and allow detection at an
      earlier stage, but even with meticulous examination, some precancerous lesions or cancers are
      missed. The newly developed LCI system (FUJIFILM Co.) creates clear and bright endoscopic
      images by using short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light on
      the basis of BLI technology. LCI makes red areas appear redder and white areas appear whiter.
      Thus, it is easier to recognize a slight difference in color of the mucosa. This is a study
      to determine if using Linked color imaging (LCI) of the colon, rather than the usual white
      light on the colon, will improve the detection of more dysplasia lesions in ulcerative
      colitis.
