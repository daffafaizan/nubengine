        -  To determine whether intersectin (ITSN1) proteins are present at elevated levels in
           primary human tumor samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for intersectin (ITSN1) expression by
      western blot assays with enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to X-ray film. The films are
      scanned, and levels of ITSN1 signal are quantified by densitometry.
