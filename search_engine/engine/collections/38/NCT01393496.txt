      frequently require multiple red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) during neonatal intensive
      care. The criteria currently applied to indicate RBCT in this population are based on expert
      opinion rather than evidence and conclusive data of long-term effects of RBCT practices do
      not exist. Both, giving RBCT to improve oxygen carrying capacity and restricting RBCT to
      avoid RBCT associated risks and costs potentially impair long-term development. The proposed
      blinded randomized controlled trial was designed and will be powered to compare the effect of
      restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion guidelines on long-term
      neurodevelopmental outcome in ELBW infants. ELBW infants will be randomized to receive RBCT
      according to liberal or restrictive RBCT guidelines, which both reflect current practice in
      Germany and aim for a clinically relevant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations. The
      primary outcome measure is the incidence of death or major neurodevelopmental impairment
      determined at 24 months of age corrected for prematurity. Key secondary outcomes are the
      incidences of individual components of the composite primary outcome, the mental and physical
      developmental index scores of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (II edition), and
      growth. Safety analyses will assess the incidences of all major diseases of prematurity. The
      results of this trial may help to improve the quality of life of these patients and reduce
      long-term health care costs.
