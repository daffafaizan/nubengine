      design will be used to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Subjects will then be
      treated at the RP2D in the expansion phase of the trial.

      Following treatment, tumor response assessments will be performed at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,
      18, and 24. At each tumor response assessment visit, imaging will be performed (triphasic CT
      Scan) and used for response evaluation. Serum AFP levels will also be measured at each tumor
      response assessment visit.

      The active assessment phase of the study will continue for 2 years. Subjects will be followed
      for 15 years post-treatment for assessment of treatment safety and overall survival.
