    
      At randomisation/baseline (Part A), subjects are randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 VIT
      2763 dose groups to receive either 30 mg (Cohorts 1a and 1b) or 60 mg VIT-2763 (Cohorts 2a
      and 2b) and 1 placebo group (Cohort 3).

      During Part B, subjects in Cohort 1a (VIT-2763 30 mg) and Cohort 2a (VIT-2763 60 mg) remain
      on the same VIT-2763 dose as in Part A; whereas, subjects in Cohort 1b and Cohort 2b continue
      with an increased dose of VIT-2763, 60 mg and 120 mg, respectively.

      Subjects randomised to placebo during Part A (Cohort 3) continue unchanged during Part B.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of VIT-2763 on markers of
      haemolysis.

      The main exploratory objective is to explore the safety and tolerability of VIT-2763.
