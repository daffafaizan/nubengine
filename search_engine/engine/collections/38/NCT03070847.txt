      Tranexamic acid is a drug registered for bleeding prevention and reduction. It is on the
      World Health Organisation (WHO) 'essential drugs list'. Preoperative tranexamic acid efficacy
      is well proved for doses between 10 and 40 mg/kg and last years and decades publications
      showed that 'low dose' (10mg/kg) is as efficient as higher doses but connected with less
      adverse effects.

      Objectives

      To determine whether 5 mg/kg dose is as effective as commonly used 10mg/kg dose in
      intraoperational bleeding reduction.

      Methodology All patients would be randomised into one of two arms - low and very low dose.
      Patients, investigators and caregivers would be blinded. Patients would receive intravenous
      bolus of tranexamic acid at 15 minutes before admission to operation theatre in a dose
      dependent on the study arm. General, intravenous anesthesia (total intravenous anesthesia)
      would be performed due to hospital standards. At the end of the surgery total blood volume
      and adverse effects would be noted. Surgeon would asses surgical field in the Fromm scale.

      The survey is planned for a two years timespan or until 50 patients have enrolled (25 for
      each arm).
