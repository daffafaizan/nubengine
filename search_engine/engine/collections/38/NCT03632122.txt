      health and function of older adults with back pain. The investigators will perform a
      retrospective cohort study using secondary analysis of the National Health and Aging Trends
      Study (NHATS) data. NHATS collected longitudinal data on Medicare beneficiaries over 65 for
      six years, from 2011-2017. This set of data is comprehensive and includes self-reported
      survey data as well as physical performance data, both of which this study will utilize.

      The specific aims include to 1) Estimate the longitudinal associations of the number of
      chronic conditions, using a standard classification scheme, with long-term physical
      performance, function, and recurrent falls, 2) Identify specific combinations of chronic
      conditions that are most strongly associated with long-term physical performance, function,
      and recurrent falls, 3) Determine the association of the number and type of chronic
      conditions with rehabilitation service use. The investigator will test a corresponding
      hypothesis for each aim: 1) Medicare beneficiaries reporting back pain with a greater number
      of chronic conditions will have worse physical performance, lower functional status, and be
      more likely to experience recurrent falls over 6 years, 2) Medicare beneficiaries reporting
      back pain with common and potentially modifiable conditions of anxiety, depression, and
      arthritis (individually and combined as dyads or a triad) will have worse physical
      performance, lower functional capacity, and be more likely to experience recurrent falls over
      6 years, 3) Medicare beneficiaries with back pain and multiple chronic conditions will report
      lower use of rehabilitation services in the past one year compared to those with back pain
      alone or one additional chronic condition.
