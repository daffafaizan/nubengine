      recognition or misinterpretation of others' intentions (Theory of Mind), are associated with
      social behavior disorders.

      This kind of disorders are observed in Fronto-Temporal Dementia, Alzheimer's Dementia (AD)
      and Parkinson's Disease, with severe deficits in FTD and lighter deficits in AD and PD. One
      explanation is that patients apply inappropriate visual exploration strategies to decode
      emotions and intentions of others.

      Our study aims to evaluate impacts of an emotion recognition rehabilitation program, named
      Training of Affect Recognition, on social cognition abilities (facial emotion recognition
      (FER) and theory of mind (ToM)) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we hypothesis that
      the effect of this rehabilitation will also evolve gaze strategies, behavioral disorders, and
      the caregiver's burden.
