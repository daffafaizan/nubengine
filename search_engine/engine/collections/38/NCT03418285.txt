      levels using the frozen plasma at the onset of STEMI and 10 months later (the chronic phase).
      To assess plaque progression, residual SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score and chronic-phase SYNTAX score are
      measured. After the chronic-phase assessment of TMAO and SYNTAX score, patients are followed
      for cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and
      unstable angina pectoris with coronary revascularization.
