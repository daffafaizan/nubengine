    
      Patients will be identified from those previously approved for the LITT procedure. Following
      consent, 20 patients will complete NCCN distress, Quality of Life (QOL) and neuro-cognitive
      baseline testing, followed by the LITT procedure using the NeuroBlateÂ® System (NBS) and
      intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Per standard clinical practice, after
      completing LITT, patients will undergo radiation at the discretion of the treating radiation
      oncologist. Patients will likewise receive concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy (typically
      temozolomide) at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist. All patients will complete
      NCCN distress, QOL and neurocognitive testing immediately after the LITT procedure on
      post-operative day 1 as able, or immediately prior to discharge if more appropriate.
      Additionally, they will complete these same tests approximately 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
      after the completion of LITT therapy.
