      stress for residents with type 2 diabetes newly moved into long-term care facilities on
      depression, relocation stress and HbA1c levels. The results highlighted the benefits of using
      strategies in the MBSR-T to promote good quality of diabetes care for residents in long-term
      care.

      The contents of the 9-week MBSR-T program were adapted from an initial MBSR program by the
      Taiwan Mindfulness Association for older people with diabetes (Chinese version). The program
      consisted of a 1.5-hour session each week for 9-weeks for a group of 8 to 10 participants.
      Each session included 30 minutes of mindful deep breathing relaxation and 60 minutes of
      practicing mindfulness activities.

      A total sample of 140 was determined. All eligible individuals in each long-term care
      facility were randomized by computerized random numbers, sequence generated by an independent
      statistician with one-to-one ratio for allocating to either control or intervention group.
      All participants were blinded to group allocation. Participants in the control group received
      usual care, while participants in the intervention group received the MBSR-T in addition to
      the usual care. All sessions in the MBSR-T were delivered by a trained mindfulness registered
      nurse who had received additional trainer qualification of mindfulness. A research assistant
      was blinded to the study protocol, who was employed to undertake data collection at baseline,
      at 3, 6, and 9 weeks (T0, T1, T2, T3).
