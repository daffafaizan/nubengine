      functions through their normal life cycle, which provide benefits to their human hosts in
      maintaining homeostasis. The relationship works both ways with the human host providing both
      nutrition and an environment for the bacteria to flourish.

      Ageing is a natural and multifactorial phenomenon characterised by the accumulation of
      degenerative processes that are in turn underpinned by multiple alterations and damage within
      molecular pathways. The alterations and damage ultimately compromise cell and tissue
      functions. As such, ageing is the most profound risk factor for almost all non-communicable
      diseases. Amongst the key processes involved [in ageing], inflammation is of particular
      interest, because ageing is characterised by an increase in the concentration of a number of
      pro-inflammatory molecules in the circulation, a phenomenon that has been termed
      "inflammageing" and is a determinant of the speed of the ageing process and of lifespan.

      Amongst the members of the human microbiome, Bifidobacterium spp. are resident microbiota
      members throughout the invesstigator's lifetime, with their levels across the life course
      aligning with key stages in immune maturation. Bifidobacteria influence this critical
      homeostatic development and programming by impacting on specific immune populations and
      signalling pathways associated with improved host well-being.

      VMK223 is a heat treated Bifidobacterium breve extract, consisting of a low molecular weight
      storage polysaccharide that targets the reduction of NF-ÎºB activation.
