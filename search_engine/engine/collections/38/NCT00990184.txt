      with dyslipidemia. Subsequently it was observed that patients with type 2 diabetes receiving
      this medication had improved glucose control. However, the mechanism(s) by which it lowers
      glucose concentrations has not been determined.

      Glucose metabolism is enhanced following oral nutrient ingestion by the action of the
      incretin hormones. The two major incretin hormones are the peptides glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which are released from the
      intestinal tract wall in response to a meal. Of these two peptides, GLP-1 appears to be more
      important in regulating glucose metabolism. In the presence of elevated plasma glucose, GLP-1
      promotes insulin release from the ß-cells of the pancreas. GLP-1 also suppresses glucagon
      release, and thereby inhibits hepatic glucose output. Administration of GLP-1 by infusion or
      by subcutaneous injection has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetic
      patients.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to determine in a cohort of individuals with
      prediabetes, who have an elevated fasting plasma glucose and are at increased risk of
      developing type 2 diabetes, whether the glucose lowering properties of colesevelam occur by
      it improving insulin sensitivity, islet ß-cell function or both. Further, by assessing the
      effect of colesevelam on incretin hormone release, it will be possible to determine whether
      any improvement in islet ß-cell function is due to enhanced incretin stimulation.
