      assignment crossover trial of methylphenidate and placebo, with each double-blind phase
      lasting two weeks. Subjects who experienced moderate or marked improvement on methylphenidate
      would be allowed to enter a long-term, open-label trial. ADHD symptom severity was measured
      monthly by a structured interview, the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale
      (WRAADDS), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) and Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF). Social functioning was assessed by the clinician administered version of
      the Weissman Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). Dosing was determined by clinical judgement,
      symptom improvement and AEs.
