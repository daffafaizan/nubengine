      efficacy of Troxatylâ„¢ (troxacitabine) administered as a continuous infusion for 5 days to
      subjects with AML. The study will primarily assess the complete response (CR) rate of a 5-day
      continuous infusion of troxacitabine at 12 mg/m2/day given as second salvage therapy in adult
      patients with AML, with secondary objectives to determine the overall, relapse-free and
      event-free survival and remission duration; to determine the duration of response; to
      determine the complete response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) rate; to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of 5-day continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of troxacitabine; and
      to determine the relationship between troxacitabine plasma concentrations, anti-leukemic
      activity and adverse events. Additional cycles of treatment may be given at the
      investigator's discretion, provided that the subject does not have progressive disease or
      experience a dose limiting toxicity. Bone marrow transplantation in responding subjects will
      be allowed.
