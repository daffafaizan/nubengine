      DMD patients suffer significant disability due to skeletal myopathy and excess death due to
      cardiomyopathy. Current guidelines advocate initiating cardioprotective treatment with
      evident global cardiac dysfunction, yet this treatment paradigm has not improved survival
      much beyond the third decade of life. Potentially promising approaches like gene therapy will
      take considerable time to improve outcomes. Recently completed studies in a DMD mouse model
      at our institution indicate that existing drugs known as aldosterone antagonists, typically
      reserved for advanced heart failure patients, preserve skeletal and cardiac muscle function
      at 80% of normal. Clinical studies at many centers including ours have shown that
      high-resolution, noninvasive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) detects subclinical myocardial
      fibrosis and abnormal regional function prior to global functional abnormalities. Combining
      findings from these preclinical and clinical studies, we plan to execute a randomized,
      controlled clinical trial (RCT) of eplerenone plus background therapy vs. background therapy
      alone in patients with DMD. We expect that the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone compared to
      standard therapy significantly delays progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy using
      highly reproducible imaging biomarkers selected for efficient sample size design, to
      ultimately reduce disability and death.
