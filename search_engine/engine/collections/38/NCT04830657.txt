      power analysis was performed by taking the information of the statistician and previous
      studies as a reference in order to determine the number of patients to be included in the
      reiki and control groups. As a result of the analysis performed by taking effect size 0.35,
      type 1 error 0.05, power 0.80 and correlation between repeated measurements 0.50, it is
      planned to study with a total of 46 patients, including at least 23 patients in each group.
      The remote reiki group will be given remote reiki 3 times a week for 4 weeks by the
      researcher who has a reiki application certificate. Remote reiki sessions will be performed
      by the reiki practitioner the night before the hemodialysis day of the patient, and the
      session duration will take approximately 36-40 minutes. After the individuals receive 12
      sessions of remote reiki (1 month later), the questionnaire will be filled in for the second
      measurement. In order to determine whether reiki has an effect in the long term, 4 weeks (1
      month) after the second measurement, the questionnaire for the third measurement will be
      completed and the research will be completed. Patients will receive routine treatment in
      accordance with the institution policy without any intervention in the control group. The
      control group will be filled in the questionnaire after the first measurement, in the 4th
      (1st month) and 8th (2nd month) weeks. At the end of the study, remote reiki sessions will be
      applied by the researcher, since the patients in the control group have equal ethical rights.
      The primary expected result of the study is the effect of distant reiki on fatigue in
      hemodialysis patients. The second expected result of the study is to determine the effect of
      distant reiki on comfort.
