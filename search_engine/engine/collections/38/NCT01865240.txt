      reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. A total of 100 participants
      with uncontrolled blood pressure, treated with three or more blood pressure lowering
      medications will be recruited into the study. Patients will be assigned to one (1) of two (2)
      groups with the aim of attaining blood pressure control. Participants in group 1 will be
      assigned to renal denervation, participants in group 2 will receive additional
      antihypertensive medication according to current guidelines and best practice in an attempt
      to reach blood pressure targets.
