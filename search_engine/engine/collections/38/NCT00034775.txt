      formulation of a antipsychotic medication may eliminate the need for daily medication and
      enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This is an open-label, non-randomized
      study of a formulation of risperidone (coated microspheres) injected into the muscle at 2
      week intervals over 12 weeks in patients with schizophrenia. The study has two phases: during
      the first 4 weeks, patients continue treatment with their present medication (haloperidol,
      quetiapine fumarate, or olanzapine); during the second phase of 12 weeks, patients receive
      the injectable formulation of risperidone, while continuing to receive their present
      medication for 3 weeks until the risperidone long-acting injectable reaches effective drug
      levels. For the remainder of the 12-week treatment phase, patients receive only injectable
      risperidone every 2 weeks. Safety evaluations include the incidence, type, and severity of
      treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the study; vital signs (pulse, blood pressure),
      clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      and extrapyramidial symptoms are also monitored at specified intervals. Assessments of
      effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and overall severity
      of illness measured by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. The study hypothesis is
      that long-acting injectible risperidone will be well-tolerated in the treatment of patients
      with schizophrenia after switching from treatment with an oral antipsychotic. Risperidone
      injections (25 milligrams[mg]) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Investigator may adjust dosage to
      37.5mg or 50 mg (maximum) or supplement risperidone injections with risperidone tablets
      (1mg), according to symptoms and treatment response.
