    
      The overall purpose of this proposed action-research project is to measure the feasibility of
      consuming and the impact of indigenous plants and foods on health outcomes among Native
      American participants on the Wind River Indian Reservation (WRIR) in Wyoming.

      Participants from the WRIR will be recruited to pilot a randomized control trial (RCT) with a
      delayed intervention to measure the impacts of consuming a diet that is 50% indigenous foods
      (based on participant total energy needs and recommended dietary pattern). Specific
      objectives of the pilot RCT will be to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of access, collection,
      and consumption of indigenous plants/animals, (2) define precisely what constitutes a "50%
      indigenous food diet" that will be supplied as the intervention in this trial, (3) quantify
      the time commitment and logistical challenges to access and collect indigenous foods, (4)
      evaluate the consumption of indigenous foods on health outcomes including waist
      circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose control, and blood lipid
      levels, and (5) evaluate the impact of consuming indigenous foods on cultural identity.

      The pilot RCT will primarily address objectives 4 and 5. In order to meet these specific
      objectives, the investigators will pilot a RCT with delayed intervention to provisionally
      assess health impacts of consuming a diet that is 50% indigenous foods for four weeks. Health
      outcomes assessed will include biometric measures of waist circumference, body mass index,
      blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol with triglycerides; and survey measures of
      quality of life, cultural identification, and food security.
