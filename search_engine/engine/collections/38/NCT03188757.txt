      During hyperglycemia a sample of venous blood for the evaluation of oxidative stress,
      inflammatory response and the expression of non-coding RNA is going to be drawn.

      Subjects will have 1H-MRS in hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic state and evaluation of executive
      function (using psychological tests) is going to be preformed. For 1H-MRS, the MRI of the
