      enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can either significantly slow the decline of renal function
      or continuously sustain the normalization of other objective functions in patients with Fabry
      disease who have been receiving intravenous infusions of Replagal (agalsidase alfa) at a dose
      of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 2 weeks.

      Study Population: Patients with Fabry disease who are currently on clinical research
      protocols 00-N-0185/TKT011 or 02-N-0220/TKT015 and who have demonstrated progressive decline
      in calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of at least 5 ml/min/year on ERT or who
      consistently show transient improvement in objective functions (such as sweating) in the few
      days post-infusion.

      Design: This is an open label study comparing one dosing regimen with a previous less
      intensive dosing regimen. Patients will receive a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight every
      week.

      Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure will be a change in the mean linear rate of
      decline of the estimated calculated GFR. The main hypothesis is that a more frequent
      administration of the previous dose of Replagal will significantly reduce the mean slope of
      the decline of the calculated glomerular filtration rate GFR compared with the currently
      observed slope on a dose of 0.2 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. At the 2-year time point,
      the dose will be increased to 0.4 mg/kg only in the patients whose GFR continues to
      significantly decline. Secondary outcome measures will be globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)) in
      plasma and urinary sediment, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, quantitative sensory
      testing. Study duration is 2 years with a possibility of additional one-year extensions.
