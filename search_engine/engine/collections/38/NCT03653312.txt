      2008, 30.7 million people had survived a stroke. Every year, there are about 14,000 new cases
      of stroke in Denmark and the number is expected to rise with about 40% by 2035, due to the
      increasing population of elderly. Stroke survivors have the worst odds of reporting severe
      disability and the greatest variety of individual domains of disability compared to a range
      of other diseases. Therefore, these patients have essential rehabilitation needs. Little is
      known about who will benefit from functional interventional rehabilitation and what kind of
      intervention is best.

      The purpose of the study is to examine the added effect of NeuroMuscular Electric Stimulation
      (NMES) in addition to exercise therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

      This RCT includes 50 patients allocated to either control or intervention. The inclusion,
      test, training and re-test will be provided during the first 14 days after ictus, starting
      day 1 after ictus and a follow-up at day 90.

      The exercise training with external NMES is done with the patient every weekday for 12
      minutes.

      If NMES increases functionality in acute stroke patients it would mean a greater degree of
      independence for individual patients and thus have the potential to improve on a major
      problem for society.

      By combining comorbidity, stroke severity, and other demographic data it might be possible to
      get a greater knowledge about who will benefit from the intervention and early rehabilitation
      and that will be the a step towards "personalized medicine" in stroke rehabilitation.
