      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, inter-individual response to PS
      consumption varies, with some individuals showing low or no reductions in LDL-C levels, while
      some even showing an increase in levels. Determining factors that predict the direction of
      response of LDL-C to PS would be helpful in identifying individuals who should consume PS and
      individuals who should seek another method of treating hypercholesterolemia. The objective of
      this research proposal is to test the a priori predictive potential of a combination of three
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., genosets, previously associated with response
      to PS in a post-hoc manner. A clinical trial with a priori recruitment of participants based
      on genoset which will test LDL-C response to PS consumption using a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled crossover design is proposed.
