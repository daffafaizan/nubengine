      lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes. Therefore, efficient screening of patients is
      essential for general health. This study was performed to evaluate prospectively the
      diagnostic utility of a blood IgG antibody titer test against periodontal pathogens.

      Methods: Oral examination was performed and blood IgG antibody titers against periodontal
      pathogens were measured by ELISA, in 1387 subjects. The cut-off value of IgG titer was
      determined in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and changes in periodontal
      clinical parameters and IgG titers by periodontal treatment were evaluated. The relationships
      between IgG titers and severity of periodontitis were analyzed.
