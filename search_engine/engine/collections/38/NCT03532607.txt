      design. Ninety-eight participants scheduled to receive a Botox injection will be randomly
      assigned to receive individual music meditation therapy intervention group or standard care
      control group before the participant's Botox injection. The study team will use an embedded
      mixed methods study that uses both quantitative and qualitative data. Qualitative data play a
      supporting role and are embedded within a larger RCT. The qualitative data will help the
      investigators better understand the patients' experience of the interventions.
