      injuries. Following medical diagnosis and supplementary evaluations where requested (i.e.,
      radiological examination), the patient will be referred to the rehabilitation service. Before
      initiating the physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program, the patient will undergo a
      comprehensive functional screening at the biomechanics laboratory. Using a decision-making
      scheme, the identified functional deficits will be used to customize the individual
      rehabilitation plan.Registry procedures will be monitorized in a customized Microsoft excel
      spreadsheet which would record the code of patient episode (i.e. 20170001) as well as the
      number of the first medical and laboratory examination and the code of the therapist
      responsible of the rehabilitation. Twice a week an investigator (I.S) will check the report
      in order to assure proper patient rehabilitation course as well as claiming that pre and post
      laboratory and medical examinations are made. Completed episodes will be moved to another
      archive as "successfully completed" whereas in completed ones will be moved to another
      archive as "unsuccessfully completed". From that register efficacy data with regards to
      complete rehabilitation management model implementation rate will be calculated and reported
      apart from the outcome variables. The obtained results in terms of number of rehabilitation
      sessions performed and number of working day loss will be compared along with historical
      cohorts of the same medical institution
