    
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor functions
      and is characterized by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability.
      Despite of pharmacological treatments, patients remain with deficits in balance, gait,
      autonomic system functions and cognition which impact on their quality of life.

      The effects of resistance training on PD are still controversial when balance and improvement
      on functional tests are the targets.

      Since the results of previous studies about resistance training on balance are still
      controversial, more interventions are required to address the question if strengthening
      exercise may improve or not the balance of PD patients. Our exercises will target the trunk,
      leg and shoulder muscles because of their contribution on patient's posture.
