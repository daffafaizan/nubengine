      heterogeneous. Candidate selection was important before intervention. The underlying
      mechanical dyssynchrony of left ventricular bundle branch block was insufficiently
      descripted. Earlier study of investigators found novel imaging methods such as cardiovascular
      magnetic resonance imaging including T1 Mapping and feature tracking imaging can provide more
      detailed information about regional and global LV function in patients. While the role of new
      cardiac MR imaging techniques in predicting CRT responses, especially in LBBB patients, is
      still insufficient. Z Chen et al used T1 mapping technique to quantitatively assess the
      diffuse fibrosis burden of myocardial in heart failure patients. But they found focal
      fibrosis burden, not diffuse burden, is associated with a poor response to CRT. Other cardiac
      MR imaging parameters also showed potential predictors of CRT, such as 16 segment
      time-to-maximum radial wall thickness , scar locations and RV septal lead placement.In this
      study cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (including T1 Mapping combined with feature
      tracking imaging ) will be applied to follow up LV function in LBBB patients (with or without
      intervention) in 10 years to find out prognostic predictors and time point or CMR parameters
      for cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with CLBBB.
