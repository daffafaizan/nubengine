        1. To study the validity and reliability of estimation of the central venous pressure by
           measurement of internal jugular vein size using 2-dimensional ultrasound.

        2. To evaluate the correlation of internal jugular vein cross sectional area and central
           venous pressure.

      Methods:

        1. The study design is prospective observational study.

        2. We will include all patients scheduled for cardiac surgery in Siriraj Hospital and
           record both internal jugular size using 2-dimensional ultrasound just before central
           venous catheter insertion. The central venous pressure will be recorded and the
           ultrasound picture will be measured.

        3. The data will be analyzed.
