      claiming patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis are malnourished as indicated by
      diminished visceral proteins, anthropometric indexes, and micronutrient status. Zinc plays
      role in protecting cells from the damaging effects of free radicals. Zinc supplementation was
      shown to prevent pulmonary pathology due to hypoxia-induced lung damage in rats. The role of
      zinc in faster sputum smear conversion has not yet been studied. However, there are reports
      which confirms, in vitro cellular killing of tubercle bacilli by macrophages after zinc
      supplementation.

      We are investigating oral zinc supplement for its efficacy in TB patients in a "double-blind
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial" fashion. We are conducting this trial in
      Category-I pulmonary TB Patients (as per RNTCP, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
      Govt.of India), and are assessing the outcome in the form of clinical improvement, sputum
      conversion and immunological parameters. This is a multi-centric trial sponsored by the
      Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.

      Supplements and placebo have been prepared by Cadila pharmaceutical Ltd., India, in the form
      of tablets. Each micronutrient tablet contains 50mg zinc (as zinc sulphate) in a lactose
      matrix. The placebo consisted of lactose alone. Supplement and placebo capsules were
      indistinguishable in appearance both externally and internally. In this clinical trial one
      tablet of zinc as oral supplement will be given everyday during the entire course in line
      with the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy recommended by the World
      Health Organization.
