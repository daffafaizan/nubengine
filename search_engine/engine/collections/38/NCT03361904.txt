      criteria were: patients scheduled for partial colonoscopy, interventional colonoscopy (for
      stent insertion, stenosis dilation).

      Data collection The following data have been prospectively collected: age, gender, indication
      for colonoscopy, preparation procedure and quality of the preparation (assessed by the Boston
      Bowel Preparation Scale; BBPS) [19-20], caecal intubation (yes/no), withdrawal time, number
      and size of polyps and polyp histopathology.

      All clinical data were collected during the procedure by a nurse and an endoscopist on a
      dedicated software. The database was then supplemented by the Clinical Research Associate for
      histopathological data.

      We determined adenoma detection rate (ADR; percentage of colonoscopies with at least one
      adenoma), polyp detection rate (PDR: percentage of colonoscopies with at least one polyp),
      mean number of polyps per colonoscopy (MNP), large polyp detection rate (LPDR; percentage of
      colonoscopies with at least one polyp of 1 cm or more) and advanced neoplasia detection rate
      (ANDR: percentage of colonoscopies with at least one advanced neoplastic lesion as defined
      below).
