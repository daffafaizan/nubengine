      warming up, we asked the subjects to perform five full kicks. The kicking process was
      captured with a Vicon high-speed camera. The data captured by the motion capture system was
      then analyzed to analyze the angles, angular velocity, linear velocity, and ground reaction
      force of the hip, knee, and ankle joints of the hip, knee, and ankle supporting legs of
      female athletes of different levels during full kicks. Finally, the subjects of different
      levels are analyzed to find the significant differences in the supporting legs of female
      football players of different levels.
