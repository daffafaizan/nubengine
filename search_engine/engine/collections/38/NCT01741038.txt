      main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer
      provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug
      resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies
      for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a
      new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that
      have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies
      due to a mutation in KRAS or BRAF.

      This is a Phase II/III, randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, two arm study
      designed to determine the efficacy in terms of OS and the safety of the InSituVax (AlloStim+
      Cryoablation) personalized in-situ anti-cancer vaccine protocol (Treatment Arm) compared with
      Physician's Choice (PC) of Treatment + Cryoablation (Control Arm) in Metastatic Colorectal
      Cancer. Subjects are randomized 2:1 into the treatment or control arms.
