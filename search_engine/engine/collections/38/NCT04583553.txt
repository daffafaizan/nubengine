    
      Commercially available Vikor Scientific Urine-IDTM urine collection kits will be provided to
      the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Department of Urology by Vikor Scientific.

      Urine samples will be collected for both standard laboratory culture at KUMC Lab and
      expedited delivery to Vikor Scientific Lab for Urine-IDTM analysis. Vikor Scientific will
      cover all costs associated with sample delivery. If insufficient urine volume is collected
      for both standard laboratory culture at KUMC Lab and Vikor Scientific Urine-IDTM, urine will
      be preferentially used for standard laboratory culture at KUMC Lab.

      Provider clinical decision making will be based on standard laboratory cultures and therapy
      will not be adjusted based on Vikor Urine-IDTM results.
