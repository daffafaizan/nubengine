      to baby. The study will also assess risk factors associated with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      infection in pregnant women. Also, the study will describe the outcomes of pregnant women
      with HCV as well as the outcomes of their infants to 18 months of age.

      Approximately 750 HCV antibody positive pregnant women and their infants will be followed
      from baseline until the infant is 18 months. A randomly selected control cohort of 500
      pregnant women who are HCV antibody negative will be followed until delivery.
