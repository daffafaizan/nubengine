      and four-part fractures of proximal humerus were treated with Proximal Humerus Internal
      Locking System(PHILOS) and hemi-shoulder arthroplasty in multi-center. All the patients
      received the same rehabilitation course. At 6 months after surgery, postoperative
      complications were observed, EQ-5D was used to evaluate quality of life, and ASES score was
      used to assess functional outcomes.
