    
      50 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder who are not currently receiving treatment will be
      enrolled in a 12-week exercise program, supervised by a trained exercise interventionist.
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline for analysis of inflammatory cytokines, as well
      as other potential biological predictors of treatment outcomes (i.e., BDNF). Assessments will
      gather data on potential clinical predictors of treatment outcomes (anxiety, stress, sleep).
      Assessments and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the treatment
      period (Weeks 4, 8, and 12) to identify mediators and correlates of treatment effects.
