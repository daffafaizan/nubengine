      indicators in the determination of menopausal status. NCCN clinical practice guidelines for
      breast cancer recommend detecting the levels of FSH and E2 for amenorrhea patients less than
      60 years of age. But the detection method and the corresponding reference ranges indicating
      postmenopausal status are not mentioned. In addition, the reference limits vary a lot among
      different equipments and methods when it comes to diagnosis of menopause, thus it is
      difficult to set universal criteria. So in this study, four widely used methods and
      instruments in China are used to detect plasma levels of FSH, E2 and LN of premenopausal and
      postmenopausal patients. Instruments and methods must be one of the following four
      categories: microparticle chemiluminescent(Beckman),acridinium ester chemiluminescence
      (Siemens),acridinium ester chemiluminescence (Abbott) and electrochemiluminescence（Roche）.
