    
      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of early carious
      lesions (white spot lesions, or WSLs) for patients who are receiving orthodontic treatment
      compared to patients who are not receiving orthodontic treatment.

      Subjects will be recruited from the University of Kentucky Orthodontic Clinic patient pool.
      Orthodontic care at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCOD) is provided by
      orthodontic faculty, as well as students enrolled in the graduate orthodontic program at the
      UKCOD. Subjects will be invited to participate in this study after receiving an initial
      treatment plan with fixed appliances for at least one arch.
