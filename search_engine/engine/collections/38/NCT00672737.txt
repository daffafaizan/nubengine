      moderate-to-severe OSA have increased pain thresholds and are more sensitive to the analgesic
      effects of opioids compared to patients with normal sleep-related breathing physiology. We
      will evaluate the effect of remifentanil, a short acting mu-opioid receptor agonist, on pain
      using an experimental heat and cold-induced pain tests, and compare it between volunteers
      with and without a polysomnography (PSG)-based diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.
