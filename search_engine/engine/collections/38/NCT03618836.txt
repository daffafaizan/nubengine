      trimester. Inclusion criteria. : case is defined as spontaneous preterm births between 22 and
      36 weeks in one of the 14 centers. The "control" patient will be considered as the following
      delivery over â‰¥ 37 weeks in the same center.

      Multiple pregnancies, medical interruptions of pregnancy and deaths in utero will be
      excluded. Regarding the vaginal flora of cases and controls, the microorganisms will be
      researched and quantified by molecular methods.

      Expected results

      Patients and control patients will be compared for their demographic, obstetric, clinical and
      microbiological data. The parameters related to the risk of spontaneous prematurity at the p
      <0.20 threshold will then be analyzed by multi-level logistic regression.

      Implications At a time when the link between bacterial vaginosis and prematurity is
      controversial, the detection - or not - of microorganisms linked to the risk of prematurity
      will be a key issue.
