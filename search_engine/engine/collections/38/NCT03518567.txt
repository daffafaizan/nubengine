      marijuana, the effect of marijuana administration (High THC) on behavioral economic demand
      for marijuana, and marijuana smoking topography. The study will recruit 100 non-treatment
      seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least twice weekly. The relationship between
      hypothetical and actual demand for marijuana will be examined. We will also investigate
      relationship between demand for marijuana and indices of marijuana smoking topography. The
      study will recruit 100 non-treatment seeking marijuana users who smoke marijuana at least
      twice weekly to obtain a final sample of 85 with complete data (15% of attrition).
      Participants will be tested at a baseline session and during two experimental sessions (an ad
      libitum marijuana smoking session and a marijuana smoking topography session). This study
      will confirm the utility of the hypothetical marijuana purchase task as a reliable and valid
      tool for assessing behavioral economic marijuana demand.
