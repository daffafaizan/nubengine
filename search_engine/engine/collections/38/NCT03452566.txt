    
      Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm in the head and neck region,
      and when present in the lower lip, it is usually associated with prolonged exposure to UV
      radiation of lip vermilion surface especially in white patients (patients with genodermatosis
      such as xeroderma pigmentosum have extreme sensitivity to UV radiation, characterized by an
      even higher risk and patients presenting radiodermatites that can evolve to squamous cell
      carcinoma). Ingenol mebutate is a natural medicine derived from the sap of the pepense
      euphoria and much used for its medicinal properties.

      The objective of this study was to determine the toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of ingenol mebutate for treatment of actinic cheilitis in patients of the Oncology
      Dermatology Session of the National Cancer Institute of Brazil (INCA) through a phase 1
      clinical trial of type 3 + 3 and to determine the therapeutic response with a dose below the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metamato of ingenuity, for the treatment of aortic cheilitis
      in patients of the Oncology Dermatology Session of the National Cancer Institute (INCA)
      through a prospective clinical trial and phase randomized trial (phase 2).

      Actinic cheilitis is a major potentially carcinogenic disorder of the lower lip and several
      reports of clinical cases with excellent results for the treatment of this lesion that can
      differentiate to squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. However, clinical trials are lacking to
      define the optimal dosage of the drug for a therapeutic modality and to define its true
      efficacy in controlled studies of this pre-malignant labial lesion.
