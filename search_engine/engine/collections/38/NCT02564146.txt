      trial with two arms.

      To estimate the treatment effect on overall survival, feasibility, efficacy and safety of
      alternating treatment cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy followed by
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine relative to standard continuing nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine cycles
      in first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients having received 3 cycles
      of induction therapy with standard nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine.
