      cancer. Fatigue is measured again at the completion of radiation treatments and at one and
      three months following completion of radiation.

      Muscle measurements are made outside the treatment area using ct scans prior to radiation
      treatment, at the completion of radiation treatment and at one and three months after
      radiation treatment. The degree of fatigue and changes in muscle will be assessed. Changes
      will be correlated to determine if muscle loss contributes to fatigue.
