      the "Move for Health Program" (formally known as the Live Smart program) will be asked to
      participate. The "Move for Health" program is a 12-week, twice-weekly 60 minute program that
      includes both aerobic and strength training. The cognitive training (delivered by an Android
      Tablet) focuses on dual-task training and requires participants to employ higher-order
      cognitive abilities such as attention and executive function. 16 Participants in one group
      will complete cognitive training integrated into the Move for Health exercise program,
      whereas 16 participants in the other group (completing program on separate days) will
      complete the exercise program only. All participants will complete assessments of cognitive
      function, physical function, well-being, and self-efficacy before and after the programs.
      This study will be the first to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of
      a combined cognitive and exercise training program for older adults in a community-setting.
      If shown to be feasible, it has the potential for broader investigation and, eventually,
      wide-scale implementation to benefits the health of older Canadians.

      Note: Due to low recruitment rates, 11 participants were recruited in the Fall of 2019 and
      all completed the experimental intervention. 32 participants were recruited and randomized
      for the Winter of 2020. In response to COVID-19, the YMCA shut down and thus the intervention
      has halted prematurely after 6 weeks of program. Post-program updated demographic
      information, activity questionnaires (physical, cognitive, and social), and assessments for
      overall well-being and self-efficacy will be conducted over phone or video call.
