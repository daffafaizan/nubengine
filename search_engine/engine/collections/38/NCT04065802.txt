        1. Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation (STAR) ablation is a safe and feasible option for
           cardiomyopathy patients for management of refractory ventricular tachycardia.

        2. STAR can be performed with available cardiac imaging, prior mapping/electrogram
           information, and standard ECGs without a multi-electrode ECG vest.

      Study Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the safety of STAR in a local cohort

        2. Estimate effectiveness of STAR in reducing VT burden

      Study Design: Prospective single center, single arm, non-randomized trial.

      Number of patients: 20 patients

      Study Duration: Enrollment will occur over three years and at least minimum follow up of six
      months

      Study Population: Adult patients with a cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia who have
      failed conventional anti-arrhythmic management.

      Primary safety endpoint: Any treatment-related serious adverse events in the first 90 days.

      Primary efficacy endpoint: Reduction in VT episodes tracked by ICD with a six week blanking
      period.

      Statistical methodology: Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test to compare the number of
      treated episodes before and after.

      Assessment of events: Adjudicated by study investigators

      Economic Analysis: Costs and resources required for STAR .Compare costs between the patients
      undergoing STAR with conventional catheter-based VT ablation.
