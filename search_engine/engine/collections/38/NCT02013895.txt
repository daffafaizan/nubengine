      developed to facilitate investigations of regional hepatic function. A disadvantage of
      conventional 99mTc-GSA SPECT was poor anatomical resolution, and this newly developed SPECT
      has a tremendously improved anatomical resolution owing to the fusion of CT and 99mTc-GSA
      SPECT. Recent reports have indicated that accurate regional function, based on precise
      anatomical information, could be evaluated using this technique.
