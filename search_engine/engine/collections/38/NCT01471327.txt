      and variable airflow obstruction. Eosinophils are usually prominent in the airway
      inflammation seen in asthma and are considered a central cause in the pathogenesis of asthma.
      The expression of interleukin (IL)-5 is elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and
      bronchial biopsies in patients with asthma. Moreover, the level of IL-5 in BAL fluid and the
      bronchial mucosa correlates with disease severity. The cytokine IL-5 promotes eosinophil
      differentiation, recruitment and survival. Thus a therapeutic strategy which blocks IL-5,
      thereby suppressing eosinophilic inflammation, may have therapeutic benefit in asthma.

      SB-240563 (mepolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human interleukin 5
      (hIL-5) from binding to its receptor. Initial clinical studies investigated the safety and
      efficacy of SB-240563 for the treatment of asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD). SB-240563
      consistently and significantly reduced peripheral and tissue eosinophils in patients with
      these atopic conditions, including asthma, and in healthy volunteers.

      SB-240563 is currently under development for severe refractory asthma and a Phase IIB
      dose-ranging study using the IV route of administration is currently ongoing. This study will
      be a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose ascending, single dose study in
      Japanese healthy male subjects.

      Since this is the first study conducted in Japanese subjects, doses of SB-240563 will be
      administered in an ascending order. In studies conducted in non-Japanese subjects, SB-240563
      has been well-tolerated following single and repeated intravenous dose up to 750 mg
      (SB-240563/006, SB-240563/036 and MEE103226). Intravenous repeated doses of 75 mg, 250 mg and
      750 mg are being administered to non-Japanese asthma patients in an on-going Phase II study.
      In consideration of the above facts, single intravenous administration of 4 doses (10 mg, 75
      mg, 250 mg and 750 mg) of SB-240563 will be administered in this study. A single intravenous
      dose of 10 mg will be administered in order to explore the effect of a lower dose of
      SB-240563 than previously studied on blood eosinophil counts. This low dose is expected to
      help further characterize the concentration-response relationship based on blood eosinophils.

      This study is designed as a randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, single-blind
      study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of
      SB-240563 in Japanese male subjects.
