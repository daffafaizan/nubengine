      revascularization, TASC C lesions for surgical revascularization in patients with appropriate
      perioperative risk and available conduit. However, Based on the development of new tools,
      including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting stent, interwoven stents, debulking tools,
      more challenging femoropopliteal arterial lesions have been treated with endovascular
      procedures.

      Despite The shift of Endovascular- first strategy has been documented in recent literature.
      There still lack evidence to support either approach have a significant advantage over the
      other. And TASC D lesion ,especially with popliteal artery involved are often excluded in
      prospective clinical trials. Therefore, a well-designed real world study that track clinical
      relevant outcomes, are required to determine the optimal therapies for patients with complex
      femoropopliteal lesions.
