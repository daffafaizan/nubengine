      elective, cardiac surgical patients will be randomized to two different fluid therapy
      regimens, 5% human albumin only or Lactated Ringer's only, beginning in the intraoperative
      period and up to 6 hours in the intensive care unit. Providers and patients will be blinded
      to the fluid administered in the operating room and intensive care unit. The primary outcome
      measure will be the total volume of 5% human albumin or Lactated Ringer's given during the
      study period to maintain specified hemodynamic guidelines. Hemodynamic instability will be
      defined according to each patient's stipulated baseline parameters. Fluid will be
      administered at the request of providers in the operating room and intensive care unit in
      compliance with a perioperative fluid algorithm.
