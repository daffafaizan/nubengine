      prognostic markers are needed to better identify patients at risk of severe complications to
      better improve their care. By advancing understanding of the mechanisms of severe disease,
      treatments may be found to hinder the processes behind them. It is likely that different
      individuals react differently to the same microbe.

      From previous incidence data the investigators have estimated that it will be possible to
      recruit a minimum of 60 patients over the course of 2-3 years from Tampere and Turku
      University Hospitals. This sample size should contain a reasonably wide array of infections
      with varying stages of severity. The investigators will then gather genetic and
      transcriptomic data on these patients at three time points, as well as salival samples for
      antibody analysis, and throat cultures to screen for carriage of the pathogen in question.
      The genome of all the GAS strains obtained from the patients will also be sequenced. From
      this the investigators hope to derive information pertaining to the interplay of the patients
      immunologic response and the pathogens inherent characteristics.
