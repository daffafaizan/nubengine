      complications of liver cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), spontaneous bacterial
      peritonitis (SBP) and variceal bleeding, which are are directly caused or aggravated by the
      translocation of enteric bacteria or their products into the blood of cirrhotic
      patients.Preliminary studies have shown that selective intestinal decontamination appears to
      ameliorate the hyperdynamic circulatory state of cirrhosis. The investigators hypothesize
      that a modulation of gut microbiota by administering a non-adsorbable antibiotic, in addition
      to beta-blockers, can be a safe strategy to reduce the portal pressure, influencing favorably
      hemodynamics of portal circulation. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if in
      patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding, Rifaximin,
      administered in addition to standard therapy with beta - blockers (propranolol), for a time
      of 60 days: leads to a significant reduction of Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (it will be
      assessed by hepatic vein catheterization), 2) modify the intestinal flora in favor of
      specific families of bacteria (it will be assessed by fecal microbiota analysis), 3) change
      systemic inflammatory responses (it will be assessed by serum pro-inflammatory cytokines) 4)
      change in cognitive functions (it will be assessed by neuropsychological and
      electroencephalogram evaluations).
