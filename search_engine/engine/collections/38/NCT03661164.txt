    
      Purpose: To report three year follow up in pediatric patients with keratoconus after
      iontophoretic transepithelial corneal cross-linking (CXL) to assess preoperative factors that
      may influence ectasia progression.

      Methods: Thirthyfive eyes of 22 consecutive pediatric patients (mean age 14.3Â±2.5 years) with
      keratoconus are evaluated in this retrospective study. Subgroup A and B are made up in
      function of progression in maximum K (Kmax,) defined as steepening of 1.0 diopter or more
      recorded three year after CXL. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), spherical equivalent,
      topographic cone location, Kmax, posterior elevation of the thinnest point and thinnest point
      are evaluated. A paired Student t test is used to compare preoperative and 12, 24, and 36
      month postoperative da-ta. A P value <0.05 was considered significant.
