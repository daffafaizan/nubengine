      patients with colorectal cancer will either present with, or subsequently develop, liver
      metastases. In contrast to many other epithelial solid tumours, resection of colorectal
      cancer hepatic metastases results in long-term survival and even cure. However, despite state
      of the art CT imaging, 60-75% of patients who appear to have limited disease amenable to
      surgical resection will eventually die from extra-hepatic and recurrent hepatic metastases.
      If occult micrometastatic disease that becomes evident after liver resection could be
      detected reliably during pre-operative assessment, patients harboring more widespread disease
      could be spared a non-curative liver resection. This is one of the present challenges of
      liver surgery. PET imaging has the potential to improve the detection of both hepatic and
      extra-hepatic metastatic disease, not detected by conventional imaging modalities.

      This prospective, multicenter trial will enroll patients with colorectal cancer liver
      metastases considered resectable, based on CT scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which
      demonstrate no evidence of extra-hepatic disease. A full colonoscopy within the preceding 12
      months will ensure there is no local recurrence, or other primary cancer at the time of
      planned liver resection. These patients will be randomized to PET scan or not.
