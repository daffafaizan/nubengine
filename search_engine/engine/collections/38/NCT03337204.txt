      embedded within activities can help maintain or even restore cognitive and functional health
      in later life and stimulating activities that carry personal meaning or confer a sense of
      purpose may have stronger health-promoting effects than activities that are just stimulating.
      While the Experience Corps program-a community volunteering program for older adults designed
      to explicitly embed these characteristics-is an effective model for health-promotion, this
      program is not, as of yet, widely accessible. Further, formal volunteering is not always an
      activity that is attractive or accessible for older adults, and other interventions aimed at
      promoting social role involvement among older adults have shown only limited effectiveness in
      doing so. Thus, the current study explores whether it is possible to create an
      individually-tailored intervention that encourages older adults to 1) carefully examine their
      existing "activity portfolios" (technology-assisted self-monitoring), 2) empowers them with
      the knowledge and skills to make improvements upon their "activity portfolios" by
      enhancing/supplementing activities in ways that increase their overall levels of physical
      activity, cognitive activity, social interaction, and personal meaning (psycho-education +
      goal setting via a workshop), and 3) provides social support through peers in implementing
      their goals (one-on-one peer mentoring). Targeting a sample of community dwelling older
      adults who are at-risk for adverse cognitive and physical health outcomes due to their
      sedentary activity levels, we aim to influence positive changes in overall health and
      well-being in a way that is more practical, effective, and sustainable than prior
      interventions.
