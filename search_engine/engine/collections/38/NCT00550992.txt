    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare an early intensification regimen comprising two "acute myeloid leukemia"
           induction therapy blocks with a standard protocol IB regimen administered directly after
           induction therapy in medium-risk (MR) and high-risk (HR) patients with newly diagnosed
           acute lymphoblastic or biphenotypic leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To compare through a randomized study the role of these regimens in treating these
           patients.

        -  To compare the overall outcome of the Interfant-06 study with outcomes in the historical
           control series, especially in the Interfant-99 study.

        -  To compare the outcomes of low-risk, MR, or HR patients in this study with those of
           patients in the historical control series Interfant-99 study.

        -  To study which factors have independent prognostic value in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  To assess the role of stem cell transplantation in HR patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy:

             -  Prednisone phase: Patients receive prednisone orally or IV three times daily on
                days 1-7 and methotrexate (MTX) and prednisolone (PRDL) intrathecally (IT) on day
                1. Patients then proceed to remission induction therapy.

             -  Remission induction phase: Patients receive dexamethasone (DEXA) IV or orally three
                times daily on days 8-28 followed by a taper to 0 over 1 week; vincristine (VCR) IV
                on days 8, 15, 22, and 29; cytarabine (ARA-C) IV over 30 minutes on days 8-21;
                daunorubicin hydrochloride (DNR) IV over 1 hour on days 8 and 9; asparaginase (ASP)
                IV over 1 hour or intramuscularly (IM) on days 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 33; MTX IT
                on days 1 and 29*; and ARA-C IT on day 15. Patients also receive PRDL or
                therapeutic hydrocortisone (HC) IT on days 1, 15, and 29.

      NOTE: *Patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis also receive MTX IT on days 8 and
      22. If CNS leukemia is still present at day 29, then patients receive weekly MTX IT until the
      CNS is free of leukemia.

      After completion of induction therapy, patients are stratified according to risk group
      (low-risk [LR] vs medium-risk [MR] vs high-risk [HR]). Patients with low-risk disease are
      assigned to treatment arm I. Patients with MR or HR disease that is in complete remission
      (CR) on day 33 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. These patients are stratified
      according to status (MR with rearranged MLL vs MR with unknown MLL vs HR).
