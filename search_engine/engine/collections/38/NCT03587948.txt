    
      A cohort study. From January 2018 to 2028, 300 cases of diabetic children in Children's
      Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai will be selected as case group, and 300 healthy
      children without diabetes will be selected as the control group.

      The purpose of the study is to guide and regulate eye health screening of children and
      adolescents with diabetes in Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, build up
      the ranks with the general practitioner as the backbone combined, and provide comprehensive,
      continuous, and dynamic information service to diabetic eye disease health management. We
      expect to reduce the prevalence rate of diabetic eye disease, blindness and visual impairment
      of DR, and improve diabetics consciousness of eye health maintenance, thus upgrading the
      level of eye disease prevention and treatment in Shanghai.
