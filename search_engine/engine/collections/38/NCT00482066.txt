      20% of patients relapse within 18 months. The drugs used can also have significant side
      effects. Abatacept, also known as CTLA4Ig, acts by blocking vital costimulatory signals
      required for T lymphocytes to be activated. As ANCA associated vasculitis is believed to be
      an autoimmune condition and dependent on autoreactive T cells, there is some reason to
      believe this drug would be effective. Abatacept has already received a license by the FDA for
      use in Rheumatoid arthritis where it has proven to be effective even in patients unresponsive
      to Etanercept (TNF blockade).

      120 patients with AAV will be invited to take part in this study, from hospitals in the UK
      and Europe. The patients will receive standard therapy with methotrexate and steroids as well
      as 12 months of abatacept or placebo. They will be followed for a further 12 months.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relapse rate over 24 months, in patients
      with acute AAV, presenting at first diagnosis or relapse, in the two arms of the study.
