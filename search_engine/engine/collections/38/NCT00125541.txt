    
      A multicentre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of
      nanofiltered Cetor® (called C1-esteraseremmer-N during the development phase) for the
      treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) will be performed. This study (KB2003.01) consists
      of three parts: Part A - pharmacokinetics (phase II); Part B - treatment of attacks of
      angioedema (phase III); and Part C - prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor (phase III). Parts B +
      C will provide data on the efficacy of C1-esteraseremmer-N.

      The changes within the manufacturing process of C1-esteraseremmer-N, compared to Cetor®
      nanofiltration and omission of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, most likely will not affect
      tolerability. The nanofiltration will provide more safety regarding viruses.

      In part C of the study, a number of HAE patients will be treated prophylactically with
      open-label C1-esteraseremmer-N for a period of 16 weeks. The number of attacks occurring will
      be compared with historical data. If possible, also some patients treated prophylactically
      with C1 inhibitor for acquired angioedema will be included.
