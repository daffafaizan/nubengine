      using an individualized, computerized decision- aid (DA). The investigators will test the
      effectiveness of this implementation with 3 strategies in 16 clinics. Formative evaluation
      strategies will be used to assess needs at each clinic, with key clinic informants
      participating in semi-structured interviews. The study will enroll at least 500 patient
      participants across all 16 sites, who will review the decision aid and be asked a feasibility
      and acceptability assessment. At the conclusion of the study, key clinic informants, as well
      as selected patient participants will participate in semi-structured interviews to assess the
      effectiveness in implementing the DA in the clinic setting.
