      after pregnancy used intensive pelvic floor muscle training. While physical therapy appears
      to be effective in preventing urinary incontinence, extensive physical therapy is too costly
      to be implemented as a preventive measure for the general population. Thus, we want to asses
      if non-intensive pelvic floor therapy decreases the urinary incidence of incontinence during
      pregnancy and postpartum. We propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to obtain
      baseline data on the effect of non-intensive pelvic floor muscle training of urinary
      incontinence in primigravid women.
