      recruited to the study and randomized to one of two groups. Each enrolled subject will
      undergo two "back-to-back" procedures.

      Subjects in Group A (study group) will undergo a Standard view colonoscopy followed
      immediately by an EndoRings™ colonoscopy. Subjects in Group B (control group) will undergo an
      EndoRings™ colonoscopy followed immediately by a Standard view colonoscopy.

      Results from the two groups will be analyzed and compared, with primary outcome measures
      being adenoma miss rate and polyp miss rate. Secondary outcome measures will include
      withdrawal time, total procedure time and characteristics of polyps detected, including size
      and histological results.

      Subjects will be followed through a 24 hour and a 7-days telephone interview for analysis of
      unexpected adverse events. Clinical results will be analyzed using various statistical
      measures of significance.

      Multi-center study with up to 126 patients. Up to 126 treated patients (2 groups of 57
      patients +6 drop-out patients) will be enrolled into the study.
