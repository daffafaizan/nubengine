      bleaching using different hydrogen peroxide concentrations and with or without light
      activation. Sixty patients will be enrolled in this trial and divide equally into 4 groups
      according to the combination of the main factors hydrogen peroxide concentration (35% or 20%)
      or LED/laser activation (yes or no). Three 15-min applications will be performed in each
      clinical appointment. A LED/laser device will be used in the respective groups for three
      1-min application with an interval of 2 min. The same procedure will be repeated one week
      later. The color change will be assessed after hte 1st and 2nd session, after 1 week and 6
      months of the end of the treatment using a value-oriented shade Vita Classical and a
      spectrophotometer Easy Shade. The tooth sensitivity will be reported by patients using a 0 to
      10 visual analog scale. The Student t test (α = .05) will be used to compare the tooth color
      changes and the intensity of tooth sensitivity between groups at baseline and immediately
      after the first and second bleaching appointments. The Fisher exact test and Student t test
      (α = .05), respectively, will be used to analyze the percentage of patients with tooth
      sensitivity and its intensity.
