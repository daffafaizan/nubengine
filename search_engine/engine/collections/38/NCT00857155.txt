    
      Primary objective:

      We hypothesize that stratifying patients on clopidogrel into time-based platelet function
      recovery groups as determined by pre-operative clopidogrel response measured by point of care
      methods will result in similar rates of bleeding as compared to those of clopidogrel naïve
      patients undergoing elective CABG.

      Study design:

      This will be a single center, prospective study analyzing clopidogrel naïve patients and
      patients on clopidogrel with background aspirin therapy requiring CABG.
