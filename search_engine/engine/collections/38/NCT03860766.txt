      weeks of training associated with the LED application, being distributed in two applications
      per week, and a re-evaluation 24 hours after the last application, totaling a total of
      approximately 7 weeks. Thus, on the first day (Pre-test) volunteers will be submitted to
      anthropometric evaluation and evaluation by bioimpedance for analysis of detailed body
      composition. Then, the maximum voluntary contraction test (CVM) will be performed on the
      isokinetic dynamometer, together with the electromyographic evaluation. Before and after the
      evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, thermography will be collected. Still, will be
      evaluated the vertical jump test after 15 minutes of passive rest.

      After the initial evaluations, the researcher will go apply the respective interventions,
      which consist of applying LEDs all over the quadriceps and hamstring bilaterally, while the
      sham group (GS) will receive the LED application off, without the emission of light. The
      application will occur for five weeks and will occur twice weekly, on days spaced for at
      least 48 hours. The same will be done in conjunction with the lower limb strength training
      protocol.

      The tests performed at the time of pre-application of the LED (Pre-test) will be reapplied in
      the same order 24 hours after the last application of the interventions. After seven days of
      the last application, the isokinetic evaluation, electromyography, and vertical jump
      evaluation will be performed. In addition, at the end of the second and fourth weeks, the
      volunteer will carry out an evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, electromyography,
      plethysmography, and thermography.
