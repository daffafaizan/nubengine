      equal results in every patients. Research about personality factors involved in successful
      outcome after bariatric surgery has led to contrasting results. The existing literature about
      potential predictors of success after bariatric surgery is far from conclusive. The
      investigators want to evaluate preoperatively by standardized diagnostic interviews (MINI,
      SCID-II) and rating scales and questionnaires to assess co-morbid psychopathology. The same
      evaluation will be done after 1,2 and 5 years. The investigators will look for a relationship
      between psychological variables and success after bariatric surgery, including amount of
      weight loss, psychiatric comorbidity, quality of life and employment. The investigators will
      also investigate the purpose of an pre- and postoperative psychological intervention.
      Patients on a waiting list for bariatric surgery are randomised to an intervention- and a
      control group. The intervention is based on cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness, 6
      weeks preoperative and two weeks postoperative programme. Outcome measures are amount of
      weight loss, psychiatric comorbidity, quality of life and employment.
