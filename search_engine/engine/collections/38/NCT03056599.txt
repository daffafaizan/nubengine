      (Comparative In Vivo Oncology) system in patients with soft tissue sarcoma accessible for
      percutaneous injection. Patients who are scheduled for surgical biopsy or tumor resection
      surgery will be injected 4 to 72 hours prior to surgery using the CIVO device. Minute volumes
      (up to 8.3 microliters) of saline (negative control) or microdoses of anti-cancer agents will
      be percutaneously injected in a columnar fashion through each of 8 needles into a single
      solid tumor. Following the patient's biopsy surgery or tumor resection surgery, the injected
      portion and a small uninjected portion will be used to determine the in situ drug response in
      the tumor. None of the data from this evaluation will be shared with patients or used to make
      clinical decisions. Study clinicians will have access to the patient's health record for 1
      year after the study to monitor patient treatment responses. Such information will be used to
      help evaluate the correlation between clinical response and tumor response assessed via CIVO.
