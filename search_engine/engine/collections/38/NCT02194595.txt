    
      In this open-label, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial, adults with T2DM of â‰¤7 years
      duration on 0-2 anti-diabetic medications will be randomized to 8-weeks treatment with either
      (i) basal insulin glargine, (ii) intensive insulin therapy consisting of glargine and
      pre-meal insulin lispro, or (iii) glargine and the GLP-1 agonist exenatide (twice daily).
      They will then go into a 12-week washout on lifestyle modification only. Beta-cell function
      will be assessed by determining the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) on oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 20-weeks. The
      primary outcome will be mean beta-cell function (ISSI-2) over the 8-week treatment period.
