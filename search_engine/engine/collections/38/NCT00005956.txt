        -  Evaluate the immune response of patients with HER2/neu expressing advanced malignancies
           showing no evidence of disease after standard treatment when injected with HER2/neu
           intracellular domain protein pulsed autologous dendritic cells.

        -  Assess time to recurrence in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are pulsed with HER2/neu intracellular domain
      protein (ICD). The pulsed DC are administered subcutaneously (SQ) and intradermally, followed
      by autologous DC mixed with tetanus toxoid (TT) and autologous DC mixed with keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH) SQ and intradermally on day 1. HLA-A2 positive patients also receive
      autologous DC mixed with CMV pp65 peptide SQ and intradermally on day 1. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 months.
