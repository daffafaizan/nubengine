    
      The following patients can be included in this registry:

      Children and adults with

        -  Medulloblastoma (MB)

        -  Ependymoma

        -  CNS-primitive neuroectodermal tumours (CNS-PNET) including CNS neuroblastoma, CNS
           ganglioneuroblastoma, Medulloepithelioma, Ependymoblastoma, CNS-PNET not otherwise
           specified (NOS)

        -  Pineoblastoma

        -  Pineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation

        -  Papillary tumour of the pineal region Who are not included in prospective clinical
           trials for these conditions

      The objectives of this registry are

        -  To evaluate clinical data on the epidemiology of the above mentioned CNS-neoplasms, and
           the use and outcome of different treatment regimens, for patients who cannot be included
           in prospective trials.

        -  To provide guidelines to establish, maintain and improve systems for quality assurance
           in the diagnostic assessments and treatment of brain tumours.

      To collect biological specimens (tumour, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral blood) and
      perform comprehensive biological studies with the aim to improve our understanding of these
      diseases and their aetiology, to improve therapy stratification and to improve or develop new
      treatment options.

      - To collect clinical data for cooperative scientific projects (e.g. new follow-up studies,
      studies on quality of survival, neuropsychology etc.)
