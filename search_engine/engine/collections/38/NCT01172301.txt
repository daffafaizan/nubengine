      mixture (dose of 6.7 g) will stimulate protein anabolism to a greater extent than a standard
      balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino acids in CF pediatric subjects.
      The principal endpoints will be the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate and the
      reduction in endogenous protein breakdown. The current project will provide information that
      will enable us to better understand the underlying metabolic mechanisms that regulate protein
      metabolism in pediatric subjects with CF.
