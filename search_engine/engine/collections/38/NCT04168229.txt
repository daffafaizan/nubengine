      new devices are expected to perform as well or better than the previous ITE devices.

      The aim of the testing is to grant quality control prior to product launch according to
      Bernafon development requirements.

      The current study will evaluate a new ITE hearing aid hardware. The firmware driving the
      hearing aid has already been sold on the market using the BTE hardware for almost one year
      and will now be launched using the ITE custom hardware. The goal is to evaluate the
      audiological performance, usability, feature function, and to identify unexpected or unwanted
      behaviour from the devices. The study plans to compare the two hardware styles regarding the
      benefit received from different microphone locations.

      As human subjects are involved the validation falls under the definition of a clinical
      investigation. The validation will address the performance of the new chip using the ITE
      hardware, and ensure that there is no reduction in speech understanding between using the BTE
      and ITE hardware styles. Evaluating the overall performance of the Mermaid 9 ITE devices is
      important to validate that the end user is satisfied with the devices and that all user
      requirements are fulfilled. All features available in Mermaid 9 have been validated and are
      currently used on the market in Mermaid 9 BTE devices.
