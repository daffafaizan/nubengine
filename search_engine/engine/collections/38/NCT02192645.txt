      then repeated in the second and third years. Eligible participants diagnosed with PAR were
      randomized at a ratio of 2:2:1 into one of three groups: (a) SHP group; (b) placebo group; or
      (c) waiting-list group. The waiting-list group will receive no treatment in the first year,
      but will receive SHP in the following two years. The primary outcome, total nasal symptoms
      score, is self-assessed at the beginning of each treatment session and during each annual
      follow-up. Secondary outcomes include the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire,
      allergic rhinitis attacks, and relief medications. The trial will be stopped if early
      termination criteria are met during the interim analysis.
