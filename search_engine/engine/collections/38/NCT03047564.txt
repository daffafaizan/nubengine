      surgery, after 3 month, 1 year and 5 years.

      Blood samples are collected in 7.5 ml S-Monovette® tubes (for trace metal analysis, Sarstedt
      AG, Germany) using a specific steel needle for trace metal analysis (Sarstedt AG, Germany).
      Within one hour, plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for ten minutes. Samples
      were stored at -20°C before being analysed for chromium, cobalt, molybdenum and nickel
      content using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer Z-8270 with
      Polarisation-Zeeman-Absorption (Hitachi Ltd., Japan). The accuracy and precision of the
      method is validated to < 10% using the control materials SeronormTM Trace Elements Serum
      (SERO AS, Norway). The detection limit of the method is estimated at 0.5µg/l for chromium,
      cobalt and molybdenum, 1.0µg/l for nickel (mean + 3 standard deviations from buffer). All
      probes having ion levels below the detection limit were adjusted to 0.25µg/l for chromium,
      cobalt and molybdenum and 0.5µg/l for nickel.

      Clinical outcome is measured with the Knee Society Score, Oxford Knee Score, Short-Form 36
      and University of Los Angeles Activity Score.
