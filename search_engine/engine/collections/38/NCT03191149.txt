      I. To evaluate the best objective response rate of AZD9291 (osimertinib) among patients with
      EGFR exon 20 insertions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of 160 mg once daily (QD) dose of AZD9291 (osimertinib) in
      patients with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival. III. To determine the overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize molecular markers of response to treatment in circulating tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      II. To evaluate biomarkers of response to treatment through retrospective analyses of
      pre-treatment tumor tissue.

      III. To identify resistance mechanisms to AZD9291 (osimertinib) through post-progression
      tumor biopsies and circulating tumor (ct)DNA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months
      for up to 5 years.
