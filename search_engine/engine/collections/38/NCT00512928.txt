      carboxylation reaction of Gla-proteins. In this respect it is important to quantify the
      dose-response relationship of the interaction between oral anticoagulants and menaquinone-7.
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate at what menaquinone-7 intake the vitamin
      will interfere with oral anticoagulants in a clinically relevant way. Clinically relevant is
      defined as a decrease in level of anticoagulation that would require a change in oral
      anticoagulant treatment in order to stay within target levels. Secondary objective of the
      study is to investigate changes in carboxylation level of osteocalcin and matrix-gla protein
      after menaquinone-7 supplementation during the oral anticoagulation treatment period. This
      will demonstrate whether during oral anticoagulation menaquinone-7 will be transported
      preferentially to the liver or to other target tissues.
