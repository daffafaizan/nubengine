      and aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). These are multifactorial vascular disorders caused
      by complex genetic and environmental factors. Older patients with more comorbidity are often
      affected. Open abdominal aortic surgery is associated with high mortality rate. Even in
      specialised institutions it varies from 2 to 5%. Similar results can be compared to mortality
      for coronary artery bypass grafting. This reflects the complexity of the surgery and the
      general health of those patients. It is associated with intravascular volume blood loss and,
      thereby, with a high requirement for blood and blood products transfusion. Allogenic blood
      transfusion (ABT) has been associated with an increased risk of tumour recurrence,
      postoperative infection, acute lung injury, perioperative myocardial infarction,
      postoperative low-output cardiac failure, and increased mortality.

      In the last decades, multiple strategies have been undertaken to prevent massive
      intraoperative blood loss during elective surgery and allogenic blood transfusion
      requirement. One of the method advocates a preoperative increase in red blood cells level
      using B12, folic acid and iron supplements or with erythropoietin usage. Other methods
      involve the optimisation of surgical technique and the use of a machine for intraoperative
      blood salvage, known as "cell saver".

      The aim of this study was to establish the rate for ABT during elective open abdominal aortic
      surgery, find parameters associated with ABT requirements, and optimise the investigators
      hospital's maximum surgical blood ordering schedule (MSBOS).
