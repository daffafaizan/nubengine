      with a prevalence of approximately 10% among unselected hypertensive populations. Subtype
      diagnosis is crucial because unilateral primary aldosteronism can be treated by laparoscopic
      adrenalectomy or open surgery, which may result in a cure or significant improvement of blood
      pressure, thus decreases the incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular complications. Currently,
      adrenal venous sampling (AVS) serves as the gold standard for subtyping of PA. Given that the
      right adrenal vein is angled caudally in most patients, AVS via an antecubital approach was
      performed since January 2012 at the Fuwai Hospital. So far, there have been more than fifteen
      hospitals to have some experience on AVS via antecubital approach with investigators' helps.
      The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of AVS via the antecubital approach.
