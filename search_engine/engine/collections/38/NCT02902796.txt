      1000 hertz frequency stimulation or standard stimulation in patients who have a spinal cord
      stimulators implanted. Each patients will be randomized to either group A or B, where each
      groups consists of Burst, standard, and 1000 hertz frequency stimulation or vice versa with
      wash off period in between. The duration for each stimulation modes will be approximately 3
      weeks, with approximately 4 days of wash off prior to starting the new stimulation mode and
      in between stimulation modes. Treatment duration for each groups will last about 3 months or
      less, and with cross over total duration of the study is about 6 months in total.

      During the trial there will be 13 visits. The first visit will consist of screening visit
      activities and once the eligibility of the subjects are confirmed, they will be randomized
      and they can start the study immediately and begin their wash off period. After the initial
      visit/ randomization visit, there will be 12 follow up visits. At each visit, patients will
      be assessed for their pain, disability index, and their perception of their painful
      condition, as well as any adverse events and changes of medication usage or lack there of. At
      the end of the study, the data will be pooled to look at the pain level, disability index,
      and patients perceived changes in their painful condition for each treatment groups (Burst
      stimulation, 1000 hertz stimulation and standard stimulation) to determine if subject
      experienced equivocal pain relief from all three stimulation modes.
