    
      A randomized, controlled, and single-blind trial will be performed. Patients over 18 years
      who have been admitted to intensive care units with the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease at risk
      of presenting PICS will be recruited.

      The study subjects will be divided into two arms, and the intervention program will be
      compared to the standard care clinical practice.

      The program will consist of early care (first visit at one month of hospital discharge),
      therapeutic education on prevention and management of PICS and chronic pain during three
      medical visits in six months, and psychological treatment in patients at risk for emotional
      distress.

      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of the program on health-related life quality at
      six months after hospital discharge.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To assess the health-related life quality at three months after hospital discharge.

        2. To quantify the incidence of chronic pain, its characteristics, and the degree of
           functional limitation at three and six months after hospital discharge.

        3. To quantify the incidence of anxiety and depression at three and six months after
           hospital discharge.

        4. Quantify the incidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after
           hospital discharge.
