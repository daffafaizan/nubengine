      patches. There are forms of vitiligo which are more resistant to treatment, including
      segmental vitiligo and acral vitiligo. Previous studies have shown that a low energy
      helium-neon (633 nm) laser can cause increased proliferation of melanocytes and
      repigmentation in segmental-type vitiligo. The goal of this study is to verify these results
      and show efficacy in other recalcitrant forms of vitiligo including acral vitiligo and post
      melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation vitiligo.
