      newly diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared to hospital or standard care alone.

      AIM: to test the feasibility and clinical impact of home vs. hospital based resistance
      training programs in adults newly diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared to standard care.

      Objective 1: to describe the feasibility (defined as acceptability, compliance, recruitment
      and retention) of the two intervention models and control; Secondary outcome measures:
      Objective 2: to test their tolerability (patients' perception) and safety (number of adverse
      events due to the exercise); Objective 3: to explore the effect of the interventions on
      clinical outcomes (muscle mass, treatment related toxicities, strength, functional capacity,
      quality of life, fatigue); Objective 4: to evaluate the associated health resources use
      (unplanned medical appointments, acute and emergency visits and hospital admissions) in the
      intervention and control arms.

      Study design: the investigators designed a three arm, randomised, open label, phase II trial,
      in advanced cancer patients, comparing 1) standard treatment concomitant with a resistance
      training program at home; 2) standard treatment concomitant with a resistance training
      program at the hospital; 3) standard treatment alone.

      Overall trial start date: 01/05/2016 Overall trial end date: 31/03/2017 Condition: Advanced
      cancer Interventions: Resistance training at home, resistance training at the hospital
