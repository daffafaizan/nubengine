    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of STEMI
      patients that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and clinical
      outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will establish a
      prospective registry of 1000 STEMI patients in 10 sites with follow-ups of up to 5 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate myocardial tissue features and functional changes in STEMI patients.

        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in STEMI patients.

        4. To compare myocardial tissue characteristics and functional changes in STEMI and NSTEMI
           patients (data derived from EARLY-MYO-CMR II Registry).
