      participants will be randomly allocated into verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or usual
      care groups, in a 2:2:1 ratio. The verum acupuncture group will receive twenty verum
      acupuncture treatments over an eight-week period, while the sham acupuncture group will
      receive sham acupuncture treatments with non-penetrating needling. Participants assigned to
      the usual care group are scheduled to receive twenty verum acupuncture treatments for free
      after waiting 24 weeks. Health education will be provided to participants in the three
      groups. The primary outcomes will be the changes in the mean number of migraine days and
      migraine attacks per four-week cycle. The secondary outcomes will be as follows: the
      proportion of responders, migraine intensity, migraine disability assessment questionnaire,
      health-related and sleep-related quality of life, the dose of intake of acute medication.
      Chinese medicine factors will include de qi sensations and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      constitution. Psychological outcomes will include anxiety, depression, personality,
      expectancy about acupuncture, and doctor-patient relationship. The central randomization and
      data collection will be conducted by an electronic data management system.
