      cardiac disorders. However, quality of life and physical activity have been scarcely analysed
      in children with inherited cardiac arrhythmia or inherited cardiomyopathies. Moreover,
      current guidelines on the eligibility of young athletes with inherited cardiac disorders for
      sports participation mainly rely on expert opinions and remain controversial.

      The QUALIMYORYTHM trial is a multicentre controlled study. The main objective is to compare
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children aged 6 to 18 years old with inherited
      cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic
      ventricular tachycardia, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia), or inherited
      cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy), to that of age and
      gender-matched healthy subjects. The secondary objective is to assess, in this population,
      HRQoL according to the disease clinical and genetic characteristics, the level of physical
      activity and motivation for sports, the exercise capacity (VO2max), and the socio-demographic
      data. Participants will wear a fitness tracker (actimeter watch) for 2 weeks. A total of 214
      children are required to observe a significant difference of 7 Â± 15 points in the PedsQL,
      with a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%.

      The QUALIMYORYTHM trial intends to improve the level of evidence for future guidelines on
      sports eligibility in this population.
