      will receive a "sham light" treatment (Group 1). Essentially, a sham light treatment refers
      to regular light (not LED) exposure for 20 minutes. The sham light comes from the same device
      as the treatment light (Omnilux machine) however, this light has no anticipated effects on
      wound healing and is used simply to reduce the amount of bias that sometimes complicates the
      results of these studies. There is no added risk or benefit for the patients in the control
      group exposed to the sham light. Both groups will receive the standard care of wounds on the
      lower extremity.

      Groups 1 and 2 will receive 4 sham light or treatment sessions, respectively (one session
      every week for 4 weeks). After these sessions are done, all subjects will continue weekly
      follow up visits until the wound is closed, or 3 months after the surgery have passed; which
      ever happens first.

      One final follow up visit will occur 1 week after the wound closed.
