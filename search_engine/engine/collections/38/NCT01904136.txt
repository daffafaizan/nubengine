    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate safety, tolerability and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of expanded
      natural killer (NK) cells to be used in patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing a
      haploidentical stem-cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine survival of NK cells in vivo post-transplant. II. To determine the function
      of NK cells post-transplant and compare with a retrospective control treated with no NK
      cells.

      III. To estimate the proportion of patients with engraftment/graft failure. IV. To estimate
      the non-relapse mortality (NRM) at day 100 post-transplant. V. To estimate the cumulative
      incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD (acute graft-versus-host disease) at day 100.

      VI. To assess the rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within the first year post
      transplantation.

      VII. To assess immune reconstitution post-transplant. VIII. To assess disease response,
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after transplantation.

      IX. To perform a retrospective comparison of patients treated on the study with NK cells will
      be performed with a Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)
      control of similar patients who did not receive NK cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NK cells followed by a phase II study.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 conditioning regimens.

      MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on day -7, fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -4, undergo total-body
      irradiation (TBI) on day -3, and NK cells IV over 30 minutes on day -2 or -1.

      NON-MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day
      -7, fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -4, undergo TBI on day -3, and receive NK cells
      IV over 30 minutes on day -2 or -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow
      transplant on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV
      over 3 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus IV beginning on day 5 for 2 weeks and then orally
      (PO) for approximately 4 months, and mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) beginning on
      day 5 for approximately 6-7 months.

      NK CELLS: Patients receive NK cells IV over 30 minutes on days 7 and 28-90.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
