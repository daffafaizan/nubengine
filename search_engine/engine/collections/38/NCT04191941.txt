      complex based outer memberane structure, this kind of structure enables the CAR-T cells to
      simultaneously target one or two targets on the tumor cell surface and enhance CAR-T cell
      persistence in tumor microenvironmentï¼Œas well as stimulating innate T/NK cell activation and
      expansion.
