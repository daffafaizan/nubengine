      Both components of the two groups were treated by four rehabilitation sessions defined as
      "standard". This involves joint health and passive mobility for the glenohumeral and
      scapulothoracic joints for a period of about 45 minutes each.

      The patients of the sample group underwent the application of the NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT)
      before each rehabilitative session. The control group was addressed exclusively to the
      "standard" treatment. The sessions were spaced apart about five days to ensure the optimum
      adhesion of NMT.

      The results were evaluated by administering rating scales for pain (VAS) and spasticity
      (Modified Ashworth Scale). The ROM was evaluated using the manual goniometer. The outcomes
      (Pain, Spasticity, ROM) were assessed at base line, before and after each treatment session
      and at 1 month follow up.
