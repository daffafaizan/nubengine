      represent an early marker for neurocognitive improvements related to Kuvan treatment. As a
      first step in the study, 20 patients with PKU who are ≥ 6 years of age will receive baseline
      functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) evaluations before being treated
      with Kuvan™. Response to Kuvan™ will be monitored for 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks,
      response to Kuvan™ will be reviewed and all 20 patients will receive follow-up fcMRI
      evaluations. Fifteen patients with a reduction of ≥ 20% in blood phenylalanine will continue
      in the study and receive a third fcMRI evaluation at the end of 6 months of treatment with
      Kuvan™. For comparison purposes and to control for possible practice effects in repeated
      testing, a matched control group of 20 healthy individuals without PKU will used. All 20 of
      the control subjects will receive baseline and 4-week fcMRI evaluations; fifteen will receive
      a 6-month evaluation.
