      participants to receive seasonal trivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine (A/H1N1;
      A/H3N2 and B) or placebo (phosphate buffered saline). A total of about 480 healthy male and
      female adults 18 through 65 years of age; 320 participants will be randomized to receive
      vaccine and160 will receive placebo (a 2:1 ratio). At least 25% of the participants (N=120)
      will be >/= 45 years of age (80 vaccine and 40 placebo recipients).

      Safety will be assessed in all participants through Day 91. Immunogenicity will be assessed
      in serum samples obtained at baseline and 21 days after vaccination in a subset of at least
      100 individuals randomized to study vaccine and 50 placebo recipients.
