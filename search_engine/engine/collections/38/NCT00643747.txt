      administration of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV 2/2.hRPE65p.hRPE65) at
      three different dosage levels in individuals with autosomal recessive severe early-onset
      retinal degeneration due to mutations in RPE65. We have a comprehensive clinical monitoring
      plan to investigate the safety and efficacy of vector delivery.
