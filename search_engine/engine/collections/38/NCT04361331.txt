      accompanied by metastasis, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN guidelines hepatobiliary cancer, 2019)
      recommend that the current treatment options are limited, mainly recommending gemcitabine
      combined with platinum-based antitumor drugs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.) chemotherapy as
      first-line treatment. Adding targeted drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effect. For those with
      microsatellite instability, it is recommended to add anti-PD1(programmed cell death protein
      1) antibody. Gemox chemotherapy (oxaliplatin + gemcitabine) has been used in the treatment of
      advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but the efficacy is still not satisfactory.
      Lenvatinib is a small-molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that is currently approved for
      first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, the anti-PD1
      antibody has shown efficacy in the treatment of primary liver cancer. Lenvatinib combined
      with anti-PD1 antibody or chemotherapy may have a better effect than single use for advanced
      ICC. At present, lenvatinib combined with anti-PD1 antibody or lenvatinib combined with Gemox
      in the first-line treatment of advanced ICC has not been reported.
