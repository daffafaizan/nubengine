      toxicities including heart failure (HF), hypertension, arrhythmias and ischemic heart
      disease. While the presence of cardiac events may be a class effect of proteasome inhibitors
      (PI), the effect may be more profound with the irreversible inhibition of carfilzomib
      compared with reversible inhibition with bortezomib. Data available from currently published
      clinical trials may be inadequate to fully understand the incidence and severity of cardiac
      injury in patients treated with proteasome inhibitors because the trials were not designed to
      fully assess cardiac events. The purpose of this study is to better define and understand
      potential cardiac toxicity and begin to understand optimal management strategies.
