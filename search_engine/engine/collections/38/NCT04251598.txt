      program, based on social cognitive theory, on parents' sun-protection product use and sun
      avoidance behaviors. Organized as a randomized controlled experimental study conducted on
      three groups with a pre- and post-test follow-up design, the study was carried out in
      Manavgat between April 2018 and October 2018 and included the participation of 185 parents,
      of which 63 were in the education group, 62 were in the education+SMS group, and 60 were in
      the control group. The parents in the intervention group were administered the "I Am
      Protecting My Child from the Sun" program for a period of six weeks, while the education+SMS
      group, in addition to the program, also received a total of 25 short text messages twice a
      week. Data were collected using the Parent Information Form, Skin Cancer Risk Perception
      Form, Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge Scale, Parental Self-Efficacy Scale, Parental Sun
      Protection Scales, and Parent Behaviors Regarding Protecting Themselves and Their Children
      from The Sun Question Form.
