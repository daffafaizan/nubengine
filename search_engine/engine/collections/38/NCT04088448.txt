      Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. In order to
      explain, at least in part, such variable efficacy, we have shown that SSRI administration
      does not affect mood per se but, by enhancing neural plasticity, amplifies the influence of
      the living conditions on mood. Consequently, in a favorable environment, SSRI treatment leads
      to a reduction of symptoms while, in stressful conditions, it could lead to a worse
      prognosis. Here, we test the hypothesis that, given the clear association between living
      conditions and metabolic profile, the modulation of the latter may mimic the effect of the
      environment on SSRI outcome, determining treatment efficacy.

      Metformin is widely used as a first line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      for more than 60 years for the reduction of hepatic glucose output and increase of the
      insulin mediated utilization of glucose. Previous studies demonstrated that metformin can
      rapidly cross the blood brain barrier and has several beneficial effects in the brain such as
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, metformin, along with its
      anti-glycemic effects, has been documented to possess anti-depression effects in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. In Guo's study, 58 participants diagnosed with depression and type 2
      diabetes were divided into two groups: one treated with metformin and the other with a
      placebo for 24 weeks. Analysis of MADRS and HRSD-17 scores showed that metformin
      significantly reduced MADRS scores and HRSD-17 scores. Metformin administration improves
      depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
