      induces an increase in calcification and atherosclerosis. Elevated FGF-23 levels are already
      found in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it has been shown that high FGF-23
      levels are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and increased overall
      mortality.

      Method: In this pilot study a total number of 30 patients on maintenance haemodialysis will
      be enrolled. The investigator will examine the course of FGF-23 and PTH levels during a
      single hemodialysis session. In addition, the T-50 time, a novel non-traditional
      cardiovascular risk factor as well as further parameters of sHPT, such as serum calcium
      (sCa), phosphate (P), 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D
      (1,25(OH)2D) will be assessed.

      Hypothesis and specific aims: The major end point of the study is the level of FGF-23 and PTH
      at three points during hemodialysis treatment. As secondary end points the T-50 calcification
      propensity and further parameters of sHPT, as well as the correlation between these
      parameters will be measured.

      Hemodialysis is classified as a kidney replacement therapy and FGF-23 and PTH are partly
      metabolized and excreted by the kidneys. Based on this the investigator hypothesize that
      FGF-23 and PTH levels are at their highest at the beginning of dialysis and decrease during
      the treatment.
