      a nonrandomised case-controlled prospective study of consecutive patients with parastomal
      hernia.

      Summary Background Data: Two reviews of uncontrolled studies concluded that the Sugarbaker
      repair is superior to the Keyhole repair. The present study challenges the claim.

      Methods: In two time periods 135 patients with a parastomal hernia were repaired with the
      Keyhole technique (74 patients, using a two-layer mesh of polypropylene and ePTFE with a
      self-cut slit, 1997- 2009) or the Sugarbaker technique (61 patients, using a coated
      polypropylene mesh, 2009-2015). The patients in the two groups matched with regard to age,
      gender, ASA score, colostomy or ileostomy hernia, previous repairs, size of fascial defect
      and simultaneous repair of a concurrent incisional hernia. Observation time was defined as
      time to recurrence, stoma re-siting, mesh removal, death, or last non-event visit
