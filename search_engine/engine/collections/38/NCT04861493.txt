      mucosal surfaces against pathogens. Dysregulated expression of AMPs has been considered a
      possible causal mechanistic link in the microbial dysbiosis associated with periodontal
      disease and some risk factors, including tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and
      obesity.Antimicrobial peptides as a part of innate immunity are important molecules that
      provide a balance between disease and health. Moreover, they are considered to be an
      important intermediate step in initiating an initial immune response against the microbial
      side of the gingival epithelium and in the transition to acquired immunity. Cathelicidins, in
      particular - which play an important role in regulating the immunological response of oral
      tissues, are a group of peptides released from neutrophil granules and they are present only
      in humans in the form of LL-37.
