      randomized crossover study. Upon enrollment, all subjects will enter a 4-week run-in egg-free
      period where they will refrain from consuming any egg-based foods (Period 1). Subjects will
      then enter the first intervention period, where they be randomly assigned to consume either 3
      whole eggs/day or the equivalent amount of egg white-based egg substitute/day for 4 weeks
      (Period 2). Afterwards, subjects will enter a 4-week washout period where egg-based foods are
      restricted (Period 3), followed by a second intervention period, where they be assigned to
      the alternative whole egg- or egg white-based treatment for 4 weeks (Period 4). Subjects will
      come to the Department of Biology at Fairfield University every two weeks to check-in, and to
      pick up their egg products during the intervention periods. Subjects will be asked to
      maintain their normal diet and physical activity practices throughout all periods of the
      study. Subjects will complete 5-day dietary records and physical activity logs at the end of
      each study period.
