      Hyponatraemia exists in many cases of Cancer. The Cancer cell's viability depends on
      Angiogenesis and formation of blood vessels that carry water and nutrient to the
      rapidly-dividing Cancer cells. This study tests the hypothesis that disrupting the water
      content of blood could lead to increasing its Tonicity and hence withdrawing water from the
      Cancer cells by Osmosis, which can result in disrupting the growth of the Cancer cell itself.
      This disruption of Blood Water content can be achieved using Osmotic Pressure differential
      via immersing the whole body in Hypertonic Saline Solution for a certain amount of time, thus
      making the Blood more Hypertonic relative to the cells of the body and of the cancer, leading
      to water withdrawal from the cells of the body and of the cancer. While body's cells can
      sustain temporary dehydration, Cancer cells could be negatively affected.
