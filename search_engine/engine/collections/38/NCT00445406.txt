      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride
           liposome in women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Identify surrogate markers of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor
           (VEGF), VEGF receptor 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses*.
      Patients then receive bevacizumab alone IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses with
      bevacizumab repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive additional courses of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome at the
      discretion of the primary investigator.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, on day 1 of course 3 and then once every 3 months
      during study treatment, and after completion of study treatment. Samples are analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the level of circulating angiogenesis-related
      molecules, including serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor 1, and
      matrix metalloproteinase 9.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
