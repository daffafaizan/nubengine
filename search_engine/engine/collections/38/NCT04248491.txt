      below the umbilicus and is severe enough to cause functional impairment or require treatment.
      The health care burden of CPP is substantial. First line treatments involve a
      multidisciplinary approach and include general relaxation and stress management, patient
      education, self-care and behavioral modification, and pain management. Second-line agents
      include physical therapy (avoiding kegel exercises), and oral and intravesical agents. More
      invasive options including neuromodulation.

      The Emsella chair is currently approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence.
      Chronic pelvic pain patients may benefit from treatment. The Emsella chair generates
      electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles
      inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor muscles. The Emsella
      chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment
      of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related discorders. HIFEM technology induces deep
      pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises
      over 28 minutes.
