      in the workplace can decrease ambient melamine exposure, oxidative stress markers (such as
      8-hydoxy-2-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde)and indicators of early renal damage (such as
      N-acetyl β-D-glucosaminidase, microalbumin and β2-microglobulin). The one week before
      intervention and the second week after intervention, the volunteers were asked to collect
      their urine samples for one consecutive week during mornings and afternoons. Blood samples
      were taken on Fridays morning, workplace air was sampled for 5 consecutive days. Then the
      investigators continued to trace the melamine concentration change of volunteers and
      workplace every three-month intervals after intervention, and blood samples were taken on
      12th and 24th month.
