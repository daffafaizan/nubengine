        -  Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and are
           increasingly recognized in prostate and pancreatic cancers.

        -  Basal/ Triple negative breast cancer is associated with BRCA mutations in some
           ethnicities.However the link between BRCA gene mutations and Basil/ triple negative
           disease in Hispanic/ Latino women is not known.

        -  Common recurrent mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 exist in Hispanic/ Latino communities.

        -  New therapies such as PARP inhibitors may be particularly effective in BRCA mutation
           carriers.

        -  Therefore a unique opportunity exists to identify women in this underserved minority
           that may be eligible for and benefit from new targeted therapies.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - The primary objective is to collect saliva samples and histology data from up to 2000
      Hispanic/ Latino subjects with breast cancer as a source of DNA, and to analyze the BRCA1 and
      BRCA2 genes..

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - All Hispanics females, over the age of 18, with breast cancer will be eligible.

      DESIGN:

      - Natural history study of 2000 Hispanic/Latino women with breast cancer, 1000 with triple

      negative disease, 1000 without.

        -  Obtain clinical pathology reports and relevant history data on all subjects.

        -  Analyze recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
