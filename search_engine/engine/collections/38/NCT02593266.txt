      well as having four times the likelihood of developing a mood disorder compared to children
      of non-depressed parents.

      Objectives: To evaluate acceptability and feasibility of an adaptation of Beardslee's
      'Preventive Intervention Program (PIP) for Depression' in Chilean families, and to measure
      the clinical effects of this intervention.

      Participants: Parents with an episode of Depression in the past 3 months with at least one
      non-depressed child between the ages of 6-12.

      Design: single-blind randomized controlled trial with two groups; the intervention group
      (n=32), which will receive a home-based PIP for depression, and the treatment-as-usual
      control group (n=32).

      Results: Acceptability and feasibility will be measured by determining whether the trial was
      successfully conducted and well received by the families and preventionists. Recruitment and
      delivery of the intervention will be assessed as well as whether there was appropriate
      response and follow-up, and whether the objectives of the study were reached. Secondary
      outcomes will look at depressive symptoms, family function, psycho-education, parental
      competence, adaptive behavior and resilience in children.

      Follow-up times: T = 0 baseline, T= 2 months (post-intervention), T=5 months, T=8 months,
      T=11 months.
