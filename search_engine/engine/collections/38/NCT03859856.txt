      including reproductive years. It is showed that hyperglycemic state in diabetes results in
      organ damage like kidneys and eyes. Ovarian reserve is important for the reproductive period.
      The measurements of serum hormones including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing
      hormone (LH), estradiol (E2) and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) will give us an idea about the
      ovarian reserve. The investigators aim is to measure ovarian reserve parameters in patients
      diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and to compare them to healthy controls. Serum FSH,
      LH, E2 and AMH will be measured on the 3rd day of the cycle. Antral follicle count and
      ovarian volume measurement will be done with ultrasonography. Ovarian reserve markers will be
      compared between the groups.
