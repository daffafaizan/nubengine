      obstruction during sleep that provoke frequents arousals, sleep fragmentation, oxygen
      desaturation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA may contribute to the development of
      systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease. Many studies has reported a crucial role for
      the prostaglandin D system in sleep regulation. In addition, it has been described urinary or
      blood levels of prostaglandins was higher in the patients with hypertension, diabetes
      mellitus, and these values were associated with the severity of coronary artery disease.
      However, the relation between alterations of prostaglandin D system and sleep architecture,
      sleepiness, and clinical outcomes such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis in the patients with
      OSA are not known. Additionally, after CPAP treatment, we will investigate the association
      between change of prostaglandin system and sleep architecture, sleepiness, clinical outcomes.
