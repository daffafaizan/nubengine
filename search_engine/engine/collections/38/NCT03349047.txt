      peanut and/or tree nut allergic, and endorse anxiety/discomfort about non-ingestion exposure,
      hold and touch their offending allergen in addition to education leads to reduced discomfort
      for both patient and caregiver compared to education alone. The primary outcome measure is
      immediate differences in the score obtained on a child-reported scale in response to a
      question assessing how worried the patient is about the thought of being near or touching
      peanut or tree nut from pre-intervention to immediate post-intervention when compared between
      an intervention (education and touching) and a control group (education only). Secondary
      outcome measures include: difference between and within groups of child-reported scales
      regarding questions assessing patients worry regarding casual exposure immediately and one
      month post intervention within and between groups, differences between and within groups on a
      parent-reported scale regarding parental worry about casual exposure to food allergen
      immediately and one month post intervention within and between groups, differences between
      and within groups on a parent-proxy measures regarding child worry about casual exposure to
      food allergen immediately and one month post intervention within and between groups,
      improvement in child anxiety and parent-proxy measures of anxiety from pre-intervention to
      one month post-intervention within and between groups and improvement in parent-proxy
      measures of quality of life from pre-intervention to one month post-intervention within and
      between groups.
