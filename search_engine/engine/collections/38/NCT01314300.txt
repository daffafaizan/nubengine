      result from several causes : infectious (post-herpetic neuropathy), traumatic (tumor or
      Positional)or toxic (chemotherapy or radiotherapy). They are often associated with malignant
      pediatric disease.

      These pains are spontaneous, continuous or intermittent, as type of burns or electric shocks
      or abnormal skin sensation (hyperesthesia or allodynia). Treatment is the same as in adults:
      antiepileptic or neuroleptics, sometimes associated with analgesic (level 2 or 3).

      Lidocaine 5% plaster are used in adults as first line of treatment to reduce post-herpetic
      neuropathic pain, especially in cases of mechanical allodynia. These plasters are indicated
      for the symptomatic treatment of post-herpetic neuropathic pain.

      Each plaster contains 700 mg of lidocaine. It must be applied on the painful area once daily
      for a maximum period of 12 hours per 24 hours.

      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of lidocaine 5% plaster (VERSATIS 5%) after
      12 hours on reducing of pure or mixed neuropathic pain and on reducing of vasoocclusive
      sickle cell pain, localized, superficial, in child, adolescent and young adult.

      The secondary endpoint are:

        1. to evaluate the efficacy of lidocaine 5% plaster (VERSATIS 5%) after 6 hours on reducing
           of pure or mixed neuropathic pain and on reducing of vasoocclusive sickle cell pain,
           localized, superficial, in child, adolescent and young adult.

        2. to evaluate safety of lidocaine 5% plaster (VERSATISÂ® 5%) in these same indications.
