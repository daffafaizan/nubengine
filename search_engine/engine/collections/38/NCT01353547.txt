      fight infection) becomes misdirected and attacks healthy tissue. In patients with MS, the
      misdirected white blood cells attack myelin, a lining that insulates the nerves found in the
      brain and spinal cord. This results in inflammation and damage in the myelin. Loss of this
      protective lining disrupts nerve impulses and causes abnormal function in the nervous system.

      This large research study will ultimately enroll 5000 subjects who are at risk of developing
      MS.
