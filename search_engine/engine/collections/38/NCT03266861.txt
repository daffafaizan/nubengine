      at rest transcutaneous oxygen pressure is measured at the chest, calves and buttocks and
      results will be expressed as the minimal value of the DROP index (Limb changes minus chest
      changes) Patients walk on treadmill (2MPH 10% slope) until exertional limb pain. Lactates
      sample (100 microliter) will be collected at minute 3 of recovery from walking Correlation of
      lactate increase to the sum of DROP values wil be studied
