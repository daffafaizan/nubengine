    
      Primary Objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), based on acute CNS toxicity
      at 30 days, of hypofractionated radiotherapy given in 5 fractions with temozolomide for the
      treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Assess the short- and long-term adverse effects.

        2. Determine the radiographic response rate.

        3. Determine the overall survival rate.

        4. Assess quality of life during treatment

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypofractionated (5 fractions) radiotherapy
      with temozolomide for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, patients will be evaluated by
      a multi-disciplinary team composed of radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and
      neuro-oncologists to assess for their eligibility. Patient's oncologic history, presenting
      symptoms, physical examination, pathology, and imaging studies will be reviewed. Patients
      will be evaluated for surgical candidacy and resectability. Patients who are surgical
      candidates will undergo a surgical resection prior to radiotherapy. Patients whose tumors are
      unresectable or are not good surgical candidates will undergo a biopsy for tissue diagnosis.
      Radiation will be delivered in five fractions.
