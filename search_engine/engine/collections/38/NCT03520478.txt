      efficacy and safety of SHR3680 with bicalutamide in the patients with hormone sensitive
      prostate cancer. Approximately 572 patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SHR3680 or bicalutamide treatment. Primary endpoints of the study
      are radiological progress-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).
