      in the current trial. The primary objective is to determine how implantation of an epidural
      stimulator can help to control movement in the leg muscles to stand and perform stepping.
      Participants will be trained using a robotic suit and parallel bars. The procedure of using
      epidural stimulation with the robotic suit is experimental. The participant will be scheduled
      to perform temporary implantation followed by permanent implantation. Seven days later, two
      8-electrode arrays of Vectris lead will be implanted in an operating room. The research team
      will be responsible for helping the participants to trigger the paralyzed muscles from supine
      and sitting using for 5 days per week. Participants would be required to come for study
      visits twice daily for 2 hours per day. Each visit will last approximately 1 hour in the
      morning and 1 hour in the evening. During these visits, participants will practice walking
      with a robotic suit for 30-60 minutes followed by overground walking between parallel bars,
      or with a walker or crutches.
