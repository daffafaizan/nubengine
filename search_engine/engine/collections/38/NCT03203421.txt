      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study. The study will assess the safety,
      immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the novel malaria vaccine candidates ChAdOx1 LS2
      and MVA LS2 in healthy UK adults.

      Healthy, malaria naive adults, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited and vaccinated
      in Oxford.

      A total of between 23 and 31 volunteers will be recruited across four groups:

      Group 1 volunteers will receive a low dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0. Group 2
      volunteers will receive a high dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0 and a dose of MVA LS2 on
      day 56, followed by a CHMI on day 77. Volunteers exhibiting sterile protection will undergo a
      repeat CHMI 5-7 months later.

      Control Group A will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI on day 77.

      Control Group B will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI during the repeat
      challenge.
