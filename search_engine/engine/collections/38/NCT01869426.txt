      of VSL#3 and the difference in the daily average crying time (measured with parental diary)
      between end of treatment and baseline.

      In this study, 62 infants will be enrolled and will receive 10 drops per day of VSL#3 or
      Placebo according to randomization list. The study product will be supplied as a box
      containing the oil bottle and a powder stick. The product should be stored refrigerated. On
      the first day of supplementation, the mother will open the sachet, pour the contents into the
      bottle and shake vigorously. A dropper is provided to count the drops. The suspension must be
      shaken vigorously before every use. Compliance will be monitored by filling out a diary.
