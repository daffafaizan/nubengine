        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine hydrochloride when
           administered with TIP chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin with
           growth factor support (Gem-TIP) in patients with progressive or relapsed metastatic germ
           cell tumors.

        -  To compare the MTD of the Gem-TIP regimen with the MTD determined in a previous Medical
           Research Council study of TIP alone.

        -  To compare the degree of dose intensification achieved with Gem-TIP chemotherapy with
           that achieved in the prior study of TIP chemotherapy alone.

        -  To assess the dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride that can be delivered with the TIP
           regimen in these patients.

        -  To measure response rates and failure-free survival of patients treated with Gem-TIP
           alone.

        -  To assess the utility of PET scanning after Gem-TIP chemotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride
      followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV
           over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-5, and ifosfamide IV over 1
           hour on days 2-6. Patients also receive filgrastim or lenograstim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
           (SC) on days 7-18 or until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day 6.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: An additional cohort of 14 patients is treated as in phase I at the MTD
           determined in phase I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year and
      then at the investigator's discretion.
