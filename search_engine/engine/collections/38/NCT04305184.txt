      ascending dose- MAD) and a dose expansion (single dose expansion and multiple dose expansion)
      phase. Dose escalation will consist of up to 4 cohorts for single ascending dose (SAD) and up
      to 2 cohorts for multiple ascending dose (MAD) with different dose levels. For SAD, after
      randomization on Day 1, participants will receive ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo
      administration into the affected ear. Participants will return to the site on days 2, 3, 8,
      15, 29, and 57 [end of study (EOS)]. For MAD, after randomization on Day 1, participants will
      receive ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo administration into the affected ear and will
      receive additional treatments into the same ear on Days 15 and 29. Participants will return
      to the investigative site on Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 57, and 85 (EOS). The dose expansion
      phase will be based on the safety and efficacy results from an interim analysis. The interim
      analysis will be conducted after completion of after completion of SAD and after completion
      of MAD. If dose expansion is opened, 2 or 3 treatment groups will be selected. If 3 groups
      are selected, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio of high dose ASP0598 Otic
      Solution, low dose ASP0598 Otic Solution, and Placebo. If 2 groups are selected, participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of high dose ASP0598 Otic Solution and Placebo. For single
      dose expansion, after randomization on Day 1, participants will receive ASP0598 otic solution
      or placebo administration into the affected ear. Participants will return to the
      investigative site on days 15, 29, 57, and 85 (EOS). For multiple dose expansion, after
      randomization on Day 1, participants will receive ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo
      administration into the affected ear. Participants will receive additional treatment in the
      same ear on Days 15 and 29. In cases where complete closure is confirmed on Day 15 or Day 29,
      the participant will not receive the next scheduled dose(s). Participants will return to the
      investigative site on Days 15, 29, 43, 57, 85 and 113 (EOS).
