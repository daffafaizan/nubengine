      pathologically diagnosed early-phase non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were enrolled in
      the clinical form 2009 to 2017 and explore recurrence/metastases of the NSCLC patients as
      measured by patient survivals and the impact factors of patient survivals. The study data on
      patient demographic characteristics, tumor biological characteristics, and clinicla
      treatments were collected via a retrospectively review method for evaluation of patient
      survivals and the relevance of clinical characteristics of the patients and patient
      survivals.
