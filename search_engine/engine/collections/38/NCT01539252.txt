      in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in controlling
      serum phosphate while minimizing oral calcium load. While most attention has focused on the
      use of non-calcium containing phosphate binders such as sevelamer and lanthanum, modifying
      conventional dialysis regimens to improve phosphate clearance is an alternative approach that
      remains relatively unstudied. A secondary analysis of a previous randomized cross-over study
      from our group found that the use of two dialysers in parallel resulted in a reduction in
      pre-dialysis serum phosphate levels. As this study was small, and the mechanisms resulting in
      the reduction in phosphate levels were unclear, further study is warranted. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized cross-over study comparing the impact of dialyzing using two
      dialysers in parallel with a single dialyser in hyperphosphatemic hemodialysis patients.

      There will be a total of 34 participants from Alberta,Canada participating in this study. The
      length of study participation is 10 weeks.
