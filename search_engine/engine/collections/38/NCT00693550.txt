        -  Identify the relationship between intraoral metal contact allergy and epithelial
           carcinogenesis in patients with newly or previously diagnosed intraoral squamous cell
           carcinoma.

        -  Compare the prevalence of metal contact allergy in these patients with control data from
           other existing study populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Participants undergo metal patch testing using 27 metals* commonly used in dental
           repairs that are part of the Mayo metal series. Metal patches are applied to the
           patient's back for 3 days and the back is read on days 3 and 5. Relevant patient data
           obtained from their medical and dental history, physical exam, laboratory values and
           treatment are documented.

      NOTE: *Healthy volunteers (control) undergo metal patch testing using 8 metals most commonly
      positive for contact allergens.
