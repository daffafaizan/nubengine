      increase colorectal cancer screening using mailed fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT).

        1. Opt-In - subject must actively choose to receive a home FIT kit.

        2. Opt-Out - a FIT kit is sent as a default unless the subject actives chooses not to
           receive the kit or reports prior screening.
