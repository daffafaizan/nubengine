      conventional treatment in Peking University Third Hospital. Radioactive Iodine-125 seed
      brachytherapy is the implantation of Iodine-125 seed into tumors.The radioactive Iodine-125
      seed can release low dose of irradiation persistently which kills tumors cell and causes less
      damage to normal tissue at the same time. 3D-printing non co-planar template is made
      individually which guides the implantation of Iodine-125 seed into the tumor and ensures the
      accuracy of the position.This study collects the data of patients with pelvic recurrent
      rectal carcinoma who underwent 3D-PNCT assisted with CT-guidance for radioactive Iodine-125
      seed implantation from 2015 to 2018. We evaluate the dose that covers 90% target
      volume(D90),the volume that 100% prescription dose covers(V100) and other dosimetric
      parameters after the implantation. The efficacy and adverse effects were observed. Local
      control(LC) time and overall survival(OS) time are evaluated.
