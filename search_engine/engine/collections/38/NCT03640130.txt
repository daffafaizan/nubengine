      blocked computationally with a "simulated scotoma." Participants will be free to move their
      eyes around the page of text at a comfortable rate. The three outcomes described elsewhere
      will be evaluated.

      In different blocks, text will contain one or more of several dynamic assistive manipulations
      that are hypothesized to enhance reading: 1) inverting the text at a given position, with
      instructions for the participant to attend to that location, which simulates a "surrogate
      fovea" of a patient with central vision loss. 2) horizontally expanding text to alleviate
      within-word crowding. 3) highlighting the next word with a visible indicator to encourage
      proper eye movements.
