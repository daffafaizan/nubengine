      provides not-inferior analgesia to LIA in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) in the first 24 hours postoperatively, and during the first mobilization using the
      numerical evaluation of the pain (NRS).

      The secondary objectives are to demonstrate that the consumption of opioids and the range of
      joint mobility are not inferior in those patients who receive geniculate nerve blocks
      compared to those who receive LIA.
