      gluten protein found in wheat, barley, rye and small intestinal mucosal inflammation in
      individuals with genetic predisposition. Disruption of intestinal barrier integrity play role
      in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Zonulin levels increase in the disruption of
      intestinal permeability in celiac patients.

      At the present, the only treatment of celiac disease is life-long gluten-free diet and it
      requires strict gluten elimination . With compliance to gluten-free diet, thickening of
      intestinal mucosal layer, decreasing of villi atrophy and decreasing of transcellular
      infiltration are observed. In other studies, it was stated that adherence to gluten-free diet
      can repair intestinal permeability and decrease zonulin levels.

      While compliance to gluten-free diet is a key point to prevent progression of the disease,
      nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet affects nutritional status of patients.
      Moreover,restricted diets in terms of energy or various nutrients affect health-related
      quality of life. In studies examining all aspects of celiac disease, it has been stated that
      health-related factors reduce the quality of life in celiac patients.

      In conclusion, this study aims to investigate the presence of intestinal permeability with
      serum zonulin levels in celiac patients, to evaluate nutritional status of patients with
      anthropometric measurements and food consumption records, and to determine quality of life of
      patients with validated celiac disease questionnaire. This study in Turkey, is also first
      study that investigate all these three factors.
