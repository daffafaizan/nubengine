      parallel-group phase 3 IIb\IIIa trial to evaluate the efficacy of Polyoxidonium®,
      lyophilizate for solution for injections and topical application, 6 mg over placebo in
      hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A study will last for 29±3 days
      (maximum) for each participant and will include: screening (days -1...1); treatment period
      (17 days in total, days 1...17) with the administration of the investigational product
      Polyoxidonium/placebo (intravenous injections for 3 days, then intramuscular injections for
      14 days), assessment of the clinical status, recording of AEs; follow-up period (days
      18...29±3).

      Haematology and blood chemistry tests will be performed at day -1 and days 1,3, 8 ±1, 17±1.

      Assessment of the clinical status according to the 7-point ordinal scale and according to the
      National Early Warning Score (NEWS) scale will be done every day during hospitalization from
      day 1 up to and including day 17 and at the follow-up on day 29±3.

      The safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study (from signing the Informed
