      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of duct tape occlusion therapy for the treatment of
      common warts.

      Design: A double-blinded, controlled, clinical intervention trial. Setting: Veterans Affairs
      Medical Center. Participants: A total of 90 immunocompetent adult volunteers with at least
      one wart measuring between 2-15 mm were enrolled in this study between October 2004 and July
      2005; 80 patients completed the study.

      Intervention: Patients were randomized using a computer-generated code to receive either pads
      consisting of moleskin with transparent duct tape (active) or moleskin alone (control).
      Patients were instructed to wear the pads for 7 consecutive days and leave the pad off on the
      7th evening. This process was repeated for 2 months or until the wart resolved, whichever
      occurred first. Follow-up visits occurred at 1 and 2 months.

      Main Outcome Measure: 100% resolution of the wart. Secondary outcomes included change in size
      of the target wart and recurrence rates at 6 months for warts with complete resolution.

      Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients
      with resolution of the target wart (duct tape=8/39, 21% vs. control=9/41, 22%). Of patients
      with complete resolution, 75% (6/8) in the duct tape group and 33% (3/9) of those in the
      control group had recurrence of the target wart by the sixth month.

      Conclusions: Occlusive therapy with transparent duct tape is not significantly better than
      moleskin alone for treatment of common warts in adults.
