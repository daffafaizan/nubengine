    
      Study Day 1

        -  Start 150 mEq Na+/day diet (POTS patients as inpatients; healthy control subjects with
           CRC provided outpatient diet)

        -  Start a 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)

        -  Blood work

        -  Blood volume - carbon monoxide rebreathing

      Study Day 2

        -  Complete 24h urine

        -  Start STUDY DIET (10 mEq Na+/day or 300 mEq Na+/day in a random order) after 3 meals of
           150 mEq Na+/day are complete; water ad lib

      Study Day 3 - 5

        -  Continue STUDY DIET; water ad lib

        -  On Day 5, a 24 hr holter combined ECG monitor will be placed on the subjects.

      Study Day 6

        -  Continue STUDY DIET; water ad lib

        -  Remove 24h Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor from subject

        -  Start a 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)

        -  Complete questionnaires

        -  NPO after midnight for study next day

      Study Day 7 (BIG DAY)

        -  Awaken early (~6am) to void (still collecting 24h urine)

        -  Patient returns to bed, IV catheter inserted

        -  Posture Study (in morning; between 7-8am ideally)

        -  Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured while supine and then while standing for
           up to 30 minutes

        -  We will draw 3 tablespoons of blood in each body position to measure hormones that
           regulate blood pressure and blood volume

        -  Hormones to verify the subject's phase of menstrual cycle

        -  Serum/plasma aliquots for future analysis

        -  Subjects will rate symptoms during supine period and at end of stand using Vanderbilt
           Orthostatic Symptoms Score (VOSS)

        -  Total Blood Volume (DAXOR)- using injection of iodinated I-131 tagged human serum
           albumin nominally 25 micro-Ci of radiation blood samples drawn through IV catheter
           before injection and for ~30 minutes post-injection (total - 25 ml)

        -  This will be done after supine assessment, but before standing the subject up

        -  Autonomic Function Test with Cardiac Output and Brief Tilt

        -  The subject will be tilted up to 60-75 degrees head-up tilt for up to 10 minutes to
           measure the changes in heart rate and blood pressure and symptoms with upright
           challenge.

        -  Blood volume - carbon monoxide rebreathing

        -  Exercise Capacity Test (in the afternoon) Will estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2
           max) This test will be conducted on a stationary bicycle. Effort will be gradually
           increase while expired air is measured during exhaustive physical work.

      All procedures are repeated at least a month later with the 2nd level of dietary salt.
      (Randomized to high or low salt to the first phase, the second phase is the remaining level)
