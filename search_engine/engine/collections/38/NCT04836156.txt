      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with triple negative subtype who
      achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer survival. The neoadjuvant
      treatment for her2 negative patient was chemotherapy with combined drugs. However, not all
      patients benefit from chemotherapy but suffer from chemotherapy-related side effects. It was
      unknown for a patient who could benefit from which drug before chemotherapy. Drug sensitivity
      screening in vitro was a promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method
      could select effective drugs accurately for breast cancer participants until now.

      Previously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTC) in vitro
      culture technology. It is a cell cluster including tumor cells, mesenchymal cells and
      lymphocytes, which simulates the tumor microenvironment in vitro. In the preliminary
      exploration, investigators included 35 early breast cancer participants, the corresponding
      between in vitro drug sensitivity screening based on this technology and clinical treatment
      results was well. The results have been published.

      This study will focus on her2 negative early breast cancer participants. 46 participants will
      be included. All of them will received in vitro drug sensitivity screening upon PTC before
      neoadjuvant therapy. The choice of chemotherapy drugs is determined based on the PTC drug
      sensitivity results. If single-agent chemotherapy is effective in vitro, this drug will be
      the chemotherapy regimen for the corresponding participants.
