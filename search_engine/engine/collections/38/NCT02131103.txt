    
      1.Research design: Intervention trial 1.1 Study domain: STEMI patients who will receive the
      fibrinolysis for reperfusion therapy 1.2 Target population: STEMI patients who will receive
      the percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis in Lampang Regional hospital and
      Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital.

      1.3 Study population: STEMI patients who will receive the percutaneous coronary intervention
      after fibrinolysis during the year of 2013-2014 at Lampang Regional hospital and Maharaj
      Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. The patients who received the percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis

        2. Adult patients with age more than 18 years old

        3. GRACE risk score less than 155 (low-intermediate risk)

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. The patients who received primary PCI or rescue PCI

        2. The patients who had the previous history of coronary-artery bypass surgery

        3. The high risk patients (such as cardiogenic shock, complete heart block, GRACE â‰¥155)

      1.4 Occurrence relation Y (Composite outcomes) = f (Treatment early vs. delay | confounders)

      1.5 Setting: The study will be conducted in Lampang Regional hospital and Maharaj Nakorn
      Chiang Mai hospital.
