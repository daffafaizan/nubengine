      investigated simultaneously. In both locations the skin is treated daily with the ZnO/placebo
      formulations.

      At day -8 skin areas of the forearms and the axillae are sampled by adhesive tape that is
      extracted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and PBS extract analyzed on total proteins (BCA)
      and IL-1α. In the axillae swabs are taken for Corynebacterium spp. semi quantification and pH
      is measured in the axillae and on the forearm.

      At day 0 treated skin areas of the forearms and the axillae are sampled by adhesive tape that
      is extracted in PBS and PBS extract analyzed on total proteins (BCA) and IL-1α, and compared
      to adjacent non-treated skin. In the axillae and on the forearms, swabs are first taken for
      Corynebacterium spp. semi quantification followed by wounding using ablative fractional (10%)
      carbon dioxide laser at 20 millijoule/microbeam and pediatric lancet. pH is measured in the
      axillae and on the forearm.

      Progress of wound healing is assessed by dermatoscopy at days 3, 4 and 5. At day 5 swabs are
      taken in the axillae for Corynebacterium spp. semi quantification and pH is measured.
      Furthermore, skin areas of the axillae are sampled by adhesive tape that is extracted in PBS
      and PBS extract analyzed on total proteins (BCA) and IL-1α.
