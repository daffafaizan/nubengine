      catheters. The catheter would be inserted into the rectum and used as a tool to help the
      patient recognize the pelvic floor muscles. The advantages of Foley catheters are that they
      are cheap, safe for contacting the mucosa, easy for self-insertion, and can be reused.
      Furthermore, we can increase the load of exercise by increasing the amount of water pushing
      into the balloon, and can use that as a tool for progressive resistive exercise.
