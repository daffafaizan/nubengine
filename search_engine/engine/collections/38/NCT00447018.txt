      worsening of the neurological status through the impairment of brain perfusion. In an effort
      to reduce the intensity and the time spent with increased ICP, infusion of mannitol has been
      the recommended first-line agent for years. The growing interest in the use of hypertonic
      saline solutions (HSS) in this clinical setting has, however, challenged the use of mannitol.
      Because mannitol and HSS may differ regarding their clinically relevant mechanisms of action,
      there is a need to determine which osmotic compound could be the most appropriate in patients
      with elevated ICP. We conduct thus a parallel, randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effects of an equimolar infusion of 20% mannitol or 7.45% HSS without colloid in patients
      with elevated ICP. The primary end point of this trial is the magnitude of ICP and of
      cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) changes following treatment during a study period of 120
      min.
