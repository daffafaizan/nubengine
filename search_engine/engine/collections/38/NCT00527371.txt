    
      Following a review of treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by the Medical
      Advisory Secretariat (MAS) of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC), the
      Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) recommended that "a registry study be
      conducted to establish longer term effectiveness and complication rates for PVP given the
      likelihood of increasing diffusion of this technology". Since then, the Medical Devices
      Bureau of the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, has licensed in April 30,
      2007, a 120W-KTP laser system (Greenlight HPS (TM)) for sale in Canada. As several new 120W
      systems will be operating in Ontario in the coming months, there is an urgent need to
      evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and durability of 120W PVP compared to
      conventional TURP in the treatment of patients with BPH.
