      on the Quality of life and General Health for patients attending Rheumatology MSK triage
      clinics in SUH and OHLM or in similar service around Ireland. A new questionnaire (MSK HQ)
      has been developed which has been validated in use with this population. This will be
      completed by the patient on the day of the appointment and again a year later. Their number
      of visits to secondary care in the year after their visit will also be captured and analysed.
      This information will inform the health service of the outcomes of these patients and the
      impact of their MSK disease on the health service. It will also help with resource allocation
      and planning for future services, which will ensure the best service for these patients in
      the future.

      Alongside this, Patient satisfaction and feedback is vital to ensuring service quality and
      quality improvement. The VSQ 9 will be used to measure Patient Satisfaction in this study to
      evaluate if patients are satisfied with the service they have received on the day. The
      repeated MSK HQ will help identify if their triage clinic appointment was beneficial to their
      Quality of life.
