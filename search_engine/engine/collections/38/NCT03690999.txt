      immune system, and metabolic status in older adults. This study will determine the degree to
      which a prebiotic supplement can 1) regulate immune status and function including reducing
      chronic, systemic inflammation as assessed by high dimensional immune profiling, 2) alter
      microbiota composition and function, 3) impact the microbiota metabolites-potential
      normalizers of metabolic and immune dysfunction, and 4) alter metabolic markers.
