    
      This is a multicenter long-term (up to five years post-conversion), non-interventional
      registry in kidney transplant patients who have been converted from tacrolimus BD to
      Advagraf. Centers that are providing medical care for kidney transplant patients who may
      convert patients from tacrolimus BD to Advagraf will be identified and requested to approach
      patients for consent to participate.
