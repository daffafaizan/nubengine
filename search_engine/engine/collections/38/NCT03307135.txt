      management and consequences. The patient will be assessed by two evaluators with the MSPMI
      installed on the foot and the shank. MSPMI allows the record of angular movement of the ankle
      (position, speed and acceleration), of biomechanics (stiffness, torque, work and power) and
      electromyography (root mean squared and integrated electromyography signals) of two chiefs of
      the triceps surae (medial gastrocnemius and soleus). Electromyography data will be recorded
      on a maximum voluntary contraction when the deficiency will permit it. After that, data will
      be recorded at 3 velocities (with respect to the clinical scale recommendations) on two
      different positions (knee flexed and extended), according to our clinical practice. The
      evaluation on day 0 will allow the assessment of inter-rater intra-session reproductibility,
      internal consistency, construct validity, measurement error and known group validity. If the
      patient is hospitalized, he will be included on the "hospitalization group" and a second
      evaluation following the same protocol will be done 7 days later (assessment of inter and
      intra-rater inter-session reproductibility). If a specific therapy (selective tibial
      neurotomy, anesthetic block or botulinum toxin intramuscular injection) is proposed, the
      patient will be included on the "treatment group" and a new evaluation will be done after the
      therapy (30 minutes - 2 hours after an anesthetic block, 2-3 months after neurotomy or
      botulinium toxin injection) allowing assessment of the responsiveness of the MSPMI. If the
      patient is not on these two situations, he will be included on the "simple evaluation group"
      and his participation will end.
