      included. They are randomized either to receive standard nicotine replacement therapy (24 h
      nicotine patch 21, 14, 7 mg/day for one month each, respectively), control arm, or nicotine
      dose adjustment according their saliva cotinine: dose adaptation arm. In the control arm, at
      the discretion of the investigators, buccal forms of nicotine replacement therapies are
      allowed. In both arms, saliva cotinine determinations are performed every 2 weeks for 2
      months. In the control arm saliva cotinine results are not communicated to the investigators.
      In the dose adaptation arm investigators receive saliva cotinine results and should adapt the
      nicotine doses (mg of nicotine/day) according to baseline (when smoking) saliva cotinine to
      obtain 100 % substitution. Smokers are assessed at weekly visits after the predetermined quit
      day for 3 months. Follow up at 6 months. Main outcome measure: sustained abstinence (self
      reported no smoking and expired air carbon monoxide concentration equal or less than 8 ppm
      during the last (3rd) month of the treatment phase.
