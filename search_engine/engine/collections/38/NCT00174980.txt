      outcome and death. Animal and clinical studies have shown that increasing brain oxygen in
      such patients improves functional outcome, and Oxycyte has been shown to be an effective
      means of delivering oxygen to tissues, including the brain. This study is an eight patient
      proof of concept study to test the effects of oxygen delivery with Oxycyte in patients with a
      severe traumatic head injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 9.

      Subjects diagnosed with a severe head injury (GCS 3-9) who receive a brain oxygen monitor and
      microdialysis catheter, will undergo baseline monitoring for 4 hours. In the first 4 subjects
      the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 50% for a 4 hour stabilization period and
      this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of Oxycyte. The Fi02 will
      remain at 50% for 24 hours.

      In the second 4 subjects the Fi02 on the ventilator will be increased to 100% for a 4 hour
      stabilization period and this will be followed by a single intravenous infusion of 3ml/kg of
      Oxycyte. The Fi02 will remain at 100% for 24 hours.

      Subjects will be enrolled, treated, and then monitored by LICOX 02 monitor before and after
      infusion of PFC, and then for at least 48 hours following the discontinuation of Oxycyte.
