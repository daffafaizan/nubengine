    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of developing parastomal hernia detected either clinically or
      radiologically in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit, with or without mesh.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of developing symptomatic parastomal hernia requiring surgical
      intervention in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

      II. To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of clinical
      parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or
      without mesh.

      III. To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of radiological
      parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or
      without mesh.

      IV. To estimate the rate of stomal prolapse and time to its development in patients with
      radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

      V. To evaluate mesh-related complications in mesh group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo placement of biologic mesh during radical cystectomy and placement of
      the ileal conduit.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care radical cystectomy and placement of the ileal
      conduit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2-4 months for 2 years.
