      out-of-treatment opioid abusers transition to methadone maintenance treatment. All study
      participants (n = 120) will be new admissions to the Addiction Treatment Services at Hopkins
      Bayview (ATS), stabilized on 80 mg of methadone, and randomly assigned to one of two study
      conditions. The experimental induction condition will receive low threshold stepped care
      (LTSC) for the first 3-month of treatment that reduces the counseling demands of maintenance
      treatment (i.e., one counseling session / month). This condition will be compared to routine
      stepped care (RSC) for the first 3-months, which provides escalating intensity of counseling
      schedules contingent on drug use or poor adherence. RSC is routine treatment at ATS. All
      participants will receive routine stepped care following the 3-month induction phase, and
      will have the opportunity to remain in treatment at ATS following study participation.
      Participation is for 4-months. Retention is the primary outcome. Participants will also
      submit urine samples weekly on a random schedule each month. We hypothesize that LTSC
      participants will exhibit better retention than RSC participants, and that both conditions
      will exhibit reductions in drug use compared to baseline.
