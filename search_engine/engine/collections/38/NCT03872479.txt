    
      This is an open-label, single ascending dose study of EDIT-101 in adult and pediatric (ie,
      ages 3 to 17) participants with LCA10-IVS26. Approximately 18 participants will be enrolled
      in up to 5 cohorts to evaluate up to 3 dose levels of EDIT-101 in this study. EDIT-101 is a
      novel gene editing product designed to eliminate the mutation on the CEP290 gene that results
      in the retinal degeneration that defines LCA10-IVS26.
