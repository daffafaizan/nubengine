        1. To determine the effect of dietary fish oil supplementation, metformin, and fish oil in
           combination with metformin on fasting and non-fasting plasma TG, apoB48 and
           apoB100-lipoprotein concentrations.

        2. To determine the physiological mechanisms associated with the effect of dietary fish oil
           supplementation and metformin on in vivo plasma lipid and apoB-lipoprotein kinetics. We
           will quantitate the in vivo production and kinetics of plasma TG, apoB48 and
           apoB100-lipoproteins in plasma and isolated lipoprotein fractions, using established
           methods.

        3. To explore the effects of dietary fish oil supplementation, metformin and fish oil in
           combination with metformin, on plasma insulin and testosterone, and the association with
           changes in plasma lipids and apoB-lipoprotein metabolism.
