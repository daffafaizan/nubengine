      every other week for at least 24 weeks are assessed for psoriasis disease severity through
      measurement of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) before adalimumab treatment
      start, and prior to sampling. Patients who interrupted their treatment schedule during the 24
      weeks prior to blood sampling are excluded. Samples of patients who were treated with
      adalimumab for any other inflammatory disease and later developed psoriasis are also
      excluded. Percentage of PASI improvement compared to baseline (∆PASI) represents clinical
      response. Patients are classified as nonresponders (∆PASI<50), moderate responders (∆PASI
      50-75) or good responders (∆PASI 75-100).Serum is collected for adalimumab trough level and
      anti-drug antibody determination (Sanquin, The Netherlands). By receiver-operator
      characteristics (ROC) analysis, a cut-off value of adalimumab trough level can be determined
      to distinguish insufficient from adequate responders.
