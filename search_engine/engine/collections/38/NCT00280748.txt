      Primary

        -  Estimate the response in patients with intracranial brain metastases from non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with whole-brain radiotherapy and pemetrexed disodium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Estimate the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the functional status of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess neurological function and progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response of patients with extracranial disease treated with pemetrexed
           disodium.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks beginning on day
      1. Patients also receive pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1, 2, or 3 and day 28 of course 1, and
      on day 1 of each subsequent course. Treatment with pemetrexed disodium repeats every 21 days
      for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 2 months
      for 2 years.
