      therapy on bleeding frequency, pain, range of motion, muscle strength, arm circumference,
      joint health, functionality and quality of life in the physiotherapy and rehabilitation of
      hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow. Seventeen adolescent and young adult hemophilic
      individuals aged 12-30 years with elbow arthropathy were included in the study. The
      individuals were divided into the two groups via simple randomisation as Manuel Therapy and
      Exercise Group (MTEG) and Home Exercise Group (HEG). The individuals in HEG were given
      strengthening exercises as a home program. Those in the MTEG were applied manual therapy by
      the physiotherapist and were given supervised strengthening exercises. All treatments were
      performed 3 times a week for 5 weeks totally 15 sessions. Frequency of bleeding was evaluated
      with number of bleeding in the last 5 weeks. Numerical Pain Scale was used for activity and
      resting pain. Range of motion and muscle strength were measured with universal goniometer and
      digital dynamometer, respectively. The Quick-DASH questionnaire and Oxford Elbow Score were
      used for the functionality of the upper extremity and quality of life, respectively. The
      joint health status was evaluated with Hemophilia Joint Health Score-Elbow Point and Hospital
      for Special Surgery-Elbow Scoring System. Evaluations were made by the same physiotherapist
      before and after treatment.
