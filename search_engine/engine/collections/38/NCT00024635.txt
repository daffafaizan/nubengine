      volunteers for participation in research protocols in the Experimental Therapeutics and
      Pathophysiology Lab (ETPB) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and for the
      collection of natural history data. In addition the protocol will allow clinicians to gain
      more experience in the use of a variety of polysomnographic and high-density EEG recordings.
      Subjects in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which may include: a psychiatric
      interview; a diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical history; a physical exam; brain
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); electroencephalography (EEG); electrocardiography (EKG),
      magnetoencephalography (MEG); blood, saliva and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request
      for medical records. Subjects may also be asked to complete questionnaires about attitudes
      towards research and motivation for research participation. The data collected may also be
      linked with data from other mood and anxiety disorder protocols (e.g., brain imaging, DNA,
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc) for the purposes of better understanding the
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of patients with mood disorders. Parents
      of minors will be interviewed. Upon conclusion of the screening process, subjects will either
      be offered participation in a research protocol and will sign the appropriate informed
      consent, or will be considered not appropriate for participation in research and will be
      referred back into the community. The current protocol thus serves as an entry point for
      individuals with mood or anxiety disorders or healthy volunteers to enter NIMH IRB approved
      ETPB protocols.
