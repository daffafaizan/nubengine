    
      This was a two-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 120 subjects were randomized
      1:1:1:1 into four groups to receive either two sequential non-adjuvanted or a single
      non-adjuvanted or a single adjuvanted intramuscular injection of 500 mcg M-001 (treatment),
      or one placebo (saline) injection, before receiving the TIV. Due to visual differences
      between placebo and treatment the study was partially blinded. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI)
      was evaluated at baseline and 3 weeks after standard trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
      (TIV) vaccination as a measure of M-001's efficacy. Cell mediated immune (CMI) responses were
      also evaluated in some of the subjects who received non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted M-001
      vaccinations. The subjects were monitored for safety throughout the study.
