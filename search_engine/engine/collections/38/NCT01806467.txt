      cardiovascular derangements, to help diagnosing the causes and to monitor the response to
      therapy.

      Pulmonary thermodilution (ThD) is still considered the gold standard reference method for
      cardiac output (CO) measurement [1]. Its invasiveness, however, often limits or delays its
      application [2, 3]. In the last decades new less invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems have
      been developed. The majority of such new devices allows for continuous monitoring of CO and
      other hemodynamic variables [4].

      Among the various less invasive techniques, the PiCCO (Pulse-induced Contour Cardiac Output)
      relies on the concept of the "pulse contour methodology" for providing beat-to-beat CO
      assessment. This method needs transpulmonary ThD calibration. This is a well validated
      dilution technique [5]. Another minimally invasive system is the Pressure Recording
      Analytical Method (PRAM). Unlike other systems with pulse contour analysis, the PRAM does not
      need external or internal calibration factors since it analyzes the pressure waveform at a
      frequency of 1000 Hz and computes the patient's cardiovascular system impedance using a
      mathematical algorithm based on the physical theory of perturbations. It only requires a
      connection to a femoral or radial artery catheter for the acquisition and analysis of the
      arterial pressure traces [6]. This new method has been validated under different experimental
      and clinical settings [6-9]. Limited data are available under conditions of hemodynamic
      instability [10-12]. So far, its accuracy and reliability in assessing CO in hemodynamically
      unstable patients needs yet to be clarified.
