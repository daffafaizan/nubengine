      that specialize in the lessening (palliation) of symptoms and addressing quality of life
      concerns may improve the end-of-life care, quality of life, and mood of women with poor
      prognosis metastatic breast cancer.

      Palliative care is a specific type of medical care given to patients to improve their pain
      and other symptoms like fatigue, and to support patients and their families as they cope with
      their illness. Palliative care includes physicians and advanced practice nurses who have been
      specifically trained in how to help patients with serious illness.

      Increasingly, the role of palliative care has been shown to benefit patients when introduced
      early in the disease trajectory. For example, in patients with metastatic (or spread) lung
      cancer, early involvement of palliative care improves patients' quality of life and mood.
      Patients with some metastatic cancers, like breast cancer, have an unpredictable disease
      trajectory, which makes it difficult to determine the best time to introduce palliative care
      services.
