      men in high risk areas reduce their risk of HIV infection by 60%.

      The Government of Rwanda has ranked HIV prevention as a top priority item, and wishes to
      decrease the HIV incidence in the country by 50%. As part of a holistic HIV prevention
      approach, we decided to embark upon a process of national scale up of adult male
      circumcision. The national HIV prevention plan calls for voluntary MC of 2 million adults by
      the end of 2012.

      The PrePex System was designed to enable safe, effective, painless and bloodless male
      circumcision programs, to support global public health efforts to stop the spread of HIV.

      The PrePex System includes a simple, disposable device that is easy to use and can be
      deployed by minimally trained healthcare professionals, in urban or rural settings, without
      the need for sterile, hospital settings. As such, The PrePex System places minimal burden on
      the existing health care infrastructure to accomplish national circumcision programs.

      The protocol, approved by the Rwanda National Ethical Committee, was issued to assess the
      safety and efficacy of the circumcision device for applying it to the national scale up of
      adult male circumcision in Rwanda.
