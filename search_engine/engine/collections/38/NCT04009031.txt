      However, sustaining engagement in home-based therapy is challenging. Bootle Blast is a
      low-cost video game that uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor to track upper limb movements and
      interactions with real-life objects (e.g. musical instruments, building blocks). To play
      Bootle Blast, the child needs to use the hemiplegic arm/hand to play unilateral game
      activities, and highly involve it in bilateral activities.

      This study will answer our research questions: 1a) to what extent can Bootle Blast sustain
      engagement in children with CP over a 12-week home intervention? 1b) from the perspective of
      children with CP and their parents, what are the intervention features influencing
      engagement? and 2) to what extent can the use of Bootle Blast lead to improvements in UL
      motor function when the playtime goal is family-identified? As measures of feasibility we
      hypothesize that 1a) 75% of children will achieve their weekly play time goal and complete
      the 12-week intervention and 2) 75% children who achieve their weekly play time goal will
      improve in one or more UL motor outcome measures.
