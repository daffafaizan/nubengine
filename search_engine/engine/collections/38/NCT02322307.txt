      Colitis presenting at the Mount Sinai Health System.

      Eligible participants who complete the informed consent will fill a Tablet or Web-based
      questionnaire at the end of which they will be given a pin and offered to download the
      HealthPROMISE app or an education app. Patients who download HealthPROMISE app will then be
      requested to provide updates on quality metrics, a quality of life questionnaire, and
      emergency visits and hospitalizations.

      Data will be collected continuously throughout the study using the mobile health app. Study
      endpoints will primarily be assessed using "intention to treat" analysis. Additionally, per
      protocol analysis of data will be performed for patients who have logged into the application
      at least 4 times in 12 months. The total study duration will be 2 years (104 weeks). At 1
      year (52 weeks), an interim analysis will be done to determine if study needs to be continued
      for full 104 weeks. Furthermore, patients in either arm who login using PIN but not
      completing week 52 (or week 104) exit survey will be considered as "lost to follow up".
