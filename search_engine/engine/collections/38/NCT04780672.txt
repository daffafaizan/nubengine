    
      Patients with the severe course of COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR laboratory test will
      be involved in the study on a voluntary basis.

      In accordance with regulatory enactments, these patients receive specialized medical care in
      specialized medical institutions, where the conduct of the study is planned.

      The study is planned as a double-blind, which will be achieved by using Molixan and placebo
      (0.9% NaCl solution) in the same packaging with the same labeling, indistinguishable in color
      and smell.

      Patients will be randomized in an unpredictable manner using the IWRS system.

      It is planned to divide patients into 2 parallel groups:

        1. Group 1. Standard therapy + Molixan;

        2. Group 2. Standard therapy + placebo. The regimen (1 or 2) assigned to each study subject
           will not be known to either the Investigator or the patient.
