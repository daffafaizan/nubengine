    
      COLLEGE ATHLETES:

      At each study visit, participants will undergo an fMRI-cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)
      challenge scanning session as well as an aerobic exercise test on a stationary bike. During
      the CVR-fMRI scan, the participant will wear a mask that will deliver a blend of oxygen and
      nitrogen at varying amounts while lying in an MRI scanner. During the aerobic stationary bike
      assessment, the participant will pedal at a steady state against applied resistance for 10
      minutes while wearing a 3-lead ECG monitor to observe heart rate. A Biostrap heart rate
      variability (HRV) wrist monitor will be provided which will be worn daily. The data from the
      monitor, concerning HRV and sleep, will be collected. The participant will answer a brief
      survey concerning the previous night's sleep. After the conclusion of the sport's season,
      there will be a follow up scanning session. After the post-season scan, the participant will
      participate in a breath work meditation intervention over the following two months, twice a
      week for a 30 minute meditation session.

      HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES:

      Participants will be given a Biostrap HRV monitor which will be worn daily. The data from the
      monitor, concerning HRV and sleep, will be collected. The participant will answer a brief
      survey concerning the previous night's sleep. High school althletes will be randomized into
      one of two study groups, the control group or the intervention group. The intervention group
      will receive guided meditation. The control group will proceed about their lives normally.
