      I. To determine the response rate (RR) associated with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) as
      3rd-line therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients who have failed therapy
      with a distinct vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if baseline hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), endothelial selectin (E-selectin)
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. To determine if pre-metastatic niche density in regional lymph nodes (LNs) is associated
      with PFS.

      III. To determine an association between E-selectin, IL-6 and pre-metastatic niche density.

      IV. To evaluate the prognostic effect of pre-metastatic niches as an independent factor in
      time to first relapse.

      V. To determine if phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3)
      in tumor tissue is associated with PFS.

      VI. To describe the toxicity associated with pazopanib in this patient population.

      VII. To evaluate PFS and overall survival (OS). VIII. To compare, within patient, time to
      tumor progression of 2nd-line therapy with time to tumor progression on pazopanib as 3rd-line
      therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of
      study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
