    
      This Phase IIIb outcome study in AHF patients was designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study in order to assess the efficacy, safety
      and tolerability of intravenous infusion of serelaxin or placebo. The AHF patients randomized
      to either serelaxin or placebo in the study were followed for a period of 180 days, and were
      required to receive standard-of-care background HF management during both the index
      hospitalization and post discharge according to regional or local guidelines/institutional
      standards.
