      overall sign of defocus of images falling on the retina, with myopic defocus imposed by the
      fitting of plus-lenses halting or slowing axial elongation of the eye. In the animal models,
      these STOP growth signals have been shown to be particularly strong - with brief periods of
      high myopic defocus able to outweigh the effects of prolonged periods of imposed hyperopic
      defocus in promoting eye growth. These results therefore suggest a novel strategy for
      preventing the progression of myopia in children - the imposition of high levels of myopia
      for brief periods of time. This approach is conceptually distinct from under-correction,
      which imposes chronic mild myopic defocus.
