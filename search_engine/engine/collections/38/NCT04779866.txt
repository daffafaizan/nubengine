      Aim 1: Determine the accrual, retention, adherence and feasibility, and randomization to the
      self-administered hypnosis program among caregivers of individuals with ADRD. Feasibility
      will be determined by (1) drop-out rate, (2) participants' rating of the program, and (3)
      participants' rating of treatment satisfaction. Adherence will be determined through at-home
      practice logs. Essential experience on accrual and retention data as well.

      Aim 2: Determine feasibility of measures: PSQI, actigraphy recordings, and sleep diaries to
      assess sleep quality and duration, as well as feasibility of secondary self-report outcome
      measures of insomnia severity, stress, cognition, and pain among caregivers.

      Aim 3: Determine perceptions of hypnosis and potential barriers for the caregiver population
      and feedback.

      Participant Selection and Recruitment Plan

      A sample of 20 caregivers, both male and female, of individuals with ADRD, who suffer from
      poor sleep will be enrolled in the study. A screening checklist will be used for screening
      participants who are interested.

      Potential participants will be identified (1) via advertisements and press releases, (2) via
      physician referral, and (3) targeted mailings. Participants eligibility will be determined by
      criteria listed on a screening checklist. The investigators have used these strategies in
      prior studies and have demonstrated ability to accrue the required number of participants.
