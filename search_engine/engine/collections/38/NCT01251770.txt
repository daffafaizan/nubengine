      used since 1957 (Holiday & Segar), it is not always adequate for children with acute
      diseases, leading to hyponatremia. This mainly occurs due to a non-physiologic ADH secretion
      in this group of patients due to nausea, stress, pain, and surgical interventions, and the
      use of hypotonic maintenance IV fluids.

      0.3% NaCl/dextrose 5%, is widely use as IV maintenance fluid in children after surgery. There
      is evidence suggesting that these IV fluids used in postsurgical hospitalized patients do not
      provide the adequate amount of sodium they require, leading to an increased risk of
      developing hyponatremia. Using 0.45% NaCl/dextrose 5% as IV maintenance fluid in these
      children would prevent hyponatremia, but this treatment has not been totally studied yet.

      Study procedures: Hospitalized children who fulfill inclusion criteria and not having any of
      the exclusion criteria will be considered for the enrolment after written informed consent.

      Venous blood samples will be taken at enrollment (baseline) for estimation of serum sodium.
      After randomization, one group will receive 0.3% NaCl/dextrose 5%, IV, at standard
      maintenance rate (100 ml/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 ml/kg for the next 10 kg,
      and 20 ml/kg for body weight exceeding 20 kg). The second group will receive 0.45%
      NaCl/dextrose 5%, IV, at the same rate.

      Serum sodium will be estimated in both groups after 12 hours of intravenous fluid therapy.

      Children who required oral fluids will be excluded from per-protocol analysis, and only
      analyzed for intention to treat.
