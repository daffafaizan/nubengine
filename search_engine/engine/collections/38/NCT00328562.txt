    
      To estimate treatment-related esophageal, pulmonary, hematologic, and other toxicity of
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ZD1839 with hypofractionated
      thoracic radiotherapy (RT). All estimates of toxicity rates will be presented with
      corresponding confidence intervals using the exact method. The method of Atkinson and Brown
      will be used due to the two-stage sampling; the method of Conover will be used for tumor
      response.

      To estimate tumor response rates of this treatment regimen and identify the most effective RT
      dose level, defined as the level associated with the best response rate. Estimates of tumor
      response rates will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals using the exact
      method of Conover. Survival will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
