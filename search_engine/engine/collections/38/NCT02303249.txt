      together with the nurse from the hospital ward. Next, the patient is discharged from the
      hospital and meets the nurse from the municipality at home. Together with the patient the
      nurse form the municipality reviews:

        -  Documents from the hospital

        -  Medicine

        -  Nutrition

        -  Mobility

        -  Assessment of the need for health care services from the municipality

      All patients in the project - both patients in the intervention group and patients in the
      control group - will receive treatment and care equivalent to normally applicable quality
      standards.

      In 2011 4387 patients were discharged Monday to Friday from the Medical and Geriatric
      Departments at Roskilde and Køge Hospital to one of the seven municipalities. Of these, 1204
      persons (27%) were readmitted (in any department) within 180 days. It is expected that the
      study demonstrates a reduction of ≥ 6 percentage points (from 27% to 21%) with a power of 80%
      and a significance level of 5%. There will be a need for 792 patients in both control and
      intervention group, ie 1584 in total.
