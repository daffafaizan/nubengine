      with solid tumors. II. Assess the biological and immunological parameters that would suggest
      the optimal biologically active dose of KRN7000 in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of KRN7000 at the different dose levels in these patients. IV. Measure any
      antitumor activity in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive KRN7000 by slow intravenous
      injection on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive
      escalating doses of KRN7000 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
