      done. A bone marrow test, a chest x-ray and a CT scan of the abdomen will be done if not
      studied recently.

      Blood tests will be repeated after 14, 21, and 42 days. Provided the disease has responded,
      another bone marrow sample will be taken to confirm remission. X-rays may be repeated for the
      same reason.

      The patient or a family member will be taught to inject 2CdA under the skin three times a day
      for 7 days. The patient will also take cyclophosphamide by mouth twice each day. Rituxan will
      be given by vein once weekly for 4 weeks after a test infusion on the day prior to the first
      injection. A second course of the 3 drugs will be given about 6 weeks after the start of the
      first course. All patients with improving disease will then be followed without further
      treatment.
