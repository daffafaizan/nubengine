    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. ABT-199 is a pill that blocks BCL-2, a
      protein that is important for the survival of WM cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how well the study drug works and the
      safety of ABT-199 as a single agent in participants with WM that has come back or has shown
      no response to previous treatment.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ABT-199 as a treatment for
      any disease.
