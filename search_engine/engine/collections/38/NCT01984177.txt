      control (HC) subjects, use administration of Corticorelin, a synthetic form of corticotropin
      releasing factor (CRF)and PET imaging to assess dopamine (DA) transmission in addiction. We
      will use [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET to measure striatal DA receptor binding on two occasions: 1)
      following corticorelin administration and 2) following saline. The change in receptor binding
      between the two occasions (i.e., displacement of [11C]-(+)-PHNO by endogenous DA) will index
      DA release.

      SUBJECTS CD subjects will meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence and be ~10d cocaine
      abstinent at the time of PET. HC will be recruited to match CD on age, sex, education, and
      cigarette smoking.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES We will measure [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding on two occasions
      (corticorelin, saline), with the difference between conditions indexing dopamine release;
      this measure will then be compared between cocaine-dependent and control subjects. We will
      also measure plasma cortisol and ACTH), physiological measures, and subjective craving and
      mood.
