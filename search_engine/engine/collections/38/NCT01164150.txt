      â€¢ To compare the incidence of acute grade >2 GU and GI toxicity

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To establish in the context of a clinical research study the feasibility of implementing
           pelvic nodal irradiation using IMRT in gynaecological cancer

        -  To establish an Image-Guided pathway for gynaecological cancer radiotherapy
           incorporating

             -  Set-up errors and optimal margins for set-up uncertainty

             -  Investigation of effects of bladder filling and rectal preparation protocols on the
                planning target volume

        -  To estimate the rate of loco-regional control

        -  To evaluate Quality of Life

        -  To estimate the rate of disease-free survival

        -  To estimate the overall survival rate

        -  To compare the incidence of late GU and GI toxicity
