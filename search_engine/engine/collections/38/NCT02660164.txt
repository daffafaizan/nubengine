    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, blinded, matched control study of young athletes (ages
      10-25 years old) in competitive sports (Cohort A: higher-risk of concussion, Cohort B:
      lower-risk of concussion) to assess the effectiveness of the Nautilus BrainPulse device when
      used as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion.

      The Nautilus BrainPulse is intended for use on a patient's head to non-invasively detect,
      amplify and capture the brain pulse, the brain motion caused by pulsatile blood flow from the
      cardiac cycle. The Nautilus BrainPulse analyzes the captured data to provide an aid in
      diagnosing an episode of concussion.
