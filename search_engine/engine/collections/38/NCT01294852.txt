    
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a syndrome in premature infants caused by
      developmental insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs.
      Exogenous surfactant therapy has become well established in newborn infants with RDS.
      Surfactant replacement therapy, either as a rescue treatment or a prophylactic, reduces
      mortality and several aspects of morbidity in babies with RDS. It is known that infants who
      are at a significant risk of RDS should receive prophylactic surfactant therapy, but the
      optimal timing and strategy for prophylactic surfactant therapy remains controversial. When
      administered immediately after delivery, surfactant mixes with the fetal lung fluid and
      reaches the alveoli before the onset of lung injury potentially created by the first applied
      positive pressure ventilation. As another approach, surfactant prophylaxis may be
      administered after resuscitation and stabilization.
