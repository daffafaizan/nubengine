      increases the basal metabolic rate, affects protein synthesis and helps growth of long bones.
      However, when thyroid functions change in the human body, the individual can be negatively
      affected and some individuals may require surgical intervention. Thyroid surgery is a
      prominent treatment for goiter, hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules or thyroid carcinoma.

      It has been reported that the most important complications after thyroidectomy are laryngeal
      nerve damage and hypoparathyroidism. Therefore, patients generally suffer from uncomfortable
      symptoms such as neck pain, shoulder stiffness, difficulty moving shoulders, choking or
      pressing feeling. In addition, it is indicated that in the early postoperative period,
      patients experience limitation in neck movement and have a robotic walking style in order to
      prevent possible neck pain and protect the incision area. It is emphasized that these
      symptoms persist for a while after the operation and negatively affect the daily life of the
      patient.

      Neck stretching exercises which include basic movements of the neck are simple and effective
      exercises. Stretching exercises provide neuromuscular coordination and flexibility in
      patients by reducing pain and muscle weakness. For this reason, neck stretching exercises
      should be performed in early postoperative period and a nurse should teach the patient the
      head-neck stretching exercises and ensure the patient's comfort after thyroidectomy.
