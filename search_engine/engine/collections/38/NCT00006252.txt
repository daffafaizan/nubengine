        -  Determine the feasibility of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, in terms of 6-month treatment-related
           mortality, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia,
           low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the 6-month and 12-month probabilities of response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients responding to this regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of donor chimerism achieved in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over
      1 to 2 hours on days -5 to -3. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on days 0-1. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily
      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients with no signs of active graft-versus host disease and stable or progressive disease
      receive donor lymphocytes IV over 2 hours beginning after day 120. Patients may receive a
      total of 3 infusions at least 8 weeks apart if disease remains stable or progressive.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
