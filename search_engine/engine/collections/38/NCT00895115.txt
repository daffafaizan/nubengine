        -  Determine the effect of tocopherol supplementation on plasma and urine levels of α-, γ-,
           and δ-tocopherols, PSA, and prostaglandin E_2 by comparing the blood and urine samples
           collected before and after the supplementation in patients with prostate cancer.

        -  Test the hypothesis that the supplementation reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress by
           measuring plasma levels of F_2-isoprostane, C-reactive protein, and 3-nitrotyrosine as
           well as urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG).

        -  Determine the levels of α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols in prostate tissues and analyze
           immunohistochemically (IHC) for cell proliferation, apoptosis, cyclooxygenase-2, 8-OHdG,
           and 3-nitropyrosine levels in prostate cancer/tissue slides.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive no supplementation.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral high γ-tocopherol vitamin E supplementation once daily for
           1 week.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral high γ-tocopherol vitamin E supplementation once daily
           for 2 weeks.

      Blood, urine, and tissue samples are collected periodically and analyzed for
      oxidative/nitrosative stress and other markers (i.e., F2-isoprostane, 8-OHdG,
      3-nitrotyrosine, prostaglandin E2, C-reactive protein, and PSA), biomarkers in prostate
      tumors and nontumorous tissues (i.e., 8-OHdG, 3-nitrotyrosine, and cyclooxygenase-2) by IHC,
      and pharmacokinetics by high-performance liquid chromatography.
