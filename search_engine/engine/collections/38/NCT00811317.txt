      regulating BG in type 1 diabetic subjects. The closed-loop system utilizes sub-cutaneous
      infusion or insulin and glucagon under the control of a computer algorithm. The only inputs
      to the algorithm are the subject weight and BG values measured every five minutes. Subjects
      will undergo up to three 27 hour GCRC admissions during which they will consume three
      standardized meals. Subject may participate in up to two closed-loop visits (with different
      insulin lispro pharmacokinetic parameter settings in the control algorithm) and some subjects
      will participate in open-loop visits. During the closed-loop admission BG will be controlled
      by the closed-loop system. During the open-loop visit subjects will regulate their own BG in
      the usual function using their insulin pumps. A small group of non-diabetic subjects will
      undergo a single 27 hour GCRC admission during which they will eat the same standardized
      meals. During all admission BG will be measured every 5 minutes and blood will be collected
      for measurement of insulin and glucagon levels every 10 minutes. During the closed-loop
      admission of diabetic subjects and the single admission of non-diabetic subjects, three
      commercially available continuous glucose monitoring devices will be worn. The data from
      these devices will later be compared to reference BG data.
