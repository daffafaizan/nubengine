      A total of 1,083 chronic smokers were randomly assigned either to a traditional
      state-of-the-art smoking cessation clinic or to the clinic supplemented by telephone support
      for recycling. Telephone outreach consisted of three separate rounds of intervention three
      months, nine months, and 21 months after the targeted date for quitting in the smoking
      cessation clinics.

      Telephone calls to abstinent subjects reinforced success and offered advice and support in
      coping with difficult situations. Calls to relapsers and nonabstainers debriefed concerning
      the relapse episode (as appropriate) and encouraged subjects to initiate concrete action
      toward quitting including setting a quit date. Subjects were offered self-help materials as
      well as referrals to more intensive programs.

      Follow-up data collection was separate from recycling contacts and occured six, 12, 24, and
      34 months after the initial smoking cessation clinics. Projected longterm sustained
      abstinence rates were 35 percent for recycling and 25 percent for the clinic only comparison.
      If results were as predicted, an effective low-cost telephone outreach protocol was made
      available that could dramatically assist in smoking cessation and thereby substantially
      reduce cardiovascular disease.
