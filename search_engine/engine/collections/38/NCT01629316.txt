    
      For Aims 2 and 3:

      Participants:

      We will enroll 400 HIV-infected men and women, age 18 years and older who are incarcerated in
      the NC Department of Correction (NCDOC) or the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ)
      and scheduled for prison release in approximately 12 weeks, who are receiving ART and have an
      HIV RNA level that is below 400 copies/mL.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be consented, enrolled, and then randomized 1:1 to
      one of two conditions:

        1. standard test-and-treat (sTNT), which is the current standard of care, wherein following
           HIV testing, the DOC provides to HIV-infected inmates ART during incarceration and
           referral to community-based care and services by prison staff as well as a supply of
           antiretroviral medication (30 days in NC, 10 in TX) upon release, or

        2. TNT-imPACT (imPACT),which includes the sTNT plus our integrated, multi-component
           intervention targeting multiple levels to enhance adherence to HIV therapy and linkage
           to and engagement in clinical care, to maintain viral suppression after release.

      All participants will be followed for up to 24 weeks post-release.
