      will undergo cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. In this surgical intervention, the abdominal
      cavity is macroscopically cleared of tumor, by removing all visible tumor nodules, and is
      subsequently rinsed with hyperthermic (heated) chemotherapy, aiming to destroy all residual
      invisible tumor cells that might have stayed behind after the debulking.

      The eventual aim of this procedure is to improve the prognosis/survival of patients with
      malignancies localized on the peritoneal surface.
