    
      This will be a prospective observational study with serial CMR imaging only.

      CMR scan Each patient will receive one CMR scan performed on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 10
      following the PPCI procedure on a 3T Philips scanner (see study flow below). All CMR scans
      will be analysed at a central CMR corelab.

      For Day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 CMRs, parameters will be collected as follows:

        -  Left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction and indexed LV end systolic and diastolic volumes
           and mass using short-axis SSFP cine imaging and myocardial tagging sequences).

        -  The AAR by T1 and T2 mapping18 as a percentage of the LV over time.

        -  Signal intensity of T1 and T2 mapping in the MI zone, MI core and remote myocardium over
           time.

        -  The incidence of intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH)(hypo-enhancement on T2* mapping
           sequence)26.

        -  The volume of microvascular obstruction (MVO) defined as signal intensity 2 standard
           deviated below the mean signal intensity of the remote myocardium on the T2* maps.

      Additional sequence for Day 3 and 7 CMR scans:

      â€¢ All the above plus MI size (measured in mass of LGE and expressed as a percentage of the LV
      mass).
