      tendon heals or have surgical intervention. Surgical intervention will entail fixing the
      tendon with bone anchors and splinting. Conservative treament involves splinting while the
      tendon heals. We will then monitor the functional outcome of the hand using the DASH
      questionare over 18 months.
