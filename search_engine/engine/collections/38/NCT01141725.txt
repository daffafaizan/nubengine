      I. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that is associated with a complete remission (CR) rate of
      at least 40%, and a rate of grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicity < 30% in patients aged 50 or
      older with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) after therapy at each level of
      the dosing strategy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bendamustine hydrochloride followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1-5 and idarubicin IV
      on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter for 3 years.
