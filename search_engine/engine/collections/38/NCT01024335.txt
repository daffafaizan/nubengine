      maintenance treatment with naltrexone in opioid-dependent individuals. We are proposing a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-groups, 8 week study of relapse
      prevention in opioid-dependent individuals. Participants will be randomized into one of two
      conditions (1) Naltrexone and Placebo (N=20) and (2) Naltrexone and dronabinol 15 mg bid
      (N=40). Treatment will be delivered in an outpatient setting except for the initial phase of
      inpatient detoxification, lasting 8 days. A long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone 380 mg
      (Vivitrol) will be administered once per month (the total of two injections), while
      dronabinol or placebo will be taken daily. In addition, patients will receive a psychosocial
      intervention that will include elements of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral
      relapse prevention therapy. The primary aim is to test the efficacy of dronabinol in
      improving tolerability of naltrexone induction and reducing attrition during detoxification
      and the first two months of naltrexone treatment. The primary outcome will be the severity of
      opiate withdrawal and craving. The secondary outcome will be will be retention in treatment
      at study's end.
