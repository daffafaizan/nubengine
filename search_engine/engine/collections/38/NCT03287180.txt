      disorders. Treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may reduce the risk of opioid overdose and
      lower the occurrence of further conditions associated with injection drug use such as
      psychiatric disorders, hepatitis C infection, HIV, and high-risk sexual and criminal
      behaviors. The study assesses whether adding a behavioral intervention, known as the
      Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), to the treatment of individuals already
      receiving buprenorphine/naloxone can improve treatment success and retention rates in young
      adults with severe opioid use disorder.
