    
      Step I - Screening and baseline phenotyping When a potential suitable participant is
      interested, a screening interview to check eligibility will take place by phone after oral
      agreement is given. The structured screening interview is carried out by means of a
      questionnaire in the format of a Case Report Form (CRF). Suitable persons are provided with
      participantÂ´s information and data protection sheet and with the "declaration of consent".
      Sufficient time for consideration is given between the screening interview and visit 1A,
      where written consent is signed.

      After the telephone-based screening interview, eligible participants are required to provide
      written consent. Participants will undergo clinical examinations at two visits (V1A + V1B),
      serving primarily for phenotyping as well as for detection of potentially unknown exclusion
      criteria. The order of some measurements carried out during V1A and V1B as well as the type
      of lipid challenge is randomized.

      Data collection V1A:

        -  Resting metabolic rate

        -  Metabolic response to meal challenge

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Sampling of blood samples for further research questions

      Data collection V1B:

        -  Metabolic response to meal challenge

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood parameters

        -  Urine parameters

        -  Hand Strength Measurement

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Sampling of blood, urine and saliva

        -  Optional: Adipose tissue distribution by MRI measurement; parameters for physical
           strength, motor function and body static condition; 24h urine collection; fecal samples

      Step II - Weight loss intervention Once participant is still deemed eligible after V1A and
      V1B, the formula-based low calorie diet (LCD) starts as weight loss intervention. Formula
      products will be provided once per week. An additional daily intake of 200 g raw or cooked
      non-starchy vegetables is allowed. Participants fulfill a food diary to record eaten products
      including drinks and vegetables and to record well-being or side effects. Furthermore,
      participants are phenotyped by a continuous glucose measurement during the first four weeks
      of intervention.

      Data collection V2:

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood and urine parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Resting metabolic rate

        -  Hand strength measurement

        -  Documentation of safety

        -  Continuous glucose measurement

        -  Sampling of blood, urine, and saliva

        -  Optional: Adipose tissue distribution by MRI measurement; parameters for physical
           strength, motor function and body static condition; 24h urine collection; fecal samples
           Step III - Weight maintenance intervention

      If weight loss is > 4 kg after eight weeks, the participant is eligible for randomization
      into one of the following four weight maintenance intervention arms:

      Low carb - App-based group Low carb - Newsletter-based group Low fat - App-based group Low
      fat - Newsletter-based group

      Data collection V3A:

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Blood and urine parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Documentation of safety

        -  Sampling of blood and urine samples for further research questions, e.g. metabolic
           profile (to be confirmed)

        -  Optional: 24h urine collection

      Data collection V3B:

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Blood parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Documentation of safety

        -  Sampling of blood samples for further research questions, e.g. metabolic profile (to be
           confirmed)

      Data collection V3C:

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Blood and urine parameters

        -  Resting metabolic rate

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Sampling of blood, urine, and saliva

        -  Optional: Adipose tissue distribution by MRI measurement; parameters for physical
           strength, motor function and body static condition; 24h urine collection; fecal samples
           Step IV - Follow-up During follow-up, all participants receive the same newsletters with
           nutritional information every 3 months (independent of weight maintenance intervention
           group). Further weight management is carried out by "self-help".
