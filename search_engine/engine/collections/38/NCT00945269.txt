      I. Assess the safety of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients using autologous
      CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clones following CD25 lymphodepletion.

      II. Determine the influence of CD25 lymphodepletion on the duration of in vivo persistence of
      adoptively transferred CD8+ antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the anti-tumor efficacy of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients
      using autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clones following CD25 lymphodepletion.

      II. Evaluate the induction of T cells to non-targeted tumor-associated antigens
      (antigen-spreading) following adoptive transfer of CD8+ antigen-specific CTL and CD25
      lymphodepletion.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive autologous T-cell intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 0 and 28 and
      low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 0 to 13 and 28 to 41. Beginning
      4-6 days before second T- cell infusion, patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 30
      minutes on days 1-3. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
