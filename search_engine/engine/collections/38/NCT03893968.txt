      Umeå, county of Västerbotten, in Sweden. There are three hospitals in this sparsely populated
      county of 55432〖km〗^2 with about 268000 in population. The hand-surgery unit serves both the
      local population and is a tertiary referral center.

      As the healthcare in Sweden is funded by taxpayers, the healthcare for patients is free,
      apart from a small nominal fee. There was a total of seven doctors and seven assistant nurses
      participating in the study, all having several years of experience working with hand-surgical
      care. Prior to the study, doctors had the formal responsibility of informing patients about
      their postoperative care. However, despite it being the surgeons' responsibility, the task of
      informing patients was at times performed by assistant nurses. After receiving the
      information, patients were discharged and left the clinic. Normally patients receive a
      complementary written information after being informed verbally. Patients included in the
      study did not receive the written information, since it might have been a confounding factor
      in understanding of information.
