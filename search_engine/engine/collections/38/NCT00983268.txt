      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat when given in combination with
           capecitabine and high-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic
           pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and side effect profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Correlative

        -  Compare pre- and post-treatment whole-cell HDAC-activity levels in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cell samples.

        -  Assess chromatin structure and DNA damage in surgical tumor tissue samples.

        -  Assess proliferation and apoptosis by in vivo imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo high-dose hypofractionated
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients also receive oral vorinostat once
      daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are evaluated for surgery within 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.
      Patients with resectable disease proceed to surgery. Patients with unresectable disease may
      receive oral vorinostat once daily and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative laboratory studies. Patients also
      undergo diffusion-weighted MRI for analysis of in vivo tumor cellularity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
