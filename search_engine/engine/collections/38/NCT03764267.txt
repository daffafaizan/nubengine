      anesthesia (GA) with propofol and remifentanil or local anesthesia (LA). Although surgeons
      perform this operation comfortably under GA, Patients have anxiety and fear of complications
      due to GA. In addition, they expect a good postoperative quality of recovery (QOR) including
      ability to resume common activities (work and daily activities) without suffering from
      moderate to severe pain.

      The LA is advantageous over GA in that airway instrumentation is not necessary, favorable
      recovery profile, decrease postoperative pain and vomiting, increase patient satisfaction and
      decrease the cost . However, patient anxiety or pain often leading to conversion of LA to GA,
      which suggests the concomitant use of i.v. sedatives and analgesics as a supplement to LA.

      The combination of remifentanil and ketofol (propofol, ketamine) for sedation during regional
      anesthesia and LA has been shown to be a safe, effective technique, capable of maintains
      adequate analgesia with conscious sedation, haemodynamic stability, and achieves lower
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting with shorter recovery times.
