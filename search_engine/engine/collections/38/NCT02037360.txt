      the tested intervention. Then in the randomized control trial, subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of two treatments: (1) a standard smartphone application to support
      smokers working to become quit-free, or (2) the tested intervention, an app that trains
      mindfulness for smoking cessation. The primary endpoint of interest will be 1-week point
      prevalence abstinence at end of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up for individuals.
