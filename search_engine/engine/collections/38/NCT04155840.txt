    
      This is a dose de-escalation study of copanlisib.

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 or days 1 and
      15 (depending on dose level). Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine IV
      on days 1 and 2 of cycles 1-4. Patients who achieve at least a partial response
      (MRD-positive) continue on treatment for 2 additional cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      cycle 7, patients receive copanlisib IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 for an additional 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, then periodically
      for up to 3 years.
