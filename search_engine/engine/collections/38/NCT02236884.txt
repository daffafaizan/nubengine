      surgery which combines the mini-invasive concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic
      surgery(NOTES), the technique of single-port laparoscopic surgery and the principle of total
      mesorectal excision with curative intent for treating rectal cancer. Based on the platform of
      either transanal endoscopic microsurgery(TEM) or transanal minimally invasive surgery
      (TAMIS), it is an innovative way of retrograde TME dissection from bottom to up with or
      without laparoscopic assistance. It is supposed to facilitate distal rectal mobilization,
      thus achieving precise and sufficient distal margin and to reduced need for multiple stapler
      firings in transecting the rectum, consequently decreasing anastomotic leakage rates which is
      especially important for obese male patients with a narrow pelvis where exposure to the
      distal rectum from the abdominal approach can prove difficult. It could also protect
      neurovascular bundle with better visualization and exposure and has the advantage of better
      function and avoiding sacrificing sphincter. After a series of preclinical trail of animal
      and cadaver, it has been successfully applied to humans and successional reports have proved
      its feasibility and safety. However, the majority of published series is hybrid NOTES, which
      need the assistance of conventional laparoscopic surgery from above to bottom and abdominal
      incision, scar, pain and incision related complications such as wound infection, abscess,
      hernia and implanted incisional tumors cannot be necessary avoided. It is also worried that
      the cost will increased since two groups of surgical equipment are needed(the abdominal and
      perineal) and more surgical staff are required if the two team operate at the same
      time(two-team approach). Up to date, as far as we have known, the pure transanal TME NOTES
      without any laparoscopic assistance has also been successfully performed in human patients
      though the cases are rare. The investigators of our center have also successfully performed
      pure-NOTES rectal resection in human cadavers in the past few months, and are confident to
      move this forward to conduct this pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this
      surgery in rectal cancer patients.
