      participants. Applied to general medical care practice, telemedicine is associated with
      improved continuity of care, cost-effectiveness, and improved service quality. To date, all
      evaluations of telepsychiatry have concentrated on video technology. The telephone is more
      readily available and less expensive communication technology that has not been evaluated as
      a method of health services delivery in the medication management of stable psychiatric
      outpatients. We will enroll 346 psychiatrically stable subjects, who carry a diagnosis of
      major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or non-PTSD anxiety disorder. We will
      use a balanced randomization strategy to assign subjects to routine care or telephone care
      for a two-year period within each provider panel. Patients randomized to receive routine care
      will be scheduled to see their psychiatric medication provider at the recommended interval.
      Patients randomized to receive telephone care will be scheduled to see their provider at
      twice the recommended clinic visit interval, and two ten-minute telephone contacts will be
      scheduled at a specific time at standard 0.67 and 1.3 times the multiple of the recommended
      interval. At two years, we will use ten data sources to compare two primary outcomes (total
      VHA health services utilization and mental health component scores from the SF-12-V) as well
      as VHA costs, imputed non-VHA costs, patient and provider satisfaction, medication compliance
      and diagnosis specific outcomes.
