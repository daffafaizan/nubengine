      open/laparoscopic surgery. Both approaches have procedural limitations that can have
      considerable impact on patient care. Traditional endoscopic tools have technical
      inadequacies, ones that inhibit the physician's ability to complete more complex tasks
      consistent with a surgical technique. Conversely a traditional open or laparoscopic surgical
      approach involves increased chance of complications (such as surgical site infection), more
      pain & blood loss, longer recovery and larger surgical scars.

      This clinical study proposes the use of an endoluminal robotic technology that is designed to
      improve patient outcomes for colorectal lesions. This system allows physicians to perform
      many types of complex endoluminal procedures with more precision, flexibility, and control
      than that of conventional endoscopic, open or laparoscopic surgical techniques. Using this
      robotic system, surgeons can perform delicate and complex endoluminal procedures that may
      have been difficult or impossible with other methods, and could have positive impact on
      outcomes, recovery time, and overall patient care.

      Patients will undergo the procedure using the ColubrisMX ELS System, and its initial safety
      and efficacy outcomes will be assessed intraoperatively and postoperatively at discharge and
      days 7 and 30.
