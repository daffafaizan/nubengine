      (IA) on slowing down dementia progression, shown in a pilot trial, can be replicated in a
      slightly larger number of subjects and to comprehensively investigate the effects by a
      combination of brain and vessel imaging along with cognitive tests and further
      state-of-the-art cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and laboratory examinations. If the trial
      results underpin the hypothesis that IA effectively counteracts pathophysiological
      impairments and dementia-related cognitive decline, it may open up a new treatment approach
      against dementia, namely the reversal or avoidance of further vascular damage by the removal
      of agonistic autoantibodies (agAAB) in agAAB-positive persons.

      The aim of this study is (beside of safety) to demonstrate the stop of the vascular
      remodeling and cognition decline by immunoadsorption, a therapeutic method which is well
      established in cardiology and nephrology.
