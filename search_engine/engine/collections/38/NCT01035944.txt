    
      Primary objective: There are two primary objectives:

        1. To demonstrate that debridements performed using HemCon dressings at the bedside can be
           performed safely without excessive bleeding in eligible patients

        2. To compare the levels of bacterial load between debrided wounds treated with HemCon
           dressings and debrided wounds treated with gauze and saline dressings at 2 days and 5
           days after debridement

      Secondary objectives: The following secondary objectives will be achieved by this study:

        1. To determine the cost efficacy, if any, between wounds debrided at the bedside with
           HemCon dressings and wounds debrided in the operating room setting

        2. To determine the cost efficacy, if any, between wounds debrided in the operating room
           where hemostasis is achieved with a HemCon dressing and between debrided wounds where
           hemostasis is achieved with traditional cauterization methods.

        3. To compare comfort levels in patients treated with HemCon dressings as compared to
           traditional gauze dressings.
