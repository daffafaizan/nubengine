      promoting a more stable and smooth transition from fetal to extra-uterine life with the
      potential to prevent iron deficiency in young children. Several studies have demonstrated
      that cord clamping timing is greatly relevant for facilitate placental transfusion, the
      transfer of extra blood from the placenta to the infant in the third stage of labor.
      Therefore, during natural 'two-step' delivery umbilical cord management may play a relevant
      role on blood passage to the neonate and it may affect neonatal hematological values and
      placental transfusion. The most effective way to manage umbilical cord in in 'two-step'
      delivery remains to be established.

      Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of two different methods of
      umbilical cord management (Early Cord Clamping - ECC vs. Delayed Cord Clamping - DCC) on the
      placental transfusion, defined by in two-step delivery, by âˆ† haematocrit (Hct) from arterial
      cord blood at birth and capillary blood at 48 h of age. Accounting for physiological body
      weight decrease. Secondary outcomes included contemporary estimate of blood gases, lactate,
      and glucose concentrations in arterial cord blood gas analysis.

      Material and methods: This is a randomized clinical trial on the effect of different cord
      management newborns born by 'two-step' delivery. After obtaining parental consent, all
      mothers > 38 weeks' gestation will be assigned to either ECC or DCC group in a 1:1 ratio
      according to a randomized sequence generated by an opened, sealed, numbered, opaque envelope
      containing the cord clamping interventions allocation, ECC (at 1 minute) or DCC (at 3 minutes
      after delivery).
