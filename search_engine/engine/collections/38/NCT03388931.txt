      from the program that has been used in the cooperative group trial RTOG 9003. The radiation
      therapy dose schedule in our study twice-daily alternating fractions over 30 treatment days.
      The Biologically Effective Dose (BED) of this schedule is about 11% higher than our standard
      schedule twice-a-day. During radiotherapy, patients will receive chemotherapy with our
      standard program of weekly.
