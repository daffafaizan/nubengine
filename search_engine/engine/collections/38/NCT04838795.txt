    
      Purpose To monitor the effectiveness of the single dose Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine among
      health care workers (HCW) as compared to the general unvaccinated population in South Africa

      Study design Open-label, single-arm phase 3B vaccine implementation study

      Rationale South Africa is severely affected by the global COVID-19 epidemic, but currently no
      vaccine has been rolled out. The recent promising results of the 'ENSEMBLE' trial conducted
      by Janssen in South Africa, and the availability of a limited amount of vaccine doses,
      provide the rationale for a cohort study of vaccinated HCWs to inform the larger vaccine
      rollout.

      Study participants Health Care workers age 18 and above working in the South African public
      and private health care sector (N=500 000) Study sites Department of Health Vaccine
      administration sites across South Africa supported by the Sisonke (Together)
      (VAC31518COV3012) trial Research Site Investigators and Study Staff

      Study duration Participants will receive a single dose of vaccine at enrolment; to monitor
      outcomes the DATCOV surveillance system and NICD line list will be reviewed for up to 2 years
      post-vaccination.

      A sub-cohort will be followed up at Months 3 and Month 6. This group will also have outcomes
      monitored for up to a further 18 months, bringing their total follow-up duration to 2 years
      post-vaccination.

      Primary objectives • To assess the effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine on severe COVID,
      hospitalizations and deaths in HCWs as compared with the general unvaccinated population in
      South Africa.

      Secondary objectives • To estimate the incidence of symptomatic SARS CoV-2 infections in HCW

        -  To estimate vaccine uptake among HCWs in South Africa

        -  To monitor the genetic diversity of breakthrough SARS CoV-2 infections

        -  In a subgroup of participants:

             -  To compare serum neutralization and immune responses before and after vaccination

             -  To monitor for asymptomatic infection Exploratory objectives • To establish a link
                between the national pharmacovigilance system to assist with monitoring safety and
                any unexpected adverse effects
