    
      Outline: This is a multi-center study.

      Chemotherapy/radiation therapy (2 cycles)

        -  Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8 of 28 day cycle

        -  Etoposide 50 mg/m2 IV days 1-5 of 28 day cycle

        -  Concurrent chest radiation (planned dose is 5940 cGy with an additional, optional boost
           of 1080 cGy to a total allowed dose of 7020 cGy) with the following:

      Maintenance therapy of Sorafenib 400 mg PO BID of 28 day cycle, to begin a minimum of 6 and
      maximum of 9 weeks from completion of chemo-radiotherapy until PD, intolerable toxicity, or
      up to 1 year.

      Patients with progressive disease will discontinue treatment.

      ECOG performance status 0 or 1

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 mm3

        -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm3

        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  PT or INR < 1.5 x ULN unless on anti-coagulant therapy

        -  PTT < 1.5 x ULN unless on anti-coagulant therapy

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

        -  ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement)

        -  AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement)

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine < 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No significant history of cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure > class II NYHA.

        -  Patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina
           (began within 90 days prior to registration for initial therapy) or myocardial
           infarction within 6 months prior to registration for initial therapy.

      Respiratory:

        -  FEV1 ≥ 1 liter by spirometry within 60 days prior to registration for initial therapy.
