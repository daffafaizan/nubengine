    
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing short course (5 days) to
      long course (14 days) antimicrobial therapy for children between 1 and 10 years of age with
      acute bacterial sinusitis. The major outcome measure is the proportion of children with a
      clinical relapse on day 10 in the short course therapy group compared to day 20 in the long
      course therapy group. In addition, the proportion of respiratory flora that are resistant to
      antibiotics on day 30 will be compared to baseline in each group.
