      I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with arsenic trioxide.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 on week 1.
      Beginning on week 2, patients receive a maintenance dose of arsenic trioxide IV twice weekly
      thereafter. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue to
      receive therapy for at least 6 months beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months or until disease progression.
