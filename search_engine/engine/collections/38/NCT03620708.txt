      designed to increase motivation to quit smoking in socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a) A brief motivational interviewing
      intervention, b) A nicotine replacement therapy sampling intervention, or c) A referral-only
      intervention.
