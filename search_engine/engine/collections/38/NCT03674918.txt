      a single blood pressure measurement is useless to diagnose hypertension. Nevertheless, a
      questionable not well-defined number of measurements still is often used for this purpose.
      Diagnosis and therapeutic control of hypertension are therefore suboptimal. This study's
      objective is to determine the number and timing of measurements needed to give a trustworthy
      approximation of an individual's average blood pressure. Therefore, 24 h ambulatory blood
      pressure measurements were retrospectively analyzed.
