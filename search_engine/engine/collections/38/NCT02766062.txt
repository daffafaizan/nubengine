      development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), are becoming more common.The
      investigators don't know whether propofol based anesthesia has a more severe impact on early
      postoperative cognitive function than sevoflurane in elderly patients with metabolic
      syndrome. In this study, the investigators want to investigate propofol versus sevoflurane
      anesthesia on the effects of early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients with
      metabolic syndrome.
