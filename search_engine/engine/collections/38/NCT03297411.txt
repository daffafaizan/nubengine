      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment, from the brain regions associated with memory
      impairment, with ECT stimulation. This will be done by 1) testing effects on memory of 4
      different forms of ECT, which stimulate the brain differently; 2) in a subset of
      participants, use computer modelling to assess the pattern of brain stimulation with the 4
      forms of ECT, and match these results to memory outcomes.
