    
      Main objective

      The primary objective of the present trial is to assess the beneficial effect of VAL070-B
      compared to a placebo, on blood LDL cholesterol level in moderate hypercholesterolemic and
      hypertriglyceridemic subjects after 12 weeks of consumption.

      Secondary objectives

      Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the effects of VAL070-A and VAL070-B,
      compared to a placebo and to each other, in moderate hypercholesterolemic and
      hypertriglyceridemic subjects after 12 weeks if consumption through the following parameters:

        -  Blood level of LDL cholesterol (VAL070-A compared to placebo and VAL070-A compared to
           VAL070-B),

        -  Lipid profile: Blood levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and
           non- HDL cholesterol,

        -  Glycaemia,

        -  Blood hsCRP,

        -  Fructosamine,

        -  Blood total free fatty acid levels,

        -  Anthropometrics assessed by body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), hip
           circumference (HC) and waist to hip ratio (WHR).

      Safety objectives

      The following parameters, analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks of consumption,
      participated to the safety objectives:

        -  Blood levels of urea and creatinine,

        -  Blood levels of GGT, AST and ALT,

        -  Complete blood count,

        -  Hemodynamic measurements: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic
           blood pressure (DBP),

        -  Adverse events.
