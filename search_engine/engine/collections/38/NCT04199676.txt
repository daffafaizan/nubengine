      to increase as rates of obesity and metabolic disease increase in reproductive age women.
      Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes carry an increased risk of developing type 2
      diabetes later in life, even if their glucose tolerance initially normalizes following
      delivery.

      The gold standard assessment of glucose tolerance postpartum is a two hour glucose tolerance
      test (GTT) that is completed between six and twelve weeks' postpartum. Unfortunately, the
      compliance rate with this test is low, ranging from 30 - 50% by most reports. As a result, a
      large number of women with glucose intolerance are missed due to noncompliance with
      postpartum testing, thereby forfeiting the opportunity for diagnosis, treatment and
      prevention of longterm health consequences. The postpartum hospital stay provides a unique
      opportunity to increase compliance with glucose tolerance testing due to an increased rate of
      patient capture. However, it is unknown if administration of a glucose tolerance test in the
      immediate postpartum period would adequately identify women with persistent glucose
      intolerance.

      The current study aims to provide data towards the accuracy of an immediate postpartum GTT in
      a population of women with gestational diabetes and provide follow-up data on women with
      abnormal testing.
