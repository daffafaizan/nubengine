      Application of an electronic medication management support system.

      Objectives:

      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medication management
      support system on hospitalization and death, its cost-effectiveness and its effects on the
      quality and safety of prescribing in patients with polypharmacy.

      Methods:

      A parallel, cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted in about 1,080 general
      practices located in the Westphalia-Region (Germany), which care for adult patients covered
      by BARMER health insurance. Per group, 17,200 clustered-randomized patients (about 32
      patients per practice) will be included, if they take â‰¥ 5 long-term prescriptions (at least 2
      consecutive quarters).

      In the intervention group, family physicians will use an user-initiated clinical decision
      support system (CDSS) which provides drug-therapy relevant information (e.g. on diagnoses and
      treatments) and alerts in case of drug-drug, drug-disease and drug-age interactions. Based on
      that information, the family physician systematically assesses the appropriateness of
      patient's medication and optimizes it. Patients receive an updated medication plan in their
      mother's language, if needed.

      In the control group, patients continue to receive usual care where there is no access to the
      CDSS.

      The primary outcome is the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital
      admissions after 15 months. The outcome measures will be based on secondary data (i.e. claims
      data). Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at patient level. The primary analysis
      will be performed adhering to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.
