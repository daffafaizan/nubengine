      are in use, together with analgesia and sedation, during the cooling process in many centers
      to prevent shivering. However, neuromuscular blockers are accused to be associated with
      various side effects causing serious harm and/or leading to prolonged ICU stay. Furthermore,
      the use of neuromuscular blockers may mask epileptic activity. Therefore, the advantages and
      disadvantages of neuromuscular blockers during therapeutic hypothermia need to be
      re-evaluated.

      Aim of this study is to investigate if continuous application of neuromuscular blockers is
      necessary to prevent shivering and thereby avoiding an increase in energy expenditure in
      patients during therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming after cardiac arrest (initial 72h).
