    
      Gastroparesis is a disease of the stomach where there is significant delay in gastric
      emptying of contents to the intestines. This disease results in a multitude of symptoms
      including nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and malnutrition.

      Current treatments for gastroparesis include dietary changes, oral medications (prokinetic
      agents to enhance gastric motility, acid reducers, anti-emetics to reduce nausea and
      vomiting), gastric stimulators and rarely surgery.

      G-POEM (Gastric Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy-creating a cut in the muscle that controls
      gastric emptying), an incision-less (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic
      procedure, is increasingly being performed to assist in the management of certain groups of
      patients with gastroparesis.

      This data will be used for research purposes only to determine the clinical impact of
      endoscopic treatments on gastroparesis. The physicians will also be able to better understand
      the patient's condition and disease process that may lead to improved standard of care and
      improved patient management.
