      section 3 will benefit from a treatment with ribavirin/PEG-a-IFN combined treatment. This
      study will be open to all patients with histologically documented hepatitis C recurring after
      LT, provided that all inclusion and exclusion criteria, as defined below, are met, and
      irrespectively of the pattern of response to a previous antiviral treatment (if any).

      The benefit will be assessed in terms of biochemical (normalization of serum transaminases
      levels), virological (disappearance of HCV RNA from serum) and histological (amelioration of
      the histological signs of hepatitis) response. The presence of a sustained virological
      response, as defined below in section 6, will also be studied in relation to the early
      kinetics of serum HCV RNA, in keeping with recent data obtained in chronic hepatitis C
      patients, which suggest that an early rapid decrease of HCV viremia is associated with a
      durable response.
