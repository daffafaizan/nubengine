      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent papaverine hydrochloride (PPV), and
      lung SBRT in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or lung metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess primary tumor control rate, local control rate, local-regional recurrence
      free-survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS),
      and overall survival (OS).

      II. To assess whether blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) studies can predict which patients may respond best to PPV + SBRT, and detect
      changes in oxygenation before and after PPV administration.

      III. To assess whether blood-based micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) biomarkers can predict
      which patients may respond best to PPV + SBRT.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of papaverine hydrochloride.

      Patients undergo BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and receive papaverine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Within 30-90 minutes, patients undergo a second
      BOLD fMRI. Patients then receive papaverine hydrochloride IV and within 30-90 minutes after
      dose undergo SBRT for a up to 4-5 sessions over 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1
      and 2 years, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
