      enrolled. Age, waist circumstances, blood pressure, basic history of infertility, blood
      pressure, serum lipid level and side effects will be collected. Blood tests, including
      fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG), fasting insulin (FINS), SHBG,
      sex hormone levels, blood lipids and anti-m√ºllerian hormone(AMH) will be performed before
      treatment to evacuate their metabolic conditions.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients will receive MA (megestrol
      acetate) 160 mg by mouth daily for at least 3 months on Arm I. Patients will receive MA 160
      mg plus LNG-IUS insertion for at least 3 months on Arm II. Then an hysteroscope will be used
      to evaluate the endometrial condition every 3 months, and the findings will be recorded. For
      patients with EEC, complete response (CR) is defined as the reversion of endometrial disease
      to proliferative or secretory endometrium; partial response (PR) is defined as regression to
      simple or complex hyperplasia without atypic or atypical hyperplasia; no response (NR) is
      defined as the persistence of the disease; and progressive disease (PD) is defined as the
      progression of endometrial lesions. Continuous therapies will be needed in PR, NR or PD.

      As the reason of the low response rate of LNG-IUS alone in EC patients (nearly 50%), and the
      potential limitation of LNG-IUS to focal cancer lesion in endometrial cavity, the
      investigators did not add LNG-IUS alone as a single control group.

      After completion of study treatment, 2 months of maintenance treatment will be recommended
      for patients with CR, and participants will be followed up for 2 years.
