      HB-adMSC infusion on global gray and/or white matter, as well as structural integrity of GM
      and WM regions of interest in the corpus callous and corticospinal tracts as measured by
      fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in specific regions known to correlate
      with specific neurocognitive deficits in patients after neurological injury.
