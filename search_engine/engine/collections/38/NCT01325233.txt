      48 evaluable) first hemorrhagic stroke patients will be randomly divided into the control and
      treatment groups. Each group will be treated as follows: 1) control group will accept placebo
      t.i.w treatment for 14 days from second day of admission, in addition to standard ordinary
      treatment.; 2) treatment group will accept PG2 t.i.w treatment for 14 days from second day of
      admission, in addition to standard ordinary treatment. Inflammatory index including the
      levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), S-100 protein,
      IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-beta levels will be measured and clinical symptoms including Glasgow
      outcome scale (GOS), modified rankin scale (MRS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and
      Barthel Index (BI) will be evaluated during this study.
