      positively-adjudicated ONJ in subjects with cancer with an observation period of 5 years.
      Most of these subjects are expected to have received bone antiresorptive agents such as
      bisphosphonates or denosumab together with cancer-specific therapies (eg, chemotherapy,
      steroids, or anti-angiogenics). It is also possible that the registry will include subjects
      with cancer who developed ONJ without exposure to any antiresorptive therapy.
