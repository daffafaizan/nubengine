      I. To determine whether administration of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to patients with basal cell
      carcinoma is associated with a reduction in Gli messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein
      levels in tumor biopsy samples, when compared to baseline levels.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there is evidence of tumor size reduction of ATO against basal cell
      carcinoma in humans.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
