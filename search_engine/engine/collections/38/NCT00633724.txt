      lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. We
      have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from these molecules. We
      also tend to use the peptides targeting to tumor angiogenesis. VEGF receptor 1 and 2 are
      essential targets to tumor angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides derived from these
      receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo.
      According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and
      clinical response of those peptides.
