      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible
      treatment for this diagnosis. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a
      treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to
      humans.

      The research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex
      virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous
      system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and
      genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1
      can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have
      removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make
      copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.

      If it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then
      make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all
      glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not
      grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans,
      and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma. This study is also looking for the
      highest dose of rQNestin34.5v.2 that can be given safely to people with malignant brain
      tumors.
