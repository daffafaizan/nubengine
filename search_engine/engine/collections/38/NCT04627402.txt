      growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy and required continuous injections. Delayed control of
      macular edema might cause irreversible function loss. To predict the response to anti-VEGF
      treatment according to the CST change after one injection was proved reasonable recently.
      Adding intravitreous corticosteroids to the treatment regimen at early time might result in
      better outcomes than anti-VEGF therapy alone. Patients with diagnosis of refractory diabetic
      macular edema, confirmed by fluorangiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT), with
      limited response to one intravitreal anti-VEGF injection will be enrolled in the study. The
      enrolled patients will be randomized for the addition or not of the triamcinolone to
      intravitreal therapy.
