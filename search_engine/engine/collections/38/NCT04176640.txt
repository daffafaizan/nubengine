    
      To evaluate a novel early neuroimaging diagnostic tool for hospitalized children with
      traumatic brain injury.

      This tool is used to detect evidence of traumatic brain injury on routine brain scans. The
      tool combines features invisible to the human eye but detectable by computer software with
      expert knowledge.This study will evaluate how well the tool can perform in a real health care
      setting. It is believed that it will greatly improve the efficacy and quality of care
      provided to children after traumatic brain injury.
