      apnea has been correlated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Sleep
      apnea is not as well studied in women and even less is known about sleep apnea in pregnant
      women. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the incidence is quite high, particularly
      in women with severe preeclampsia. We propose to perform sleep studies on 30 women with
      preeclampsia and 30 healthy pregnant controls. In addition to the usual sleep study
      monitoring, we will also measure beat-to-beat blood pressure through non-invasive monitoring
      and we will do continuous electronic fetal monitoring. Women found to have sleep apnea will
      have a repeat study in which CPAP therapy is applied, and be provided CPAP therapy for
      nightly use at home.
