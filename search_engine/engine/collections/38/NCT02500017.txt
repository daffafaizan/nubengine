    
      Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is a unique disorder characterized by a delayed pattern of food
      intake in which recurrent episodes of food consumption occurs after the evening meal and/or
      during nocturnal awakenings. Diagnostic criteria for NES include: (1) recurrent episodes of
      night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food
      consumption following the evening meal, (2) awareness of those eating episodes, and (3)
      significant distress or impairment caused by the disorder. Exclusion criteria are
      binge-eating disorder or another mental disorder, as well as medical disorders or medications
      that might better explain the disordered eating pattern. NES is also more common among
      patients with insomnia, eating disorders, and other psychiatric disorders. 100 participants
      with night eating syndrome will be recruited from the general population. They will be
      randomized to either a commercially available rapid-release formulation of melatonin (5 mg)
      or matching placebo capsules, that will be administered once a day for a total of 8 weeks.
      Participants will attend a screening appointment, a baseline assessment and additional
      research assessment visits every other week for the 8 weeks.
