      the patients with nondipping BP pattern were randomly divided into two groups and treated
      with bedtime or awakening doses of potassium losartan. Any patients who had any
      antihypertension medication at bedtime would withdrawal the drugs for 2 weeks before ABPM.
      Patients with nondipping BP were then randomly divided into two groups and received a bedtime
      or awakening dose of potassium losartan. Patients with dipping BP were called the dipper
      group, while the patients with nondipping BP were called the awakening dose group or bedtime
      dose group, according to the time of drug administration.
