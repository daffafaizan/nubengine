      addition of high calorie and protein breakfast promoted sustained weight loss and prevented
      weight regain by reducing diet-induced compensatory changes in hunger, cravings and ghrelin
      suppression.

      However the effect of isocaloric and isoproteic breakfast with different source of proteins,
      (whey vs other proteins or vs low protein in breakfast) on weight loss, appetite and on
      glycemic fluctuations after breakfast lunch and dinner was not explored in obese diabetic
      individuals.

      To search whether compared to proteins like tuna, eggs and soy, the intake of whey protein in
      the breakfast will lead to reduced hunger and overall postprandial glycemia and will enhance
      weight loss in obese diabetic individuals
