        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7070 when administered to adult patients
           with solid tumors.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug and study the
           predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility and dose relationship of the
           toxic effects in this patient population.

        -  Propose a safe dose for phase II study.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this drug at different dose levels in this patient
           population.

        -  Determine any possible antitumor activity of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive E7070 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment continues every 6
      weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of E7070 is escalated until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
