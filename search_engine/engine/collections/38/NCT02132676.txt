      have poor risk factor control and face significant self-management challenges. Moreover, many
      VA patients face barriers to attending frequent face-to-face visits. This project will
      evaluate the implementation of a novel program found in a recent VA randomized, controlled
      trial to significantly improve VA patients' diabetes-specific social support, insulin starts,
      and glycemic control compared to usual nurse care management. The program uses periodic group
      sessions in conjunction with calls between paired patients with diabetes to promote more
      effective care management as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) communication among diabetes patients
      who both have poor glycemic control and are working on similar care goals. "Peer buddies" are
      encouraged to talk by phone at least weekly to provide mutual support and share their
      progress on meeting their self-management goals. The goal of this service is to enhance the
      effect of shared medical appointments (SMAs), a service model demonstrated to be effective in
      improving outcomes among patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions and now being
      widely implemented in VA. Based on the success of the efficacy trial of this intervention,
      the investigators now seek to evaluate a wider-scale implementation of this program. During
      implementation of the P2P program in conjunction with shared medical appointments (SMAs) in
      five diverse VA facilities, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of SMAs alone
      and SMAs+P2P compared to usual care, and study the implementation process in order to gather
      information required to disseminate the program more broadly in Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA).
