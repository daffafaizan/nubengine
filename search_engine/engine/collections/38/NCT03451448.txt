    
      Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) has the potential to
      provide detailed information on coronary artery anatomy, the presence of coronary artery
      stenosis, the composition of atherosclerotic plaque using MRI tissue characterisation and
      information about the underlying biological processes using targeted PET tracers.
      Ultra-small-superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) have a long blood pool
      half-life so are an ideal contrast agent for PET/MRI imaging.

      This study will assess the use of PET/MRI with USPIO in patients with stable coronary artery
      disease and recent acute myocardial infarction.
