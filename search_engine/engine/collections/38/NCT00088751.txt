      nervous system stimulant and an atypical antipsychotic in treating the behavioral symptoms of
      FTD.

      Rationale. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is increasingly recognized as an important
      neuropsychiatric disorder. Symptoms of FTD include disinhibition, impulsivity, apathy,
      affective lability, and language dysfunction. The clinical syndrome is associated with
      frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy on imaging and autopsy. Currently, no treatments
      have been proven to be effective for altering the course or clinical symptoms of FTD.

      Design. Study subjects will include 20 male and female patients with mild-moderate
      frontotemporal dementia recruited from participants in NINDS protocols 02-N-0001 and
      81-N-0010. In a double-blinded crossover 11-week study without a placebo control, patients
      will be treated with a stimulant (dextroamphetamine) and an atypical antipsychotic
      (quetiapine). The primary outcome measures will be the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Change. Cognitive measures and side effects scales will also be
      collected.
