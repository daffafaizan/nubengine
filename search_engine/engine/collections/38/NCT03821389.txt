      those with bronchiolitis is a critical problem in the clinical management. Chest
      physiotherapy (CPT) and an invasive positive percussion ventilation (IPPV) have been
      recognized as to encourage dislodging the secretions; nonetheless, the tolerance to the
      procedure and its efficiency have not been proved to be sufficient. This study aims to
      examine the tolerance, feasibility, and physiological effects in airway clearance by using a
      novel non-invasive oscillating transducer device (NIOD) in critically ill children. The study
      will be prospective Crossover Randomized Study in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a
      Canadian Academic Children's Hospital. We will target children less than 24-month-old, for
      whom CPT is prescribed for airway clearance with or without atelectasis. We will apply two
      different frequencies of NIOD (i.e. 40 and 60Hz) for 3 minutes each, on each patient 3 hours
      apart. The investigators will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including
      hypertonic saline nebulization, IPPV, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the
      ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing PEEP or changing the nasal mask to total
      face CPAP) can be provided at the direction of bedside pediatric intensivists in charge.
