      advance directive or the web advance directive (Ourcarewishes.org). Patients will be
      approached in the Cancer Center and provided the AD information to complete on their own.
      They will complete a survey at enrollment and a follow up survey administered by email. The
      primary endpoint will be proportion with new documentation in the EHR at 8 weeks. Second
      endpoints will include the change in satisfaction with end-of-life plans, AD acceptability,
      self-reported rates of completion, self-reported rate of sharing with their preferred
      surrogate decision-maker, proportion with new documentation of preferred decision-maker in
      the chart, and qualitative feedback. Patients in both groups will receive follow up reminder
      emails encouraging them to complete the advance directive.
