      greater overall drug costs and cost-related non-adherence. Interventions are needed to
      stimulate appropriate generic drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers
      to branded medications that may impede essential medication use.

      The SAMPLES trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing
      physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and
      simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians
      in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions
      or to receive no samples. We will use pharmacy claims of their patient population enrolled in
      a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to evaluate outcomes of interest. The
      primary outcomes are physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are
      generic), and patient adherence to chronic therapy. Secondary outcomes will include physician
      adherence to established guidelines (for anti-hypertensive regimens) and overall prescription
      drug costs. Primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat principles.

      This trial highlights a new and innovative approach to stimulate cost-effective prescribing.
      Free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as out-of-pocket costs to the
      patient without sacrificing efficacy, and may result in improved adherence to essential
      cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice
      guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If found to be effective, this strategy
      could be utilized broadly by private insurers or government payers aiming to stimulate more
      cost-effective and higher-quality care.
