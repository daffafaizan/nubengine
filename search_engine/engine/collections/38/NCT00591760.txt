      with chronic heart failure (CHF): reductions in GH levels, reductions in IGF-1 and a pattern
      of peripheral resistance to GH, in particular in patients with severe heart failure and
      cardiac cachexia. Unpublished experience of our group support the concept that a considerable
      amount of CHF-patients have a coexisting Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), defined by current
      guidelines(GH stimulation test).

      Our study hypothesis is that correction of GH deficiency in patients with chronic heart
      failure may exert a beneficial effect on their cardiac function and remodeling, performance
      status and quality-of-life.

      Since this was a preliminary study, no sample size calculation was performed; treatment
      effects from were sought in left ventricular function (as assessed by cardiac MRI),
      cardiopulmonary exercise performance, clinical status, vascular reactivity, biochemistry and
      neurohumoral markers of disease (NT-proBNP).
