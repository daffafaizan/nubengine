      Patients aged 75 years or older with uncomplicated colonic cancer or precancerous colonic
      lesion non-endoscopically resectable, will be randomized to either colectomy by laparoscopy
      or laparotomy. All patients that might be included will have a comprehensive geriatric
      assessment performed within the 30 days before randomization with the following scores: MMS
      (Mini Mental Score), ADL scale (Activities of Daily Living), IADL scale (Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living), GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) and TGUG test ("Timed
      Get-Up-and-Go" test).
