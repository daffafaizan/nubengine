      chemotherapy regimens for HER-2 positive early breast cancer(EBC). Earlier use of trastuzumab
      could improve the DFS rate in HER2+ EBC. But due to the cardio-toxicity of both anthracycline
      and trastuzumab, the investigators usually avoid using these two drugs synchronously. The
      guidelines do not recommend ECH-TH regemin because of cardiac adverse effect. Doxorubicin
      liposome(A) has equivalent effect as anthracycline in advaced breast cancer(ABC), lower
      cardiac toxicity and could be combined use with trastuzumab. In this study, the investigators
      want to find out whether ACH-TH regimen compared with the EC-TH regimen in HER2+ EBC could
      improve the pCR rate in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
