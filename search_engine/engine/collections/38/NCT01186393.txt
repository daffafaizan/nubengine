      designed to induce weight loss and improve glycemic control in overweight subjects.

      This is a randomized, treatment-controlled, 3-arm, parallel study. The 3 arms of the study
      will include dietary manipulation in the free-living setting to include potatoes/potato
      products frequently in the diet (5-7 days / week). Two diets will be energy-restricted (~ 500
      kcal deficit /d) for weight loss and the control diet will be prescribed for weight
      maintenance. The two energy-restricted diets will include further manipulation, such that,
      one dietary plan will be a high glycemic index (GI) diet and the other a low glycemic index
      diet.
