      exposure. Some actinic keratoses may develop into skin cancers.

      Imiquimod 3.75% cream is an approved treatment for actinic keratoses that utilizes a regimen
      of application to the entire face or balding scalp of up to 2 packets of cream daily for two
      2-week cycles, separated by a 2-week no treatment interval.

      Photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 20% topical solution is also an approved
      treatment for actinic keratoses. ALA is applied to actinic keratoses, and after an incubation
      period, is excited with light. Although approved as a lesion-directed treatment for actinic
      keratoses, treatment of a field (e.g. face) with photodynamic therapy is commonly performed.

      Treatment with photodynamic therapy followed by imiquimod 5% cream has been reported in
      patients with actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma and Bowen's disease, and treatment with
      imiquimod 5% cream followed by photodynamic therapy in patients with vulvar intraepithelial
      neoplasia. There are, however, no prior studies on the safety and/or efficacy of using
      topical imiquimod 3.75% in conjunction with photodynamic therapy in the treatment of actinic
      keratoses.

      This study will use an open-label parallel cohort design in which all patients will received
      treatment with imiquimod 3.75% cream, and subsequently will be randomized to either
      photodynamic therapy or observation.
