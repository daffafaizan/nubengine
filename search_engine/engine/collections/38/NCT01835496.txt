    
      This is a single-arm, single-dose study of Ferriprox in patients with sickle cell disease.
      Patients found to be eligible will visit the clinic the day before receiving the drug, in
      order to reconfirm eligibility and to undergo baseline assessments, and will receive a single
      dose of 1500 mg Ferriprox under fasting conditions. Blood and urine samples for
      pharmacokinetic assessment will be collected over a 10-hour period. Standard safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study, and patients will return for a safety
      follow-up.
