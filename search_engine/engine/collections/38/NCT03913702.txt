      multiple potential benefit benefits to the society, the investigators aim to compare
      subacromial ketorolac versus methylprednisolone for the treatment of shoulder impingement
      syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that patients with shoulder impingement treated with
      a subacromial methylprednisolone versus ketorolac have similar outcomes based on the ASES
      (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon) self-assessment score. The study will be performed at
      one institution, the University of Texas Medical Branch.
