      characteristics among people with severe and advanced COPD who opt-in or opt out of PR
      services.

      The study includes data from: socio-demographic, anthropometric, physical (function,
      activity, muscle strength, balance) characteristics as well as self-reported symptoms of
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, lung symptoms, quality of life, sleep-quality, mortality,
      hospitaladmissions, length of stay and qualitative patient interviews.

      cohort.
