    
      This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I to II
      trial to determine the value of BNCT in the treatment of inoperable, irradiated, locally
      advanced cancers of the head and neck region. An attempt to perform 18F-labeled
      boronophenylalanine (18F-BPA) SPECT or PET imaging will be made before BNCT. Patients whose
      tumor uptake is >2.5 times that of the corresponding normal head and neck tissue will be
      enrolled, and treated with a single fraction BPA-based BNCT twice, 3 to 5 weeks apart.
      Another 18F-BPA SPECT or PET study may be performed 1 to 3 months after BNCT to determine the
      SPECT/PET response.

      The neutron irradiation site is the FiR 1 reactor site, located at Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland,
      about 6 kilometers from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, where patient
      evaluation and post-irradiation care will take place.

      Prior to BNCT, BPA is infused as a fructose complex (l-BPA-F) into a peripheral vein over 2
      hours. Blood samples will be taken for monitoring whole blood boron concentration before
      starting the BPA infusion, and thereafter at 20 to 40 minute intervals during the infusion,
      following infusion, and after delivering neutron irradiation. The blood samples will be
      analyzed for blood boron concentration to estimate the average blood boron concentration
      during neutron irradiation.

      All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
