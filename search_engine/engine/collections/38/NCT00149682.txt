      address weight and behaviors that contribute to obesity because of lack of knowledge,
      training, and access to resources. To address these physician barriers to counseling, the
      investigator has developed a web-based tool that collects and integrates relevant patient
      clinical and behavioral information online and generates patient-specific recommendations and
      links to resources in the form of electronic patient and physician reports. In doing so, the
      tool provides physicians with a time saving device that identifies at risk patients who are
      motivated to make behavioral changes; at the same time, the tool provides tailored resources
      and recommendations that help physicians deliver more effective counseling.

      The pilot study described in this application randomizes overweight primary care patients to
      a control group and the web-based intervention. The aims of the study are to examine the
      feasibility of incorporating the web-based tool into primary care practice and to collect
      preliminary data on its potential effectiveness on improving the rate and quality of
      physician-patient discussions about weight and on improving several clinical and behavioral
      outcomes.
