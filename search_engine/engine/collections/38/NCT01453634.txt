    
      This is a prospective, open-label, PD, safety, PK and efficacy study of Lunacalcipol
      Injection. Approximately 12 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups
      receiving either 180 µg (n=4) or 270 µg (n=8) Lunacalcipol Injection in a 1:2 ratio,
      respectively. All subjects are planned to receive a total of 11 doses of the study drug given
      three times per week (tiw) over 24 days (day 1 to day 24), administered not more often than
      every other day.

      Previously defined criteria relating to serum levels of iPTH, Ca, and P will be reviewed by
      the Medical Monitor to determine subject safety. If any of the criteria are observed,
      subjects will be discontinued from the study, receiving no further administration of the
      study drug and will be followed for safety. Safety data will be reviewed by the Medical
      Monitor for the first 2 subjects in the 270 µg group. If the first 2 subjects meet dose group
      discontinuation criteria, including treatment emergent calciphylaxis, treatment-emergent
      adverse events (TEAEs) related to elevated serum Ca levels, or a reported death associated
      with elevated serum Ca levels or related to study drug, subjects beyond the first 2 will not
      be dosed.

      A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to provide an independent
      evaluation of all safety data, including all laboratory results and serious adverse events
      (SAEs). The DSMB will conduct its review after 4 subjects in the 270 µg dose group have
      completed at least 6 doses, at any time death is reported, or at the request of the DSMB. The
      DSMB will also conduct an additional review at the End of Study.
