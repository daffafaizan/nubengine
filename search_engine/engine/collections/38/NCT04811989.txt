        1. To analyze the contribution of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables
           to diabetic foot care adherence and knowledge, and perceived foot health, over time.

        2. To analyze the differences between groups over time in diabetic foot care adherence,
           knowledge on foot care, and perceived foot health.

        3. To examine the mediating role of representations about diabetic foot in the relationship
           between knowledge about foot care and adherence to diabetic foot care, over time,
           controlling for health literacy.

        4. To examine the moderating role of foot pain, foot function, and footwear between
           representations about diabetic foot and adherence to diabetic foot care/ perceived foot
           health, over time.

      Data Analysis:

      Generalized Mixed Models, which allow examining changes over time including longitudinal
      mediation and moderation.

      Sample size calculation:

      Considering a dropout rate of 10%, the sample size required is 60 patients (20 per group).

      Procedure:

      Participants will be assessed at the first consultation of the diabetic foot (T0), about two
      weeks after the first assessment (T1), and three months after the T0 in a follow-up
      assessment (T2), with T1 and T2 being performed through telephone calls.
