      delivered by caesarean section after the spontaneous onset of uterine contractions, or after
      oxytocin exposure. Moreover, benefits for the mother due to stretching of the lower uterine
      segment and possible lower blood loss are plausible.

      In obstetrics, there is a well described and standardized way to induce artificial uterine
      contractions in order to predict fetal wellbeing and tolerance of labor, without inducing the
      labor itself. This is the oxytocin challenge test (OCT). Although the OCT has not been
      performed previously in the context of planned elective caesarean section deliveries, it is
      generally considered a safe procedure if appropriate monitoring is granted. Hence evaluation
      of the role of artificial uterine contractions in perinatal respiratory morbidity of term
      infants delivered by elective caesarean section is possible and of interest.
