      continuous low-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (LDIVH) infusion for the prevention of
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) induced neurocognitive dysfunction and other
      delayed neurological deficits.

      Additionally, increased blood and CSF levels of certain inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, hsCRP,
      etc) have been correlated to aSAH patients with poor clinical outcomes. Unfractionated
      heparin (UFH) has known anti-inflammatory actions. As a result, a secondary objective of this
      study will be to evaluate whether LDIVH can reduce blood and CSF inflammatory biomarkers
      levels compared to controls and whether there is any association between inflammatory
      biomarker levels and cognitive outcomes in aSAH.
