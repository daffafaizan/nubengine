      Fr. sheath is around 5-10%, compared to the single feasibility study of the Glidesheath
      Slender by Aminian et al (see reference in the citations), the rate of radial artery
      occlusion was reported 0.88%.

      This study will be a prospective randomized, single-blinded (patient-blinded) study,
      comparing the rate of radial artery occlusion and vascular access site complications between
      the Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and the standard 6 Fr. radial sheath in
      patients undergoing transradial coronary catheterization.

        -  The study will enroll patients who will undergo elective or emergency coronary
           angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via transradial approach at
           the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.

        -  A baseline clinical vascular & ultrasound assessment will be performed prior to the
           procedure to document patency of the radial artery.

        -  Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive the Terumo Glidesheath
           Slender versus the currently used 6 Fr. sheath.

        -  The standard angiogram/ PCI will be performed as per usual practice.

        -  Following the angiogram, clinical vascular assessment as well as an ultrasound will be
           performed prior to discharge.

        -  At 30 days follow up the patient will come back for clinical and ultrasound assessment
           of radial artery patency and access site vascular complications.
