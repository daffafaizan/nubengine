      demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies to be the best candidate for trachoma treatment
      (T1225 1.5% eye drops BID for 3 days) with a shorter duration of treatment (T1225 1.5% eye
      drops BID for 2 days) and with a single oral administration of AZM (20 mg/kg) in patients
      suffering from active trachoma. The study was to be performed in approximately 600 children
      (aged 1 to 10 years) from Guinea Conakry and Pakistan.
