      of 2.5 gm each without a break in therapy for a total of three cycles. All patients who
      receive at least one dose of resveratrol will be evaluated for toxicity and tolerability.
      Toxicities will be assessed every 28 days while the study drug is being taken by the patient.
      Pill bottles will be reviewed at this visit as well to ensure compliance with the study
      medication. Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Blood
      will be drawn for a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. In addition, one
      vial of serum will be stored at the time of each toxicity assessment for later analysis of
      resveratrol levels. This level must be drawn one hour after the morning dose and the
      participants will be instructed to alter the time of the morning dose so as to allow proper
      timing with the scheduled blood draw.

      During the third cycle of treatment, a post-treatment biopsy will be obtained for study
      related purposes and will be processed only for research related purposes.
