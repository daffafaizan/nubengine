    
      4-Demethylcholesterylpenclomedine(DM-CHOC-PEN)is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryl
      carbonate that has demonstrated complete remissions when administrated to mice bearing
      intracranially implanted human cancer xenografts (glioblastomas and breast cancers) and has
      acceptable preclinical toxicity profiles - mice, rats and dogs.

      The drug is being administered intravenously once every 21 days as an infusion. The starting
      dose was 39 mg/M2 (based on 1/10 LD10 observed in mice and rats).

      A modified accelerated dosing protocol of Simon, Freidlin, et al is in process to escalate
      dosage which will reduce the number of patients required and minimize ineffective doses. The
      protocol will result in one patient cohorts at 40% dosage escalations. When the 1st instance
      of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) [grade - 3 or 4 toxicity] is observed, or the 2nd instance
      of a 1st course grade 2 toxicity of any type is observed, the cohort for that current dose
      level will be expanded to 3-6 patients and escalation will proceed at 33% increments.

      During the entirety of the study, intra-patient escalation will be allowed. This will occur
      if the patient experiences are < grade 2 toxicity at the existing dose, if no > grade 2
      toxicity was identified at the existing dose and no DLTs were noted at the higher dose level
      (if any patients had been escalated to that dose).

      Continuation of therapy - Patients who experience stabilization, partial or complete
      remission while being treated will continue to receive the drug as per the last dose prior to
      identifying positive results at an every 3 weeks interval.

      Discontinuation of therapy - progressive disease and/or toxicities.
