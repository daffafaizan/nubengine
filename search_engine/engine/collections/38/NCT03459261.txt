      avoiding devastating complications. Diagnosing POM is difficult due to the lack of a highly
      specific and sensitive test, such as in myocardial infarct, stroke and intracranial bleeding.
      Serum inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cells
      (WBC) can support clinical findings but they are not able to differentiate between
      inflammatory response to infection and the host response to non-infection insult with high
      specificity and sensitivity.

      The prospective nonrandomised cohort study included 86 patients after high-energy injury to
      the shin requiring primary surgical treatment (open or closed reduction and internal fixation
      of tibial fracture). Values of the biochemical and immunoinflammatory profile were measured
      on admission (ADD), first postoperative day (POD1) and fourth-postoperative day (POD4).

      The objectives of the study were to investigate that the biochemical and immunoinflammatory
      profile could facilitate postoperative monitoring, guide the antibiotic treatment and timing
      of revision surgery.
