      carboplatin works in treating ovarian cancer. Platinum containing drugs such as carboplatin
      are the standard treatment for ovarian cancer, and are effective for many women. However, in
      many women the cancer eventually stops responding to the chemotherapy (becomes resistant).

      The active part of NOV-002 is a substance made by the body that is involved in many chemical
      reactions in cells. NOV-002 does not directly kill cancer cells, but previous research has
      shown that it may make cancer cells more likely to be killed by chemotherapy drugs.
      Specifically, it may help platinum chemotherapy kill cancer that has become resistant to
      platinum chemotherapy. Previous trials have also shown that patients receiving NOV-002 in
      addition to carboplatin may have tolerated chemotherapy better than those who received
      chemotherapy alone. NOV-002 has been used in other research studies on various types of
      cancer. It is approved for use in Russia. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use outside of research studies.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if adding NOV-002 to the
      chemotherapy drug carboplatin works in treating ovarian cancer in women whose cancer has
      stopped responding to carboplatin chemotherapy alone.
