    
      This is a Phase III multicenter, open-label, non-comparative trial of the Woman's Condom to
      evaluate contraceptive efficacy as the primary method of contraception. Secondary evaluations
      include safety assessment, incidence of UTIs, symptomatic vaginal infection, performance of
      the Woman's Condom (clinical breakage, slippage, misdirection, and invagination) and overall
      acceptability of the product. We will perform a Substudy to assess the semen biomarker as a
      means of detecting product failure in a subset of subjects.
