      Primary

        -  Compare the sensitivity and specificity of microsatellite analysis (MSA) of urine
           sediment with cystoscopy and urine cytology for detecting bladder cancer in participants
           undergoing cystoscopy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the temporal performance characteristics of MSA in urine sediment from these
           participants.

        -  Determine which of the 15 individual markers or combination of markers that make up the
           MSA test are most predictive of the presence of bladder cancer in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-blind, multicenter, cohort study.

      Urine and blood specimens are collected from all participants at baseline. Urine specimens
      are examined using microsatellite analysis, urine cytology, and urinalysis. Patients in
      groups 2 and 3 also undergo cystoscopy at baseline.

      Patients in group 3 undergo cystoscopy, upper tract imaging (e.g., abdominal CT scan),
      microsatellite analysis, urine cytology, and urinalysis every 3 months for 2 years in the
      absence of progressive disease.

      Microsatellite analysis, which identifies loss of heterozygosity using polymerase chain
      reaction technique, is conducted for 15 markers: D4S243, D21S1245, FGA, D17S695, D16S476,
      D9S171, IFN-A, D20S48, D13S802, D17S654, D16S310, THO1, D9S162, D9S747, and MBP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 participants (100 each for groups 1 and 2 and 300 for group
      3) will be accrued for this study.
