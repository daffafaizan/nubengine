      autoregulation and regional cerebral oxygen saturation should be monitored if disturbances of
      cerebral perfusion and oxygenation have to be suspected. Noninvasive monitoring techniques
      are established. When detected early, disturbed perfusion and oxygenation may be treated
      promptly and permanent damage of brain tissue can be avoided.

      In critically ill patients, hemodynamic changes occur due to the disease itself but also as a
      function of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Systemic hemodynamic changes can be
      monitored using PiCCO® system (pulse contour cardiac output, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich,
      Germany) that combines transpulmonal thermodilution and pulse contour analysis. PiCCO®
      continuously monitors cardiac output (CO), as well as static parameters like global
      enddiastolic blood volume index (GEDVI), and dynamic parameters as difference in pulse
      pressure (dPP) and stroke volume variation (SVV), respectively. CC Nexfin® (BMeye, Amsterdam,
      The Netherlands) is a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor.

      This study investigates the effects of changes in cardiac output on cerebral blood flow
      velocity and regional cerebral oxygen saturation in intensive care patients that underwent
      major abdominal surgery.
