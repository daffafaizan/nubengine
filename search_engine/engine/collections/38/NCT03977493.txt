    
      After a baseline evaluation, each patient will receive a first injection of
      IncobotulinumtoxinA or placebo (50:50 randomization) in a double blinding setting. Assessment
      of the Focal hand dystonia (FHD) will be done at each site by an investigator blinded to the
      treatment.

      A first evaluation of the efficacy will be performed after 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, patients
      unsatisfied with treatment and wishing to continue the treatment will receive an injection of
      IncobotulinumtoxinA regardless of the treatment arm they were initially assigned to at
      baseline. These patients will subsequently be excluded from the study.

      A second assessment will be performed after 12 weeks (only for patients not receiving a
      second injection of IncobotulinumtoxinA at week 6).
