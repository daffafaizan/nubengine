      the operating room. When family members need to be contacted during the operation, whether
      family members in the waiting area can be notified in time will affect the overall operation
      time of the patient and the utilization rate of the operating room. The way of contact also
      indirectly affects issues such as hospital costs and patient privacy. This study is a
      comparative study of the benefits of different ways of contacting patients' family members
      during surgery.

      This study will compare the current traditional method (using radio and telephone to notify
      the patient's family to the operating room) or the wireless vibrating caller to notify the
      patient's family to the operating room, and analyze the variables generated by the two
      different methods including demand time of notification, acceptance, and patient privacy
      issues. The results of the study will use scientific data to prove which way to notify the
      patient's family is more efficient and a good way to take into account of the patient's
      privacy.
