      shoulder joint among inpatients or outpatients in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine
      of our hospital, who had a stroke of fewer than 2 years, and the findings suitable for
      adhesive capsulitis, namely the thickness of the joint capsule in the axillary concave
      Identify those with thickened findings. Their shoulder power rating, passive range of motion,
      stiffness evaluation (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS), and the presence or absence of Reflex
      Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) were evaluated, and the relationship with ultrasound findings was
      investigated.
