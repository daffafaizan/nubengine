      study was performed as a two-dimensional randomized, between-patient RSP designed multicenter
      study with two interventional- and one response variable. The interventional variables
      "Number of OMT's" and "Treatment Interval" with common response variable formed two
      independent one-dimensional randomized between-patient RSP studies. The response variable was
      the percent reduction in sum of the five GERD score from baseline. Three GERD patients were
      allocated on the first design level given six OMT with five days' interval. Based on results
      obtained in the first and second design level, five patients were included to the second
      design level and seven to the third.
