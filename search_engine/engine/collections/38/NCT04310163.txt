    
      This is a natural history study, for up to 2 years, during which parents or guardians of a
      GM1 child collect video data of patients doing specific daily life activities at baseline and
      follow-up timepoints throughout the study (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months) and/or submit videos
      taken in the past through a secure smart phone mobile application. The video assessments
      focus on several hallmarks of GM1 progression. Caregivers participate in qualitative
      interviews to provide context for the videos and discuss any changes they observe during the
      study. Activity videos will be evaluated by expert clinicians using both Clinical Global
      Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scales. The
      caregiver interviews and clinician-rated activities will inform the patient-specific disease
      trajectories for each hallmark. There is no treatment or intervention associated with this
      study.
