      the antidiabetic activities of Allium hookeri have been documented in animal studies, the
      improved effects of Allium hookeri on human are not clear. Therefore, in this study, the
      researchers investigated whether Allium hookeri root extract could be effective in reducing
      the risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes.
