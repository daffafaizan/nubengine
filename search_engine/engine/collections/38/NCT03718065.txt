      week, participants will be asked to abstain from opioid use other than buprenorphine.
      Participants will come to the clinic 3 times that week for urine drug testing. If all 3 tests
      are negative, participants will be randomly assigned to take either lofexidine or placebo
      (inactive medication) two to three times a day for 5 weeks. During this time, participants
      will upload videos of themselves taking their medication. They will come to the clinic 3
      times a week for urine drug screens and to have their vital signs measured. They will also
      participate in "CREMA" sessions (Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment) 2 times a day.
      These sessions include looking at stressful and neutral pictures and rating stress and
      craving. At the end of five weeks, participants will return to the clinic and participate in
      a stress task and a scripted opioid imagery task the following day. For the next five days,
      participants will taper their medication dose. During this time they will continue to come to
      clinic to have their vital signs measured and complete a follow-up visit.
