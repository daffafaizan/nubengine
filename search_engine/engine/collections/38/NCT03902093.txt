      the patient the time involved in the study and arrange an appointment with the patient if
      interested.

      A series of appointments are designed to follow up the patient's development with the device
      at determined times during the process. On the first appointment the patient will be
      consented prior to any tests or health services given.

      The first and last appointments are the longest ones with a duration of about 1 and a half
      hours for questionnaires, medical history, and device fitting. Additionally, all appointments
      include measurement of ear canal relative humidity which should take a total of 30 minutes
      and imaging of the area to determine thickness and blood flow in the tissue surrounding the
      device. Follow-up appointments with the Audiologist will take 45 minutes for all basic
      procedures. The Lyric device is used commercially and Audiologist can provide it to patients
      already, but the purpose of this study is to use a pioneer technique with a device that looks
      inside the ear canal in the same way as a regular used speculum to look at details of the
      tissue around the device to see if any changes occur due to extended wear of the Lyric
      hearing aid device.

      The complete study per person will be completed in about six months. An Audiologist will
      perform all the audiology testing plus the ear canal humidity measurements and his/her time
      will be covered by the sponsor (a total of 9 hours per patient). The Lyric devices will be
      provided on loan by the sponsor as well as the equipment and software needed to make the ear
      canal humidity measurements. The imaging measurements will be conducted by the Audiologist
      trained in using the handheld device.
