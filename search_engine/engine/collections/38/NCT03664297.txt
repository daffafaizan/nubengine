    
      SHR1459 is a selective small molecule BTK inhibitor developed by Jiangsu Hengrui medicine
      Limited, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of BTK and down regulation of BCR signal
      transduction pathway, And then selectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of B cell
      tumor. The objective of this phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of SHR1459
      in patients with replaced/refractory mature B cell neoplasms, in order to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for phase 2 clinical study (RP2D);
