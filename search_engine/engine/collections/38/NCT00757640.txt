      gastrectomy than in general population. This higher incidence is probably related to surgical
      dissection of the vagus nerve branches and the anatomical gastrointestinal reconstruction.
      Therefore, some surgeons perform routine concomitant cholecystectomy during standard surgery
      for gastric malignancies. However, not all the patients who are diagnosed to have
      cholelithiasis after gastric cancer surgery will develop symptoms or require additional
      surgical treatments and a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible even in those
      patients who underwent previous gastric surgery.
