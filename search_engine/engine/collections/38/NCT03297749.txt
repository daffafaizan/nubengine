      will have periodontal and dental examination for diagnosis of caries and periodontal
      diseases. They will undergo blood, saliva, GCF and subgingival plaque sampling and a series
      of tests on cardiovascular disease, including measures of pulse-wave velocity,carotid
      intima-media thickness and echocardiography assessment. Statistical analysis will assess
      associations between dental diagnoses and metabolic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, genetic,
      microbial and cardiovascular risk outcomes.
