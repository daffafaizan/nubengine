      30.06.2019 and 30.12.2019. Study Kartal İstanbul Prof. Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Training and Research
      Hospital Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Under the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Ahmet
      Kale, it will be conducted by Kazibe Koyuncu. The study was planned as a pilot study since it
      was planned to investigate the results of performing the surgical method with the posterior
      approach instead of the anterior approach and it was calculated that the inclusion of 20
      patients would be sufficient. It is planned to include 20 patients between 30-60 years of age
      who applied to hospital with prolapse complaint and completed fertility request. Patients'
      symptoms and physical examinations will be recorded in accordance with international
      standards and questionnaires will be applied to the files in order to make objective
      evaluation before and after surgery. Pre-and post-operative POP-Q classifications will be
      recorded in the files, PFDI-20 questionnaire evaluating the severity of prolapse before and
      after the surgery, and PGI questionnaire evaluating postoperative satisfaction. In the
      pectouteropexy operation we applied to the patients, the support of the uterus posterior was
      insufficient in the sling fixation with mesh suture to the anterior and iliopectineal
      ligaments of the uterine cervix. We aimed to increase the efficiency of the operation by
      hanging the uterine cervix posterolaterale to the iliopectineal ligament with the anterior
      uterine cervix in order to get better results with this method, which can be applied more
      safely and easily than the other sling methods. Consent form is attached.

      There are validity-reliability studies of the questionnaires to be used in Turkish.
