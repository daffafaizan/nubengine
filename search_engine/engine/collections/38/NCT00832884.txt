      the fall of 2008. Lacosamide is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of
      partial onset seizure disorder in patients' age seventeen years and older. A parenteral
      dosage form of Lacosamide is desirable for patients who are temporarily unable to take
      medication orally. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of IV Lacosamide in
      children with epilepsy, ages 4 to 35 years, who are either unable to take oral medication, or
      whom parenteral administration of IV Lacosamide is desirable.
