    
      This protocol is a prospective, randomized, single center, designed to evaluate incidence of
      cytomegalovirus recurrence infection/disease in two immunosuppressive regimens, after the
      first episode of cytomegalovirus: (1) conversion of azathioprine or mycophenolate to
      sirolimus, in a regimen wih low doses tacrolimus and prednisone; ( 2) Maintenance of the
      current regimen during the first episode of cytomegalovirus infection ( azathioprine or
      mycophenolate, in combination to tacrolimus or prednisone). Our hypothesis is that conversion
      from azathioprine or sodium mycophenolate to sirolimus, with low doses of tacrolimus, and
      prednisone results in lower recurrence of cytomegalovirus infection/disease in kidney
      transplant recipients.
