      infarction (MI). Despite these consistent findings, there are almost no prospective data
      unequivocally documenting a benefit of antiischemic therapy on prognosis in patients with
      silent ischemia. There is some indirect evidence of a better outcome after repeat angioplasty
      for silent restenosis. In patients with a recent MI, the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot
      study documented a short-term benefit of antiischemic drug therapy and angioplasty in
      patients with silent and symptomatic ischemic episodes. However, long-term outcome data in
      totally asymptomatic patients is missing and it is unknown whether angioplasty in addition to
      secondary preventive measures is superior to antiischemic drug therapy in these patients.
      Therefore, the (SWISSI 2) study was started 15 years ago with the aim of comparing the
      effects of angioplasty with medical therapy, each combined with secondary preventive advice,
      aspirin and statin therapy, on long-term outcome in patients with recent MI and an exercise
      test without symptoms but silent ischemia verified by stress imaging.
