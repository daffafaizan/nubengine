      tightly coupled with cerebral metabolism and can be used as a marker of neural activity.
      Resting state magnetic resonance imaging which measures synchronous activity across the
      brain, allows detection of functional connectivity of intrinsic brain network. Diffusion
      tensor imaging detects the anisotropic water diffusion in axonal fibres can provide
      information on connectivity and fibre tracts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy would enable
      the levels of neurotransmitter to be elucidated.
