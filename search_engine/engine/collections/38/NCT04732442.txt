      oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in the preoperative period is widely accepted in reducing
      the incidence of perioperative complications and immunonutrition is generally recommended.
      However, there is little clinical data regarding the impact of such treatment on a tumor
      biology.

      Investigators want to perform Randomized Controlled Trial to explore the impact of the use of
      immunonutrition in relation to standard nutritional support in the preoperative period on
      alternating the expression of inflammatory response cytokines expression and leukocytes
      infiltration in tumor tissue in patients operated for colorectal cancer.
