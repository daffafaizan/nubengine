      triaged using the Swiss Emergency Triage Scale (SETS), a 4-level symptom-based triage scale.
      At the end of the triage process the triage nurse has to choose an emergency level and a main
      presenting complaint among a listing of 98 presenting complaints. The SETS recommends a pain
      evaluation for 44 out of the SETS 98 presenting complaint.

      After this evaluation, a protocol standardize administration of analgesia for patients
      presenting pain.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether pain is correctly evaluated when
      required by the SETS criteria for the 44 presenting complaints.

      The secondary objectives are (1) to evaluate whether an appropriate treatment is delivered
      when pain is present, and (2) to identify predictors of pain evaluation and treatment.
