      mapping arm draining lymphatics and nodes and compare it to isosulfan blue (IS-BLUE) in the
      setting of sentinel node procedures with or without axillary node dissections in women with
      breast cancer. All participants will also have tumor samples evaluated with
      99technetium-sulfur colloid, a radiolabel used to identify tumor markers.
