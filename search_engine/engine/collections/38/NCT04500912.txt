    
      Study design: An Investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized clinical trial in HBR
      patients receiving PCI with Supraflex Cruz or Ultimaster Tansei stents

      Study population: 2 x 368 (736) patients, who undergo a PCI and are at high risk for bleeding
      (HBR).

      Intervention: Patients are treated according to the randomized regimen at index PCI and at
      planned staged procedures. Either with the ultrathin stent strut Supraflex Cruz stent to the
      thin stent strut Ultimaster Tansei stent

      DAPT treatment (combination and duration) is according to the Guidelines of the European
      Society of Cardiology for Myocardial Revascularization.

      Follow-up is scheduled at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months post index PCI procedure.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      The primary endpoint Net Adverse Clinical Endpoints (NACE) defined as a composite of
      cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, stroke and
      bleeding events defined as BARC 3 or 5 at 12 months follow-up after the index PCI.
