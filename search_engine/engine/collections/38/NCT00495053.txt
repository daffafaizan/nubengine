      electrocardiograms, and physical examinations.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravesical instillation of
      hMaxi-K compared to the control group. Efficacy parameters that will be evaluated are: mean
      number of micturitions per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours,
      mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours, overall maximum bladder capacity, number of
      uninhibited contractions during the cystometry procedure, participant rating of urgency
      score, participant rating of perceived bladder condition severity, participant assessment of
      response to treatment, participant rating of Quality of Life (Kings Health Questionnaire),
      SF-12 Health Survey, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-SF), and
      pad weight measurement of accidental bladder leaks.
