      (using a portable monitor and auto-CPAP) or in-lab evaluation with a PSG and
      manually-titrated CPAP. We will obtain sleep, sleepiness and quality of life questionnaires,
      vigilance testing and blood pressure at baseline and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of therapy.
      We will also assess and compare compliance with CPAP therapy in each arm of the study.
