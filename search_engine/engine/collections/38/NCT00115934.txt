      Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and related single right ventricle anomalies are the
      highest risk congenital cardiovascular malformations. Surgical repair begins with the Norwood
      procedure during the newborn period, a stage II procedure at 4 to 6 months of age, and Fontan
      procedure at 18 to 36 months. The Norwood procedure remains one of the highest risk
      procedures in congenital heart surgery. A few small nonrandomized studies of a novel approach
      to the Norwood procedure have reported improved outcomes. This new approach uses a RV-to-PA
      shunt to provide pulmonary blood flow rather than the standard MBTS. This multi-center,
      randomized clinical trial will evaluate early and intermediate-term outcomes for patients
      undergoing a Norwood procedure with either the RV-to-PA shunt or the MBTS.
