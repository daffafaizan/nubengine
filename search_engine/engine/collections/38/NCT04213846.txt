      data and deliver a personalized intervention (mAEC) using participants' own event-level,
      real-world experiences to challenge proximal alcohol expectancies and alter the associations
      between alcohol expectancies and drinking and consequences. The mobile app intervention will
      be used in a randomized controlled trial comparing young adult college students who receive
      the intervention with those who only receive assessments via the mobile app. Assessments
      include an eligibility survey, baseline assessment, and follow-up assessments occurring 1-,
      6-, and 12-months post-intervention.

      The goal of the intervention is to target college students' alcohol expectancies (what they
      believe or expect alcohol's effects to be) and the associations between alcohol expectancies
      and alcohol use and related consequences. Intervention content will utilize twice daily
      messages, one in the morning (AM Messages) and one in the late afternoon or early evening (PM
      Messages). Most PM Messages draw on information collected in the daily assessments
      (Personalized Messages). Intervention Messages in general will include feedback based on
      selected assessment items, weekly summaries generated from the daily assessments, general
      psycho-educational messages and videos about alcohol, and a toolbox with content that
      supplements information provided in the daily intervention messages.
