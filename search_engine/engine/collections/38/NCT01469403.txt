      annually increase. In the year 2000 was performed approximately 2,500 operations and in 2008
      was performed more than 7,500 total knee arthroplasty operations, and there appears in all
      countries to be similar tendency. Meanwhile, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has
      increased markedly over the last 50 years. Approximately 13% of the Danish population is
      obese. For several years the association between obesity and knee osteoarthritis (OA) has
      been recognized, and osteoarthritis is the most frequent indication for total knee
      arthroplasty(80%).

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether weight loss interventions before primary
      total knee arthroplasty will improve quality of life and functional level, reduce pain and
      risk of early and late postoperative complications.

      Sample size Significance level is set to 5% by using a 2-sided analysis and the power is set
      at 80%. Based on an expectation of a difference in patient-reported outcome scores in between
      the groups at 8%, as measured by SF-36 12 months postoperatively, standard deviation (SD) 13
      must be include 41 participants in each group. To allow a drop-out rate of 20% the group size
      increases to 51 participants in each group. In total 102 participants.

      Statistical analysis, The two groups scores at 12 months postoperatively, and the two groups'
      change in the primary outcome measurer, from 1 week before surgery to 12 months
      postoperatively, compared with t-test or Mann-Whitney test rang sum depending on data
      distribution.
