      severe bleeding which can lead to hemorrhagic shock. During shock, inadequate perfusion of
      critical organs can lead to local ischemia and tissue hypoxia (insufficient oxygenation),
      which can be detected by an increase in serum lactate levels. Despite optimal care, more than
      10% of trauma victims who reach hospital alive will die, and many will suffer from organ
      failure. Death and significant, persistent morbidity are consequences of trauma, and
      traumatic injuries are associated with lost productivity, reduced quality of life, and direct
      costs to patients and health care systems worldwide. Current therapies, which also include
      blood transfusion, are aimed at supporting failing organs, but a therapeutic agent that could
      help to quickly restore adequate oxygenation may be beneficial to prevent or shorten duration
      of organ failure and improve patient outcome.

      Direct support for the proposed clinical application to use MP4OX in resuscitation from
      hemorrhage is found in preclinical animal studies. Using a pig model of uncontrolled
      hemorrhage and resuscitation, survival was greater and restoration of hemodynamics and
      acid-base status were improved with MP4OX relative to an equivalent volume of crystalloid,
      pentastarch, or unmodified hemoglobin. Administration of MP4OX improved 24-hour survival,
      stabilized cardiac output and arterial pressure at nearly normal levels, and reduced lactate
      levels more effectively than the control fluids. Importantly, these benefits of MP4OX were
      observed with or without co-administration of autologous blood, suggesting that blood alone
      was not sufficient to achieve complete resuscitation, and that the effects of MP4OX appear to
      be additional to those of blood.
