    
      This is a single-centre, non-randomized study investigating the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of substrate guided ablation in persistent AF.

      The study population will be patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with symptomatic,
      persistent atrial fibrillation (≥1 year) referred for catheter ablation on standard clinical
      grounds.

      The catheter ablation procedure will be performed using the Precision Ensite™ three
      dimensional mapping system and the Advisor High Density Grid™ mapping catheter (Abbott
      Medical Incorporated). All patients will undergo conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).
      As an adjunctive strategy to PVI, low voltage areas (used as a surrogate for atrial scar), as
      derived from the voltage map, will be targeted for ablation in order to isolate or homogenise
      these areas of the atrium. A pre-procedural cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan will be
      performed in all patients.

      All patients will undergo 12 months follow-up with an ECG and ambulatory holter monitoring at
      3, 6 and 12 months.
