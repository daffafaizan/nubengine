      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obese and subjects with family history of T2DM (FH+).
      Exercise increases mitochondrial capacity whereas lipid infusion or high fat diet decreases
      genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study 2 cohorts will be involved: Cohort
      I (athletes, T2DM and obese) and Cohort II (healthy with "FH+" or without "FH-" family
      history of T2DM). This randomized, parallel arm clinical trial will consist of 4 periods:
      screening, stabilization (3 days), baseline (for Cohort I and II) and exercise period (14
      days, only for Cohort II). The overall objective of the study is to validate a paradigm for
      the evaluation of compounds and drugs that activate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal
      muscle. In Specific Aim 1 we will compare and contrast biopsy and MRS power to detect
      differences in mitochondrial capacity in 78 subjects: athletes (N=10), FH- (N=24), FH+
      (N=24), obese (N=10) and T2DM (N=10). In Specific Aim 2 we will compare mitochondrial changes
      in response to exercise in subjects FH - vs. FH + subjects. In Specific Aim 3 we will
      determine if HFD impairs mitochondrial changes in response to exercise in FH+ subjects. In
      Specific Aim 4 we will determine the role of mitochondrial capacity in metabolic flexibility
      and insulin sensitivity in T2DM, obese, FH+, FH- and athlete subjects.
