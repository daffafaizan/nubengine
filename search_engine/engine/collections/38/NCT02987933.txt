      of normal subjects to allow a high level of classification accuracy of whether subjects have
      chronic pain. In addition, investigators will utilize DTI and a brief activation state using
      pain rumination to assess whether investigators can reliably find differences between chronic
      pain sufferers and healthy normals. The analysis will use pattern recognition methods in a
      leave N out cross validation design. The success of the classifications will be the mean of
      all the validation runs.
