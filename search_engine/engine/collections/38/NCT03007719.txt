    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the change in fluorine F 18 Ara-G ([18F]F-AraG) uptake in primary and/or
      metastatic tumor(s) on whole-body [18F]F-AraG PET/MR imaging associated with neoadjuvant
      atezolizumab and standard of care (SOC) anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate change in [18F]F-AraG uptake within the primary tumor with clinical and
      pathologic response in patients treated with neoadjuvant atezolizumab. (Cohort 1) II. To
      assess [18F]F-AraG uptake in lymphoid organs before and after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1
      treatment. (Cohort 1 and 2)

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 or 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (NEOADJUVANT COHORT): Patients receive fluorine F 18 Ara-G intravenously (IV) and
      undergo PET/MR imaging over 1.5-3 hours within 7 days of starting standard of care
      atezolizumab and within 7 days before surgery.

      COHORT II (SOC COHORT): Patients receive fluorine F 18 Ara-G IV and undergo PET/MR imaging
      over 1.5-3 hours within 7 days of initiating course 1 of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy and
      between day 15 of course 1 and day 7 of course 2 of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at days 2 and 8.
