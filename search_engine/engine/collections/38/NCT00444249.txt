      surgery, will be randomized into one of four groups. Group I and II are blue light filtering
      intraocular lenses and group III and IV are white lenses. Group I and III are lenses form
      Alcon, group II and IV are lenses form Hoya. The following examinations will be performed
      before, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery: vein puncture for melatonin
      analysis, visual acuity, complete slit lamp analysis including intraocular pressure, pupil
      size measurement, and questionnaire about sleeping time and sleeping quality. At the
      follow-up visits the following examinations will also be performed: autofluorescein imaging,
      infrared imaging, and optical coherence tomography imaging. Vein puncture will be performed
      between 8 and 10 a.m. and has to be performed at the same time for the same patient. Pupils
      are not allowed to be dilated by the time of vein puncture and pupil size measurement.
