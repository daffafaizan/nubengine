      to receive blinded MK-1092 subcutaneously (SC) or glargine SC, as a single dose under the
      euglycemic clamp. Once a safe and tolerated dose that achieves GIRmax is identified in Part
      1, Part 2 will start. In Part 2, 4 different healthy adult participants will be enrolled in a
      single panel and receive open-label MK-1092 SC as a single dose under the euglycemic clamp
      and also receive an intravenous infusion of HumalogÂ®. In Part 3, adult participants with T1DM
      will be randomized to receive blinded MK-1092 SC or insulin glargine SC, as a single dose
      under the euglycemic clamp. Part 4 includes a 3-period (Periods 1, 2, and 3) design that will
      explore up to 3 single subcutaneous doses of MK-1092 or insulin glargine in participants with
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
