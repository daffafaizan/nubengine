      the patient is awake) potent topical steroid agents, during initial stage of inflammation,
      and evaluated at frequent intervals, with a schedule of steroid tapering dictated by clinical
      response. The most common topical corticosteroid prescribed for the treatment of anterior
      uveitis are prednisolone acetate 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% and
      Difluprednate 0.05%. However, topical treatments are limited by the potential for patient
      non-adherence and variation in drug concentrations due to the intermittent or suspension of
      use nature of application. A corticosteroid insert placed in the inferior and superior
      canaliculi provides the advantages of reliable and continuous drug delivery for 24 hours a
      day for 30 days without the need for patients to adhere to a treatment regimen. Dextenza is a
      sustained-release dexamethasone intracanalicular insert recently approved by the FDA for pain
      and inflammation post ophthalmic surgery. Dextenza was shown to decrease inflammation and
      pain compared with placebo following cataract surgery in a multicenter randomized clinical
      trial.
