      20mg glatiramer acetate (GA) (20mg/daily) to GA 40mg three times a week (40mg x 3/weekly) on
      thalamus pathology, as measured by changes in diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We hypothesize that GA 40mg x 3/weekly will
      exert similar, if not better effect on prevention of thalamic pathology, as compared to GA
      20mg/daily. The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of switching
      from GA 20mg/daily to GA 40mg x 3/weekly on evolution of microstructural changes in normal
      appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal appearing gray matter (NAGM), as measured by DTI.
