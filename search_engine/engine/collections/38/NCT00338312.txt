      a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Patients
      were stratified based on presence/absence of uterus and randomized to receive placebo or
      testosterone transdermal system. Patients had to maintain a stable dose of estrogen/progestin
      throughout the study. Patients who completed the first 52 weeks of the study were given the
      opportunity to participate in year 2-4 open-label (active treatment) study extension which
      was added to the protocol by amendment. Safety was assessed by adverse events, lipids, serum
      chemistry with hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabois in evaluation, coagulation testing,
