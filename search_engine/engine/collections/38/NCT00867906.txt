    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multiple dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cat-PAD in cat allergic
      subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and controlled asthma. The efficacy of Cat-PAD
      will also be explored in these subjects using the EPSR, LPSR, CPT, and levels of cat specific
      IgE. A single centre will be initiated first, with a second centre included as a backup, if
      needed, to enable recruitment numbers to be met.

      Three cohorts will be studied, depending on the treatment used to control the subject's
      asthma:Cohort 1 - inhaled salbutamol only, Cohort 2 - inhaled corticosteroid only, Cohort 3 -
      inhaled corticosteroid plus a LABA

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 8 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,
      at the investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of a single visit 1 to 4
      weeks before randomisation.

      In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomised to either 3 nmol Cat-PAD or placebo. Treatments will be administered every 2 weeks
      (Â±2 days) for 14 week

      In Period 3, Post Treatment Challenge consist of a single visit 24-28 weeks after the first
      administration in the treatment period and assessments will be performed identical to those
      at the baseline challenge. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after PTC.
