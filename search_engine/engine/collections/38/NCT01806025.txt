      infection. The severity of the disease is determined by genetic factors (type of mutation),
      environmental factors (exposure to bacteria) and behavioral (adherence with therapy). Even
      among patients with the same severity of mutations there is a variation of the severity of
      CF.

      Haptoglobin is a protein responsible for collecting Iron from senescent Red Blood Cells.
      There are two genes of Haptoglobin, numbered 1 and 2, and combinations between the two genes
      create three forms of proteins: 1-1, 1-2, and 2-2. The 1-1 Phenotype was found to be
      associated with a predisposition to infection.

      In this study the investigators aim to find a correlation between Haptoglobin phenotypes in
      patients with CF and frequency of infectious complications.

      To this end the investigators will collect serum from CF patients, and determine their
      Haptoglobin protein phenotype by gel- electrophoresis. The investigators will correlate
      Haptoglobin phenotype to retrospectively gathered data on infectious complications.
