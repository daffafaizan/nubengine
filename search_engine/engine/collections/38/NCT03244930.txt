      mobilization. Consecutive patients in autologous transplant protocol will receive
      mobilization consisted of daily subcutaneously G-CSF 10 mg/kg for 4 days and plerixafor 0.12
      mg/kg as a single dose 11 hours prior to initiation of apheresis. HSC collection was
      performed with a Cobe Spectra® or Spectra Optia® apheresis system. The planned target blood
      volume to be processed will be 4-fold total blood volume calculated according to patients'
      weight and size. Peripheral blood CD34+ counts will be analyzed using flow cytometry. For
      each ASCT, we aimed for target yields of at least 2 x 106 CD34+cells/kg. Toxicities and
      engraftment will be documented.
