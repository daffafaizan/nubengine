      N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) systems to psychosis in healthy humans beings using THC
      and ketamine respectively (both alone and in combination). Healthy subjects (n=21) will
      receive THC (active or placebo) followed by ketamine (active or placebo) in a double blind,
      randomized, crossover (2x2) design. Psychotomimetic effects will be assessed before and at
      various time points after the drug infusions. EEG indices of information processing,
      specifically neural oscillations, will be assessed during peak drug effects.
