      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of aldesleukin (IL-2) combined with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with IL-2.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the association of PD-L1 protein expression by pretreatment tumor with
      response to treatment.

      II. To investigate the association of regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency and Treg to effector
      T cell (Teff) ratios in peripheral blood and tumor tissue with response to therapy.

      III. To investigate the association of de novo serological and cellular responses against the
      ubiquitous RCC tumor antigen 5T4 with response to therapy.

      IV. To investigate the association of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) repertoire
      clonality with response to therapy and to assess the detection of dominant TIL clones within
      peripheral blood over time in responding patients.

      V. To investigate the association of whole genome copy number alterations measured on
      pretreatment archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor with response to
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of aldesleukin.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also
      receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) 5 days per week for 6 weeks; or aldesleukin IV on
      days 2-6 of pembrolizumab cycles 1 and 2. Pembrolizumab treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4
      cycles per treatment course in the absence of clinical disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up via surveillance scans for
      every 3 months for up to 1 year or until disease progression.
