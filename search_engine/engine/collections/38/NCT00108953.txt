    
      In addition to the key secondary outcome parameters the following parameters will be assessed
      in an exploratory manner: relative time to progression (TTP), time to symptomatic progression
      (TTSP), response rate (RR) and overall survival between the 2 study populations.

      The possible and potential predictive assays of clinical benefit through an assessment of the
      correlation between the defined baseline characteristics and key clinical endpoints.

      The safety and tolerability will be assessed in the adverse event section. Doxorubicin
      pharmacokinetics in HCC patients treated with sorafenib versus placebo will be compared and
      the pharmacokinetic data will be correlated with doxorubicin-related adverse events (i.e.,
      cardiotoxicity).
