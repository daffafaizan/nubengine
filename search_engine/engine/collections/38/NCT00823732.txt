        -  To compare the effects of palliative care intervention (PCI) vs standard care on overall
           quality of life and psychological distress in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or
           IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To compare symptom control in these patients.

        -  To compare geriatric assessment outcomes, as measured by OARS Instrumental Activities of
           Daily Living, MOS Activities of Daily Living, MOS Social Activities Limitation Scale,
           Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores, and Karnofsky performance scale, in these
           patients.

        -  To compare the effects of the PCI vs standard care on resource use.

        -  To identify subgroups of patients who benefit most from the PCI in relation to
           sociodemographic characteristics, treatment factors, and geriatric assessment predictors
           at week 12.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      Group I (usual care): Patients receive standard care.

      Group II (palliative care intervention): Patients receive an individualized interdisciplinary
      palliative care intervention comprising sessions, focused on physical, psychological, social,
      and spiritual well-being, once weekly in weeks 3-6. Patients then receive 4 follow-up phone
      calls in weeks 9, 13, 17, and 21.
