      treatments need to be identified. Paroxetine is effective in treating the acute symptoms of
      social anxiety, but many patients achieve less than optimal response. CBT has also been
      effective in treating social anxiety disorder; thus,it may also be effective in augmenting
      paroxetine response. This study will examine the effects of paroxetine treatment alone and in
      combination with CBT among patients who achieve less than optimal response after an open
      trial with paroxetine.

      Participants in this study will receive paroxetine for 12 weeks (Phase 1). After 12 weeks,
      participants who have completed this open trial but have achieved some but less than optimal
      response will move forward to Phase 2. To be eligible to move forward to Phase 2, patients
      must have achieved at least a 10% improvement in their open-trial Liebowitz Social Anxiety
      Scale Scores (LSAS) but still have an LSAS score of 30 or greater. Patients meeting these
      criteria will be randomly assigned to either add weekly sessions of CBT to their treatment or
      to continue taking paroxetine alone for another 16 weeks. Social anxiety symptoms, rates of
      response and remission, fear of negative evaluation, disability and quality of life will be
      assessed.
