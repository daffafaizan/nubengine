      patient group recruits subjects diagnosed with first episode psychosis which occurred within
      2 years and having been treated with antipsychotics for 1 year. Participants will complete
      clinical scales and undergo PET scans. Subjects in the patient group will receive a reduced
      intake of antipsychotics by 25% after each week of the four-week period in which they will
      also undergo PET imaging at the baseline, 7 week, and 8 week marks to detect the correlation
      between the capacity of presynaptic dopamine and relapse in the patients discontinuing
      treatment.
