      lung microstructure. The most mature of these techniques utilizes HXe spin-density MRI to
      depict regional lung ventilation. Prior work suggests that ventilation imaging has utility in
      all obstructive lung diseases. This is a Phase II clinical trial to assess HXe MRI capability
      of providing qualitative and quantitative clinical information regarding lung ventilation.
      Proton and xenon images will be acquired within single breath holds on 28 subjects per year,
      including healthy volunteers and patients with COPD and asthma. All studies will include
      repeat scans and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT). Ventilation scans with Technetium-99m
      (Tc-99m) diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) aerosol scintigraphy will be acquired on
      lung patients.

      The primary goal of this aim is to validate the effectiveness of HXe ventilation MRI for
      delineating regions of normal and abnormal lung ventilation. To validate the regional
      depiction of ventilation, HXe MRI ventilation will be compared with nuclear medicine Tc-99m
      DTPA ventilation scintigraphy. The comparatively low spatial and temporal resolution of
      ventilation scintigraphy will limit this study to demonstrating only that HXe MRI ventilation
      is not inferior to the current clinical standard. Additionally, the concordance between
      measurements of the whole lung volume from both proton MRI and HXe MRI with PFT, the current
      clinical standard for lung volume measurement, will be assessed as a secondary outcome of the
      study.
