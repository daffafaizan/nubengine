    
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride on days 2-5, 9-12, and 16-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for the expression of EGFR, HER3, HER2, downstream
      signaling molecules, and other molecular markers by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The
      presence of aberrant gene copy numbers (amplification and polysomy) for EGFR, HER3, and HER2
      are determined by FISH. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study
      for polymorphism analysis and correlative molecular analysis of surrogate endpoint
      biomarkers.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.
