      in gangrene and lower limb amputation. Consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of
      hospitalization for persons with peripheral neuropathy. Although not all foot complications
      can be prevented, dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a
      multidisciplinary approach to patient management, The reduction of pressure to the Charcot
      foot ulcer is essential to treatment. Proper off-loading and pressure reduction prevents
      further trauma and promotes healing. This is particularly important in the peripheral
      neuropathy patient with decreased or absent sensation in the lower extremities. Furthermore,
      recent studies provide evidence that minor trauma (eg, repetitive stress, shoe pressure)
      plays a major role in the causal pathway to ulceration.

        -  Off-loading approaches that deal with Charcot neuroarthropathy will decrease the
           significant psychological, social and functional impact on individuals.

        -  The need of this study is developed from the lack of controlled studies that reported
           the therapeutic effect of Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker 3d printed sole on Charcot
           foot ulcer.

        -  So the present study is designed to evaluate the Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker 3d
           printed sole on Charcot foot ulcer. Furthermore, the current study may help physical
           therapist, physicians, and clinicians to organize a protocol of treatment that would be
           safe, simple and economic for treating patients with Charcot neuroarthropathy.
