    
      This is a randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), open-label (all involved people
      know the identity of the study drug), active-controlled study to evaluate the improvement in
      social functioning among participants with schizophrenia taking LAI risperidone and oral
      risperidone tablet. The study drug will be administered for 52 weeks in flexible dose (range
      as per Investigator's discretion) and a total of 11 assessment visits will be conducted per
      participant, including Screening. The participant may be withdrawn from the trial for any
      medical reason at the sole discretion of the investigator. Before starting the study
      treatment, participants undergo the period of switching from the previous medication to
      risperidone for 4 weeks, and then they will be evaluated for tolerability for 2 weeks (run-in
      period for stabilizing to risperidone). In this 2-week period, participants will take oral
      risperidone. The efficacy will be primarily evaluated through Personal and Social Performance
      Scale. Safety will be evaluated through Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia
      Rating Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
