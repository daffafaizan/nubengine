      technology of NIA algorithm with results from final diagnoses of cardiac catheterization. As
      the NIA algorithm is a fast and less costly, if it provides more sensitivity and specificity
      than does exercise ECG, nuclear myocardial perfusion test, and high-resolution coronary CT
      angiogram, it will expedite diagnosis for patients with coronary artery disease.
