      worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, the region hardest hit by the HIV-1 epidemic, HSV-2
      prevalences of 30-50% have been seen in the general population with prevalence up to 90% in
      infected with HIV-1. HSV-2 is common in those with, or at risk for, HIV-1 infection, and
      HSV-2 reactivation increases HIV-1 acquisition and infectiousness. Recent studies have shown
      that suppression of HSV-2 has a sustained effect on lowering HIV-1 levels in blood plasma.
      New data have raised the question whether higher doses of HSV-2 suppressive therapy might be
      more effective at suppressing HIV-1 levels. Acyclovir and valacyclovir, chosen for use in
      this study, are safe and effective treatments for decreasing the frequency of HSV-2
      reactivation and shedding. The standard dose of acyclovir is 400 mg twice a day.
      Valacyclovir, a drug that converts to acyclovir after absorption, delivers higher
      concentrations of acyclovir. 1.5 grams of valacyclovir, will be used to provide a higher dose
      of acyclovir, and will be compared with the standard dose of 400 mg twice a day of acyclovir.
