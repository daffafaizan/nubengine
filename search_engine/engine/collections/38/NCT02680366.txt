      asherman syndrome is operating to dissect adhesions. In order to prevent the postoperative
      re-adhesion, many physical isolation measures have been tried. However, they don't improve
      the microenvironment of endometrial regeneration. It's reported that bone marrow mononuclear
      cells have good effects on the functional recovery of injured uterus. This study will
      determine whether collagen scaffolds loaded with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells
      will be more effective than Foley balloon catheters at treating infertile women with severe
      intrauterine adhesions who have taken hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. In addition, the study will
      be carried out in 2 centers, one is the Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing
      University Medical School, the other is Changzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital
      that is in Jiangsu Province.
