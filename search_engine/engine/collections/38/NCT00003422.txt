        -  Compare local recurrence free rates and quality of life in patients with operable rectal
           cancer receiving preoperative radiotherapy versus patients receiving selective
           postoperative chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine local recurrence free survival, overall survival, time to appearance of
           distant metastases, disease free survival and morbidity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by a number of
      factors including surgeon.

      Patients are randomized to receive preoperative radiotherapy (arm I) or postoperative
      chemoradiotherapy (arm II).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 1 week prior to surgery.
           Patients undergo surgery within 7 days of the last fraction of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy 4-12 weeks after surgery (if circumferential
           resection margins are histologically involved by tumor). Radiotherapy is administered in
           25 fractions over 5 weeks (5 days per week). During radiotherapy, patients either
           receive fluorouracil (5-FU) continuous infusion, 5-FU bolus IV and leucovorin calcium IV
           weekly, or a 5-day bolus schedule of 5-FU and leucovorin calcium.

      Patients may then receive adjuvant chemotherapy as per local policy.

      Quality of life assessments are made every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for
      the next 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1800 patients will be accrued into this study.
