      vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation that contributes to systemic arterial underfilling
      and leads to functional decline of the kidney in these patients. Vasoconstrictors currently
      in use are associated with reduced organ perfusion and have marginal effect on sodium
      excretion. The vasoconstrictor angiotensin II has been shown to produce significant sodium
      excretion and urine output in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, supporting its potential
      utility in the treatment of HRS.
