      Adventists in the U.S. and Canada. The study is searching for associations between diet and
      risk of common and medium frequency cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, uterus,
      pancreas, melanoma of skin). This cohort is unusual in that about half are vegetarian, many
      eat soy at Asian levels, and many have very low or absent dairy intake while others eat
      normal amounts of dairy. Thus observations on these people, many of whom have contrasting
      dietary habits, may provide insights about diet and cancer, so supporting dietary changes
      that could be readily adopted by many.
