      These markers of poor quality are even more common among Black patients and families than
      among Whites. To address these challenges, the investigators developed a mobile app that
      allows families to both give and receive information relevant to palliative care and for ICU
      clinicians to visualize patient/family data and therefore better support them.

      To determine the effect of this intervention,the investigators propose to conduct a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to usual care to address four
      specific aims: (1) Using a cluster randomized clinical trial, determine the effect of the
      intervention vs usual care on unmet needs [as measured by the NEST scale], psychological
      distress symptoms [as measured by the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PTSS scales], and patient-centered
      care [as measured by the IPC scale]; (2) Determine the impact of the intervention on unmet
      needs and patient-centered care based across different racial groups; and (3) Explore family
      member and clinician experiences with intervention using mixed methods to understand
      mechanisms within unique case contexts [exploratory aim]. The investigators hypothesize that
      compared to usual care, ICUconnect will reduce family members' unmet needs, reduce family
      member psychological distress, increase the patient-centeredness care, and reduce hospital
      length of stay overall--though the magnitude of effect will be greater among Blacks compared
      to Whites.
