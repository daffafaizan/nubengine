      with coronary artery disease. However, in-stent restenosis requiring target-lesion
      revascularization (TLR) occurs even with the use of drug-eluting stents. Emerging evidence
      suggests that among various potential risk factors, atherogenic progression within the
      neointima, "neoatherosclerosis" is one of the major contributors to TLR, and that patients'
      lipid profile is one of the key risk factors for the development of neoatherosclerosis.

      Conversely, recent animal and human studies have demonstrated the importance of high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) functionality, rather than of HDL-cholesterol levels, in the development of
      de novo coronary artery disease. Cholesterol efflux capacity, a measure of the ability of HDL
      to promote cholesterol removal from lipid-laden macrophages, was found to be inversely
      correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular events and was shown to improve
      cardiovascular risk prediction beyond that with the use of traditional coronary risk factors.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the HDL function of promoting cholesterol
      removal from lipid-laden macrophages could be associated with TLR through its effect on the
      process of neoatherosclerosis progression within stents.

      Recently, the investigators developed a rapid cell-free assay system to directly evaluate the
      capacity of HDL to accept additional cholesterol; the measurement of this cholesterol uptake
      capacity (CUC) enables HDL functionality to be readily evaluated in our daily practice. Thus,
      the investigators performed this study in order to clarify the potential relationship among
      CUC, neoatherosclerosis, and TLR by using the novel cell-free assay system, CUC measurement,
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis.
