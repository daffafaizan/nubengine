      site of metastasis. This treatment will be given once a day, 5 times a week (Monday through
      Friday) for one to four weeks depending on the location and size of the disease to be
      treated. Blood for the cytokine tests will be drawn before your therapy starts, weekly during
      therapy and at the follow-up visits as stated in the next paragraphs. Two to four tablespoons
      of blood will be removed each time.
