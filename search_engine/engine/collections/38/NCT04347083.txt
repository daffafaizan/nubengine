      stimulation inducing muscle spindle-based reflex by using Intramuscular electromyography
      electrodes. Eight healthy volunteers will be participated in the study. Two surface
      electromyography electrodes will be placed on the left gastrocnemius muscle belly to record
      spindle based reflex response. Single motor unit electrode pairs will be then inserted
      between two surface electrodes into the lateral gastrocnemius muscle to record stimulus
      artifact caused by tapping. The Achilles tendon will be tapped 20 times at 3-5 s intervals by
      a reflex hammer (Achilles tapping). Participants will be then asked to stand up and stand
      upright on the left foot. To maintain static balance, participants will be asked to hold the
      handles on the wall. The left heel will be tapped 20 times at 3-5 s intervals by a hammer
      (Heel tapping).
