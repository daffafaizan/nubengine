      hypothesized to be a treatment emergent adverse effect associated with selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor medication. While there is currently no consistent method for treating
      apathy among psychiatrists, it has been proposed that switching MDD patients to
      antidepressant medications containing both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as duloxetine,
      may reduce the incidence and severity of apathy in these patients.
