      women. These women are insulin resistant and have compensatory hyperinsulinemia that
      stimulates ovarian cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity that in turn stimulates ovarian androgen
      concentrations.

      In obese PCOS women, weight loss improves insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, resulting
      in improvement of clinical symptoms.

      Since lean PCOS women do not have the option of weight loss, it is important to know if
      composition and meal timing distribution may influence glucose metabolism and
      hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity. We hypothesized that a timing pattern
      of increased nutrient intake of protein and carbohydrates in the morning, with decreased
      caloric intake at night would improve insulin sensitivity and hyperandrogenism in lean women
      with PCOS
