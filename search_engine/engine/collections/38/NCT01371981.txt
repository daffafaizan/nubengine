      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without high allelic ratio fms-like tyrosine kinase
      (FLT3)/internal tandem duplications (ITD)+ mutations who are randomized to standard therapy
      versus bortezomib/standard combination therapy.

      II. To determine the feasibility of combining bortezomib with standard chemotherapy in
      patients with de novo AML.

      III. To compare the OS and EFS of high-risk patients treated with intensive Induction II with
      historical controls from AAML03P1 and AAML0531.

      IV. To determine the feasibility of administering sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) with
      standard chemotherapy and in a one year maintenance phase in patients with de novo high
      allelic ratio FLT3/ITD+ AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the anti-leukemic activity of sorafenib in patients with de novo high allelic
      ratio FLT3/ITD+ AML.

      II. To compare the percentage of patients converting from positive minimal residual disease
      (MRD) to negative MRD after Intensive Induction II with historical controls from AAML03P1 and
      AAML0531.

      III. To compare OS, disease-free survival (DFS), cumulative incidence of relapse, and
      treatment-related mortality from end of Intensification I between patients allocated to best
      allogenic donor stem cell transplant (SCT) and comparable patients on AAML0531 who did not
      receive allogenic donor SCT.

      IV. To compare OS, DFS, cumulative incidence of relapse, treatment-related mortality, and
      severe toxicity between patients allocated to matched family donor SCT on AAML1031 and
      AAML0531.

      regimen.

      VII. To obtain sorafenib and metabolite steady state pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data in subjects with FLT3/ITD receiving sorafenib.

      VIII. To compare the changes in shortening fraction/ejection fraction over time between
      patients treated with and without dexrazoxane.

      IX. To refine the use of minimal-residual disease (MRD) detection with 4-color flow
      cytometry.

      identification with multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF)-based MRD in patients with
      translocations amenable to quantitative real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (e.g.,
      t[8;21], inv[16], t[9;11], Wilms tumor 1 [WT1] expression).

      role in defining response to therapy.

      XII. To define the leukemic stem cell population in patients with AML. XIII. To determine the
      prevalence and prognostic significance of molecular abnormalities of WT1, runt-related
      transcription factor (RUNX)1, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-partial tandem duplication (PTD),
      tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), Cbl proto-oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase
      (c-CBL), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT), and other novel
      AML-associated genes in pediatric AML.

      XVII. To collect biology specimens at diagnosis, treatment time points, and relapse for
      future biology studies XVIII. To create a pediatric-specific algorithm to predict the
      occurrence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prior to its clinical
      manifestations using a combination of pre-transplant clinical variables and serum GVHD
      biomarker concentrations in the first weeks after SCT.
