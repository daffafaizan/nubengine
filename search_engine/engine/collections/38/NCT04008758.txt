      leads to atelectasis, lung consolidatioin. Finally it could results acute respiratory
      distress syndrome.

      Lung ultrasound is non-invasive and available in anytime even during surgery. Previous
      studies showed recruitment maneuver using ultrasound improved postoperative oxygenation in
      pediatric cardiac surgery. In adults, recruitment maneuver not using ultrasound improved
      oxygenation after cardiopulmonary bypass. There is no study in adult trauma population.

      The aim of this study is evaluation of the efficacy of lung recruitment using ultrasound in
      perioperative period in trauma patients.
