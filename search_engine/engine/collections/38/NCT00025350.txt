        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate in patients with recurrent
           metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with gefitinib.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate, progression, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG
      performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline serum CEA (less than 5 mg/L vs at least 5 mg/L), and
      number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2 or more). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily (twice daily on day 1 of course 1).
           Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a higher dose of oral gefitinib as in arm I. Patients are
           followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually
           thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
