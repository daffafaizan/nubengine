      carried out in the oral and maxillofacial Clinics. The surgical removal of the impacted
      mandibular third molar is usually associated with pain, swelling and inability to open the
      mouth. Those symptoms reach the maximum intensity between the third to fifth hours
      postoperatively for the pain and 24 to 48 hours postoperatively for the swelling and then,
      they gradually diminished until the 7th day postoperatively.

      Kinesio taping (KT), also termed ''elastic therapeutic bandage,'' is a popular technique used
      for the management of postoperative lymphedema after maxillofacial surgery. KT is an elastic
      therapeutic tape invented by Dr Kase in the 1970s. KT originated from sports medicine and is
      primarily used to support damaged soft tissues (muscles and joints), helping to reduce pain.
      KT is considered to regulate the blood and lymph flow and also to remove the congestion of
      lymphatic fluid or hemorrhage and, thus, has achieved popularity in the control of
      lymphedema.

      Many studies had evaluate the KT technique in reducing the morbidity after surgical removal
      of third molar. There is a lack of adequate evidence regarding effects of KT techniques
      versus placebo and the effectiveness of KT with that of other methods and medical agents.
