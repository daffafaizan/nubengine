      kernicterus.However, light sources and irradiance level are different among hospitals, and it
      was controversial whether the improvement of jaundice is related to the irradiance level of
      phototherapy or not. In addition, long-term side effects are not clear, therefore, excessive
      irradiation should be avoided. The purpose of this study is to show that the low irradiance
      level is not worse than the high irradiance level in the phototherapy for neonatal jaundice.
      This study is multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by Nagoya University
      Hospital, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Kasugai Municipal Hospital, Handa Hospital, TOYOTA Memorial
      Hospital, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Japan Red Cross Nagoya
      Daiichi Hospital, Hekinan Municipal Hospital, and Ogaki Municipal Hospital.
