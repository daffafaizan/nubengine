      device and its safety and benefits for improving the appearance of Postinflammatory
      Hyperpigmentation. Postinflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH) caused by acne is a common
      inflammatory disease that can adversely affect facial appearance. Facial acne can have a
      serious negative impact on psychosocial functioning leaving deep emotional scars. Severe acne
      can also lead to physical scars and disfigurement. Among patients with severe acne, facial
      scarring affects both genders equally and occurs to some degree in 95% of cases.
