      low in critically ill patients. The prevalence ranges from 26 to 82%. 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      deficiency is associated with longer ICU stay, higher medical cost and higher death rate in
      septic patients. 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a kind of hormone related to bone and mineral
      metabolism. Moreover, the receptors were found in almost all cells, and it is related to
      immune system, cytokine release, cellular proliferation and differentiation, angiogenesis,
      and muscular energy. The main source is skin metabolism triggered by sunshine and food
      consumption. It is subsequently converted to calcifediol in the liver and then calcitriol in
      the kidney (the active form). Its serum level is regulated by parathyroid hormone and serum
      calcium and phosphate. The critically ill patients are deprived of sunshine, suffered from
      poor nutrition support, impaired liver and kidney function, higher rate of consumption, and
      are under higher risk of deficiency. Nowadays, the studies about 25-hydroxyvitamin D in ICU
      patients were conducted mostly in Europe and America. There is no large-scale study in Taiwan
      or Asia. A randomized controlled study from Austria has shown large dose supply in patients
      with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency could decrease the mortality.

      The object of this multi-center study is to investigate the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      deficiency, the risk factors and the correlation with outcomes. The results could be a
      step-stone for future randomized controlled studies.
