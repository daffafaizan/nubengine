      for Clinical and Translational Research. The protocol is divided into 4 two-week periods: (1)
      Two-week baseline diary symptom monitoring, followed by a barostat test of pain sensitivity.
      (2) Two-week treatment with either Lubiprostone or placebo, with daily symptom diary
      recording and barostat test of pain sensitivity at the end. In addition, patients will be
      tested for whole gut transit time by the radio-opaque marker (Sitzmark) technique in the
      second week. (3) Two-week washout period, during which patients will continue the symptom
      diary. (4) Two-week crossover to Lubiprostone or placebo, identical to the second two-week
      period.
