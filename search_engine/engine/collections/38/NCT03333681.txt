      selected. After signing informed consent form, autologous stem cells were obtained by bone
      marrow aspiration. Isolation and culture (3 to 4 weeks in MEM-alpha medium) of mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs) were performed in accredited good manufacturing practices (GMP) clean room.
      A panel of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers including CD105, CD166, CD44, CD45, CD90,
      and CD34 were checked for making sure about differentiation of cells into MSCs after 3-4
      weeks of cell culture. Viability of MSCs was checked by Trypan blue testing and all of the
      cultivations were negative for bacterial contamination. A single dose of 1000000 to 2000000
      mesenchymal stem cells/kg infused into patients intravenously. To prevent anaphylactic
      reactions, a single intravenous dose of hydrocortison (100 ml) and oral dimenhydrinate (10
      ml) were administered before MSCs infusion into patients. The effects of mesenchymal stem
      cells on the cellular and humoral immune responses and also the role of chemokines in homing
      of immune cells were studied at time points 1, 6 and 12 months after intravenous
      administration of MSCs in refractory rheumatoid arthritis.
