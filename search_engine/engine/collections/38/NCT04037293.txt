      and it leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.
      Prevention and intervention of premature atherosclerosis is beneficial for prognosis and
      survival of patients with SLE.

      The primary aim of this study was to investigate the natural progress of carotid intima media
      thickness (CIMT) in 5 years, and examine the risk factors for progression of CIMT and
      atherosclerotic plaques based on a Chinese SLE cohort. The secondary aims of the study were
      to investigate progression of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and to examine the
      risk factors for increasing baPWV in patients with SLE.

      Based on sample size calculation, 440 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled in this study. All patients will be enrolled from Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital. After informed consent is obtained, the patients will be comprehensively evaluated
      from demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical assessments, laboratory tests
      results, CIMT and baPWV at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Descriptive analysis, univariate
      analysis, and multivariate analysis will be used to analyze the correlation between potential
      risk factors and CIMT/baPWV.
