      Phase of study: Phase I

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are:

      Primary:

      1. To evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) 400 mg once
      daily during co-administration with rifampicin and isoniazid (Rifinah or local generic)

      Secondary:

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) 400 mg once daily
           during co-administration with rifampicin and isoniazid (Rifinah or local generic)

        2. To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes
           and drug exposure

        3. Exploratory: To investigate the impact of anti-retroviral drugs on platelet function in
           people living with HIV

      Study design:

      Two-centre, two-stage, 98/99 days in London (Stage 1) and 28 days in Kampala (Stage 2)
      (excluding screening and follow up), open-label, pharmacokinetic study

      Indication:

      London: HIV-1 infected patients (without tuberculosis infection) on established treatment
      with a combination based on 600 mg efavirenz dose Kampala: Patient with both HIV-1 and
      tuberculosis infection being treated with 600 mg efavirenz combination for HIV AND undergoing
      TB treatment with a dual therapy regimen contaning rifampicin and isoniazid

      Methodology:

      Measurements of efavirenz concentrations and efavirenz pharmacokinetic profiles in the
      absence (Stage 1 only) and in the presence of rifampicin and isoniazid in two populations of
      HIV-infected individuals:

        1. without TB (Stage 1, London)

        2. with TB (Stage 2, Kampala)

      Planned sample size:

      Stage 1, London: For this sequential design, a sample size of 25 patients would provide at
      least 80% power to detect a decrease in efavirenz Cmin of 20% during the combined
      rifampicin/isoniazid-efavirenz phase, compared to the efavirenz alone phase.

      Up to 40 subjects may be screened and enrolled to have 25 HIV-infected patients completing
      the study.

      Stage 2, Kampala: A pilot study in 10 patients in Uganda with HIV and TB co-infection and on
      anti-HIV treatment and anti-TB treatment will also be performed to validate findings of the
      London PK study in a TB-infected population.

      Up to 25 subjects may be screened and enrolled to have 10 HIV/TB-co-infected patients
      completing the pilot sub-study

      Summary of eligibility criteria:

      Stage 1, London: HIV-1 infected males or females of at least 18 years, treated with a stable
      efavirenz based combination regimen (tenofovir/ emtricitabine or tenofovir/lamivudine or
      zidovudine/lamivudine) for at least the preceding 12 weeks and with an undetectable viral
      load and a CD4+ T-cell count > 100 cell/mm3.

      Stage 2, Kampala: HIV-1 infected males or females of at least 18 years, treated with a stable
      efavirenz based combination regimen (tenofovir /emtricitabine or tenofovir/lamivudine or
      zidovudine/lamivudine) for at least the preceding 12 weeks, with a CD4+ T-cell count > 100
      cell/mm3, co-infected with TB and undergoing anti-TB treatment with rifampicin and
      isoniazid-containing regimens.

      Duration of treatment:

      London: 98 / 99 (+/- 1) days (excluding screening and follow up visits) Kampala: 28 days (+/-
      7) days (excluding screening and follow up visits)

      Dose and route of administration:

      All study drugs will be administered orally to subjects with the following schedule:

      Stage 1, London:

           zidovudine/lamivudine plus efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) 400 mg once daily

        -  Phase 2 (12 weeks): tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir /lamivudine or
           zidovudine/lamivudine) plus efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) 400 mg once daily plus Rifinah
           or local generics once daily (rifampicin 600 mg and isoniazid 300 mg if ≥50kg or
           rifampicin 450 mg and isoniazid 300 mg if <50kg.)

      (Sustiva/Stocrin) 400 mg once daily plus Rifinah or local generics once daily (rifampicin 600
      mg and isoniazid 300 mg if ≥ 50 kg or rifampicin 450 mg and isoniazid 300 mg if < 50kg).

      Criteria for evaluation:

      drawn on days:

        -  14/15 (2 weeks after reducing efavirenz dose from 600 mg to 400 mg)

        -  42/43 (4 weeks after Rifinah or local generics initiation at start of phase 2) and

        -  98/99 (12 weeks after Rifinah or local generics initiation)

        -  PK profile at 0 (pre-dose), 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post administered dose.

      Stage 2, Kampala: Pharmacokinetic parameters of efavirenz will be evaluated on blood drawn
      on:

        -  days 28 +/- 7 days (while on anti-TB medications)

        -  PK profile at 0 (pre-dose), 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post last dose.

      Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questioning to collect
      adverse event symptoms, physical examination and laboratory parameters, performed at regular
      intervals during the study, including efavirenz therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) once/twice
      a week.
