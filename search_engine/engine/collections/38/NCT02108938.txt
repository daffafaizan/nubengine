      (GI) tract such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic pancreatitis. These studies
      suggest that alterations in the brain-gut axis may relate to disease severity and pain
      perception. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized
      by periods of disease activity and periods of disease quiescence. Crohn's disease (CD) is one
      of the two major subtypes of IBD. Patients with CD typically experience abdominal pain when
      the disease is active; however, many also report experiencing pain in the absence of
      objective evidence of inflammation. Alterations in brain-gut interactions may explain the
      perception of pain in these patients. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding brain
      changes in patients with IBD and CD, specifically. We are proposing a pilot study to
      characterize brain-gut interactions of disease activity and pain modulation mechanisms in
      patients with IBD using advanced neuroimaging tools.
