      method for the early diagnosis of complications after surgery in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Samples taken with Onzurf probe will be analyzed and then compared with routine clinical data
      on surgical procedures in gastrointesinala tract. These parameters are: Patient general
      condition, endoscopy, radiology and routine clinical samples (global) as CRP (C-reactive
      protein), white blood cells, blood gases.The patients are their own controls when the purpose
      is to see if you can detect early complications with Onzurf probe and also identify how many
      people gets complications after surgery in the gastrointestinal tract. The patients' clinical
      routine tests (blood tests, etc.) will serve as control samples, which then will be compared
      with results from sampling of Onzurf probe. No interventions will be carried out on the
      patient.
