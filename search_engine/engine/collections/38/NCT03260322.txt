    
      This is a multi-center, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP8374 as a
      single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. After discontinuation of study drug
      treatment (initial treatment and re-treatment), all participants will complete an end of
      treatment visit along with 30-day and 90-day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of
      ASP8374. Participants will be enrolled in respectively escalation cohorts or expansion
      cohorts. The 90-day safety follow-up visit is optional for participants who discontinue due
      to progressive disease or initiate new anticancer treatment after the last dose of study
      drug.

      Escalation cohorts: Approximately 60 participants may be enrolled in the escalation cohorts
      (approximately 30 participants for monotherapy and 30 participants for combination therapy).

      Expansion cohorts: The total number of subjects in the expansion cohorts will depend on the
      observed pharmacokinetic and antitumor activity. It is estimated that approximately 240
      participants may be enrolled in the monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts.

      As the number of participants in the escalation cohorts and the expansion cohorts will depend
      on the observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity,
      approximately 300 participants are expected to be enrolled.
