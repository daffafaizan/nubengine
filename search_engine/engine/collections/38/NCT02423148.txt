      this study intervention. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      Indocyanine Green for your specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are interested in learning how a new
      investigational device, the FluoSCOPE, performs in the operating room. This study will also
      allow the investigators to optimize the settings of the imaging system. The investigators
      hope that this device, along with the local injection of Indocyanine Green around the tumor,
      will help find the sentinel lymph nodes in real-time during the surgery to remove lung
      cancer.

      Although this is the first time the FluoSCOPE is being used in humans, the technology of
      near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes of
      patients with breast cancer, skin cancer and lung cancer.
