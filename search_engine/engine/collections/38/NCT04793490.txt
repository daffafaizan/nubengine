      lumbar puncture, it is likely due to the loss of cerebrospinal fluid into the epidural space
      through the dural tear. The prevalence of PDPH is higher in pregnant women.Sphenopalatine
      ganglion block (SPGB) is a non-invasive intervention with minimal adverse effects, it is
      indicated in acute and chronic facial/head pain like cluster headache, trigeminal neuralgia,
      post herpetic neuralgia and pain due to head and neck cancer.SPGB can be performed by
      different approaches:transnasal,transoral ,sub zygomatic and lateral infratemporal.Transnasal
      is the easiest, least invasive approach which can be done at bedside.

      The objective of this trial is to study the efficacy and efficiency of sphenopalatine
      ganglion block for management of post-dural puncture headache in obstetric patients.The
      following will be recorded: pain score will be assessed using the numeric rating pain
      scale(NRS),heart rate and mean arterial pressure, onset and duration of analgesia, total dose
      of ketorolac, duration of hospital stay and patient satisfaction
