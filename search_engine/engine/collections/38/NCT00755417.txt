      following regimens:

        -  G-ER 1200 mg daily (single evening dose)

        -  G-ER 1800 mg daily (dosed asymmetrically; 600 mg in AM/1200 mg in PM) compared to
           placebo in reducing the average daily frequency and severity score of moderate to severe
           hot flashes in postmenopausal women after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment with a
           stable dose, compared with the baseline week.
