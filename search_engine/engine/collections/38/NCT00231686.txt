      Several studies have indicated that physical training might improve fitness and lung
      functions (or, at least, slow the decline in lung functions). However, there are no long-term
      studies comparing the effects among aerobic training, strength training and no training.
      Furthermore, motivation to continue a training with little variations between sessions has
      been shown to decline rapidly. Thus, adherence with such a program may be low. Finally, not
      all patients feel happy with the same program. Therefore, a home-based individualized sports
      program might be best suitable to achieve long term benefits. The MUKOTRAIN study is a
      multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of a home-based physical
      training in patients with CF.

      Comparisons:

      Study A) Patients training aerobically 3 * 30 min per week (supervised in a sports club near
      their homes) in addition to their baseline physical activity compared to patients training
      upper and lower body strength 3 * 30 min per week (supervised in a sports club near their
      homes) compared to patients maintaining their physical activity. The supervised intervention
      lasted 6 months, thereafter patients were followed for an additional 18 months.

      Study B) Patients asked to participate in sport activities at least 3 * 60 min per week (free
      choice of activities) in addition to their baseline physical activity compared with patients
      asked to maintain their baseline physical activity.
