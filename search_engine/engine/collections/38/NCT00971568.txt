      diagnose IC. Infectious, autoimmune and anatomic causes have been looked at with few usable
      results. Inflammatory cells and markers have been more productive. Recently we have shown in
      the rat model, that chemically induced inflammation, yields temporal increases in measurable
      cytokines and chemokines in the urine. Moreover, this was done by Multiplex analysis, using a
      multiple antigen bead assay (Luminex).

      Cytokines and chemokines, part of an organisms proteome, allow for looking at the function of

      Urine is obtained non-invasively and yields significant information about urinary tract
      organs. The ability to find a biomarker or pattern of biomarker in the urine, diagnostic to a
      disease, offers significant advantages over serum or tissue diagnosis.

      We hope to identify patterns of inflammatory markers using proteomic analysis using the
      previously mentioned multiple antigen cassettes (Luminex) as well as identify possible new
      biomarkers using a Protein Chip SELDI--TOF (surface enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time
      of flight) mass spectrometer. The detection of patterns or new biomarkers has promise to help
      with diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately revealing the etiology and course of IC.
