      laparoscopic colectomy patients and 50 opioid anesthesia laparoscopic colectomy patients at
      Tampa General Hospital. After consent is obtained patients will be electronically randomized
      using REDCap in a 1:1 ratio and assigned to a opioid anesthesia or opioid free anesthesia
      group. Patients will also consent to be asked survey questions preoperatively and be followed
      for 12 months postoperatively at specific intervals to evaluate pain, satisfaction, and
      opioid prescription use. This will be done through a data mining platform and service known
      as REDCap. REDCap is partnered with USF to allow for subject management, data collection and
      the distribution of surveys via mobile phone. All data collected by REDCap is stored on a
      HIPPA compliant server. Patients will receive automated push notifications to their mobile
      phones to fill out surveys regarding their pill usage, pain, and satisfaction for a year or
      until cessation of opioid use is confirmed. Confirmation of opioid cessation will be
      performed on a case by case basis by the principal investigator, Dr. Camporesi. In addition
      to the surveys performed, nausea and pain scores will be collected prospectively from
      observation in the PACU
