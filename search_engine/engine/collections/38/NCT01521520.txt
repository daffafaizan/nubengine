      diabetes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based technique will be used to noninvasively
      measure changes within the pancreas associated with the development of autoimmune diabetes.
      The iron-containing drug ferumoxytol will be used as an intravenous MRI contrast agent for
      this study.

      Individuals will be asked to participate one time, for 1-year, or over a 2-year period.
      During the development phase of the study, each imaging series will consist of 3 or more MRI
      scans. At the initial imaging visit a pre-ferumoxytol scan will be done, followed by
      ferumoxytol injection, and then an immediate post-injection scan. The subsequent scans will
      be concluded within 96 hours of ferumoxytol injection (typically at 48 hours). Those who
      participate for 1-year will have repeat imaging at approximate times 0, 6 months, and 12
      months. Those who participate for 2-years will have repeat imaging at approximate times 0, 3,
      6, 12, 18, and 24 months after enrollment.

      Measurements of autoimmunity and metabolic parameters (collected as part of collaborating
      diabetes clinical studies) will be used in the data analysis for the longitudinal portion of
      the study. Stimulated C-peptide will be measured as a marker of endogenous insulin production
      capacity and beta-cell mass.
