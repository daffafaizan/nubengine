      and decreased platelet production due to anti-platelet antibodies. HBM9161 is a fully human
      anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody that can effectively remove pathogenic IgG, thereby relieving
      platelet destruction and rapidly increasing platelet counts in patients. The study will be
      conducted in a Phase 2/3 operational seamless design, with group Dose A and Dose B of HBM9161
      and a placebo group in Phase 2.
