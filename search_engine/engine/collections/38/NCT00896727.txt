        -  Assess in-situ protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
           HER-2, and p53 by automated quantitative analysis (AQUA™) and multiplexed analysis at 2
           markers per slide using tumor tissue from women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA
           breast cancer treated on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

        -  Assess the main effects of ER, PR, HER-2, and p53, as well as interactions to generate
           classes formed by clustering of biomarkers, on a large breast cancer tissue microarray
           to predict disease-free and overall survival of patients who received high-dose
           cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to receptor status
      and menopausal status.

      Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by quantitative protein expression analysis (AQUA™, a
      fluorescent antibody technique) for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53 and HER-2.
      AQUA™ is used to assess markers individually and as ratios with the use of clustering
      algorithms to define reproducible classifications of tissue from patients treated on
      SWOG-9313 as a function of molecular classification.

      Results of the AQUA™ testing are compared to immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH) results obtained on SWOG-9313.
