      atrial fibrillation.1 Pulsed spectral Doppler signals were obtained over the chest wall using
      a signal processing and algorithm package in conjunction with a non-imaging Doppler device
      coupled with an electrocardiogram. Clear reproducible lung Doppler signals (LDS) originating
      from different elements and phases of cardiac activity that generate mechanical waves which
      propagate throughout the lung were expressed in pulsatile changes in ultrasound reflections.

      After the completion of the first 25 patients in our pilot study, we have received some
      valuable information. After assessing patients with CHF and pulmonary hypertension, we
      identified signals particular to the CHF group. There were unique features that were never
      observed in the normal patients. On top of the regular Lung Doppler signals seen in normal
      patients, high velocity "disorganized" variable signals that were not synchronous with the
      heart beat, but rather sometimes with respiration were observed. We believe that the signals
      may represent popping open of small bronchi surrounded by "water filled" parenchyma. These
      events that generate very strong reflector like signals may represent the movement of fluid
      at the blood vessel-alveolar air junction.
