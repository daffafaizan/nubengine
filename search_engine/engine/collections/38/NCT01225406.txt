    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the virological efficacy, as measured by the
      proportions of children with HIV RNA below 400 and 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks after initiating
      third line ARV therapy.

      Third line ARV therapy is defined as an ARV regimen in a patient who has failure or
      intolerance to first line NNRTI-based therapy and second line PI-based therapy. Such regimens
      may contain new drugs or drug classes such as darunavir, tipranavir, etravirine and
      raltegravir
