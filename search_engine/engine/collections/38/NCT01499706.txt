      rise. In fact, it is estimated that by 2014, 50% of all HIV-positive persons will be 50 years
      of age or older, due largely to a) better clinical care and the improved efficacy of highly
      active antiretroviral therapy that has extended the lives of many HIV-positive persons and b)
      an increase in the number of new HIV infections in older persons. Despite escalating HIV
      incidence and prevalence rates in older adults, and the fact that an estimated 13% to 30% of
      older persons living with HIV/AIDS continue to engage in risky sexual practices, few
      secondary risk reduction interventions have been contextualized to meet the unique needs of
      sexually active HIV-infected older adults. These unique needs include biological and
      libidinal changes associated with aging such as erectile dysfunction and the increased use of
      erectile dysfunction medications in older men, sexual partnerships with younger persons,
      survivor guilt over outliving romantic partners, and the impact of co-morbid chronic
      illnesses (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, hepatitis C) and associated medication
      and/or treatment side effects on perceptions of physical attractiveness.

      Many HIV-positive older adults who would benefit from face-to-face sexual risk reduction
      interventions live with serious comorbid health conditions that complicate travel to medical
      and social service appointments, have significant confidentiality concerns, and are
      geographically isolated from traditional risk reduction resources. As such, face-to-face
      interventions are an unrealistic intervention modality for many members of this group.
      However, risk reduction interventions delivered using distance technologies, such as regular
      and cellular telephones, can reach many older adults living with HIV/AIDS.

      In response to the lack of age-appropriate risk reduction interventions for HIV-infected
      older adults who engage in high-risk sex, and the potential of telephone technology to
      deliver cost-effective risk reduction interventions to this group, this study tested the
      efficacy of 1- and 4-session telephone-administered behavioral sexual risk reduction
      interventions for HIV-positive adults 45-plus years of age who engage in risky sexual
      behaviors.
