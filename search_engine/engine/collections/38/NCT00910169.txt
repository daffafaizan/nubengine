    
      This study will evaluate global, psychiatric, somatic and psychosocial outcome for inpatients
      with anorexia nervosa through three evaluations (intake, discharge and one-year follow-up).
      The study will also consider five types of in-patient treatment in a naturalistic setting
      (i.e., patients will not be assigned to different treatment conditions; rather, we will study
      inpatient care as it exists today). The five treatment modalities to be studied are:

        1. Discharge weight objectives.

        2. The practice of a separation period.

        3. The use of clear nutritional and dietary objectives (cognitive/behavioural).

        4. The intensity of family involvement in treatment.

        5. Stabilisation phase before ending inpatient treatment.
