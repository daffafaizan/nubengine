      "traditional pain education" based on pain self-management ("living despite the pain") and
      biomedical models. As the focus is based on cognitive change, pain neuroscience programs
      could be more effective than pain self-management programs, contributing to reconceptualize
      beliefs and minimize the level of threatening perceived by the brain. Gallagher et al (2013)
      reported effects of a pain neuroscience education program based on a book of metaphors
      compared to a pain self-management program (Back book) and reported greater immediate from
      pain neuroscience education on pain catastrophizing and pain knowledge. The hypothesis of
      this study is that a pain neuroscience education will show more effective results for pain
      intensity, catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy when compared to the pain self-management
      program in patients with CLBP. The purpose of this study will be to compare the immediate
      effects of an educational program focused on Pain Neuroscience Education vs. Pain
      self-management program for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) considering the
      outcomes of pain intensity, catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy. The investigators will
      recruit 108 with CLBP between 18 and 60 years and both genders. The sample size will be
      randomized into two arms: fifty participants will be submitted to Pain Neuroscience Education
      and the remaining fifty to Pain Self-Management education. Both interventions will be
      administered in one session (50 minutes). The programs will be showed as interactive
      workshops. Participants will be submitted to a brief initial assessment considering: pain
      intensity, fear of movement, anxiety and depression, catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy and
      global perceived effect.
