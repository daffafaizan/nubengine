      situation. The duration of this pause was dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called mobocertinib. The study will assess the PK of
      single dose mobocertinib and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in participants
      with moderate and/or severe HI compared to matched-healthy participants with normal hepatic
      function.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of
      the following 3 treatment groups in a staggered manner based on their degree of hepatic
      impairment which will be determined based on Child-Pugh Score as follow:

        -  Moderate HI (Child-Pugh B): Mobocertinib 40 mg

        -  Severe HI (Child-Pugh C): Mobocertinib 40 mg

        -  Normal Hepatic Function: Mobocertinib 40 mg

      Healthy participants with normal hepatic function will be recruited to match both moderate
      and severe HI by age (mean plus or minus [+-] 10 years), gender (+-2 participants per
      gender), and body mass index (BMI, mean +-10 percent [%]).

      All participants will be asked to take single dose of mobocertinib on Day 1. The dose level
      for severe HI may be modified based on the previous results of approximately 3 moderate HI
      and healthy participants who completed up to Day 10 study procedures.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 51 days. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
