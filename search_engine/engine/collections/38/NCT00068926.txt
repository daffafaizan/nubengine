      if they are eligible for infectious disease vaccine clinical trials being sponsored by the
      Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the NIH Clinical Center. All work will be conducted by the
      VRC Clinic of the National Institutes of Health or IRB-approved extramural sites that are
      collaborating with the VRC Clinic. Educational materials on vaccines will be reviewed with
      and provided to subjects before enrollment into the study.

      SUBJECTS: Approximately 3,000 healthy adults; age 18-70 years.

      STUDY DURATION: Duration of participation is variable, and may last from a few weeks to
      several months for each subject. Study participation is complete when the subject enrolls in
      a vaccine study, is found to be ineligible for all vaccine studies or declines to participate
      in any vaccine studies.

      STUDY EVALUATIONS: Evaluations usually include history, physical examinations and laboratory
      tests. Only those evaluations needed to determine eligibility for a particular study will be
      done. Evaluations other than those described in this protocol may be done if necessary for
      eligibility for a study. Blood will also be collected for storage.
