    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore baseline levels and effects of adavosertib (AZD1775) on DNA copy number,
      mutation, and level of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression (together described as
      "molecular results") in tumor protein p53 (p53)-related pathways before and after treatment
      in women with primary advanced high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate molecular results to clinical endpoints including response and survival.

      II. To correlate molecular results to pathologic endpoints including tumor volume and
      apoptosis.

      III. To compare DNA copy number and level of RNA and protein expression in p53-related
      pathways in tissue from patients treated with AZD1775 to those untreated with AZD1775 in the
      preoperative period.

      IV. To determine the toxicity of AZD1775 given preoperatively, with a focus on postoperative
      wound healing.

      V. To determine the feasibility of treating preoperatively with AZD1775.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Patients then undergo
      standard of care laparoscopy. Patients may also receive adavosertib PO QD on days 8-12,
      15-19, and 22-26 for up to 28 days based on surgery schedule.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
