    
      Subjects having cardiac surgery in which they will be on a heart-lung machine and will
      receive the antibiotic vancomycin, will be able to participate.

      Up to ten blood samples testing for vancomycin concentrations will be collected in subjects
      administered vancomycin as prophylaxis before cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and
      modified ultrafiltration. Participation will be complete once the cardiac surgery has been
      finished.
