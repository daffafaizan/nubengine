      purpurea in children 6-11 years old. The goal of the study is to determine if Echinacea
      purpurea is associated with activation of immune markers including cytokines such as tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interferon alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukins 2, 6, and
      12 (IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12), as well CD25 and CD69 activation. A total of 40 study children
      will be randomized to receive either the Echinacea purpurea formulation or placebo for 10
      consecutive days at the start of 3 consecutive 30-day periods. Blood samples will be obtained
      at baseline, at the time of "peak" TNF activity, and either 30 or 120 days after beginning
      the study medication. Prior to beginning this pediatric study "peak" TNF activity will be
      determined by administering the Echinacea purpurea to 3 adult volunteers for 10 days and
      doing frequent blood sampling during this period. If it is demonstrated that this formulation
      of E purpurea has biologic activity, a large randomized controlled trial is planned to
      determine if E purpurea can prevent upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in children 2-11
      years old.
