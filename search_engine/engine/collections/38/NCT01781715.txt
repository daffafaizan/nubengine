      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCD) patients,
      who have experienced STEMI, are at a high risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE) within
      one year after primary PCI. While MACE incidence in patients with one-vessel coronary artery
      disease is about 14.5%, patients with two- and three-vessel lesions experience MACE in 19.5%
      and 23.6% of cases, respectively. The risk of death in a 5-year follow-up increases two-fold
      in MVCD patients. This risk can be partly explained by slower recovery of left ventricular
      function and progression of left ventricular pathological remodeling process after MI. In
      addition, the mere presence of MVCD has been shown to be associated with MACE development in
      the long-term period. There are several treatment strategies for ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) patients with MVCD: infarct related artery (IRA)-only percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), multivessel stenting in the primary PCI setting and staged
      revascularisation. The current guidelines for STEMI revascularisation give no definite
      instructions on the need for concurrent non-IRA intervention in patients with stable
      haemodynamics. At present, there are not clinical trials testing the current
      Zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) in STEMI patients with MVCD undergoing primary PCI for
      different strategies of revascularization.
