        -  Compare the tumor response rates in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3 different schedules of pemetrexed disodium and
           gemcitabine.

        -  Compare the duration of response, time to progressive disease, time to treatment
           failure, and survival time in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of these regimens in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      of disease (IIIB vs IV) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one
      of three treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1 followed by
           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by
           pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and pemetrexed
           disodium IV over 10 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 6
      additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 20 months.
