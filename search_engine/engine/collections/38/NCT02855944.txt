    
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated
      with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of
      rucaparib has been evaluated in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. An oral formulation is
      the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being investigated as
      monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with breast cancer susceptibility gene 1
      (BRCA1) or BRCA2 mutations.

      While PARP inhibitors have demonstrated consistent robust clinical activity in patients with
      relapsed ovarian cancer associated with HRD, prospective studies evaluating efficacy and
      safety of PARPi versus standard of care chemotherapy have been limited. The primary purpose
      of this Phase 3 study is to compare the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemotherapy
      as treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer in patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in
      their tumor.
