      688 patients who have had previous bypass grafts and require invasive coronary angiography
      over a period of 30 months.

      Patients will be randomised to receive either computed tomography cardiac angiography (CTCA)
      prior to their invasive coronary angiogram, or invasive coronary angiography alone.

      The primary endpoints will be the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy, the duration of
      the invasive coronary angiographic procedure and patient satisfaction. A number of secondary
      endpoints will also be looked at.

      Findings from BYPASS-CTCA will potentially demonstrate that a CTCA prior to invasive coronary
      angiography in this cohort of patients reduces the incidence of contrast-induced kidney
      injury, the length of procedure and improves patients satisfaction. The results of this trial
      may influence future clinical practice guidelines in coronary artery bypass graft patients
      undergoing invasive coronary procedures.
