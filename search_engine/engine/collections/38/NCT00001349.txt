      blood, it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma and/or leukocytes, than
      can be safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely
      obtained using apheresis procedures in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. This protocol is
      specifically designed to conform to the requirements of the Apheresis Unit for donors to have
      apheresis procedures (>7 years of age and greater than or equal to 25kg). Donors must first
      be admitted to another approved clinical research protocol of the LPD, NIAID before they may
      have the apheresis procedures described in this protocol. The investigational nature of the
      studies in which the samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits of the donation
      process will be explained to all donors, and a signed informed consent document will be
      obtained.
