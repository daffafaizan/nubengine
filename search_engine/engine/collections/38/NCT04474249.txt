      Hospital and were included in the Uppsala COVID-19 biobank. The patients will be contacted
      after three to six months for a first follow-up with assessment of functional level in
      activities of daily life, psychiatric symptoms, neurological symptoms and working capacity as
      well as specific organ functions. The organ functions will include circulation, respiration,
      coagulation, immune function and kidney function. In addition, blood and urine will be
      collected for biobanking.
