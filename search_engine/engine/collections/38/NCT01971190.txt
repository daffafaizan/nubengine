    
      Single-center Double blind randomized Phase 2 interventional parallel study.

      Group A : 2mg intravitreal Aflibercept(Eylea) injection at baseline, at 1 month, and at 2
      month Group B : Sham injection at baseline, at 1 month, and at 2 month

      At 3 month, 4 month, 5 month, and 6 month, PRN treatment of aflibercept injection or
      half-fluence photodynamic therapy may be done, if one of following conditions is fulfilled.

      The PRN treatment method was decided by investigator's discretion.

      Of patient who had persistent intra- or subretina fluid on SD-OCT

        1. Central subfield thickness is not decreased to more than 50 micrometer compared with
           baseline central subfield thickness

        2. Best-corrected ETDRS letter score dose not increased more than 5 letters than baseline
           (because of the persistent CSC).

        3. Central subfield thickness is thicker than the previous exam

        4. BCVA letter score is worse than the previous exam (because of the persistent CSC)
