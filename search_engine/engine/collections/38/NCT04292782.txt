      AQLB and CB in children undergoing unilateral open hip reduction/osteotomies for hip
      dislocation.

      Patients were randomly assigned, into 1 of 2 groups, namely, group CB (n = 20) and group AQLB
      (n = 20).

      Preoperatively all children were premedicated by using oral midazolam (0 .5mg/kg).

      anesthesia was induced with 3 to 4% sevoflurane and 50% with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen.Then
      fentanyl 3 Î¼g/kg and Propofol 1 - 2mg/Kg were administered for anesthesia induction. Airway
      was secured with endotracheal tube placed in the mouth facilited by 0.15 mg/kg cistracurium.
      Anesthesia maintenance was performed with sevoflurane 2% in 50% nitrous oxide.

      AQLB and CB were done with 1 ml/kg, 0.25% Ropivacaine (maximum dose limited to 20 ml)

      Postoperative follow-up:

      All patients received 15 mg/kg paracetamol before extubation. Tramadol 2 mg/kg intravenous
      was planned as rescue analgesia when CHEOPS score was more than 3. Supplemental IV tramado, 1
      mg/kg could be added if necessary every 6 hours.
