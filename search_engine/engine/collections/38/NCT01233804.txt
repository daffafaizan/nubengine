      would be eligible. Enrolled women would be randomized to either the Opting in (obtaining
      written consent to administer the vaccine) or Opting out (signing only to refuse the vaccine)
      study group (Part 1). Vaccine uptake rate and reason for refusal will be captured for
      enrollees. At the end of this clinic visit, enrollees will be asked if they are interested in
      participating in Part 2 and 3 of the study. If yes, consent will be obtained. Part 2 of the
      study, a random sample of 50 women will be called 2 days after enrollment to determine 1)
      vaccine side effects 2) recall of information provided in consent and 3) to confirm next
      followup visit with Obstetrician. During Part 3, at 6 weeks post EDD (estimated due date),
      data about episodes of respiratory illness in the mothers and their infants occuring between
      the time when influenza vaccine was offered (Part 1) and 6 weeks post-EDD will be abstracted
      using a standard form. Data will be collected retrospectively by research nurses.
