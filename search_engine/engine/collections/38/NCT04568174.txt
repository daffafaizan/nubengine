    
      PPSGG (PN-1007) is intended to bind anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies, the underlying cause of
      anti-MAG neuropathy, in a highly selective manner, resulting in their neutralization and
      removal from the circulation. This allows specific targeting of anti-MAG IgM in the
      circulation and circumvents unspecific immunosuppression associated with current treatment
      strategies.

      This is a Phase I/IIa, First in Human (FiH), multicenter, single and multiple ascending dose
      escalation trial of PPSGG (PN-1007), an antibody scavenger of pathogenic anti-MAG
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies for treatment of anti-MAG neuropathy. The aim of the
      study is to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
      and preliminary efficacy of PPSGG (PN-1007) in a SAD and a MAD phase in an adaptive trial in
      anti-MAG neuropathy patients.
