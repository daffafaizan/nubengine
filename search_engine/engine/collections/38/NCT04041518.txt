      another site in the same patient's mouth. It has become a routine treatment option for
      missing teeth in the human dentition and a reasonable alternative to dental implants, fixed
      bridgework, resin-bonded restorations, and removable partial dentures.

      Under ideal circumstances, a vital transplanted tooth with healthy periodontal tissues is the
      final outcome of autotransplantation. Best results for both the rate of revascularization and
      the further development of the roots are achieved in adolescent teeth with two thirds to
      three fourths developed roots. According to Andreasen et al., the critical diameter of the
      apical foramen of the transplanted tooth is 1 mm for successful revascularization. The
      reported success rates for revascularization of mature teeth with fully developed roots were
      distinctly lower, and endodontic treatment was considered a standard procedure after
      transplantations of mature teeth.

      Aim of the presented study is to evaluate the success rate of autotransplantation of almost
      or completely fully developed teeth with intraoperative extracorporeal root tip resection to
      facilitate revascularization and obviate subsequent root canal treatment.

      The primary endpoint is the successful periodontal healing of the graft, the secondary
      endpoint the revascularization of the graft.

      Revascularization is assessed radiologically with intraoral films after four weeks and three,
      six, nine and twelve months (obliteration of the pulp, no signs of inflammatory root
      resorption, and magnetic resonance tomography 4 weeks postoperatively.

      Patients are followed-up for one year.
