    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of oral SPI-1005 in
      adults with Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). All recruited subjects will have their
      severity of NIHL determined before the start of SPI-1005 treatment using various hearing
      tests. Subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either placebo or SPI-1005. Subjects will
      be dosed with either placebo or SPI-1005 for 7 days, beginning 1 day before an acute NIHL.
      Subjects will have hearing tests performed before and immediately after a calibrated sound
      challenge (CSC). Follow-up hearing tests will be performed post-CSC.
