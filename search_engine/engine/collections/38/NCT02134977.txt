      switching to leuprorelin acetate 3 month depot 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg
      injection kit) from a 4-week adjuvant therapy with a LH-RHa 1 month depot over 48 weeks in
      premenopausal breast cancer participants in daily medical practice, as well as to evaluate
      the influence of condition of estrogen receptor expression on the efficacy and safety of
      leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit .

      For adults, leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit)
      is usually administered subcutaneously once every 12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger
      rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle pointed upward, allowing the entire
      suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the powder. The powder is then fully
      suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not generated.
