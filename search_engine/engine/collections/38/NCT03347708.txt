    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, vehicle and placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multi-center study in subjects with single-level, symptomatic lumbar
      intervertebral disc degeneration (>6 months) and unresponsive to conservative therapy for at
      least 3 months. The study will compare single intradiscal injections of high and low dose
      IDCT with two control groups (saline, Sodium Hyaluronate).

      8 study visits will be completed by all subjects; screening, day 1 (injection day), week 4,
      week 12, week 26, week 52, week 72 and week 104. The subject will be assessed for safety and
      efficacy utilizing VAS and ODI questionnaires alongside radiographic evaluations. The study
      will have a 1 year follow-up and a 1 year extension period (total 2 years).
