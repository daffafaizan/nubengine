             1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of specificity CD38 CAR-T cells in patients
                with relapsed or refractory leukemia and lymphoma.

             2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells,
                and the phenotype of persisting T cells.

           Real Time polymerase chain receptor (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM
           and lymph node will be used to detect and quantify survival of CD38 CAR-T cells over
           time.

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to
                specificity CD38 CAR-T cell infusions.

             2. The CAR-T cells will be administered by i.v. injection over 20-30 minutes as a
                using Day 0: 1-5x10e6/kg total dose on day 0.
