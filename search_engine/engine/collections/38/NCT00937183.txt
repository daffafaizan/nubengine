    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluation of feasibility of dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination program using
           autologous tumor cells and/or lysates in patients with indolent B cell lymphomas or
           multiple myeloma as an adjuvant therapy to induce immune response in remission after
           cytoreductive treatment.

        -  Evaluation of the immune response of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluation the progression-free survival of patients treated this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the adverse events of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive intranodal (under ultrasound guidance) or subcutaneous vaccinations
      of adjuvant electrofusion hybrids of autologous dendritic cells (DC) with autologous lymphoma
      cells, electrofusion hybrids of allogeneic DC with autologous lymphoma cells, and/or
      autologous DC pulsed with autologous tumor lysate cells in weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 26, and
      50.
