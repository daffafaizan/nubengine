    
      Chylous fistula is one of the common complications after pancreatic operation, whose
      incidence is about 10%. The delayed diagnosis or wrong treatment in the perioperative period
      may lead to refractory chylous ascites, water-electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, immune
      dysfunction, secondary infection and other complications. In the past, chylous fistula, as
      the postoperative complication, is common in abdominal aortic surgery, gynecological
      malignancies accompanied with posterior peritoneum lymphadenectomy and spinal surgery, etc.
      But chylous fistula after pancreatic operation did not attract enough attention. The
      comparative study or case analysis is lacked in relevant reports and there is no consensus on
      diagnostic criteria. In addition, once it occurs after pancreatic operation, the
      rehabilitation of patients will be affected, increasing the burden of hospitalization and
      even endangering the lives of patients due to the lack of diagnosis and treatment experience
      of specialists. The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) proposed relevant
      definitions under the background of no unified diagnostic criteria of chylous fistula after
      pancreatic operation. But this definition still has some shortcomings; for example, it lacks
      the value of clinical guidance and research implementation. Moreover, how to take targeted
      preventive measures, choose the optimal treatment method and avoid complications, and whether
      there is a superior treatment method need to be further considered and investigated.
      Therefore, we performed this study, so as to better improve the relevant definition and
      provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment.
