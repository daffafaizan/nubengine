           electrophysiological mapping (stimulation and recording) and, when used in conjunction
           with a radiofrequency generator and irrigation pump, for cardiac ablation with
           monitoring of tissue temperature during ablation.

        -  In this study, the DiamondTemp Ablation System will be evaluated for the treatment of
           patients with atrial fibrillation.
