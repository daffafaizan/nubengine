      Study Design: This will be a single-center, open-label trial to assess the safety and
      efficacy of rapid administration of velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) to treatment-naive patients
      with type I Gaucher disease. The first six infusions will be administered in the hospital:
      the first three infusions within 60, 30 and 20 minutes each, with the beginning of a 10
      minutes administration from infusion #4. Following the three uneventful administration of the
      10 minutes in the hospital, the bi-weekly ERT will continue as home therapy, as outlined in
      the protocol. The duration of the study will be 12 months, with an extension pending positive
      results.

      Number of Patients: 15. The first ten patients will be adults, and then children will be
      allowed to enroll in the trial.
