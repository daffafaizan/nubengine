    
      A prospective multicenter single arm open label study to evaluate ambulatory detection
      performance, arrhythmia detection and safety of the ASSUREâ„¢ Wearable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (WCD). A total of 130 adult subjects at risk for sudden cardiac arrest but
      otherwise protected by an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) will be enrolled at 10
      clinical sites in the United States. Subjects will wear the device for approximately 30 days
      during normal daily activities including sleep. The WCD shock alarms and shock functionality
      will be disabled. Shock Alarm Event Markers are recorded by the WCD and will be used for
      analysis of the primary outcome measure. All episodes recorded by the ASSURE WCD and/or the
      subject's ICD will be reviewed by independent clinical experts.
