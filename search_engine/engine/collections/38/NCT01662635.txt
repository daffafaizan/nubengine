      biomarker studies. To identify ALK rearrangements, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      studies were performed on 3 to 4 mm thick paraffin sections from NSCLCs. The commercially
      labeled Vysis LSI ALK Dual Color (split-apart), break-apart rearrangement probe (Abbott
      Molecular, Abbott Park, IL) was used to detect any rearrangement involving the ALK gene. The
      probe hybridizes to band 2p23, on either side of the ALK gene breakpoint. Criteria for probe
      signal interpretation in at least 200 interphase nuclei were as follow: 1) separated green
      and orange signals or single red signals identified cells with rearranged ALK; 2) overlapping
      of red and green signals (yellowish) indicated cells in which ALK was not rearranged.

      FISH-positive samples for ALK rearrangement were defined as having cells with a clearly
      separated pair of probe signals, or with >15% of cells having loss of the 5Â´(centromeric)
      probe. The higher threshold for loss is necessary because parts of probes can be lost during
      sectioning.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the utility of IHC with 5A4 and RT-qPCR in the detection
      of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC compared with the current method of choice, FISH. Further, we
      report on the demographics, and clinicopathologic features of ALK-rearranged NSCLC in a
      Latin-American population.

      Clinical details of these patients were included in a database. Further results will be
      analyzed with the program SPSS17
