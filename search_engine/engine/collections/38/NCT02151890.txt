      fractional biopsy was taken, stained with H&E stain and by immubohistchemical (IH) staining
      by stem cell marker OCT4. IH expression of stem cell marker OCT4 was evaluated before and
      after transplantation according to Edessy Stem Cell Score (ESS).

      After laparoscopic injection of stem cell sample in the ovaries, participants were followed
      up monthly for a period of one year by hormonal (FSH, LH and E2), clinical (resuming
      menstruation), US (folliculometry), histopathological (HP), and IH expression of stem cell
      (stem cell positivity and scoring according to ESS).

      These cases were of ESS 5 and 6.
