    
      The study consists of 5 cohorts:

      Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding) dose-escalation to find the recommended dose (RD) of
      lenvatinib using time-to-event continual reassessment method (TiTE-CRM) in children and
      adolescents with relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumors. When the RD is identified,
      Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 3A will enroll in parallel.

      Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion) will evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib at the RD in
      children, adolescents, and young adults with

        1. 131 iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) [Cohort 2A] or

        2. Relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma [Cohort 2B]

      Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding) will determine the RD of lenvatinib in combination with
      ifosfamide and etoposide in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or
      refractory osteosarcoma.

      Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion) will evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib at the RD from
      Cohort 3A in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in children, adolescents, and young
      adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. Participants with osteosarcoma who have
      enrolled into Cohort 1 or 2B and experienced progressive disease will also be candidates for
      enrollment in Cohort 3B.

      Lenvatinib will be provided as hard capsules containing 1, 4, or 10 mg lenvatinib. Lenvatinib
      capsules should be dissolved in water or apple juice for those who are unable to swallow
      capsules.
