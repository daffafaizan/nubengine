      I. To determine whether the proportion of patients who achieve a >= 50% decline in serum
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after 12 weeks of protocol therapy with itraconazole dosed at
      300 mg orally (PO) twice daily (BID) is superior to a historical control based upon the
      observed PSA response proportion in prior studies of non-castrating systemic therapy in men
      with biochemically relapsed hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median time to PSA progression from the start of protocol therapy with
      itraconazole among men with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      II. To determine the median time to clinical progression measured from the start of protocol
      therapy with itraconazole among men with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      III. To determine the median metastasis-free survival measured from the start of protocol
      therapy in patients treated with itraconazole for biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      IV. To determine the mean percent change from baseline after 12 weeks of protocol therapy
      compared with pre-treatment in PSA doubling time.

      V. To characterize the safety profile of itraconazole in the biochemically relapsed hormone
      sensitive prostate cancer population, as graded by Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version
      4.03. All adverse events will be tabulated by grade according to the worst grade experienced.

      VI. To determine the mean steady-state itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole serum levels
      after 4 weeks of therapy with itraconazole.
