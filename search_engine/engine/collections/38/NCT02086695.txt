      prospectively enrolled . (80 at Mayo Clinic [80 receiving BVZ, Sunitinib ,or Pazopanib] and
      20 at St. Boniface General Hospital (SBGH)). Patients receiving either BVZ 5mg/kg iv
      ,Sunitinib 50 mg po daily, or Pazopanib for advanced Metastatic carcinoma will be screened
      for potential eligibility in the study. For metastatic renal cancer treatments, Sunitinib
      doses are (oral) 50 mg once a day for 4 weeks followed by a two week off period. The six week
      cycle is then repeated. In case of toxicities observed with the dose, a 25% reduction in the
      daily dose during the "on" period is performed (37.5 mg). Patients will be studied at 7 time
      points: i) Baseline; ii) Day 1; iii) Day 5; iv) 4-6 weeks ; v) 3 months; vi) 6 months after
      the initiation of both drugs (BVZ and Sunitinib) ; and vii) 12 months after the initiation of
      BVZ drug only (Figure 1). Three visits (baseline, 4-6 weeks , and 3 months) are considered
      part of standard clinical care, and four visits are for research. At each visit, in addition
      to standard of care provided by the Oncologist, blood will be drawn to measure high
      sensitivity troponin-T (hsTnT) and Natriuretic-proBNP. The patients will also undergo a TTE
      with tissue velocity imaging (TVI), strain and left ventricular opacification (LVO) and
      myocardial perfusion at each time point. EndoPAT test will also be performed at baseline, and
      3 months. The baseline, 4-6 weeks, and 3 month visits will be part of your standard clinical
      care and followup.
