      it many secondary health problems. Therefore, it is important to seek strategies to promote
      weight loss and to assist in weight maintenance after weight loss. Different diet
      compositions may have different effects on satiety and thus affect food choice. A pilot study
      will be conducted to determine if mixed nuts affect food selection and intake. Questionnaires
      will also be administered to determine if personality characteristics are also influencing
      food choice.
