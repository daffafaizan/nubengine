      5), Simvastatin or placebo will be administered with antibiotics. Quantitative cultures will
      be performed for microbiological confirmation of VAP. Simvastatin or placebo will be
      administered through an enteral feeding tube or administered orally when patients are able to
      safely take oral medications. The type and placement of the enteral feeding tube
      (nasogastric, nasoenteric, PEG, orogastric, oroenteric, etc.) and the ability to safely take
      oral medications will be determined by the patient's primary team. Study drug will be blinded
      with an identical appearing placebo.

      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA), and various blood factors will be measured
      during treatment.
