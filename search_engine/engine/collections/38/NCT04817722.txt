      curves, on the duration of hospital length of stay (hLOS) and on previously reported
      incidences of surgical, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, other, and long-term AEs was
      evaluated with F-ratio statistics or with Chi-square tests set at a more stringent P<.01
      value for significance to reduce the incidence of false discovery rates. Loglinear variance
      was utilized to examine the role of postoperative hLOS residuals across the range of
      intraoperative crystalloid administration. Multivariable analysis screened those previously
      reported independent variables with P<.1 with length of surgery, and the a posteriori
      variable of interest, rate of intraoperative crystalloid administration on duration of hLOS
      in a stepwise fashion with a maximum 5-fold R2 stopping rule, a cross validation technique
      that chooses the best model. The multivariable analysis was repeated with a regional
      instrumental variable based upon state residency to represent unmeasured confounders in this
      population that may have an association with the outcome of interest. Variance inflation
      factors calculations were conducted to determine the role of multicollinearity by the
      independent variables of interest. Sample size calculations for multivariable analysis
      require a minimum of 100 patients with â‰¥200 the preferred sample size. Recursive partitioning
      with 5-fold cross-validation, a measure of internal model validation, examined administration
      rates of intraoperative crystalloid administration by quantiles on hLOS and the role of
      intraoperative transfusion of pRBCs on hLOS. Tests to support the likelihood of causality of
      the intraoperative crystalloid administration on duration of hLOS was examined following
      analysis of seven likelihood tests; published findings consistent with prior research,
      biologic plausibility, dose-response relationship, strength of effect, and exclusions of
      effect-cause, confounding, and bias. The statistical program, JMP 13.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
      NC) was utilized in this study.
