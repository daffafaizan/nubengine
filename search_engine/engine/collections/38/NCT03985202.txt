      ultrasound test to look for a AAA. If their abdominal aorta is > 5.5 cm they are referred to
      a Vascular Surgeon. If the patients abdominal aorta is between 3 cm and 5.4 cm they are
      offered further ultrasound scans to monitor the size of their aorta. This is a surveillance
      programme. In addition men who have an AAA between 3 cm and 5.4 cm that is detected by an
      ultrasound scan, CT or MRI performed as part of an investigation for another clinical problem
      are added to the surveillance programme.

      In Torbay and South Devon men in the AAA surveillance programme are referred for a
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test when the AAA reaches 4.5 cm as part of standard clinical
      practice. This takes place in the Pre assessment Clinic in Torbay Hospital and is performed
      by a Consultant Anaesthetist. If the patient is able to safely perform the Cardiopulmonary
      Exercise Test they will be identified as potential participants by the Consultant
      Anaesthetist.
