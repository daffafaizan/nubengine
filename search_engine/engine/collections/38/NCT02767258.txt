      ocular lubrication and protection can be compromised. However, the literature diverges on
      which is the best clinical practice for treatment. Thus, the general objective of this study
      was to evaluate the risk for developing dry eye in critically ill patients and the
      effectiveness of three types of interventions: eye gel and eyedrops (control group). The
      specific objectives were: verify the most effective intervention for the prevention of dry
      eye from the available literature and provided by: eye gel compared to the control group
      eyedrops who received eye care through randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients and
      methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the best care for the
      prevention of dry eye from those available on the market (eye drops and eye gel), in the
      period from 14/01/2016 to 31/12/2019 . The expected result is: negative values in Schirmer
      test and no corneal ulcers presence.
