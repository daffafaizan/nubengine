      consequences for patients, mainly in terms of severity, and predictive criteria. This will
      allow us to identify some patients most at risk of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions,
      and thus to adapt morphine titration and monitoring of these patients. Leading to a better
      understanding and a better prediction of adverse effects in patients, it is possible that
      part of the "opiophobia" which persists in emergency services disappear. Finally, it is
      toward a better security but also a better efficiency in the management of pain patients in
      emergencies that leads this study.

      The secondary objectives are:

      To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events related to morphine. To establish
      an inventory of morphine use in emergency departments in the different centres studied.
