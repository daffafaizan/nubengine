      produces greater reduction in severity of defeatist attitudes than a supportive contact
      control group in consumers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with persistent
      moderate-to-severe experiential negative symptoms. A second aim is to determine whether
      reduction in defeatist attitudes mediates improvement in experiential negative symptoms and
      psychosocial functioning in mCBTn. The third aim is to determine whether mCBTn increases
      pupil dilation and whether changes in pupil dilation (an objective psychophysiological
      biomarker of effort) are associated with changes in defeatist attitudes and negative
      symptoms. The final aim is to explore predictors of response to mCBTn, including device use
      and group session adherence, demographics, neurocognitive impairment, and negative and other
      symptom severity at baseline.
