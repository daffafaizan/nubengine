      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) treated with sorafenib.

      II. Determine the toxicity in patients treated with sorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate bone marrow angiogenesis, CLL tumor cell expression of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors (flt-1, KDR, flt-4 and neuropilin-1), basic fibroblast
      growth factor, and plasma interleukin-8 levels with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
