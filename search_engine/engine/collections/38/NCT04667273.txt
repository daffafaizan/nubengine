      Electrical Stimulation (NMES) on pain, range of motion (ROM), functional capacity, neck pain,
      sleep quality. The study will be included 48 volunteers with Subacromial Impingement Syndrome
      (SIS). The study's inclusion criteria are as follows: Having a diagnosis of subacute /
      chronic extrinsic SIS, 18 to 65 years of age and being volunteer. The exclusion criteria are
      as follows: Fracture or surgical history in the shoulder region, another diagnosis that can
      affect shoulder function, having received local corticosteroid injection / treatment in the
      shoulder joint within the last 3 months, neuromuscular disease, pregnancy, cancer, unstabil
      angina, communication problems, systemic inflammatory joint disease, situations where
      electrical stimulation and exercise are contraindicated, orthopedic, rheumatologic or
      congenital disease of the affected upper extremity. The sociodemographic data of the patients
      will be questioned. ET will be applied daily and NMES will be applied 2 days a week for 8
      weeks. In addition, both groups will apply these exercises as a home program 3 times a day,
      10 repetitions of each exercise. Pain intensity with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), range of
      motion (ROM) with goniometer, muscle strength with Hand-held Dynamometer, upper extremity
      function evaluation with Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
      Questionnaire, disability of neck level with Neck Disability Index, sleep quality with
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index will be evaluated before and after treatment. All parameters
      will be compared between ET and ET+NMES group.
