      a promising treatment for a variety of ocular diseases associated with inflammation. To date,
      the only drug available, 'Kenalog-40 Injection' produced by Bristol Myers Squibb, has not
      been formulated for intraocular use. This formulation when used intraocularly has been
      associated with cases of non-bacterial endophthalmitis, which is thought to be due to the
      presence of benzyl alcohol and/or polysorbate 80. Both are suspected irritants.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a novel preservative-free formulation
      of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC-PF) at four dosage levels.

      The study will be an open-label, single-masked, randomized Phase I study that will
      investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the new formulation of TAC-PF. Sixteen
      participants with retinal vascular disease will be randomly assigned to receive via
      intravitreal injection at one of 4 dose levels (1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg) of TAC-PF.
      Depending on a participant's response, injections may be repeated at up to 3 month intervals.
      Participants will be followed for 3 years.

      The primary outcome will be an assessment of post-injection intraocular toxicity related
      events including increased inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, significant
      decreases in BCVA, cataract formation, retinal detachment, and intraocular hemorrhage. The
      secondary outcomes will be an improvement of 15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA, ETDRS) from baseline to year 3, and decreases in retinal thickening and area of
      leakage.
