      inflammation and alternations in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Patients with BC have
      impaired fatty acid profiles, low level of PUFAs, and high n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio. Moreover,
      these changes are related to clinical outcome.

      Fish oil is the richest source of anti-inflammatory n-3 PUFAs. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is
      rich in 18:3 n-6, the only n-6 fatty acid with an anti-inflammatory effect. Dietary intake of
      fish oil or EPO has been shown to decrease inflammation and improve PUFAs status in patients
      with cancers. However, it is not known what is the effect of combined EPO and fish oil in BC
      patients.

      The study design is double-blind, controlled, randomized nutritional intervention. The
      participants are randomly assigned into intervention and control group before starting
      chemotherapy. All patients receive nutritional counseling to achieve a daily energy and
      protein intake according to recommended dietary allowances, with (intervention) or without
      (control) of milled seed mix.
