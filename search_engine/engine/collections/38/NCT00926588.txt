      musculoskeletal pain of moderate severity, and randomize them to either the stepped care
      intervention or usual care control group. The intervention will be based upon the
      empirically-validated Three-Component Model which in SCOPE will involve collaboration between
      the primary care physician, a nurse pain care manager, and a supervising physician pain
      specialist. SCOPE will involve a telemedicine approach coupling automated home-based symptom
      monitoring with telephone-based nurse care management. The intervention will consist of
      optimized analgesic management using a stepped care approach to drug selection, symptom
      monitoring, dose adjustment, and switching or adding medications. All subjects will undergo
      comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by interviewers blinded
      to treatment group. Our principal aim is to test whether SCOPE is more effective than usual
      care in reducing pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. Secondarily, we will test the
      impact on other pain outcomes (e.g., severity, self-efficacy, use of self-management
      strategies), emotional functioning, health-related quality of life, and treatment
      satisfaction.
