      eligibility. This screening visit will be located at a laboratory at McMaster University's
      Institute of Applied Health Sciences. Eligibility will be determined using health
      questionnaires and non-invasive physical assessment of the upper limbs. Participants may not
      be eligible for further participation based on their health status and risks to health and
      safety.

      Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to 1 scheduled appointment (30-60
      minutes in duration). The appointment time will be scheduled according to individual
      symptoms, such that it will coincide with the time of day that lymphedema symptoms are
      predicted to be at their highest. Upon arrival at the scheduled appointment, participants
      will be randomized to receive 20 minutes of acupuncture+applied electrical stimulation or no
      treatment. Participants in both groups will be asked to provide physical assessment data over
      a period of 30 minutes during the scheduled appointment. Differences between groups in tissue
      swelling of the affected upper-limb will be determined immediately following treatment, and
      at 10 minutes following treatment.

      Participants will be asked to report any significant changes to their health state for a
      period of 2 weeks following treatment. A follow-up questionnaire will be made available at 2
      weeks following attendance of the scheduled appointment.
