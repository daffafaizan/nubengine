      tethered capsule microscopy in subjects with Parkinson Disease. Images from patients with
      Parkinson disease will be compared to our previously obtained images in healthy subjects to
      establish the spectrum of esophageal pathologies occurring in patients with Parkinson disease
      by OCT imaging.

      In the case of imaging internal luminal organs, like the esophagus, OCT light is delivered
      via a long catheter. We have developed a new technique termed Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy
      (TCE). TCE involves swallowing a tethered capsule that acquires cross-sectional microscopic
      images of the entire esophagus as it traverses the luminal organ via peristalsis or is pulled
      up towards the mouth using tether. The catheter is connected to the imaging system, and the
      side-viewing optical beam rotates either proximally by a motorized rotary joint or distally
      by a micro-motor, effectuating circular scanning of the lumen wall. Three-dimensional OCT of
      the entire length of the lumen can be acquired by simultaneous rotation and translation of
      the focused OCT beam creating a helical pattern.
