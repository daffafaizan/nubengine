    
      This is a randomized prospective study. All women who need to complete an intake and voiding
      diary at the Yale Urogynecology outpatient facilities will be invited to participate. After
      completion of the consent process, they will be randomized to one of two groups. Both groups
      will have their voiding diaries analyzed by three blinded experts and will be graded on
      completeness of the information filled out. The mean grade obtained from this process and the
      return rate of the voiding diaries will be the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes will
      include a brief patient questionnaire on their satisfaction of the instructions with the
      voiding diary. The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated between the groups to
      determine the effectiveness of the video intervention.
