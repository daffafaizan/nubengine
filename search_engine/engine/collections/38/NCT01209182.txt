      for repeat operations due to cancer involved margins. Repeat operations result in excessive
      removal of benign tissue, increased risk for infection, slower healing and inferior cosmetic
      results. In the current standard of care, the status of the margins is determined by
      pathology only several days after surgery. An intraoperative assessment of the margins
      enables complete tumor excision in a single surgery.

      The proposed randomized controlled study will evaluate the benefits of adding the ClearEdge
      imaging device to the Standard of Care (SoC) of margins assessment in breast conserving
      surgeries. The study will assess whether there is an improvement in the detection of cancer
      involved margins by measuring whether removal at the time of primary surgical treatment can
      reduce the need for repeat surgeries as compared to the SoC, which does not use the device.

      ClearEdge is a CE marked device already been used in several hospitals in the UK. It was used
      in a prospective single arm and 2 phases clinical study. It was demonstrated that surgeons
      successfully used the device to identify cancer involved margins and that it can reduce the
      need for repeat surgeries by meeting the margins depth criteria to require repeat operations.

      clinically evaluated by several hospitals.
