      machinery genes in MDS but they failed to demonstrate a consistent prognostic relevance.
      Moreover, the clinical impact of these mutations on the outcomes of hypomethylating agent
      treatment in MDS has never been explored yet. The investigators investigated the prognostic
      impact of mutations in spliceosome machinery genes (SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) on the outcomes
      of 1st line decitabine treatment in MDS.
