      However, people with AD do not all develop the same infections. For example, some people with
      AD who receive the smallpox vaccine develop a life-threatening condition known as eczema
      vaccinatum (EV). This study focuses on individuals with AD who also have a history of eczema
      herpeticum (ADEH+), a condition similar to EV. It is unlikely that the differences in the
      development of skin infections are due to differences in viral exposure, and instead due to
      differences in each individual's response to viruses. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the genetic pathways which are responsible for the development of viral skin
      infections in people with AD.

      Participants in this study will also be enrolled in the ADVN Biomarker Registry Study. There
      will be only one clinical visit for this study at which blood and/or skin samples may be
      collected. The samples will then have high-throughput genotyping to define genetic markers in
      individuals susceptible to viral infections.
