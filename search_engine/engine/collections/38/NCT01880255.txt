      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment for working memory deficits in
      individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder between 18 and 59 years of age.
      The study duration is approximately 3 months, with the rTMS sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5
      times a week, for about 1 hour each. Several scales will be used to assess symptom severity
      as part of the clinical assessment. Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery and
      the N-back task.

      This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks of daily rTMS to better understand the effects of
      rTMS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of
      different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow while you are
      completing some basic tasks to assess brain function. We will also collect two blood samples
      (before and after rTMS treatment) to see if certain proteins change in response to treatment.
      Finally, an analysis of genetic material will be conducted to see if genes play a role in
      differences in how people respond to treatment.
