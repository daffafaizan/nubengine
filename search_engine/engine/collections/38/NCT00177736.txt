      the treating team not the investigators. Patients on cefepime who have ventilator-associated
      pneumonia or bacteremia will be invited to participate in the study. Blood samples will be
      taken to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. Blood cultures will be repeated
      in patients with bacteremia to determine clearance of infection. A mini-BAL will be repeated
      in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia to determine clearance of pneumonia.
