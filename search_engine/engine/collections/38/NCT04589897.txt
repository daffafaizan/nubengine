      in the different types of bacteria found within these infections.

      This clinical trial looks at whether a novel sinus rinse device (that incorporates manuka
      honey) could help clear infection or reduce the amount and/or types of bacteria found within
      the upper airway. This study assesses the changes in the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22)
      scores along with any changes in quality of life, before and after the use of a sinus rinse
      device for 30 days.

      In addition to this, the amount and types of bacteria found in nasal swabs, the sinus rinse
      solution, and sputum samples, before and after using the sinus rinse device will be
      investigated. Sputum samples will also be monitored for changes in composition before and
      after using the sinus rinse.
