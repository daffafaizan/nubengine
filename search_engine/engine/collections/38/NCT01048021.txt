      1911. With classic "blind" techniques, an incidence of pneumothorax has been reported ranging
      from 0.5-6.0%, limiting its widespread use, despite the belief that the supraclavicular
      approach is the most consistent, effective technique for anesthetizing the brachial plexus.
      With the advent of ultrasound guidance and real time visualization this risk has been
      minimized and a resurgence in utilization of this approach has occurred. Increased block
      success, diminished performance times, and lower anesthetic volumes have been observed with
      this technique when compared to nerve stimulator techniques. Despite these advantages,
      brachial plexus anesthesia above the clavicle is associated with diaphragmatic dysfunction
      and caution must be demonstrated in patients with respiratory disease. Interscalene brachial
      plexus blockade has been widely documented to produce a 100% incidence of hemidiaphragmatic
      paresis and an associated 25% mean reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) with local
      anesthetic volumes ranging from 20 - 45mL 8-10, these parameters for supraclavicular brachial
      plexus blockage are not as well defined. Previous investigations report an incidence of
      hemidiaphragmatic paresis of 1-75% with supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. This study
      will address whether diaphragmatic function and respiratory mechanics can be preserved with
      lower anesthetic volumes in ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade.
