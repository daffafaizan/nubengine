      international/PCI) has been designed as a pilot study to allow a peer reviewed process of
      four international test centres on measurement of perioperative acute and long-term cognitive
      outcome. Data from standard clinical treatment of 500 patients age â‰¥ 70 years scheduled for
      elective surgery (stratified according to preoperative assessment of frailty and monitored by
      intraoperative depth of anaesthesia) will be supplemented by guideline conform delirium-
      analgesia- and sedation screening until day 5 after surgery, I-Pad based neuropsychological
      testing [Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery - CANTAB connect]
      pre-operatively, 3 months, 1- 2- and 5 years after surgery, a paper-based verbal fluency test
      (animal naming test from Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R)), a paper based
      test on executive function (Trailmaking Test), cognitive screening tests (Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MOCA) and Mini-Cog), and concomitant questionnaires to assess functional status,
      self- and by proxy rating of cognitive performance, psychological factors (depression,
      perioperative anxiety, stress, resilience and coping), social support, perioperative anxiety,
      stress, resilience and coping, as well as risk consumption of alcohol and tobacco.

      A non-surgical control group of 100 study participants who are not scheduled for surgery will
      be followed up at the same time points as the surgical cohort for scaling of cognitive data
      and definition of cut off values to define significant cognitive decline.

      Secondary outcome measures of this trial comprise levels and changes in molecular biomarkers
      involved in Alzheimer's dementia etiology sampled from spinal fluid on induction of spinal
      anaesthesia and sampled from blood in all patients.
