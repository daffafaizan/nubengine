      The serum calcification test has been established and validated by A. Pasch and coworkers,
      the expertise to perform the necessary statistical analyses is present in the investigator's
      department, all patient-related procedures necessary for this project are routinely performed
      in the investigator's department.

      Objective

      Does short daily hemodialysis strengthen the calcification-inhibitory forces inherent in
      hemodialysis patient sera, when compared to conventional three-times weekly hemodialysis?

      Methods

      Serum calcification test
