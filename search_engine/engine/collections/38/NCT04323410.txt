      performed under anesthesia with or without percutaneous pinning. This research protocol was
      developed due to good results reported on leaving the fractures in an overriding position.

      In this randomized controlled trial, we will compare objective outcomes between casting in
      finger-trap traction without reduction versus closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation
      of dorsally displaced, overriding distal metaphyseal radius fractures in children.

      Inclusion criteria are patients younger than 11 years old (Tanner 0) with completely
      overriding distal radius fractures. At the emergency department patients are randomized into
      two groups: finger trap traction and cast immobilization (experimental group) and anatomic
      reduction and percutaneous pin fixation (control group).

      The current controversy is whether cast immobilization alone is an adequate stabilization or
      whether percutaneous pin fixation is more appropriate for displaced, complete, distal forearm
      (overriding) metaphyseal fractures. The objectives of this trial are to compare the outcomes
      between conservative treatment with finger trap method for completely displaced distal radius
      fractures and surgical treatment with percutaneous pinning. Our null hypothesis is that there
      are no radiological or clinically relevant differences in outcome measures between the two
      treatment groups. We consider non-inferiority proven if there is no clinically significant
      difference at 6 months between the two treatments groups in the primary outcome: ratio (%) of
      forearm rotation and wrist extension-flexion range of motion (ROM) compared to the
      non-affected side at 6 months (non-inferiority margin 10%).
