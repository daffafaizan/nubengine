      influence on children's obesogenic behaviors (i.e., diet, sleep, physical activity, sedentary
      behaviors) and self-regulation. In this pilot study children will be randomized to two arms:
      attend a structured summer camp, not attend a camp. The investigators hypothesize that
      children attending the summer camp will engage in more healthy obesogenic behaviors, display
      higher levels of self-regulation, and subsequently will experience less weight gain than
      children not attending the summer camp. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims
      will be accomplished: Aim 1 (Primary): Compare changes in BMI z-scores and fitness among
      children from low-income households attending a structured summer day camp and those not
      attending a structured summer day camp. Aim 2 (Secondary): Compare changes in obesogenic
      behaviors among children attending a structured summer day camp and those not attending a
      structured summer day camp. Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore changes in self-regulation and the
      moderating effect of these changes on primary and secondary outcomes among children attending
      and not attending a structured summer day camp.
