      units (NICUs) are included in this study. Glucose levels was analyzed two hours after birth.
      In the age of 8 months parents completed the questionnaire Pediatric Quality of Life - Infant
      scale. The questionnaire Quality of life for children 5-7 years and for their parents will be
      offered to them in the next 4 months.

      We will investigate if there is a correlation between glucose levels and quality of life in
      premature infants, and if quality of life changes over years.
