      PeAF. All patients will be randomized to either the upgraded '2C3L' arm or PVI arm in a 1:1
      fashion. The upgraded '2C3L' technique is a fixed ablation approach consisting of EI-VOM,
      bilateral circumferential PVI and three linear ablation lesion sets across the mitral
      isthmus, left atrial roof, and cavo-tricuspid isthmus. The follow-up duration is 12 months.
      The primary endpoint is freedom from any documented atrial tachycardia arrhythmias of > 30
      seconds from 3 to 12 months after a single ablation procedure (including a blanking period of
      3 months) off antiarrhythmic drugs.
