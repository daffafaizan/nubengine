      detection rate of adrenal incidentaloma (AI) has been greatly improved. Most AI are benign
      and do not have the function of autonomic hormone secretion, but about 20% of them have
      function and can secrete adrenal hormone autonomously. Studies based on biopsy reports show
      that the prevalence of AI is about 2%, and the prevalence of AI detected by CT scan is 1% -
      4.5%. However, most of these studies are retrospective, and there may be selection bias and
      other confounding factors. There is no large sample prospective study on the prevalence of AI
      in the general population. The purpose of this study is to prospectively include patients
      with adrenal incidentaloma in community physical examination population, and evaluate their
      function and prognosis. The research results will provide new evidence for standardized
      diagnosis and treatment of adrenal incidentaloma in the future.
