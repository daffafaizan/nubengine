      with the The National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU)'s recent inclusion of a
      positive RT-QuIC for pathological prion protein in the diagnostic criteria for
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) [1], we aim to deploy this novel method to establish it as an
      accurate research and diagnostic resource in the assessment and prognosis of RBD. This
      research is transformative and has the potential to change practice.

      Currently, there is no simple method with high sensitivity and specificity available which
      can identify patients who will go on to develop an α - synucleinopathy. Clinical assessment
      of a panel of markers (e.g. Postuma et al. 2015) are time-consuming and impractical in normal
      clinical settings, with the majority of patients presenting to sleep physicians,
      geriatricians, and non-specialised neurology clinics, both publicly and privately. This has a
      major impact on counselling strategies for RBD patients, appropriate follow-up, trials of
      novel neuro-protective agents in alpha-synucleinopathies before full-blown phenotype is
      manifest and enhancing understanding of pathways involved in RBD out-with the dopaminergic
      system.

      RBD is a common, sometimes fatal disease (through injury to self/others) and treatments are
      indiscriminate regarding aetiology with limited evidence-base. A simple test using CSF
      (analogous to measuring CSF-orexin levels to diagnose narcolepsy+cataplexy) with high
      sensitivity and specificity is ideal. Thus, we believe that the central thesis of our work
      will not only inform subsequent behavioural, genetic and neuroimaging characterisation of our
      established RBD cohort, but will also translate the α-syn RT-QuIC concept into evidence-based
      and effective clinical practice.
