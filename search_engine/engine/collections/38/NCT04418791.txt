    
      To study the role of gut health, more specifically the intestinal barrier, in individuals
      with psoriasis and the effects of fasting on both organs in a prospective cohort cross-over
      study. The investigators will test whether MIF can improve (i) skin lesions (clinical and
      molecular level), (ii) intestinal integrity markers such as zonulin, IFABP and sCD14, and
      (iii) the timing of these improvements. As such, it can be determined whether fasting
      benefits psoriasis and gut health. MIF will consist of a limited calorie uptake of 500 kcal
      for 2 days a week. The remaining days of the week are as usual. Gut and skin health will be
      tested at the molecular level during 12 weeks with another crossover of 12 weeks (alternating
      between MIF and usual diet).
