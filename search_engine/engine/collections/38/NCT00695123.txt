      participate in other active NIH research studies studying blood disorders. This protocol
      serves several purposes: 1) allows detailed investigations into the blood disorders of these
      subjects, and the status of other organ systems that would determine their ability to safely
      tolerate specific aspects of active research protocols; 2) allows investigators to offer
      clinical diagnostic testing and procedures to patients if this treatment will facilitate
      their participation in a clinical trial; 3) allows investigations as to whether a donor is
      HLA matched, fit to receive G-CSF, and fit to undergo apheresis and therefore eligible to
      participate as a donor on a bone marrow transplant protocol; 4) allows the evaluations of
      healthy volunteers as to whether they are eligible for participation as control subjects on
      protocols that require generally good health status by history or physical exam findings, or
      laboratory assessments; and 5) allows for the collection and storage of research specimens
      and samples obtainable by minimal risk for development or validation of novel clinical tools
      and approaches to disease. After completion of the screening process, the subject will either
      be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol, or if no appropriate
      protocol is identified, subjects with blood disorders will have recommendations for other
      treatment options relayed to them and/or to the primary or referring physician.
