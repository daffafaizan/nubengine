    
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective, and longitudinal study of participants with IBD
      (UC or CD) receiving vedolizumab between years 2015 and 2020. The study will determine the
      real-world evidence of vedolizumab, its relationship with TDM, biomarkers of inflammation,
      and its effect on clinical outcomes in a real-world setting.

      This study will enroll approximately 5,500 participants. Participants will be enrolled in 2
      cohorts: TDM Cohort and Historical Cohort. The study will have a retrospective data
      collection of the participants from PSP between the years 2015 and 2020. The study will
      include longitudinal analysis of data collected in a subset of Takeda Canada PSP,
      specifically for those participants on vedolizumab, some of which received biomarker testing
      and TDM at pre-specified intervals during their treatment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Canada. The overall time for data collection in
      the study will be approximately 5 years.
