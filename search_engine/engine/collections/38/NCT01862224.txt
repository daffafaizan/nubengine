    
      This is a randomized (participants assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind
      (participants and study personnel will not know what treatment is being given),
      placebo-controlled (a placebo appears identical to a study drug, but contains no active
      ingredients), parallel-group (treatments will be given to groups of participants at the same
      time) study. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either
      JNJ-38518168 for 52 weeks or receive matching placebo for 12 weeks, followed by JNJ-38518168
      for 40 weeks. The total duration of participation will be approximately 60 weeks for all
      participants, including a screening visit and follow-up visits. Safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-38518168 will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events reported by participants
      throughout the study . In addition, results from clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms, vital signs measurements, and physical examinations performed during the
      study will be monitored.
