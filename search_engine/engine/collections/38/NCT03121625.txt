      unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies.
      Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30, CD7, BCMA, CD123, etc. may be
      potential in developing the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors
      expressing those markers. Investigators have developed a high efficient platform for
      constructing different CARs and preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of
      corresponding target cells. In this study, investigators will evaluate their safety and
      efficacy in patients with different types of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. The
      primary goal is safety assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse
      effects. In addition, tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be
      evaluated.
