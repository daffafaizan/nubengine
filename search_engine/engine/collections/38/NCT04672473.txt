      induce tumor-specific antigen expression. Tumor-specific antigens have strong specificity and
      are ideal therapeutic targets. In this study, tumor-specific antigens were used as
      therapeutic targets. The researchers screened the tumor-specific epitope peptides through
      bioinformatics database combined with in vitro experiments. The peptide-loaded DCs are
      co-cultured with T lymphocytes to induce the proliferation of CTLs, which are then refusion
      to tumor patients to treating diseases.
