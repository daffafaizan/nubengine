      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), regardless of treatment received. Chemotherapy is
      recommended for advanced NSCLC patients in good clinical condition, but it is not clear how
      much benefit is gained from giving chemotherapy to patients in poor general condition
      (performance status 2). This category of patients represents about 20% of all patients at
      initial diagnosis of NSCLC, and remains a treatment challenge for the clinician. There have
      been very few studies that have evaluated the impact of chemotherapy for this group of
      patients, and there is no established standard therapy. Studies evaluating single agent and
      combination two-agent chemotherapy regimens' impact on survival and improving symptoms are
      needed.
