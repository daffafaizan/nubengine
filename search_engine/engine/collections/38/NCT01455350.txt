      treatments to topical lidocaine in women suffering from provoked vestibulodyina. The first
      treatment consists of 10 sixty minutes weekly physiotherapy treatments including relaxation
      techniques, stretching and pelvic floor muscle control exercises. The second treatment is a
      night time application of lidocaine to the vulva for 10 weeks. Physiotherapists will then
      evaluate women's pain and sexual function right after the treatment and 6 months later.
