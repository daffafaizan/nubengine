      of morbidity and mortality.The prognosis of patients with BM is generally poor, with a median
      survival time of 2-6 months. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been advocated as the
      primary treatment for metastatic brain cancer. WBRT injures small cerebral vasculature and
      neuropil,effects linked to imaging-defined white matter changes. However, information on the
      neurocognitive function(NCF) impact of WBRT in BM patients is also limited.This study aims to
      explore and evaluate the impact of NCF in patients with multiple brain metastases receiving
      WBRT.All patients were assessed at each visit for NCF according to the Hopkins Verbal
      Learning Test-Revised(HVLT-R),Mini-Mental Status Examination(MMSE) and Quality Of Life
      measurements(QOL,Questionnaire-QLQC30) .
