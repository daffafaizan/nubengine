    
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of MLD10
      for the prevention of migraine headache. The study population will consist of approximately
      142 male and female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with frequent episodic migraine
      as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders-3beta criteria. Two MLD10
      (243 mg (milligrams) of elemental magnesium) or placebo caplets will be taken twice daily for
      a total daily dose of 486 mg.

      VISIT 1 - SCREENING

      The following will be completed at Visit 1:

        1. Obtain written Informed Consent. The informed consent will be obtained in accordance

           the exclusion criteria.

        3. Obtain demographics (race, ethnicity, sex, date of birth)

        4. Obtain medical, medication, and headache history. Data collected will include medical
           history and diagnoses, age at onset of migraine and other pertinent migraine/headache
           history, history of acute and prophylactic headache medications within the past 30 days,
           and history of other recent/concomitant medications.

           Results of the pregnancy test must be negative to continue in study.

        6. Perform physical and neurological examinations.

        7. Measure vital signs (height, weight, resting heart rate, and blood pressure).

        8. Review Baseline Headache Diary. Subjects will be instructed to complete a daily online
           headache diary. Assessments to be captured are start/stop time, severity, associated
           symptoms, use of rescue medications, and unusual symptoms.
