    
      This is a randomized phase IV controlled trial with two parallel arms: (1) PeriActive rinse
      and (2) Chlorhexidine 0.12% rinse. Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups
      at the time of implant surgery. An alternating 1:1 randomization scheme will be used, with
      the first patient receiving Chlorhexidine, the second patient receiving PeriActive, the third
      patient receiving Chlorhexidine and so forth.

      Implant surgery will require an incision and tissue reflection. Implant(s) will be placed at
      bone level (+/- 2 mm). The abutment placed will be transgingival at least 2 mm above soft
      tissue level. Tissues will be sutured with 6-0 ePTFE (Goretex) sutures, as needed.
      Antibiotics will be prescribed for 7 days following surgery. In addition, at the end of the
      surgical visit, the patient will be issued two bottles of the assigned rinse which will be
      used twice each day.

      Details of Study Visits Screening/Visit 1 - Day 0 Following signing of informed consent form,
      adult male and female subjects aged ≥18 years will be screened for study eligibility by
      assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening procedures will include collection
      of demographic data and medical history. Eligible subjects will then undergo implant surgery,
      and relevant indices will be measured. Subjects will then be instructed in how to rinse with
      the relevant oral rinse and be given two bottles for the remainder of the study.

      Visits 2 and 3 - 2 and 4 weeks (± 3 days) post-surgery, respectively At visit 2, sutures will
      be removed and a light curetting of the sites (as needed) will be performed, followed by
      evaluation for Gingival Index (GI; modified for incision), Plaque Index (PI) and compliance
      with protocol. At visit 3, only clinical indices and compliance with protocol with be
      evaluated.
