      Esophagitis (EoE) and patients with a clinical diagnosis of EoE will be recruited and asked
      to swallow the SECM capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a
      tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses
      down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the esophagus are
      acquired. Images are analyzed at a later stage.
