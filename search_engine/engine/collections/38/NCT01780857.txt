      Specific Aim. To identify transcriptional signatures in the skin and blood of patients with
      palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP).

      II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

      Despite major advances in elucidating the molecular pathways of chronic plaque psoriasis
      (CPP), the immunopathogenesis of PPP, a less common "variant" of psoriasis, remains elusive.
      It is characterized by the development of inflammatory sterile pustules on the palms and
      soles of affected individuals, which can be exceptionally painful, interfering with walking
      and manual activities and impinging significantly on quality of life. Current systemic and
      biologic treatments used to treat CPP have only a moderate effect in patients with PPP,
      supporting the suggestion that PPP is a separate disease entity with a distinct
      immunopathogenic basis. Moreover, the spontaneous paradoxical development of PPP is
      frequently observed in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î± therapies, agents
      typically used in the treatment of CPP. Genetic analysis also distinguishes patients with PPP
      from those with CPP.

      At the investigators' institution, microarray analyses of blood transcriptional patterns have
      permitted crucial advances in characterizing the immunopathogenesis of immune-mediated
      conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosis and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis. The investigators now wish to examine transcriptional profiles in the skin and
      blood of patients with PPP to identify the immunopathogenesis of this condition and identify
      potential therapeutic targets. The investigators will validate the findings at a cellular and
      protein level using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and measuring serum levels of
      proteins in the blood with Luminex or ELISA.
