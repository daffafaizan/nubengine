      diabetes (T2D), and this relation is expected as both conditions share obesity as a common
      risk factor. Despite that several articles have stated that OSA is an independent risk factor
      for abnormal glucose metabolism, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.

      In contrast, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are leaner and younger than patients with
      T2D, so it was expected that OSA might be less common in patients with T1D. However, few
      studies have reported the prevalence of OSA in T1D with a range between 8 and 46%. The
      relationship between OSA and diabetes-related vascular disease is poorly explored in patients
      with T1D. This suggests a mechanism other than obesity may be responsible for OSA in patients
      with T1D. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that (1) OSA is related to CAN rather
      than obesity in patients with T1D. (2) OSA is common in patients with T1D. (3) OSA is
      associated with worse metabolic profile and microvascular complications in T1D. (4) Oxidative
      and nitrosative stress are possible mechanisms relating OSA to T1D complication.
