      considered to be one of the most successful orthopedic surgeries performed. The 8th Annual
      Report from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales reported 95.3% component
      survivorship at 7 years for over 300,000 THA implantations. MicroPort Orthopedics, Inc. (MPO)
      currently markets several THA components throughout the world, including the European Union
      (EU). As part of the process for gaining approval to market in the EU, MPO is conducting this
      post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these THA
      components. The objectives of this study are to evaluate component survivorship and total
      functional outcome scores of implanted subjects at out to 10 years follow-up.
