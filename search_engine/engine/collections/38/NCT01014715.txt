      control rate of 3D-CRT confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity for patients with
      Stage I and IIa (less than or equal to 3 cm) carcinoma of the breast (non-lobular histology)
      treated with APBI using 3D-CRT before lumpectomy. For selected patients with Stage I and II
      breast carcinoma, 3D-CRT delivered to the primary tumor preoperatively is technically
      reproducible with acceptable complication rates. Cosmetic results after partial breast
      irradiation before lumpectomy will be comparable to that obtained after whole breast external
      beam radiation therapy. The local tumor control rate in the breast after partial breast
      irradiation therapy followed by lumpectomy will be comparable to that of conventional
      external beam radiation therapy, with less inconvenience and potentially less cost to the
      patient, given the selection criteria which minimize the risk of clinically significant
      multicentric or extensive residual carcinoma following lumpectomy.
