      greater compliance by patients than is currently the case with positive airway pressure. To
      this end, the investigators recently showed that increased inspired CO2 via rebreathing was
      effective in reducing most obstructive and central apneas in OSA patients. Then, the
      investigator's University of Wisconsin (UW) team of bioengineers, physiologists, and sleep
      physicians built a novel variable dead space rebreathe device-with no added positive
      pressure-which monitors breath by breath ventilation and automatically adjusts the rebreathe
      dead space volume to add or subtract the level of inspired CO2 depending on the degree of
      sleep disordered breathing. This approach provides the minimum effective CO2 dose needed in
      individual OSA patients to stabilize central respiratory motor output and to recruit upper
      airway dilator muscles, thereby treating obstructive and central apneas. The investigators
      propose to determine the effectiveness of this "Smart CO2" treatment as well as its effects
      on sleep state stability, sleep quality, and blood pressure in 10 moderate to severe OSA
      patients studied over several nights. The investigators expect the findings from the proposed
      study to be sufficient to determine if the "Smart CO2" treatment is a viable approach to OSA
      treatment worthy of testing in a clinical trial.
