      patients undergoing surgery. Intraoperative hypothermia is related to postoperative patient
      discomfort, impaired wound healing, increased blood loss, anxiety and disturbances in glucose
      and insulin levels. Prewarming of patients prior to surgery may result in maintenance of
      intraoperative temperature and reduce postoperative complications. We therefore aim to
      investigate the effects of prewarming of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery on
      intraoperative temperature control and blood loss and postoperative patient discomfort and
      glucose and insulin levels.

      Objective of the study:

      Does preoperative heating of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery reduce the
      incidence of intraoperative hypothermia and postoperative comfort and modulate postoperative
      glucose and insulin blood levels?

      Study design:

      Multi-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial.

      Study population:

      Patients undergoing an elective orthopedic hip- or knee replacement
