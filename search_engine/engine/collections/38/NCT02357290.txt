      children and adolescents. Subjects will include youth ages 5-17 years with a bipolar spectrum
      disorder (type I, II, or NOS), mixed, manic, or hypomanic state, according to the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
      Association, 2013). The primary outcome measures will be improvement in manic symptoms as
      measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and improvement in depressive symptoms as
      measured by the Child Depression Rating Scale (CDRS).

      Bipolar diagnoses will be made according to the DSM-5 in a clinical evaluation by a Child
      Psychiatrist and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
      School-Age Children - Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E)(Orvaschel, 1994). All subjects must
      have a YMRS score of at least 15. Only patients who are not responding to their current
      treatment regimen will be tapered from their medications; youth on concomitant psychiatric
      medications will be permitted to continue those medications as listed in the concomitant
      medication section.
