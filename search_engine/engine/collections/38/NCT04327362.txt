      test whether tDCS targeting excitation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can enhance a
      standard course of PE in a sample of adult civilians and Veterans (ages 18-65) who meet full
      DSM-5 criteria for chronic PTSD (i.e., > 3 months post-trauma; N = 20). All participants will
      receive a total of ten 60-min. sessions of manualized PE, preceded by 20 min. of either
      active or sham HD-tDCS. The stepped-wedge multiple baseline design features tDCS as a 2-level
      within-subject factor (Sham tDCS+PE vs. Active tDCS+PE), and between-subject comparisons
      based on stratified random assignment to cross-over from sham to active tDCS just prior to
      sessions 4 through 8. Strata will be defined by dichotomous classifications of possible
      confounds, including baseline severity (moderate vs. severe), psychotropic medication status
      (no vs. yes), and sex (female vs. male). The sample will consist of treatment-seeking
      civilian and Veteran participants referred by either of two of our consortium sites,
      including the National Crime Victim's Research and Treatment Center (NCVC) at MUSC, or the
      PTSD Clinical Team (PCT) at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, as well as community participants who
      respond to study advertisements.
