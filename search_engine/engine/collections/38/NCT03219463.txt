      Take a 3g supplement of ginger in powder form with meals once/day (preferably in the morning)

      test for mid-intervention CRP, IL-6, and TNF-Î± values. By end of week 8, participants will do
      a final blood test for CRP values and fill out the SF-36 survey for post-intervention levels.
