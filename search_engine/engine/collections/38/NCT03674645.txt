    
      The purpose of the present study is to test and optimize, on healthy subjects, specific MRI
      acquisition sequences firstly developed in a preclinical phase on phantoms (inert objects
      containing solutions or gels) and animal (Pig, sheep). This study will allow the
      investigators to define practical acquisition parameters that will allow reproducible results
      and precise definition of clinically relevant examination protocols for each new developed
      sequence.
