    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of dasatinib in combination with
      oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (5FU) (modified version 6 regimen of leucovorin, fluorouracil
      and oxaliplatin [mFOLFOX6]) with or without bevacizumab in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer, defined as the lowest intermittent dose of dasatinib that affects serum
      biomarkers of OCT2 without influencing the pharmacokinetic properties of oxaliplatin.

      II. To determine the toxicity profile (based on Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
      [CIPN]20 and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 5.0) of
      dasatinib in combination with oxaliplatin/5-FU/bevacizumab in patients with colorectal
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the influence of dasatinib on the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin and vice
      versa in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, leucovorin IV over 2 hours,
      fluorouracil slow IV push over 2-4 minutes followed by continuous infusion over 46 hours on
      days 1 and 15. Patients also receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 14, 15,
      and 28 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 2. Patients may receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to cycle 3 day 1 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
