      investigator will be aware of treatment assignment during the study. This protocol is
      designed to address the hypothesis that oral testosterone enanthate plus dutasteride can
      suppress the secretion of LH and FSH after four weeks of administration. In addition, we will
      compare the gonadotropin suppression mediated by a dose of testosterone enanthate (400 mg
      twice daily) that would be expected to maintain the serum testosterone in the normal range
      throughout the day, with the same dose (800 mg once daily) administered once daily. This
      larger once-daily dose is expected to result in a higher peak and lower trough by the end of
      the dosing interval. Secondary endpoints in this study include the ability of oral
      testosterone enanthate plus dutasteride to maintain short-term androgen-mediated endpoints
      such as mood and sexual function over the 4-week treatment period as well as weekly measures
      of safety, including blood counts, PSA and liver and kidney function.
