      hemodialysis under the diagnosis of end stage renal disease. The subjects were divided into
      the treatment group and the control group through random assignment under the condition of
      receiving hemodialysis steadily and followed up for 6 months. After randomization, the
      treatment group received beraprost sodium (Berasil) for 6 months (24 weeks) and beraprost
      sodium will be provided by Astellas Pharma Korea, Inc. Patients were randomly assigned within
      2 days after successful arteriovenous graft surgery, and the treatment group started taking
      120 mcg of Berasil, while the control group did not take placebo to replace beraprost sodium.
