    
      All participants complete 3 data collection visits following an over-the-phone eligibility
      screening call (baseline, week 8, and week 12). Participants will be randomized into either
      the control group or the intervention group at the baseline visit.

      All participants will receive 8 weekly credits for groceries and will be given equipment for
      monitoring their BP at home. Study staff will help participants place their grocery orders
      each week, and will collect readings from the home BP monitoring equipment at the same time.
      This data will be used to understand whether the intervention is effective for controlling
      BP.

      All participants will be encouraged to maintain their regular levels of physical activity and
      receive treatment as usual from their healthcare providers.

      The control group participants will receive an American Heart Association printed brochure
      about the health benefits of a low-salt diet. All foods will be available to purchase,
      including those that do not meet the DASH diet guidelines.

      The intervention group participants will receive 1 hour of nutritional counseling over the
      phone and a personalized prescription for the low-salt DASH diet based on estimated calorie
      needs at baseline, followed by weekly 20-minute phone calls in weeks 1-8 to provide extra
      support.

      The intervention group's food choices will be limited to fresh produce and a pre-determined
      list of other foods included in the DASH diet. During weekly phone calls, the dietitian will
      use a structured phone curriculum to discuss in more detail a different component of the DASH
      diet, followed by goal setting related to that component. Through small goal setting each
      week, participants will receive ongoing support to improve full adherence to the DASH diet by
      the end of week 8.
