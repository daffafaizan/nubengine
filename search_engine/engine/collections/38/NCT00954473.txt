    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Conduct a large-scale candidate gene association study in osteosarcoma (OS) using cases
      from the national Children's Oncology Group (COG) OS biology study (P9851 and successor study
      AOST06B1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OS. II. Fine-map genomic regions
      associated with OS to identify putative functional loci.

      III. Conduct whole-exome sequencing of germline OS deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples.

      IV. Investigate the functional implications of promising genetic variants associated with OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Blood samples undergo polymorphism analysis of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
      haplotypes to examine genetic variation, gene-gene interactions, and the population
      structure.
