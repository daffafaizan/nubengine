      around nerves. NF is a lifelong condition that affects all populations equally, regardless of
      gender or ethnicity. Neurofibromatosis has been classified into three distinct types: NF1,
      NF2, and schwannomatosis. The hallmark tumors seen in NF2 are vestibular schwannomas,
      formerly known as acoustic neuromas. Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors made up of
      abnormal Schwann cells, which are the cells that give the nerves the lining and insulation
      needed to conduct information. Vestibular schwannomas can cause hearing loss in one or both
      ears, depending on whether the tumors are unilateral or bilateral.

      Schwannomatosis is the same type of tumor as that of NF2 patients. Tumors are all related to
      Schwann cells. There is no cure for NF or schwannomatosis. Surgery is the only clinical
      method at present, and no drugs have been proved to be effective in the treatment of these
      tumors.

      Adoptive immunotherapy based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific antigens has
      proven to be effective. In vitro induction of tumor antigen-specific immune cells and
      engineering of target specific immune cells have great potential for cancer eradication. If
      CAR-T/CTL immunotherapy is effective, it is expected that Neurofibromatosis or
      Schwannomatosis tumors should shrink or disappear completely. However, the minimal residual
      tumor cells or cancer stem cells may exist and cause relapse to other tissues and organs.
      Follow-up immunotherapy must focus on enhancing the anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, this
      protocol includes follow-up application of DCvac to prevent recurrence. This study proposes a
      novel protocol of immunotherapy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of targeting tumor
      antigens in patients.
