      hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol levels). Subjects were randomized into one of
      two groups: (1) Cottonseed oil (CSO), (2) Olive oil (OO). The interventions consist of
      identical foods that are only different in the respective oil they are prepared with.

      There was a screening visit and 3 testing visits: Baseline (visit 2), mid-visit at week 4
      (visit 6), and post-visit at week 8 (visit 10). Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and a
      fasting blood sample were collected at each visit. At visits 2 and 10 participants
      participated in a saturated fatty acid meal challenge in which additional blood and
      metabolism measurements were collected. Visits 3-9 represent weekly meal pickups, with the
      exception of visit 6 which is also a testing visit.

      Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesized that enrichment of the diet with CSO would result in
      significantly greater improvements in blood lipids, metabolism, and appetite compared to the
      OO group.
