      galantamine demonstrated positive results on thinking, functioning, behavior, speech and
      overall well being of patients, and prevented the behavior symptoms of dementia from
      appearing. This combined study consists of two almost identical 26-week studies that examine
      the same criteria as the previous study, but in a larger patient population (dementia has
      been identified as having been caused by blood vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease).
      The study starts with a 4-week period in which current medications for dementia are withdrawn
      followed by a 26-week double-blind treatment period when patients will receive either placebo
      or galantamine 8 milligrams or 12 milligrams twice a day. Effectiveness will be measured by
      changes in scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's
      Disease Cooperative Study Scale, the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus,
      and the neuropsychiatric inventory, as well as (in English-speaking countries only) a
      10-minute interview of the patient (EXIT-25 scale). Safety will be evaluated throughout the
      study based on the incidence and severity of unexpected events, laboratory and physical
      tests, and vital signs. The hypothesis of the study is that galantamine will improve
      thinking, function, behavior, speech, and overall well being, better than placebo. A
      voluntary pharmacogenomic study will be incorporated into the study plan to evaluate whether
      specific genes are related to the dementia or drug response. 8 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day
      for 8 weeks, then increasing to12 mg, if tolerated. After 12 weeks dose can be reduced to 8
      mg or matching placebo
