      a role in prevention of the recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

      The patients who are suffering from high-risk NMIBC will be randomly allocated into two
      groups: The first group (n-3 PUFAs group): 55 patients will receive omega-3 plus (1200 mg)
      orally, twice a day for at least 12 months. The treatment will start after transurethral
      resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), as soon as the histopathology will be obtained. The
      treatment will be discontinued if recurrence develops, unacceptable or serious adverse events
      occur or according to the patients' request. The second group (Control group): 55 patients
      will receive placebo twice daily for one year after TURBT. Patients and care providers will
      be blinded to the medication given.

      All patients will receive intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) immunotherapy and they
      will be followed up for two years.

      The chemopreventive effect of n-3 PUFAs on the recurrence of NMIBC after TURBT will be
      studied via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inpatient cystoscopy, histopathological
      examination and molecular studies of the resected bladder tissues.
