      and residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a substantial risk of relapse. The
      clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade (CPS-EG)1 combining clinical stage before
      neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and
      estrogen-receptor status can be used to identify these high-risk patients. The CPS-EG score
      was additionally validated in 2454 patients with HRpositive/ HER2-normal tumors from the
      German neoadjuvant studies' metadatabase. Patients who had a score of 3 or higher or Score 2
      and ypN+ disease show a 3-years iDFS of 77% despite adequate local therapy and adjuvant
      endocrine treatment. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK), a group of serine/threonine kinases,
      play a key role in regulating cell cycle progression by interacting with specific cyclin
      proteins in luminal-type tumors.2,3 PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral, highly selective
      inhibitor of CDK4/6 kinase activity that prevents cellular DNA synthesis by prohibiting
      progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase through blocking retinoblastoma (Rb)
      phosphorylation.4 Preclinical studies identified luminal ER subtype, elevated expression of
      cyclin D1 and Rb protein, and reduced p16 expression as being associated with sensitivity to
      palbociclib.
