    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) in the prevention
           of ocular graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation for hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure disorders.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate the Ocular Surface Disease Index with clinical ophthalmologic examination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age, type of
      transplant (related vs unrelated), and intensity of transplant (ablative vs other). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) drops in each eye
           twice daily for up to 1 year after transplant.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo ophthalmic drops in each eye twice daily for up to 1
           year after transplant.

      Patients in both arms may also receive artificial tear drops at least twice daily as
      clinically necessary.
