    
      This was a Phase 4, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in male and female subjects
      aged 18 years or older with clinically diagnosed AK lesions, conducted at 31 investigational
      sites in the United States.

      This study assessed the safety of imiquimod as a treatment for AK applied in doses ranging
      from one packet 12.5 mg) to 6 packets (75 mg) to either single or multiple body regions for
      up to 3 cycles, depending upon treatment success and AK lesion recurrence. Eligible subjects
      applied imiquimod 5% cream prior to normal sleeping hours 2 days per week to at least 4
      clinically typical, visible, discrete, nonhypertrophic AK lesions in contiguous or
      noncontiguous treatment areas totaling greater than 25 cm2 at baseline. Multiple treatment
      areas could be exposed (i.e., head, torso and/or extremities), with the number of packets
      determined by the investigator but not to exceed one packet for each 25 cm2 treatment area,
      up to a maximum of 6 packets per dose. In each treatment cycle, dosing was to continue for 16
      weeks (approximately 4 months), as instructed by the investigator, followed by a 2-month,
      treatment-free follow-up period.
