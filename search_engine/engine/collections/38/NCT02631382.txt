      pain conditions, patients are usually asking for alternative options, especially local
      traditional and therapies including wet cupping, to replace the long-term use of painkillers.
      The majority of the wet cupping trials conducted abroad used different techniques, which is
      different from our local traditional wet cupping technique. This study can identify the
      technique that is more efficacious in reducing pain, prolonging the pain relieve period, and
      decrease patient dependence on painkillers in chronic low back pain.The aim of this study is
      to compare the effectiveness and safety of double (traditional) versus single (Asian) cupping
      techniques in chronic low back pain. This a randomized comparative effectiveness pilot
      clinical trial. After taking written informed consent, patient with chronic low back pain
      will be randomized into two groups, one group to receive wet cupping therapy with the
      Traditional double technique, the other group to receive it with the Asian single technique.
      Numeric Rating Scale, Present Pain Intensity and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire will be
      used to measure the outcome before and after the intervention, one week after the
      intervention, then two weeks after. Wilcoxon rank sum test for the continuous dependent data
      analysis and the analysis of covariance ANCOVA, to compare both groups mean scores will be
      used. The outcome baseline for each score will be used as the covariate. Chi square or
      Fisher's exact test will be used to compare categorical data with Minimal Clinical
      Improvement Difference within and between the two groups.
