      to real-time continuous glucose sensor readings. Our studies to date have assessed the safety
      and efficacy of closed-loop insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes in a controlled
      setting. For patients with type 2 diabetes treated by diet or non-insulin glucose-lowering
      medications alone, an episode of acute illness may result in elevated glucose levels
      necessitating initiation of insulin replacement therapy to optimise glycaemic control.
      Insulin may also be required in patients with no prior history of diabetes, presenting with
      'stress hyperglycaemia'. Closed-loop systems may be of benefit in such insulin-naive patients
      in whom the optimal dosing regimen is difficult to establish, and may provide a safer method
      of insulin delivery with the added benefit of continuous monitoring of glucose levels on
      general hospital wards, thus minimising the likelihood of hyper- and hypoglycaemic events and
      their known associated worse outcomes.

      The study has an open-label, randomised, two-period crossover design. Participants will be
      randomised to undergo two 24-hour studies in a clinical research facility, during which
      glucose levels will be controlled by either the computer-based closed-loop algorithm
      (intervention) or by patients' usual non-insulin glucose-lowering diabetes treatment regimen
      (control). A continuous glucose sensor will be inserted on arrival for each visit.
      Participants will consume regular meals (matched on both visits) and carry out daily
      activities mimicking those occurring in an inpatient setting. Stable glucose isotopes will be
      administered on the two study occasions to collect data for modeling of glucose turnover
      around meals and during the overnight period.
