      risk of gastric aspiration, we are used to forbid to eat and to drink during labour.

      However, this behaviour is controversial and some studies have shown that clear liquid intake
      can be safe during labour. Informations from a bedside ultrasound examination of the stomach
      content may be a useful tool to balance benefits and risks of such attitude. This technique
      has recently been shown very promising in pregnant women for the assessment of the gastric
      volume.
