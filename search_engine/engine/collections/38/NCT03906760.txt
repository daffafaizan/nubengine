      orifices extension in bladder endometriosis./ MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review
      board approval for this study was obtained and waived written informed consent. The MR images
      of 39 patients operated for bladder endometriosis over a 6 years period in 3 university Lyon
      hospitals were reviewed. Two experienced readers reported the vesical repletion volume, the
      largest lesion size, the location and extension of the lesion within the bladder wall, the
      distance between the ureteral orifices and the lesion when the vesicovaginal wall was
      involved, the presence of muco-sub mucosal complex edema and the association with external
      adenomyosis. MR images were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Efficacy
      parameters were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI).
