      injections were applied from the right abdominal region using ShotBlockerÂ®, left abdominal
      region with an ice pack, and lower abdominal region without any additional application,
      respectively. All the injection sites were circled using a skin marking pen (r = 5 cm).

      All the injections were administered following a standard procedure. Pain and satisfaction
      were assessed immediately after the injection by using the VAS score. Ecchymosis was assessed
      with an ecchymosis measurement tool at 48 and 60 hours after the injection (Figure 3).
