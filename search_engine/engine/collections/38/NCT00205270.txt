      Although pre-transplant immunization is routinely recommended, this recommendation is based
      on little data. The primary objective of this study is to compare antibody responses in lung
      transplant patients who receive influenza vaccine before transplant, within the first six
      months of transplant, between 13 and 60 months post-transplant, and 110 months or beyond
      transplant.

      This prospective cohort study is to include immunization events performed over five years to
      measure H1N1, H3N2, and B antibody responses to the influenza vaccine in pre- and post-lung
      transplant patients. The pre-transplant patients will move to the post-transplant group as
      the study progressed. Similarly, participants are allowed to move to the next
      time-since-transplant group as time elapsed.

      Serum was collected from participants prior to and two-four weeks following trivalent
      inactivated influenza immunization for each season.

      Geometric mean titers, seroprotection (antibody titer at least 1:40), seroconversion
      (fourfold increase between pre and post), and mean fold increases will be compared.
