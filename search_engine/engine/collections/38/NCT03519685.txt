      have limited knowledge of contraception or their pregnancy risks. They have little
      familiarity with the full range of contraceptives, particularly long-acting reversible
      contraception (LARC) including the IUD and implant. This campus-level, multiple component
      intervention provides evidence-based contraceptive training and education to clinic staff and
      students in this age group attending community colleges in California and Texas.
