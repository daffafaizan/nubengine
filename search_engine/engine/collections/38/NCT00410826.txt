    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the complete response rate in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer,
      treated with cisplatin, radiotherapy and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) versus cisplatin
      and radiotherapy alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether the addition of erlotinib increases the acute and long term toxicities of
      cisplatin and radiotherapy, in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.

      II. Compare the disease-free and overall survivals of patients with locally advanced head and
      neck cancer treated with cisplatin and radiotherapy, with and without erlotinib.

      III. Evaluate whether the symptomatic improvement observed in the first week of erlotinib
      alone predicts for complete response and long term disease control.

      IV. Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p16 and excision repair
      cross-complementing 1 (ERCC-1) expression with response outcome to therapy with cisplatin and
      radiation with and without erlotinib.

      V. Identify other molecular correlates that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of squamous
      cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) or response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 22, and 43 and undergo
      3-dimensional conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week, on
      days 1-47. Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      -7 to 47.

      ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin and undergo radiotherapy as in Arm I.

      Within 10-14 weeks after completion of study treatment, patients with N2 or N3 disease at the
      time of screening undergo a neck dissection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
