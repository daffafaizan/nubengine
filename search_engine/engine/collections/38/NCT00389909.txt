      breathe. For a given dose, the fluctuations in concentrations of drug observed in infants'
      blood might be wide, leading to a risk of lack of efficacy of the treatment or of toxic
      effects. Two factors are linked to these fluctuations: age and gender. The aim of our study
      is to compare a dosage regimen based only on patient's weight, and another one using a dosing
      chart taking into account not only weight but also age and gender to prescribe the initial
      dose of doxapram. The final goal of this trial is to improve efficacy and tolerance of
      doxapram by minimizing the fluctuations in blood drug levels in premature neonates.
