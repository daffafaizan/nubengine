    
      Fludarabine and clofarabine are nucleoside analogs with potent antitumor and
      immunosuppressive properties used in conditioning regimens of pediatric allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) to promote stem cell engraftment.

      This is a single-center, prospective, non-interventional pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      investigating the clinical pharmacology of combination nucleoside analogue therapy in 24
      children undergoing alloHCT at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.

      Patients would receive clofarabine and fludarabine regardless of whether or not they decide
      to consent to PK sampling.

      Clofarabine and fludarabine doses will not be adjusted based on PK data.

      The investigators will apply the combination of a limited sampling strategy and population PK
      methodologies to determine specific factors influencing clofarabine and fludarabine exposure
      in pediatric alloHCT recipients and identify exposure-response relationships.

      Subjects will undergo PK sampling of clofarabine and fludarabine drug concentrations over the
      duration of combination therapy (3 to 5 days).

      To evaluate sources of variability impacting clofarabine and fludarabine exposure clinical
      data will be obtained from the patient's medical chart on each day of PK sampling.

      To assess exposure-response relationships neutrophil engraftment, treatment-related toxicity,
      and survival data will be collected through day 100 post-transplant.
