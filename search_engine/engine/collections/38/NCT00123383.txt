      narcolepsy. Preliminary studies have suggested that modafinil may have value in the treatment
      of psychostimulant dependence through positive effects on mood, sleep patterns,
      concentration, fatigue and drug craving. It appears to be well tolerated with a low abuse
      liability. Thirty dependent cocaine users will be randomised to 2 equal groups. The
      experimental group will receive modafinil 200 mg/day for 10 weeks and a tailored cognitive
      behavioural therapy program. The control group will receive placebo under equivalent
      conditions. Primary outcome will be a between group comparison of cocaine negative urine
      samples collected over the 10 week study period. Adverse events, side effects, compliance,
      retention, self reported health, psychosocial and drug use outcomes will also be compared
      between the groups.
