      primary non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by
      paclitaxel OR cisplatin and vinorelbine followed by docetaxel. II. Evaluate the response
      (confirmed plus unconfirmed) and toxicities associated with these two regimens in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 followed by gemcitabine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Following the
      3 courses of carboplatin and gemcitabine, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day
      1 every 21 days for 3 courses. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1 followed by vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 3 courses. Following the 3 courses of cisplatin and vinorelbine, patients receive
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients receive no further
      treatment until evidence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months for the
      first year, every 6 months for years 2 and 3, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients will be accrued for this study.
