      restrictions below the prosthetic socket. As a result, the functional benefits provided by
      the long residual limb are mitigated by prosthetic design limitations. Recently,
      high-profile, posteriorly-attaching crossover feet have been modified for use with people who
      have Syme's amputation. Crossover feet theoretically improve motion and energy
      storage-and-return compared to traditional foot options for the Syme's level. Crossover feet
      also have the potential to broaden the range of high-impact activities that can be performed
      with a single prosthesis. However, to date there is no empirical evidence that compares
      functional differences when walking with high-profile crossover feet compared to low-profile
      feet for people with Syme's amputation. This mixed-method pilot research will use a
      randomized, controlled within-participants design. Investigators will assess gait
      biomechanics, self-reported health outcomes, and qualitative interviews to compare relative
      advantages and disadvantages of traditional low-profile Syme's feet and high-profile
      crossover feet. This proposed work will create a foundation for future research that examines
      the potential benefits of crossover feet in people with Syme's amputation. In addition,
      results from this research will be used clinically to inform prosthetic options for people
      with limited clearance for distally-attached prosthetic feet.
