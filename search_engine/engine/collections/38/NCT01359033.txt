      between countries, due to the scarce availability of nationwide coronary heart disease data.
      The demographics and medical expenditure percentage are comparable in the United Kingdom and
      Sweden; however, the in-hospital case-fatality rates within 30 days after admission for acute
      myocardial infarction was greater in the UK than Sweden (6.3% versus 2.9%)(OECD, 2009). To
      investigate the discrepancy, the current study aims to compare the mortality risk differences
      and associated explanatory factors between the two countries. Results of the study can
      contribute to myocardial infarction care implementation in the UK and Sweden.

      The UK Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP)and Register of Information and
      Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions (RIKS-HIA) are few quality national
      registries currently available for acute coronary syndrome. Using data from the MINAP and
      RIKS-HIA, we propose to investigate (1)the survival trajectories for a reference patient with
      myocardial infarction and (2) hospital variability in myocardial infarction mortality rate in
      the UK and Sweden, adjusted for important patient-level and hospital-level covariates.
