      drainage, most often for few days (2 to 5 days) until fluid quantity is lower than 50 mL /
      24h.

      Pleural effusion may cause pulmonary congestion, atelectasis, hypoventilation, lower efficacy
      of diaphragmatic curse, lower pulmonary reexpansion and vicious attitude.

      Respiratory physiotherapy in such situations has different aims : pulmonary decongestion and
      reexpansion, aid for drainage and pleural fluid reduction, avoiding complications and
      preventing vicious attitudes.

      These aims are learned in Physiotherapy formation institutes. The forced expiration technic
      in ipsilateral decubitus is justified by pleural physiology and is used after pediatric
      surgery without any scientific evidence regarding his efficacy Using pulmonary physiotherapy
      after pulmonary, mediastinal or pleural surgery for children is not systematic and depends on
      prescriber without any professional recommendation.

      Actually no scientific evidence regarding technical or postural indicates improvement of
      effusion drainage.

      It seems to be necessary to validate efficiency of such a technic and evaluate its
      consequences on post-operative pain. Furthermore, this pleural drainage impacts directly the
      duration of hospitalization and paramedical workload
