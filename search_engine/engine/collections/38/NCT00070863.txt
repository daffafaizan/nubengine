      exclusively in groups. However, the efficacy of such treatments relative to no treatment has
      not been thoroughly evaluated. Evidence suggests that individual treatments may be more
      effective than group treatments. This study will combine motivational enhancement therapy
      with cognitive and behavior change techniques to treat men who abuse their partners.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, an individual cognitive behavior
      therapy (ICBT) manual will be constructed. During Phase 2, participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either 16 sessions of ICBT or 16 sessions of standard group therapy. Data
      on abusive behavior outcomes and secondary treatment targets will be collected from
      participants and their partners every 3 months for 1 year after the study.
