      of a social incentive-based gamification intervention to increase physical activity relative
      to a control arm among adults with stroke. All participants will use a Fitbit wearable device
      to establish a baseline step count, select a step goal increase of 33% to 50% above their
      baseline and then participate in an 8 week intervention. The gamification arm will be entered
      into a game with points and levels designed using insights from behavioral economics. They
      will be asked to select a social support partner who will receive weekly updates on their
      progress in the game.
