      pipeline including an improved blood-based test for identification of men with increased risk
      of prostate cancer and use of MRI to select men for diagnostic workup with targeted prostate
      biopsies. The aim is to increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer
      without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers.

      The primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies, the number of performed MRI and
      the number of detected high-risk prostate cancers. Secondary endpoints include the number of
      low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded
      disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the
      health economic consequences and development of automated image-analysis.

      The STHLM3-MR project is performed in two separate phases, analyzed separately. STHLM3-MR
      Phase 1 closed inclusion 2017-06-01. All participants underwent target and systematic
      biopsies together with STHLM3 test analysis. The study is constitutes a current practice
      cohort and levels of the STHLM3 test were not used for selecting participants.

      STHLM3-MR Phase 2 is a study comparing traditional prostate cancer detection using PSA and
      systematic biopsies with the improved pipeline for prostate cancer detection using the STHLM3
      test and targeted biopsies in a screening context.
