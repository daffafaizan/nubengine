      vasoreactivity of myometrial arteries. This will be novel information regarding pregnancy at
      altitude and of significance not just for women and families in Colorado, but also at
      high-altitude locations throughout the world. If altered MA vasoreactivity is found, further
      studies may be able to link these changes to the increased rates of PreE and IUGR at altitude
      and contribute to the understanding of these two disorders.

      The Investigators will also determine whether the chronic hypoxia of high altitude alters DNA
      methylation patterns and expression of key genes involved in metabolic homeostasis in
      maternal, placental and fetal cells and, in turn, the relationship of these changes to fetal
      growth and maternal well-being.
