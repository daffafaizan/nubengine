    
      A Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate TLC388 monotherapy in
      patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC. The study consisted of a
      Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment Follow-Up Period for PFS
      and OS.

      Patients were to be recruited at two stages. Stage I recruited 15 evaluable patients, who had
      completed at least 2 cycles of treatment with one tumor assessment. If â‰¤ 5 patients did not
      develop PD at the end of cycle 6 per RECIST, no patients were to be recruited for Stage II
      and the study was to be closed. If > 5 patients did not develop PD at the end of cycle 6, a
      total of 40 evaluable patients (additional 25 evaluable patients for Stage II) were to be
      recruited thereafter.
