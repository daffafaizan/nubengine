      necessarily an exercise-induced bronchoconstriction during swimming and the use of a
      bronchodilator will be unnecessary. Chlorine-derivatives exposure may be responsible for a
      weakness of the epithelium layer but warm and humid atmosphere of the swimming-pools may be
      protective for the development of a bronchoconstriction. Thus we also hypothesis that during
      a field test outside the swimming pool, swimmers will develop an exercise-induced asthma, and
      will need to take a bronchodilator in prevention.
