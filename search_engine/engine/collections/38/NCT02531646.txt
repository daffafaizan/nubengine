    
      The acquisition system will consist of using site equipment including the CARESTREAM
      DRX-Evolution x-ray system, and the predicate CARESTREAM DRX Plus detector and the
      investigational DE-DT application.

      DE Study Design Thirty to forty (30-40) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest
      exam using the DRX Plus detector and a DE exam. Each DE patient exam includes high energy and
      low energy image exposures using the investigational device. These images are used by the DE
      console software to generate additional DE images (e.g. bone and soft tissue).

      DT Study Design Fifteen to twenty (15-20) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest
      exam using the DRX Plus detector, and a DT exam. Each DT patient exam includes a scout image
      (chest PA) and a DT scan using the investigational DT SW. The DT scan is used by the DT
      console software to generate tomographic images.

      11 phantoms of various anatomy will be imaged with linear tomography (LT) as predicate and DT
      for investigational.
