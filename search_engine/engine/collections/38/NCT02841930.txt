      quality health care for NYC resident immigrants who do not qualify for public insurance with
      incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Our goal in piloting the program
      and conducting the research study is to understand the following questions:

        -  For clients participating in the ActionHealthNYC program, do they report having easier
           access to health care?

        -  What are the differences in health care utilization for participants in the
           ActionHealthNYC program and those not in the program?

        -  Do the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program report fewer barriers to needed care
           when compared to those not in the program?

        -  Are the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program more likely to have received
           preventive services according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force
           (USPTF) or recommended services for those with a qualifying condition through their
           medical home?

        -  How does the likelihood of receiving a new diagnosis compare between the ActionHealthNYC
           member group and the study group?

        -  How does emergency department and hospital use compare between the ActionHealthNYC
           member group and the study group?

      We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we will be enrolling 2,400
      people that meet the eligibility criteria and randomizing half into the ActionHealth NYC
      program. We will be employing a mixed methods approach to address differences between
      participants randomized to receive enhanced services through ActionHealthNYC (AHNYC) and
      those receiving usual care, utilizing surveys, secondary data analysis, key informant
      interviews and participant focus groups.
