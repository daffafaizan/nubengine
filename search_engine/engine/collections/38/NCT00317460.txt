      support along with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP) maintenance to opioid dependent patients
      receiving their care in an HIV clinical care setting. The proposed study will compare
      Physician Management (PM), a manual-guided brief intervention that approximates the usual
      counseling provided by primary care practitioners to patients with chronic medical conditions
      vs. an enhanced strategy of PM with the addition of a combined drug counseling and adherence
      management strategy (PM+DC/AM). DC is designed to educate the patient about the recovery
      process and provide additional advice about lifestyle changes including HIV transmission risk
      reduction and 12-step participation. Adherence Management (AM) is a counseling strategy
      focusing on HIV medication adherence, adapted from Sorensen et al1. This research will build
      on pilot work that is being completed in order to further develop and refine these counseling
      interventions, determine what other psychosocial interventions might be required, and to
      evaluate this model of integrated care in terms of its effects on opioid agonist therapy
      retention, decreasing illicit drug use, and increasing adherence to highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Finally, it will provide data that will aid in the
      formulation of guidelines and the creation of practical manuals for optimizing the provision
      of this novel therapy to individuals with HIV disease and opioid dependence, as well as
      provide data for future funded randomized clinical trials.

      From September 2005 (start date) to December 1, 2007, the study was conducted as part of a
      multi-site project that was overseen by the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM), which is in
      charge of data analysis. Following December 1, 2007, the study will continue as a local,
      single-site project without further collaboration from NYAM.
