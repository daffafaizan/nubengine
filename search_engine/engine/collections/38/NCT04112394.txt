      standard for the treatment of symptomatic gallbladder diseases. Although it is considered as
      minimally invasive surgery, pain in the early postoperative period is still meaningful.
      Proper pain control is essential for optimizing clinical outcomes and earlier ambulation
      after surgery. Traditional pain management with opioids provide good pain control, however,
      have undesirable side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression.
      Multimodal analgesia strategies with different classes of analgesics or local anesthetics may
      enhance pain relief and reduce side effects after surgery. The ESP a newer regional nerve
      blockade, has been used as part of a multimodal strategy to optimize postoperative pain
      control. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ESP block on
      postoperative recovery quality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with
      QoR-40 recovery questionnaire. Secondary aim is to assess the effect of ESP block on
      postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting.

      Study hypothesize is that patients who receive an ESP block in addition to the current
      standard of care, consisting of parenteral opioids and paracetamol, will have a clinically
      significant improvement in their QoR-40 at postoperative day 1 and lower pain levels, as
      measured by NRS in comparison to those patients who receive the current standard of care
      along.
