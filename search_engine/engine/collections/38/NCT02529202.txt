      in newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH)
      for moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In newborns with HIE, TH for 72
      hours is the standard therapy to mitigate brain damage. Most HIE patients receive mechanical
      ventilation during TH and are thus sedated with morphine. Unfortunately, morphine has
      negative side effects and does not specifically prevent shivering. Prevention of shivering is
      critical to success of TH, as shivering negates cooling. DEX is a particularly promising
      alternative sedative because it does prevent shivering and is already used in NICUs for
      sedation and pain management. In newborns, DEX PK data in the setting of TH is not available
      and needs to be determined to properly dose DEX for HIE patients.
