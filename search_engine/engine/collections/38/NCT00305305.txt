      understand the problems faced by individuals with these disorders as well as their causes. In
      the future, we hope to develop therapies that are geared specifically for individuals based
      on the underlying biology. To participate in the study, you will be asked to provide a copy
      of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documenting Agenesis Corpus Callosum (ACC),
      Polymicrogyria (PMG), or Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), clinical information, and blood
      samples from the affected individual and from the parents. Please see contact information and
      our webpage below.
