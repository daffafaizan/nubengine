    
      13 years old, a female patient was diagnosed with Calfan syndrome one year ago. Only 11
      patients have been identified in the literature. Its phenotype is characterized by recurrent
      episodes of liver failure and hepatic fibrosis in early childhood. Our patient had
      neurological symptoms that were gait disturbances, ataxia and tremor, as well as peripheral
      neuropathy and cognitive impairment. Also, musculoskeletal problems such as scoliosis, hip
      dysplasia, osteoporosis, thoracic kyphosis, and increased lordosis were observed.
