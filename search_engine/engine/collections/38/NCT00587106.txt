      cancer, a known paraneoplastic syndrome, or neurological problems that suggest a
      paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare conditions in which the immune
      system is involved in causing brain damage and fighting cancer.

      Such patients with paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations(PNDs) may have autoantibodies, an
      antibody or protein the immune system creates that is directed against his or her own
      proteins. This study aims to better understand PNDS by:

        -  analyzing for autoantibodies in serum and cerebral spinal fluid

        -  analyzing for antigen specificity and for antigens in cancer tissue

        -  comparing PND autoantibodies with those in cancer patients but no PND

        -  comparing PND autoantibodies with those in PND patients but no cancer

        -  studying the immune performance of patients with PNDs

      As this study is not a treatment study, tissues for this study will only come from procedures
      necessary for the patient's treatment.
