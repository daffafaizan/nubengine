    
      Key Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Subject must have the Image Ready System as their initial (de novo) pacing system
           implant.

        2. Subject has a Class I or II indication for implantation of a pacemaker according to the
           CSPE guidelines.

        3. Subject is able and willing to undergo an MR scan.•

        4. Subject is willing and capable of providing informed consent and participating in all
           testing/ visits associated with this clinical study at the intervals defined by this
           protocol.

        5. Subject is age 18 or above.

      Key Exclusion Criteria

        1. Subject has or has had any pacing or ICD system implants.

        2. Subject has any implants or devices that are not suitable for MR scan.

        3. Subject is enrolled in any other concurrent study that might interfere with this study.

        4. Subject has documented life expectancy of less than 12 months.

        5. Women of childbearing potential who are or might be pregnant at the time of this study.

      Primary Safety Endpoint:

      MR Scan related Complication Free Rate Analyzed at MRI Visit +1 Month.

      Primary efficacy Endpoint:

        1. Pacing Threshold (at 0.5 ms pulse width) comparison pre and 1 Month post MR Scan: pacing
           threshold increase ≤ 0.5 V after scan.

        2. Sensed Amplitude comparison pre- and 1 Month post-MR Scan: sensed amplitude: ≥ 1.0 mV
           after scan, and ≥ 50% of that before scan.
