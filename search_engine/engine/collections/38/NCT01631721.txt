      negative consequences of sexual risk behavior. Despite the fact that sexual risk behavior is
      a dyadic behavior, almost all of the social-cognitive theories emphasize individual-based
      variables to explain behavior. Little research has studied both members of an adolescent
      couple or has used measures from each member to predict future sexual activity of that dyad.
      The overall aim of the present study is to identify explanatory models of couple sexual risk
      behavior among a sample of unmarried, non co-habiting Latino and African American high
      school-aged dyads that are romantically linked. In addition, the present research also will
      study the parents of adolescent couples. In doing so, the present research will apply
      theories of cognition, emotion and emotion regulation, and a new theory of parental
      monitoring to the study of adolescent sexual risk behavior among couples.
