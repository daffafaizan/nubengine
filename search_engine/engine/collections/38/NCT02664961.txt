      on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that
      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor
      types. TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab.
      These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular
      and has been shown to densely express endoglin.
