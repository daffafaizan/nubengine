      life. Current available treatment options include; establishing a bowel regimen that consists
      of supplements, over the counter medications (stool softeners, laxatives, anti-diarrheal,
      enemas), or utilizing other prescription drugs (Linzees, Lomotil). Other conservative
      treatments include biofeedback therapy with a physical therapist. More invasive procedures
      include the injection of bulking agents or sacral nerve stimulation implantation.

      The Emsella chair is currently approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence. The
      Emsella chair generates electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the
      pelvic floor muscles inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor
      muscles. The Emsella Chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM)
      technology for the treatment of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders.
      HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the
      equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes.

      Subjects meeting eligibility will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with the Emsella
      chair and dietary counseling or sham Emsella chair with dietary counseling. A total of 8
      treatments (2 treatments per week for 4 weeks) will be completed. For treatment delivery,
      participants will sit on the device and the chair height will be adjusted to ensure the
      subject's feet are on the floor. The sham Emsella treatment will provide some sensation
      without active HIFEM technology.
