      activity of the heart that may predispose them to sudden death. In light of this risk, it has
      been recommended that such patients undergo implantation of an implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD). Your doctors have determined that you are such a patient and are to
      undergo implantation of an ICD. It is unclear who among the many patients who undergo ICD
      implantation for this reason are at greatest risk of sudden death and therefore require
      electrical response from their ICD. This research is being done to determine whether new
      imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or multi-detector computed tomography
      (MDCT), can be used to predict who is at highest risk of sudden death and require electrical
      response from their ICD.
