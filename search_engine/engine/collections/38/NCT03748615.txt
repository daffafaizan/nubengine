      longitudinal osteotomy, positioning buccal cortex laterally. The buccal cortex is positioned
      laterally to create space between buccal and lingual cortical plates, which is filled by an
      endosseous implant with or without any graft material limitations.

      Ridge split technique is a very predictable procedure that can achieve substantial gains in
      horizontal ridge width of the edentulous posterior mandible without associated morbidity.
      This technique allows the clinician to augment the site and do the implant insertion in a
      single stage surgery, shortening the healing period drastically.

      In the conventional ridge splitting technique, a complete flap is raised to allow adequate
      visibility of the bone defect which can result in disturbance of vascular supply and increase
      bone resorption rates. In this case report, a new innovative computer guided closed alveolar
      ridge splitting flapless technique has been advocated to avoid this disruption.

      As Guided implant placement showed a statistically superior accuracy when they are compared
      with freehand placement after guided osteotomy Computer guided ridge splitting may have a
      superior accuracy than the freehand ridge splitting and may reduce the time of surgery,
      healing period and post-operative pain.
