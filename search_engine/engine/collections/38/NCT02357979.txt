      clinical trial over 12 months. The subjects for this study will be recruited from the UCSF
      School of Dentistry. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria from the UCSF Predoctoral,
      Postgraduate Pediatric Dental and Postgraduate orthodontic clinics will have the study
      explained to them and be invited to participate.

      Young patients with moderate/high caries risk will be invited to enroll into the study. They
      will have to have a pair of two molars which have not been treated so far and are caries free
      and not sealed. The molar on patient's dominant side (right or left) will be randomly
      assigned to either the test or the control group with the contralateral non-dominant side
      receiving the other treatment. The test tooth will be treated with CO2 laser irradiation and
      fluoride varnish; the control tooth will receive fluoride varnish treatment alone.

      A baseline visual inspection using ICDAS II, white and blue light digital photographs
      (SOPROLIFE), and DIAGNOdent assessments will be made by a dentist prior to treatment.

      The patient will be asked to return for a 6-month and a 12-month follow up exam, at which
      time visual inspection with all testing methods will be conducted by the dentist who
      originally completed the baseline exam. The endpoint of the study for each participant will
      be when either the control or test tooth is found to have significant demineralization by
      ICDAS assessment (ICDAS code 3 - "localized enamel breakdown without clinical visual signs of
      dentinal involvement") or at the 12 month exam, whichever comes first.

      The control and test teeth might be sealed with a dental sealant at the end of the study. All
      data obtained will be analyzed for statistical significance.
