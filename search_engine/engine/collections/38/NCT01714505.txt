      approval for, and deploy at home, a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system for optimal
      blood glucose (BG) regulation in people with type 1 diabetes. The CTR system is comprised of
      two algorithmic layers: a Safety Supervision Module (SSM) and Insulin on Board Tracking and
      Safety Module (ITSM), and an automated Range Correction Module (RCM). Both modules will
      receive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin delivery data. The SSM and ITSM will
      monitor the safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to
      prevent hypoglycemia. The RCM will be responsible for optimizing BG control and mitigating
      postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through series of insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will
      use our wearable artificial pancreas platform, known as DiAs (Diabetes Assistant), which
      consists of a smart phone running CTR and connected to standard insulin delivery and CGM
      devices.
