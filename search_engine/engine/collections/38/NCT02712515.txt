      tremor through brain recordings. The investigators will collect brain signals in persons with
      essential tremor undergoing neurosurgical treatment (deep brain stimulation implantation). By
      recording from the implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation along with two other
      non-invasive intraoperative monitoring electrodes, the origins of tremor will be studied in
      the human motor network. Moreover, by performing recordings during deep brain stimulation
      delivery, the mechanisms in which deep brain stimulation modulates this network to suppress
      tremor will be investigated.

      During the standard of care DBS procedure neural recordings are performed as the participant
      is in a reclined position on the operating table. In addition to neural recordings it is
      standard to ask the patient to move their arms and legs during the procedure. An additional
      intraoperative monitoring subdural electrode strip, used in epilepsy and tumor surgeries to
      perform functional mapping, will be placed by the neurosurgeon after the DBS electrode is
      placed per the clinical need of the patient. In addition, the Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation
      Corp. device will be used to test responses with wireless sensors placed on the participant's
      arms, which can record EMG activity. Brain signals will be recorded using the clinical FHC
      Guideline 4000+ system or Medtronic RC+S, which are devices capable of recording during
      stimulation. This additional testing will add approximately 30-45 minutes to the surgical
      time. The Medtronic RC+S stimulator will not be implanted in these subjects, and will not
      used as a therapy. No interventions are compared against any controls for this study.
