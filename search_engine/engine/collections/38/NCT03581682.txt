      clinic visit 1 day apart. Parents will have a 1-hour hands-on training session to acquire
      basic echo images on their children with the same hand-held device that will be used during
      the tele-visit. Tele-visit elements will include interim medical history by the parent and
      patient, and weight, height, vital signs, digital cardiac auscultation, and home echo
      (transferred via Internet for remote interpretation), all obtained by the parent. Two MFS
      physicians, following our routine MFS care protocol, will administer either the tele-visit or
      on-site clinic visit, masked to the findings of the other. Two independent echo readers will
      analyze home and clinic echos to measure reproducibility.
