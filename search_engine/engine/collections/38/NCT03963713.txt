    
      In this study, Data of 100 patients with spinal metastatic tumor who received stereotactic
      radiotherapy or conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy in
      the multi-center of the research group from July 2019 to June 2021 will be collected, as well
      as their follow-up data.The metastases were treated with SBRT.Using multimodal image fusion
      to outline the target area.PTV = GTV + 0-10mm Target volume radiation dose: The range of BED
      value of radiotherapy was 60-72 when the distance between the tumor and gastrointestinal
      tract or spinal cord was more than 5 mm (alpha/beta=10) and 51.3-59.5 when the distance
      between the tumor and gastrointestinal tract or spinal cord was less than 5 mm
      (alpha/beta=10).The metastases were treated with Conventionally-fractionated image- guided
      Intensity modulated radiotherapy.Using multimodal image fusion to outline the target area.The
      dose of the target volume radiotherapy dose is 30 Gy/10f or 40Gy/20f.Previous treatment and
      follow-up data will be analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy comparison of stereotactic
      radiotherapy and conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      for spinal metastatic tumors, local control rate and side effects, and to clarify the
      effectiveness and safety of different doses of radiotherapy.
