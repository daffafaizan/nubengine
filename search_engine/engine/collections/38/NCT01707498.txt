      clinical setting (primary objective) and to compare this performance with an existing
      assitive technology adapted to the target population of this study (scanning system). A
      quadriplegic patient population (n = 10) evaluated the two techniques and a population of
      healthy subjects (n = 10) evaluated the BCI only.

      When a subject meets all the eligibility criteria and is not discarded by any non-inclusion
      criteria, he is included in the study. The order of the two techniques to be compared is
      randomized.
