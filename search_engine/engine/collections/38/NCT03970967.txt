    
      This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety
      and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through
      radioactive sources [Ra-224 containing stainless-steel 316LVM tubes- (Alpha DaRT seeds)]
      inserted into malignant breast lesions.

      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in
      patients.

      Histopathological confirmed invasive breast tumors with no involvement of skin will be
      treated using DaRT seeds.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint of the study is the tumor response to DaRT treatment
      assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) 9-11
      weeks after DaRT seed insertion.

      Safety will be assessed by the cumulative frequency, severity and causality of acute adverse
      events related to the DaRT treatment of adverse events (AEs) observed including the follow-up
      period.
