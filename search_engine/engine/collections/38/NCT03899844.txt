      disease-modifying treatments or simple, accurate diagnostic tests. Amyloid beta builds up in
      the brain and forms plaques in people with Alzheimer's disease, and the buildup of this
      protein is found decades before symptoms of dementia begin. A blood test may be able to
      quickly and inexpensively screen people for Alzheimer's disease clinical trials and
      eventually diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the clinic.
