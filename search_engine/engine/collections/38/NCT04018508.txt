      implantation may experience notable physical and/or emotional distress associated with this
      lifestyle-changing procedure. Furthermore, these patients are faced with the task of coping
      with the trauma of surgery, creating new self-care routines, and learning to live with a
      lifesaving mechanical device that must always be connected to a power source.The immediate
      weeks and months after LVAD implantation are a critical period to lower physical and
      emotional distress and to influence patient coping and adaptation. In small studies, massage
      therapy has been increasingly used to improve patient self-efficacy and coping. In this pilot
      study, we investigate whether regularly scheduled massages delivered in the clinic setting
      improve self-efficacy and coping in this select patient population.
