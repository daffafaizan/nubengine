      videogame-like software specifically designed as a medical device to test and train cognitive
      function for populations with cognitive disorders. After baseline test assessment,
      participants will receive stimulation while playing the training version of the software.
      After the stimulation, cognitive performance will be evaluated again with the testing
      version. Investigators will assess changes in cognitive performance associated with
      stimulation.
