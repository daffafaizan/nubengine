    
      Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing an ambulatory colonoscopy at the participating sites
      will be randomized to follow one of two different sets of dietary recommendations. The
      experimental group will be asked to start a low-residue diet 4 days before the procedure,
      during which the therapy for diabetes will be adjusted. The control group will be asked to
      follow a low-residue diet for 3 days followed by a liquid diet during the day before the
      procedure, and no adjustments will be made to their usual treatment.

      Colon cleansing will be undertaken with polyethylene glycol (4 liters in the usual split
      administration scheme) in both groups.

      Analogic visual scales and standardized questionnaires on various aspects that may influence
      the degree of satisfaction about the preparation will be answered by the participants and
      collected before the colonoscopy. The endoscopist, blinded to the preparation method, will
      grade the adequacy of the preparation. Adverse events will be recorded up to 1 month after
      the procedure
