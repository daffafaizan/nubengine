      amputee patients. Flexion, extension, and abduction are considerably impaired and end basic
      functions like sitting are usually uncomfortable or even painful. An alternative socket
      design that lowers the socket trim-lines and still provides structural support would greatly
      improve the socket comfort for transfemoral amputees.
