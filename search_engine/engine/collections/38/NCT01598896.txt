      addition to medical management (MM) over a 10-week treatment period. Following treatment
      completion, subjects will have follow-up visits until 14 weeks after treatment initiation.
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of the combination of dronabinol and clonidine
      for cannabis dependence and will establish effect sizes for a larger trial.

      Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the United States and rising among high school
      seniors, making the identification of efficacious treatments for cannabis dependence of
      critical clinical and public health significance. Schizophrenia is overrepresented among
      those with cannabis dependence. At the completion of this study, the investigators hope to
      have improved our understanding of the relationship of the pharmacotherapy combination of
      dronabinol and clondine on cannabis use.
