      discoveries of the genomic era by providing physicians, researchers and scientists access to
      quality human specimens and data aimed at improving human health and fighting disease. This
      will be accomplished through acquiring and sharing valuable biospecimen information and
      clinical outcomes in a collaborative, secure environment. The Caris Biorepository will bridge
      the gap and correlate human specimens with clinical and specimen data valuable to multiple
      and varying entities interested in advancing science with precision medicine by targeting
      disease treatments.

      The objective of this project is to develop and implement a state-of-the-science
      Biorepository that ensures molecular integrity and clinical relevance of human biospecimens
      used in research and clinical medicine. The Caris Biorepository will also provide vital
      biospecimens and data to internal researchers and external research collaborators such as
      government, academia and industry collaborators for the use of drug development discoveries,
      clinically relevant research trials, publications and posters, and the implementation of
      future healthcare policies. This project may also impact characterization of trends in
      practice patterns and their relation to patient outcomes as well as the economic implications
      of differing evaluation, treatment and management paradigms.
