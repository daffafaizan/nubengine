      earlier studies of each adolescent idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis patient. We then
      taught them to do the side-plank pose with the convex side of lumbar and thoracolumbar
      scoliotic curves downward, and a slightly altered version of the the half moon pose of yoga
      with the convex side of thoracic and cervicothoracic curves downward. The half moon pose was
      altered in that a belt was looped around the horizontal leg's foot, and held in a vertically
      extended upper arm's hand, and pulled tightly in that vertical position.

      Each pose was held as long as the patient could at least once daily.

      Cobb angles were again measured in films taken 4-10 months later.
