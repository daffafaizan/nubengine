      three weeks: water (W), caffeine-free soda (S), or 100% fruit juice (FJ). Participants
      consumed two servings/day (~710mL) of their randomized beverage for three weeks, along with
      their habitual diets. At baseline and following the 3-week intervention, participants
      completed glucose control, cardiovascular disease risk factor, and pulmonary function
      assessments.
