      psychotherapy is a type of treatment that may be as helpful as medications in treating
      depression. It focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as both current and past
      relationships. Psychotherapy explores better ways of coping with feelings, expressing needs,
      and interacting with others in order to cope with depression and other life problems.
      Subjects will go to 16 weekly, 45-minute, individual sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy
      over the course of the study. At five times throughout the study, subjects will come in for
      extra visits, which last approximately 1.5 hours and which include: speaking with a study
      doctor about depressive symptoms, filling out extra questionnaires, and performing positron
      emission tomography (PET)and a Quantitative Electroencephalogram (QEEG). The QEEG is a
      machine that measures the electrical activity of the brain. This task will take approximately
      15 minutes.
