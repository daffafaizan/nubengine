      cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy.
      Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including
      lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter
      intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy
      cost.Unfortunately, despite advances in bowel preparation methods, up to one-third of all
      colonoscopies are reported to have an inadequate bowel preparation.

      The Bristol stool form scale ( BSFS) was developed in 1988 by O'Donnell LJD et al and was
      widely applied in both gastrointestinal study and clinical practice. BSFS divides human stool
      into 7 different styles according to its moisture content. In our clinical work, we find that
      it is prone to gain poor bowel cleansing quality in patients who pass type 1or 2 stool.
      Unfortunately, there is lacking of study on tailored bowel preparation according to Bristol
      stool form scale. Thus, we intend to develop an easy, practical, BSFS based tailored bowel
      cleansing regimen, in order to serve clinical work and research.
