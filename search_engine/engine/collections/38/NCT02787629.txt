    
      Patients presenting for elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation will be randomized
      to having the ETT inserted into the pharynx simultaneous to GlideScope insertion and then
      having the ETT advanced under GlideScope guidance into the trachea, or, being intubated in
      the more common fashion with the GlideScope being inserted first and having the ETT then
      advanced via the pharynx into the trachea. The primary outcome is time to intubation.
      Secondary outcomes include: 1) Ease of intubation as noted by operator (measured on a 10-cm
      Visual Analogue Scale) 2) Number of intubation attempts 3) Number of failures to intubate 4)
      Use of external laryngeal pressure 5) Laryngoscopic grade distribution
