      cases in 2010. Endometrial cancers occurs generally after menopause but are sometimes
      diagnosticated before 40 years. The 5 years Overall survival of endometrial cancer is 76%
      (95% for non locally advanced or non metastatic disease).

      Some factors are involved in disease prognostic: age, geographical origin, physical status,
      tumor grade, tumor histology and probably biomarkers. Some studies demonstrated that advanced
      age is a negative prognostic factor due to higher relapse risk and higher specific mortality.
      Unfortunately, Incidence of endometrial cancer will probably increase in future due to aging
      of the occidental population.

      Current treatment of endometrial cancer is based on post-operative radiation therapy:
      adjuvant brachytherapy or adjuvant external beam radiation therapy. However these techniques
      lead to serious toxicity (digestive toxicity, ileitis...) in elder patient. Consequently,
      pelvic radiation therapy is difficult to organize before 75 years and dangerous to perform
      after 80 years.

      However a new technique called: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can make the
      difference. IMRT is a new high precision radiotherapy technique probably well adapted for old
      people, with less toxicity than current radiotherapy.

      Nevertheless, IMRT is not recognized as a standard radiation therapy procedure in France and
      Europe.

      Thus, goal of TOMOGYN study is to compare the tolerance of old women (at least 70 years),
      with endometrial cancer, treated with external beam radiation therapy or IMRT.
