      resistance and type 2 diabetes. The project tests the hypothesis that a diet induced decrease
      of BCAAs concentrations alter the metabolic mechanisms involved in the control insulin
      resistance and diabetes progression.

      The specific aims are to elucidate the effect of the diet induced decrease of BCAAs
      concentrations on (I) peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity (II) ectopic fat
      distribution (III) energy metabolism (IV) metabolic and inflammatory status
