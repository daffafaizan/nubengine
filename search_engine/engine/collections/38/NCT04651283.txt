      alternative for standard chair seating on hand function in children with hemiparesis.

      In this study, a total of 30 spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsied children (19 boys and 11
      girls) aged 3-6 years, they were selected from general hospitals and private centers in kafr
      El-Sheikh government, randomly assigned to either the control group (n=15), who received a
      specially selected physical therapy program for hand function on standard chair seating, or
      the study group (n=15), who received the same selected program for hand function but on
      adaptive Swiss ball seating. Both groups received 3 sessions per week for 3 successive
      months. Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) was used to evaluate each child
      individually before and after three successive months of treatment, to assess 2 subtests
      (grasping skills and visual motor integration skills).
