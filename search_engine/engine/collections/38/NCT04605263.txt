    
      This is a prospective, single-center randomized controlled trial designed to estimate the
      potential clinical benefit, and associated risks, of deep brain stimulation of the of the PPN
      and STN in patients with PD that are candidates for DBS for improvement of their motor
      symptoms and exhibit gait instability with falls. Patients will be enrolled and implanted
      with additional bilateral electrodes in the PPN. Each subject will be randomized 1:1 to one
      of the following sequences: Bilateral STN+PPN stimulation or Bilateral STN stimulation alone.
      The addition of a bilateral STN stimulation only group allows for the research of potential
      micro-lesioning effects of the PPN which might affect features of interest even in the
      absence of PPN stimulation.
