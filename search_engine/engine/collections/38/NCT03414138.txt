      Although findings from this laboratory provide novel insights into some of the brain
      mechanisms supporting the modulation of pain by meditation , the specific analgesic
      mechanisms engaged during mindfulness meditation remain poorly characterized.

      To date, there are no studies that have identified the neurofunctional connections supporting
      mindfulness meditation-based pain relief. Employing fMRI, the objective of this study will be
      to determine the neural systems of action supporting mindfulness-based pain relief. The study
      will determine if higher order brain regions are involved in mindfulness-based analgesia. The
      results from this aim will identify a neural marker(s) for meditation-related pain relief, a
      critical step in defining how meditation reduces pain.
