      position was obtained by placement of a 7-cm cushion under the head of the patient. The
      extension position was obtained by simple head extension.

      The head position was randomized as follows: group A was in the snifﬁng position ;group B was
      in the extension position . Glottic exposure was assessed by the Cormack scale.

      Randomization was performed by placing index cards with the letter A or B into100 sealed
      envelopes (more than the number of study patients), which were then placed in random order.
      At the time of a patient's enrollment, the next available envelope was placed with the
      patient's chart. At the time of intubation, the envelope was opened and the sequence was thus
      determined.
