      haemophilic arthropathy, which is often associated with chronic pain as well as functional
      restrictions.

      Due to the opportunity of sufficient factor treatment regimes, physical activity is no longer
      considered as a risk factor for PwH. In contrast, the large amount of current scientific
      evidence demonstrated high benefits of regular exercising for PwH. Meanwhile, physical
      activity is integrated as recommendation in the ´Guidelines for the management of
      hemophilia´. Nevertheless, the detailed influence of the exact course of the individual
      clotting factor level corresponding to the intensity of physical activities in consideration
      of possible bleeding events in adult PwH have not been examined to date.

      The aim of this prospective multicentre study is to evaluate the influence of individual
      clotting factor level while being physically activie. Hereby the focus is on haemophilic
      specific parameters such as bleeding events, factor treatment and pain. On the basis of this
      study, an individualized clotting factor level should be determined which ensures a minimized
      risk of a bleeding event, considering type and intensity of the exercises. In line with these
      new findings, further interventional studies could be initiated in order to safely enhance
      the degraded physical performance as well as quality of life in PwH.

      The generated knowledge could be further used in the development of haemophilic specific
      recommendations regarding physical activity in consideration of the individual clotting
      factor level.
