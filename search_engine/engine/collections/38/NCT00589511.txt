      age, implanted at up to 5 sites in the United States and Canada. The estimated duration of
      this multisite study is 18 to 24 months. The duration of individual subject participation is
      not to exceed 12 months.

      The study will be conducted as a within-subject repeated measures experiment (in which each
      subject serves as his or her own control) in order to accommodate the heterogeneity that is
      well known to characterize hearing-impaired populations
