      One of the materials is tooth colored and the other material is white but both materials use
      different mechanisms to attach to the teeth and may have different outcomes. The study will
      determine if one material is more effective in relieving chronic pain. In addition, we will
      evaluate changes in oral health related quality of life after the placement of the two
      different dental materials.
