      game generate different types of metabolic response. The exposure comprises one-hour of video
      game playing, with 36 young men randomized to each group (ie 72 in total).

      Prior to the exposure, they will collect baseline data on heart rate, blood pressure,
      anthropometry (weight, height, waist girth), grip strength and cognitive function (memory
      test), as well as appetite/mood by visual analogue scale (VAS). The investigators will also
      collect a baseline saliva sample to assess hormones associated with stress (cortisol) or
      satiety (leptin, ghrelin). The subject will arrive after and overnight fast and will be given
      a standardised breakfast. After these baseline data are collected, the randomization envelope
      will be opened and the subject assigned to his group.

      Heart rate will be monitored continuously during the study. At 20 and 40 minutes during the
      intervention, as well as when it ceases at 60 minutes, the investigators will collect further
      data on blood pressure and appetite/mood by VAS. At 60 minutes, the investigators will repeat
      measurement of memory and grip strength, and collect a second saliva sample.

      For 20 minutes after the end of the intervention, the subject will be allowed to rest,
      reading magazines, and will be able to select from a range of snack foods (savoury, sweet,
      fruit), and drinks (sweetened beverages, water). Consumption of calories will be calculated.
      At the end of this period, final measurements of blood pressure and VAS will be collected,
      and the subject will depart.
