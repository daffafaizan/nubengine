    
      This pilot study is a within-subject repeated measures design. This study will compare the
      neurophysiological and vascular responses to placebo and treatment with Lovaza® (omega-3-acid
      ethyl esters, Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in subjects with type 2 diabetes, neuropathy,
      and dyslipidemia.

      Lovaza's potential mechanism of action is the inhibition of acyl Coenzyme A:1,
      2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase and increased peroxisomal β-oxidation in the liver.

      Subjects will be recruited and a baseline of physiological, neurological and hematological
      profile established for each patient. Forty-four subjects (20 in the active arm, 20 in the
      placebo arm, and 2 replacements for each arm) will receive 4 g/day Lovaza® tablets or placebo
      for a period of 6 months. All subjects will receive a physical and neurological exam as well
      as neurovascular function testing. This includes nerve conduction studies, quantitative
      sensory testing, quantitative autonomic testing, and skin blood flow testing, which includes,
      ischemia reperfusion. Lab tests include an insulin resistance profile, hepatic and renal
      function profiles, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, thyroid stimulating hormone, and fatty
      acids. Other tests include inflammatory markers such as adiponectin and tumor necrosis
      factor-α. The study is powered to detect differences in microvascular function after 6 months
      of Lovaza® and differences in ethnic responses.
