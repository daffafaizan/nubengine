      Assessment Clinic at Magee-Womens Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Patients
      with gestational diabetes will be recruited following general education regarding gestational
      diabetes in pregnancy which is universally done for all patients at the time of their
      diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Eligible subjects will be randomized to two groups (usual
      care vs. sleep education program).
