      consecutive series of 101 patients that are scheduled for hysterectomy and suffer from
      bleeding disorders, chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea or dyspareunia. All patients will
      undergo transvaginal 2D- ultrasound, 3D-ultrasound and power doppler (PD)-ultrasound (TVU),
      magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic organs (MRI) and hysterectomy.

      We will investigate the specificity and sensitivity of 3D and 2D transvaginal ultrasound in
      the diagnosis of adenomyosis and compare data with MRI and histopathology, which is the gold
      standard by today. In addition, we will collect anamnestic information that might point to
      risk factors or connections to prior obstetrical complications and medicine use. In our study
      the pathologist will not be blinded to our ultrasound findings, and we want to investigate if
      this will raise the sensitivity of histology findings of adenomyosis.
