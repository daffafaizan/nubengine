      hypnosis and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Several studies have demonstrated
      that individuals with particular conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
      have altered hypnotic susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI), a
      general category of autonomic dysfunction that includes neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) and
      postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), often present with symptoms that are similar to those
      seen in CFS, PTSD, chronic pain, or GAD. These observations led to the hypothesis tested in
      this protocol that patients with COI may also have altered hypnotic susceptibility. We also
      hypothesize that increased hypnotic susceptibility will correlate with increased ability to
      modulate autonomic function appropriately in response to suggestions during hypnosis.

      The study population includes normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS. The design is
      blinded and correlative. Primary outcome measures are hypnotic susceptibility as measured by
      standardized scales; self-report inventory scores of psychobehavioral variables; physiologic
      parameters such as hemodynamics, sweating, skin electrical conductance, body temperature,
      respiratory rate, and bispectral analysis; and plasma catechol levels. The results of this
      study may lead to novel therapeutic strategies using hypnosis for COI.
