      1. To test the hypothesis that two weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively impair
      vascular endothelial function 2: To test the hypothesis that increasing sedentary behavior
      will decrease total sleep duration and sleep efficiency.

      3: To test the hypothesis that two-weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively increase
      24-h blood pressure and reduce nocturnal blood pressure dipping.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will become more inactive and also maintain their activity (in randomized order)
      and also come in for 3-hour uninterrupted sitting visits. Cardiovascular, activity, and sleep
      measures will be taken throughout.
