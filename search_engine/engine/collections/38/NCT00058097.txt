      I. To estimate overall survival in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme
      treated with R115777 before (and possibly after) radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate response rate in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
      treated with R115777 prior to therapy with radiation.

      II. To estimate progression free survival in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme treated with R115777 before (and possibly after) radiation therapy.

      III. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 3 weeks. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses.

      RADIOTHERAPY: Within 14 days after the completion of induction therapy, patients undergo
      radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Two weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
      additional tipifarnib as in induction therapy.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 54 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-14
      months.
