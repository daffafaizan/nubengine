      dietary fiber and probiotics alone and in combination as a add-on treatment in improving the
      antipsychotic induced weight gain, the cognitive impairment, and psychotic syndrome in
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patients. The study will recruit 100 schizophrenia or
      bipolar disorder patients who meet the criteria of DSM-5, and then randomized to 4 groups:
      probiotics group(PB group) dietary fiber group(FB group) probiotics plus dietary fiber
      group(PF group) and control group(CT group) for a 12-weeks clinical trail (20 patients per
      arm) for a 12-weeks clinical trail. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done at
      screen/baseline, 4 week, 8 week and 12 week. The specific aims are to compare probiotics
      group versus controls on: 1) clinical core symptoms; 2) cognition; 3) metabolic related
      markers. Biological samples also will be collected, and stored to research related
      mechanisms. Clinical symptoms will be measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,.
      Cognitive function will be assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.

      The investigators hypothesize that: 1) dietary fiber and probiotics may improve cognitive
      impairment of patients with schizophrenia; 2) dietary fiber and probiotics could prevent the
      cognitive decline of patients with schizophrenia; 3)dietary fiber and probiotics may prevent
      the antipsychotics induced weight gain in patients with schizophrenia.4)dietary fiber and
      probiotics may alter oxidative stress indexes or inflammatory biomarkers thus influence the
      oxidative and inflammatory mechanism.
