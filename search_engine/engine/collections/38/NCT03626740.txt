      trioxide aggregate (MTA), and, more recent, TheraCal. All of them are biocompatible and
      induce the formation of coronal hard tissue barriers (tertiary reparative dentin). Calcium
      hydroxide, considered for a long time the gold standard of direct pulp capping materials, has
      excellent antibacterial and remineralisant properties; however, it lacks adhesion, especially
      at moist dentin, and reparative dentin is less homogenous.

      MTA proved to stimulate protective dentin bridge formation without inflammatory changes and
      least necrosis. It is also moisture tolerant, but it is more expensive, has poor handling
      characteristics and slow setting time.

      TheraCal bonds to deep moist dentin, has strong physical properties, no solubility, high
      radioopacity and higher calcium releasing abilities than MTA or calcium hydroxide.
