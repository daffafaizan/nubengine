      it is the most common type of cancer in the world. Surgery is the primary treatment approach,
      especially in early stages lung cancer. Cardiopulmonary fitness of patients with lung cancer
      is lower than healthy individuals due to the disease itself and treatments. Pulmonary
      function, exercise capacity and physical activity level are affected in lung cancer depending
      on the resected lung tissue and the type of surgery. VATS and thoracotomy surgeries, which
      are the most preferred techniques in lung cancer, have advantages and disadvantages over each
      other. There are few studies compared the early effects of two surgeries on the pulmonary
      function, exercise capacity, physical activity, quality of life and fatigue. And also, no
      study compared the effects of two surgeries on respiratory muscle endurance and peripheral
      muscle strength, previously.

      According to sample size calculation, at least 15 patients with pulmonary lesion both VATS
      and thoracotomy groups would be included in the study. The demographic, physical and
      physiological characteristics were recorded from the patient files. Pulmonary function,
      functional exercise capacity, physical activity level, respiratory and peripheral muscle
      strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea perception and pain
      were evaluated pre and two weeks after postoperative term. Primary outcomes were pulmonary
      function, functional exercise capacity and physical activity level. Secondary outcomes were
      respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, quality of life,
      fatigue, dyspnea perception and pain.
