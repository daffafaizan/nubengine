      Phase one: acquisition of the informed consent followed by positioning a clip into the cancer
      bed (by radiologist) if not already present; Phase two: after radiological confirmation of
      pathological Complete Response (pCR) done performing breast ultrasound, MRI and
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET)
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy the patient becomes candidate to VABB pre surgery.

      Phase three: the patient has VABB within 15 day from the term of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      Phase four: definitive surgical intervention within 30 days from the end of the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy Phase five: verification of correspondence between histology of VABB and
      definitive histology.

      The study hypothesis is that VABB could be used in the patients with pCR to the imaging
      post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy to confirm sensibility and specificity of 18 FDG TC PET and
      breast MRI to show the absence of breast cancer.

      The use of VABB with negative histology result could bring to a therapeutic gold standard
      without over surgical treatment
