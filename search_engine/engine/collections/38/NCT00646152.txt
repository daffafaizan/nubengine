      (Poly-ICLC), a stabilized double stranded RNA (dsRNA) therapeutic viral mimic activating
      innate and adaptive immunity, has been in extensive preclinical and investigational clinical
      therapeutic use as an intramuscular and intravenous compound, most recently in oncology
      applications. Only recently have the mechanisms of action been more fully elucidated,
      including induction of interferons, cytokines, and chemokines. Recognizing this, the
      infectious disease applications have been pursued in in vitro and animal models. Intranasal
      Poly-ICLC provides protection against mortality in animal models for multiple highly
      pathogenic viruses including influenza, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS),
      smallpox and Ebola. As its effects are not dependant on knowing the causative virus, an
      effective compound that could be protective against several unknown respiratory viruses has
      significant clinical appeal. While there is clinical safety data for intramuscular (IM)
      Poly-ICLC, no clinical studies of nasal application of Poly-ICLC have been done.

      This study is a phase I safety and pharmacokinetic trial of nasally applied Poly-ICLC. Human
      volunteers will be administered increasing doses of nasal Poly-ICLC, with serial evaluation
      of safety, tolerability, as well as exploratory markers of immune activation.
