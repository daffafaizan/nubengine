      temperature can be used to estimate of body core temperature. Deep tissue temperature of the
      forehead will be measured using a new technology known as zero-heat-flux thermometry. The
      usual way to measure internal body temperature is within the nasal cavity (nasopharyngeal
      temperature). Nasopharyngeal and deep tissue temperatures will be measured simultaneously
      during surgery and compared for agreement. The hypothesis of this trial is that deep tissue
      temperature as measured by zero-heat-flux thermometry will agree with nasopharyngeal
      temperatures during surgery.
