      no cure for dementia. Ultimately, dementia will have a large impact on quality of life in
      Veterans and families, lead to expensive nursing home placement, and decrease life expectancy
      for patients and family caregivers. The experience of high burden in a caregiver for a
      Veteran with dementia increases the likelihood of permanent nursing home placement and can
      separate Veterans from their families. To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran
      with dementia, the investigators aim to study the effect of a rehabilitative intervention for
      family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. This novel approach will use video technology
      that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical
      centers.
