      of nodules are malignant. Conventional ultrasound is the current standard for the initial
      evaluation of thyroid nodules, yet due to several overlapping characteristics between benign
      and malignant nodules its utility in diagnosis has been limited, leading to a high rate of
      negative biopsies. To overcome these challenges the American College of Radiology has
      proposed a Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in an effort to decrease
      unnecessary biopsies [5]. While these efforts have shown encouraging results, further work is
      still needed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) are two
      emerging non-invasive imaging techniques which have shown promising results in the evaluation
      of thyroid nodules. However, data is limited and how these imaging modalities could
      potentially compliment ACR TI-RADS is unknown.
