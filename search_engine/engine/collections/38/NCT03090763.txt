      morbidity and mortality. The course of this condition can stay asymptomatic for long, and its
      first manifestation can be acute rupture of the aneurysm sac with life-threatening bleeding.
      Detection of patients at risk and their early treatment significantly reduce the percentage
      of this potentially lethal complications.

      Aortic diseases are most often degenerative processes with a varying involvement of genetic
      predisposition. In literature, a substantial number of genes were proved to affect the
      metabolism of the vessel wall and to determine production of structural proteins, which were
      associated with the vascular pathologies. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of lesions of the
      aortic wall have not been completely understood. Among other, they include endothelial
      dysfunction, chronic inflammation of the vessel wall, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and
      degradation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the loss of integrity of layers of the
      vessel wall and decrease in its strength, which leads to dilation, rupture or dissection.
      Apart from mutations in genes coding the structural proteins of the vessel wall, many other
      potential biomarkers were proposed for early diagnosis of aortic aneurysm. These include
      microRNA (miRNA), one-fibre chains of non-coding ribonucleic acid which are several
      nucleotides long and are involved in the gene expression through the mechanism of inhibition
      of mRNA translation or increase in its degradation. Recently, association of levels of these
      miRNAs to presence and growth of aortic aneurysms has been described.
