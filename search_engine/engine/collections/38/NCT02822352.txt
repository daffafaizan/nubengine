      bowel such as surface patterns and mucosal vasculature. This theoretically increases the
      detection of pre-cancerous tissue compared to high definition white light endoscopy alone.
      Narrow-band imaging or NBI (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), Blue Laser (Fujinon, Tokyo, Japan) and OE
      scan (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) use optical light filters to select particular narrow spectrums
      of red, green and blue light with a relative decrease in the proportion of red light. The
      Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses post hoc computer algorithms,
      applying different filters to the stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically
      endless number of combinations of filters that can be used. The Pentax I-SCAN system also
      allows post hoc modification of the images. It provides the ability to enhance the mucosal
      surface to better highlight mucosal changes.

      These new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage, which is extendedly used for sales
      purposes but so far has not been proven in the surveillance for precancerous or early cancer
      of the large bowel in patients with longstanding colitis.
