      I. To assess the objective response rate of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer to
      sunitinib (sunitinib malate).

      II. To assess the frequency of prolonged stable disease (as defined by percentage [%] of
      patients alive and free from progressive disease at 6 months) in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic endometrial cancer treated with sunitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time-to- progression, median overall survival, and rate of one-year survival in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer treated with sunitinib.

      II. To assess the toxicity associated with sunitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months until relapse.
