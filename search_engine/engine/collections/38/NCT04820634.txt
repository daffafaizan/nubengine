      Job Interview Training (VR-JIT)" which targets social competency skills needed for successful
      job interviewing, and its efficacy when applied to individuals with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI). Preliminary evidence suggests that the VR-JIT is successful in individuals with autism
      spectrum disorder and schizophrenia in improving interview abilities. However, the efficacy
      of VR-JIT has not been evaluated in TBI populations.
