    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to
      test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), randomized (the study
      medication is assigned by chance) 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants to 4
      different arms in a clinical study), and a single dose study. This study will consist of a
      screening phase (between 28 to 2 days prior to the study medication), a treatment phase of 4
      double blind study periods (2 days), and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14 days after last
      dose of the study medication). Approximately 20 participants with major depressive disorder
      will participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts
      (groups) (Cohorts A, B, C, and D) to receive JNJ-42847922 (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) and
      placebo. Each cohort consists of 4 treatment periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4). Safety will be
      evaluated by the assessment vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory
      testing, physical examination, and neurological examination. The total duration of study
      participation for a participant will be approximately 9 to 10 weeks.
