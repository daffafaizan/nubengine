      diagnostic radiopharmaceutical agent designed to bind to the folate receptor. The folate
      receptor is a glycoprotein that is over-expressed in many types of cancer cells but it is
      only minimally distributed in normal tissues . Folate conjugates bind to the folate receptor
      with high affinity and are brought into the cell via endocytosis. In contrast, folic acid
      itself enters most normal cells via the reduced folate carrier, a pathway entirely
      inaccessible to folate conjugates. Therefore, these folate conjugates are specific to cancer
      cells.

      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-treatment group, baseline-controlled
      study designed to verify product safety, gather data on the percentage of metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma patients with increased uptake of FolateScan in tumors, and to calculate
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
      of FolateScan compared to immunohistochemical staining (IHC).
