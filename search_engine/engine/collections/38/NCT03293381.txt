    
      Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (NICM) is a common cause of heart failure (HF) and death. NICM is
      a heterogeneous entity, and specific etiologies are infrequently identified. In part due to
      limited disease characterization, specific treatments are lacking for most of the different
      underlying causes of NICM. Depending on the cohort, 30-70 percent of patients with new-onset
      NICM develop persistent systolic dysfunction despite guideline-directed medical therapy, and
      these patients have high rates of subsequent morbidity and resource utilization.

      Current guidelines support the use of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in patients with both
      new-onset and persistent cardiomyopathy. However, EMB is underutilized in these populations
      due to its low diagnostic yield. A combination of sampling error resulting from standard
      fluoroscopy-guided EMB in disease entities with patchy myocardial involvement and rudimentary
      tissue phenotyping of the specimens which are obtained contribute to this low diagnostic
      yield. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of electro-anatomic
      mapping (EAM) to help identify areas of myocardium with discrete pathology based on
      abnormalities in intra-cardiac electrogram voltage and morphologies. Therefore, the primary
      objective of this protocol is to provide definitive evidence that EAM-guided biopsy leads to
      a superior diagnostic yield compared with conventional fluoroscopy-guided biopsy in patients
      with new-onset and persistent NICM.
