      extracting metabolic information by real-time imaging of biochemical reactions within the
      body. In this project, the investigators focus on prostate cancer, specifically late-stage
      disease, as management of these patients would benefit from a new imaging method that enables
      improved therapy selection, planning and monitoring.

      For imaging the lactate distribution in bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 3D coverage of a
      large field-of-view is required in order to cover the vertebral column (the most common site
      of metastases). To enable this, the investigators have developed methods using a large-volume
      transmitter and multi-channel receiver system for 3-dimensional 13C metabolic imaging in
      these patients. The image resolution and encoding matrix were tailored to the required 3D
      coverage of the vertebral column.

      At the end of this study, the investigators will have the methodology, hardware and
      clinical-research workflow needed to evaluate 13C-lactate imaging as a new tool to help
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The investigators would be the first in the world
      to apply 13C metabolic MRI to bone metastases. Although the investigators propose to study
      patients who are starting a 6-month course of treatment with radium 223, in this project,
      this proof-of-concept study may also lead to a larger clinical trial at different points in
      the treatment pathway, such as prior to deciding between treatment with cytotoxic agents
      versus drugs that target the androgen axis such as abiraterone.
