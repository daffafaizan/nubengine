      bolus plus continuous ropivacaine infusion via catheters versus single shot TAP blocks with
      liposomal bupivacaine.

      In the Liposomal Bupivacaine group, TAP block will be performed using ultrasound guidance.
      12ml of 0,25% plain bupivacaine will be used for skin infiltration and to open up the TAP.
      Liposomal Bupivacaine 266 mg (1.3% in 20 ml) will be diluted to 40 ml volume with 20 ml of
      preservative free normal saline. 20 ml (133mg) of liposomal bupivicaine will then be injected
      into the TAP.

      For those randomized to the TAP catheter group, ultrasound guidance will be used for TAP
      block and 5 mls 1% lidocaine will be used for skin infiltration. A peripheral nerve catheter
      will be placed approximately 3-5 cm into the TAP space after injection of ropivacaine. A
      bolus dose of 2.5 mg/kg of ropivacaine will be administered in a volume of 30 ml up to a
      maximum of 150 mg. An infusion with a programmable pump will be initiated at a rate of 8
      ml/hr of 0.2% ropivacaine on the inpatient floor.
