      of 10 patients will be included. To evaluate the effect of maximum doses of rosuvastatin on
      liver function and side effects, first 2 patients will be treated and evaluated. If they
      experience no serious adverse events then a further 8 patients will be included. The dose of
      rosuvastatin will be increased over a period of 4 weeks.

      Intervention: based on experience in treating dyslipidemia, gradually increasing the dose of
      rosuvastatin diminishes the experienced side effects and decreases the chances of developing
      hepatotoxicity. Therefore in this study we chose to increase the dose (see flowchart).
      Patients will start with 5 mg a day wich will be increased after 1 week to 10 mg per day.
      After the second week of therapy a further increase to 20 mg per day is executed. This dose
      will be given for another 2 weeks. At week 4 of treatment a further increase to 40 mg is
      done.
