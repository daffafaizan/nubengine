    
      The Hudson Valley is implementing several innovative programs to potentially improve quality
      and reduce the cost of health care delivered. First the Taconic Health Information Network
      and Communities Regional Health Information Organization (THINC RHIO) is facilitating
      diffusion of EHRs in office practices in the Hudson Valley. Second, THINC RHIO is also
      offering a strategic approach to pay-for-performance. Third, an additional component of the
      THINC P4P project will be an added financial incentive for private practice physicians who
      implement and reach Level II of Physician Practice Connections® - Patient Centered Medical
      Home (PCMH)™, NCQA's new national recognition system for physician practices. Our study will
      seek to determine the effect of each of these initiatives on health care quality and cost of
      care in the Hudson Valley. We will also measure the patient experience before and after
      implementation of the Medical Home.
