      consent, patients will be randomized to one of two arms. Patients in both arms will be
      provided by booklet and audio-cassette that specify lifestyle recommendations (diet, physical
      activity and breathing exercises). Patients in one of the study arms will be provided in
      addition with frozen wheatgrass juice (recommended daily dosage of 55-110 CC daily). Patients
      in both arms will be asked to fill in a daily patient's diary monitoring the practice of the
      lifestyle recommendations.

      Baseline assessment will include the following questionnaires: ESAS, MYCAW, FACIT- Fatigue.
      Evaluation will include weekly ESAS and FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire and subsequent evaluation
      (including ESAS, MYCAW, FACIT- Fatigue questionnaires) following 3 and 4 chemotherapy cycles
      of treatment. Follow-up evaluation will be performed at the completion of chemotherapy.
