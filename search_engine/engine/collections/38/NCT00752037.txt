      stated enrollment criteria. This study will assess the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir in
      combination with raltegravir on HIV-1

      Patients will be evaluated frequently over the 52 weeks of the protocol. Patients will be
      seen at screening, baseline, week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52, to include physical examination,
      assessment for the development of AIDS-defining conditions, hematology, chemistry, lipid
      profile, CD4, CD8 cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA ultrasensitive, and assessment of adverse
      events. If HIV-1 RNA becomes detectable, this will be repeated for confirmation with 2 weeks.
      HIV genotyping and phenotyping will be performed on patients who demonstrate repetitive
      plasma viral load levels of > 1,000 copies/mL.

      An interim analysis will be performed when all patients have reached the week 24 visit.
