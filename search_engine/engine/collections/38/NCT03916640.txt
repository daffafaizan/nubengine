    
      In this monocentric, randomised, double-blind, active comparator, controlled, cross-over
      trial, each patient will be randomly allocated to a sequence of three treatments: one single
      dose of the co-formulation of insulin analog and pramlintide (also called ADO09),
      simultaneous separate injections of pramlintide and human insulin and one single dose of
      insulin lispro. To keep the blinding in this trial, a placebo injection will be given in
      addition to the ADO09 formulation and insulin lispro dose for a total of 2 injections per
      dosing visit. During each visit, meal test procedures will be performed and subjects will
      stay at the clinical centre until post-dose follow-up period has been terminated. IMP
      administration will be done subcutaneously immediately prior to test meal intake.
