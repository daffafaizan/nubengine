      tolerate low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in an accelerated protocol to treat
      depression. The investigators aim to treat 12 patients with epilepsy and comorbid depression
      to receive a total of 15 hours of transcranial magnetic stimulation over 3 days at
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The investigators will assess safety of this
      protocol with regards to seizure frequency and other side effects of TMS treatment and the
      feasibility of using an accelerated protocol in this patient population. In addition to these
      primary aims, our secondary goal is to determine if dense array EEG can provide a useful
      biomarker for depression and its treatment in focal epilepsy. A structural and functional MRI
      will be obtained before treatment and a dense array EEG before and after TMS treatment to
      assess for changes in specific dense array EEG based biomarkers.

      In addition to recruiting patients, the study staff will likewise request that family members
      or friends of the patient accompany the patient monitor him/her for increased seizure
      frequency. The recruited family member will bring the patient to the treatment and stay with
      the patient overnight at a local hotel and monitor for possible seizures or other adverse
      events of treatment. Family members will be instructed in seizure safety and be given
      emergency phone numbers to call if the patient is experiencing adverse effects of TMS.
