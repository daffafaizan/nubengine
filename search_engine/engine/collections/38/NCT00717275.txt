      central nervous system result in profound neurological devastation. Existing therapies for
      brain metastases are focused on improving both neurologic function and survival. Therapies
      aimed at controlling the tumor both at the site of the brain metastases and the rest of the
      brain have the potential to improve outcomes and quality of life. The combined use of
      stereotactic radiosurgery followed by temozolomide may represent such a strategy.
