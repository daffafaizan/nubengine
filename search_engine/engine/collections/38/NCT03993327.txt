    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of iodine I 124 monoclonal antibody M5A (124I-labeled M5A
      monoclonal antibody [MAb]) to localize to CEA positive gastrointestinal (GI) metastases
      primarily focused on the liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of administration of 124I-labeled M5A MAb.

      II. To correlate the radiographic positron emission tomography (PET) images to the liver
      metastases pathology.

      III. To assess if the I-124 imaging agent detected additional liver and additional
      extra-hepatic liver lesions not appreciated on standard imaging scans.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive iodine I 124 monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously (IV) on day 0 and undergo
      PET scan on days 2 and 6.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.
