      randomized to 5-day concomitant therapy (90 patients) and to 10-day sequential therapy (90
      patients). 6 and 10 weeks after the end of therapy, patients were evaluated for their H.
      pylori status by 13C Urea Breath Test. Side effects and costs of either regimen were
      evaluated. In patients whose H pylori status at entry was assessed by endoscopy, culture was
      performed and antimicrobial resistance was determined
