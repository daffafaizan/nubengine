    
      The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging of primary brain tumors and
      relapse of brain tumors using technetium-99m labeled glucose.

      Phase I of the study:

      Biodistribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients with primary brain tumors and in
      patients with recurrence of a brain tumor.

      The main objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors in
           patients with brain tumors at different time intervals.

        2. To evaluate dosimetry 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
           the drug after a single intravenous administration.

        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a
           single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

      Additional research tasks:

      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the
      visualization of brain tumors by SPECT using 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose with data obtained by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) and
      immunohistochemical (IHC) research of postoperative material.

      Methodology:

      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of
      the labelled tracer.
