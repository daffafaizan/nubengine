      recommended for patients with nocturia because much patience and understanding is required
      for the patients to follow the therapy. Few studies have reported the efficacy of repetitive
      education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy for patients with nocturia
      and nocturnal polyuria (NPU). Furthermore, no report demonstrated the evidence about how many
      times or how long the education for behavioral therapy should be performed and how long will
      the education effect would continue. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of
      repetitive education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy in the patients
      with NPU and to show whether a single education for behavioral modification is sufficient for
      the patients.
