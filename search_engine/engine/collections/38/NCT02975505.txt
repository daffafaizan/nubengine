      filtration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/min/1.73m2, to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) represents a
      vulnerable period, when multiple physiologic and psychosocial changes occur as patients
      prepare for either dialysis or kidney transplant. This study is a pilot randomized controlled
      trial to test the safety and feasibility of studying strict versus usual BP control in a
      population of patients with advanced CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), including those with
      diabetes. For this pilot study, we will randomize 60 patients with advanced CKD who have
      elevated BP to either a home SBP target of <120 mm Hg (intervention group) versus 130-140 mm
      Hg (usual care group).
