      established that the sentinel node predicts the pathology results of the rest of the axillary
      lymph nodes. This minimally invasive technique, which can be readily performed under local
      anesthesia, makes the need for full axillary lymph node dissection unnecessary for most
      patients. If the sentinel node is negative, no further surgery is necessary. If positive, a
      complete axillary node dissection is performed. In addition, the injections are made while
      the patient is under anesthesia, reducing the physical and psychological pain that
      accompanies injections done pre-operatively.
