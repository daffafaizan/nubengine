    
      Study CC-94676-PCA-001 is a first-in-human dose finding study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of CC-94676 in subjects with mCRPC who have
      progressed on ADT and at least one prior secondary hormonal therapy approved for CRPC (eg,
      abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide). The dose escalation will evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-94676 in mCRCP subjects to determine
      the MTD of CC-94676. The dose expansion will further evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of CC-94676 administered at or below MTD in subjects with mCRPC.
