      Background:

      Instillation of Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into the urinary bladder (intravesical
      administration) improves rates of disease recurrence and progression after transurethral
      resection (TUR) of high risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), but over 30% of
      people still recur despite optimal therapy with adjuvant intravesical BCG. The meta-analysis,
      including a recent randomised phase 2 trial, suggests that outcomes might be improved further
      by using an adjuvant intravesical regimen that includes both Mitomycin C (MMC) and BCG. These
      promising findings require corroboration in a definitive, large scale, randomised phase 3
      trial using standard techniques for intravesical administration.

      General Aim:

      To determine the efficacy and safety of MMC in addition to BCG in patients with NMIBC.

      Design:

      Open label, randomised, stratified, 2-arm multicentre phase 3 clinical trial. Population: The
      target population is adults with resected, high-risk NMIBC (high grade Ta or any grade T1)
      suitable for intravesical chemotherapy treatment. Key eligibility criteria include: prior
      transurethral resection of all visible tumour, adequate organ function, and ECOG performance
      status 0-2.

      Study Treatments:

      Arm A: Intravesical BCG Alone (standard): Induction (weekly x 6), followed by Maintenance
      (monthly x 10); or Arm B: Intravesical BCG + MMC (experimental): Induction (weekly x 9),
      followed by Maintenance (monthly x 9).

      Statistical Considerations:

      A sample size of 500 (followed until 213 events are observed) provides 85% power to detect a
      10% improvement in DFS rate at 2 years from 70% on BCG alone to 80% on BCG and MMC (hazard
      ratio 0.63) at a significance level of 0.05, allowing for 10% non-compliance.
