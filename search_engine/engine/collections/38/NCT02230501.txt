      week the intervention group with stringent diet regime replaced 3 main meals by 50 g PRMR
      (Almased-Vitalkost, Almased Wellness GmbH, Bienenb√ºttel, Germany) each (=1100 kcal/day). In
      2nd-4th week 2 meals were replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. In 5th-12th week
      only dinner was replaced. The control group with moderate diet regime replaced breakfast and
      dinner for 4 weeks and then only dinner during the next 8 weeks. Clinical parameters were
      determined at the study center at baseline, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was
      reduction of HbA1c, secondary endpoints reduction of weight and antidiabetic medication.

      In the second part of the study type 2 diabetes patients are included in an open-label
      reistry and perform the lifestyle intervention with the stringent diet regime.
