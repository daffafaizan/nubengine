      patient surveillance system that includes oxygen saturation and heart rate monitoring by
      pulse oximetry will result in earlier and more sensitive detection of respiratory events and
      possibly early stages of developing sepsis in a post-surgical/orthopedic study population.

      An observational study with RRa is an additional blinded parameter to the already existing
      standard of care monitoring with SpO2 and PR on one post-surgical floor, (includes Trauma and
      orthopedic patients), where patients receive opioids for pain management. 300 consecutive
      patients will be enrolled and monitored with RRa for at least the first 24hours post-surgery,
      after discharge from the Recovery Room, & upon admission to the Surgical floor.
