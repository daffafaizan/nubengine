      and on cerebral glucose homeostasis. It is yet to be determined whether African Americans
      with mild AD can be recruited into such a study, nor has the relationship of fitness
      adaptation to neurocognitive function been systematically examined in this population. In
      addition to the goal of assessing the intervention effects, the study will evaluate the
      differential relationships of APOE to aerobic fitness-induced changes in neurocognition. The
      long-term goal is to explore the mechanism by which fitness adaptation exerts an effect on
      neurocognition, notably, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated
      inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukins (IL-1A)), deranged glucose
      homeostasis, hypertension and endothelia dysfunction are precursors of arteriolosclerosis,
      decreased cerebral perfusion and oxygen deprivation, all of which may increase AD risk.
      Because many of these putative AD risk factors are susceptible to lifestyle alterations, the
      study will also assess their roles in aerobic fitness-related improvements in cognitive
      function and reduction in AD risk.
