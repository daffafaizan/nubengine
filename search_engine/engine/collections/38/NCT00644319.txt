      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a non-steroidal based regimen comprising ibuprofen in
           decreasing post-pleurodesis pain as compared to an opiate-based regimen comprising
           morphine sulfate in patients with malignant pleural effusion.

        -  To evaluate whether chest drain size influences the amount of post-pleurodesis pain.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological
      tissue type (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma) and thoracoscopic procedure. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F) on
           day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed on
           day 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F)
           on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed
           on day 3.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F)
           on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is
           removed on day 3.

        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F)
           on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is
           removed on day 3.

      All patients will receive regular background analgesia comprising paracetamol 4 times daily
      on days 0-3. Patients not adequately treated with these regimens may also receive rescue
      analgesia comprising morphine sulfate IV on days 0-3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and
      periodically thereafter.
