      renal replacement therapy following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery was
      0.7-3.5% and increase mortality rate. Erythropoietin (EPO) is now considered a novel
      anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory action. The present study was designed to evaluate the
      administration of EPO as a means of preventing AKI in these patients.
