      the treatment of patients acutely ill with COVID-19. The researchers want to confirm the
      right dose levels of immunoglobulins/antibodies (immune proteins) and find out what
      therapeutic effects plasma donated by recovered individuals like you has on people severely
      sick with COVID-19.
