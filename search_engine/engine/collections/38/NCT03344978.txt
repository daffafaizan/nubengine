      maintaining infant axillary temperatures comparing it to the temperatures of the same infant
      being nursed in low heat incubators. The study will be done in the context of standard
      medical care, including the WHO thermoregulation protocol (warm delivery rooms, immediate
      drying after birth, early and exclusive breastfeeding, postponement of bathing and weighing,
      and appropriate bundling).

      The cardboard cot is approximately 24 inches long to accommodate the length of the infant and
      about 12 inches wide to accommodate term infants, even beyond the first months after birth.
      The cots are fully lined with a reflective metallized film sheet of Mylar. The cot will be
      covered with a cardboard piece also lined in reflective film up to about the infant's
      shoulders so that the infant's face is visible. Attached to the lid is a 5 inch cardboard
      flap lined with reflective film which folds down into the body of the cot to reduce heat
      loss.

      Infants ≤ 36 6/7 weeks gestation will be randomized to receive care in a cardboard cot or an
      incubator. Infants will begin care in one device and after 24 hours will cross over to the
      other device for another 24 hours. The process will be repeated once more for a total of 96
      hours of study duration. The infants will be normothermic and stable when they are enrolled
      in the trial. Axillary temperatures will be measured at 1 hr, 6 hours and 24 hours after
      being placed in the cost or incubator. Infants with observed hypothermia (<36° C) will have
      measures taken to increase temperature (i.e. adding blankets, hat).
