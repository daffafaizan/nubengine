      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially due, in part, to
      the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers).
      Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with
      unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated
      utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and
      symptom remission is rare. Given this, alternative ways of providing CBT need to be
      identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment.
      With this in mind, the proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly
      assigned to either videophone administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol,
      and adapted for videophone administration. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by
      trained clinicians at relevant time-points (e.g., baseline, post-treatment, follow-up) to
      assess symptom severity and impairment. Should supporting data be found,
      videophone-administered CBT would have the potential to help many more families who would
      otherwise remain untreated or inadequately treated. On a societal level, evaluation and
      dissemination of telehealth interventions such as this will lessen costs related to sustained
      treatment and OCD related impairment.
