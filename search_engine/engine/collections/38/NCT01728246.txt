      drug assigned by chance), controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and effects on
      QOL of tramadol/APAP as an add-on therapy in Filipino participants suffering from chronic
      pain because of chronic osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups:
      tramadol/APAP group and non tramadol/APAP group. Participants in tramadol/APAP group will
      receive celecoxib 200 milligram (mg) and fixed dose combination of tramadol (37.5 mg)/APAP
      (325 mg) as add on therapy, while the participants in non-tramadol/APAP group will receive
      celecoxib 200 mg only. The total duration of the study will be 4 weeks. The participants in
      both the groups will be given celecoxib 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks. In addition, the
      participants in the tramadol/APAP group will be given add-on tramadol/APAP doses 3 times a
      day for 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up at Weeks 2 and 4.
      Efficacy will be assessed using 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) while QOL will
      be assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Participant safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
