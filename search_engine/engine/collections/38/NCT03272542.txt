      placebo in 20 postmenopausal women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 2-6 years
      previously and thus have completed the postoperative period of rapid weight loss and
      metabolic and dietary change. A 24 g/day dose of SCF85 (which is approximately 20 g/day
      fiber) will be tested, as that dose was proven effective for calcium absorption/retention in
      healthy postmenopausal women and adolescents. The SCF and the maltodextrin placebo will be
      mixed in water and consumed in divided doses twice daily for 2 months, a duration exceeding
      other SCF trials but remaining feasible for a pilot. The primary outcome will be change in
      intestinal calcium absorption, which is the efficacy outcome about which the study must
      collect preliminary data and from which the investigators must refine power calculations for
      the anticipated future trial. Because the investigators hypothesize that an increase in
      calcium absorption will decrease bone turnover and ultimately increase bone mineral density
      (BMD), the study will measure biochemical markers of bone turnover in this pilot. Secondary
      outcomes will be gastrointestinal tolerability and acceptability. On an exploratory basis,
      the study will determine effects of the prebiotic on the gut microbiome. This pilot will
      yield critical experience about feasibility of recruitment and adherence to the intervention
      and measurements.
