      within 14 days before the start of the run-in period) and to answer questions associated with
      habitual diet, exercise capacity, and level of activity. Those subjects who meet initial
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo a run-in period of at least 7 days at home to
      discontinue use of all concurrent dietary supplements. Subjects will then return to the study
      site at Visit 2 (Baseline; Day 0) for further assessments and those meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to study
      product.

      Approximately 108 subjects (54 per treatment group) will be enrolled in the study. Subjects
      will be evaluated at Visit 3 (Day 14), Visit 4 (Day 45), Visit 5 (Day 60, phone call), and
      Visit 6 (Day 90). Exercise capacity (ie, 6-minute timed walk distance test) will be assessed,
      along with overall knee wellness and joint-related symptoms using WOMAC, PGA, Knee Pain
      Rating Scale, and rescue medication usage. Safety will be assessed by collecting adverse
      events (AEs) and clinical laboratory data.
