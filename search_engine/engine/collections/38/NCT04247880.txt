      approximately 100 women apprentices within their own local union. Mentees will be followed
      for two years within the mentorship program, with another 100 women apprentices in locals not
      receiving the mentorship training similarly followed as controls. The impact of participation
      in mentoring programs will be measured through apprentices' experience of stress, coping
      mechanisms, safety climate, and retention in the apprenticeship programs. Specifically, the
      investigators propose to:

      Aim 1: Develop a mentorship training program for journey-level sheet metal workers to assist
      women apprentices in navigating the challenges faced by women in trades

      Aim 2: Disseminate the training and assist locals in developing effective mentorship programs

      Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the mentoring programs specified in Aims 1 and 2

      Aim 4: Disseminate the best practices for supporting women apprentices in the skilled trades.
