    
      For periphery tests: 10 ml blood will be collected from all eligible subjects into SST tubes.
      Then serum will be separated and freeze at -80 degrees until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1
      protein by ELISA.

      For tissue tests: biopsies will be taken from colons of eligible participants. One part of
      these biopsies will be freeze until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by ELISA. The
      other part of the biopsies will be placed in dishes with appropriate media and will be
      incubated in 37 degrees in order to follow cytokine secretion for 24 h. Media will be
      collected after 24 h and then freeze until further analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by
      ELISA. The investigators will also measure mRNA levels of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein in
      collected biopsies.

      The investigators will try to correlate between the Chitinase 3 like-1 protein levels in the
      blood and in tissue among various groups of participants and will compare between healthy
      participants and IBD participants. The investigators will also follow mRNA expression in
      tissue biopsies taken from all the participants.
