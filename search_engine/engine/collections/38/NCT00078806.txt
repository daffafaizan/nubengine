      Participants who had a partial response (not able to reduce prednisone dose by 50% of the
      baseline dose in 5 months) while on 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly etanercept in Part 1A were to
      enter Part 1B for up to 4 months and were to have the dose of etanercept increased to 0.8
      mg/kg twice weekly. Participants who did not meet the response criteria in Part 1A or Part 1B
      of the study were to be withdrawn from the study as non-responders. Participants who
      responded in either Part 1A or Part 1B were randomized into Part 2, where they received
      etanercept or matching placebo in a double-blind manner twice weekly for up to 3 months. In
      Part 2, participants were stratified by the dosage of etanercept (0.4 mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg)
      they were receiving in Part 1A or Part 1B. Participants could enter Part 3, the open-label
      re-treatment portion of the study, only if they had been entered into Part 2 of the study and
      had either flared in Part 2 or had completed 3 months of treatment in Part 2. The maximum
      time participants could receive etanercept in Part 2 and Part 3 combined was 12 months.
