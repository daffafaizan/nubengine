      applied in the clinic. The clinical exercises vary according to the time and severity of the
      pathology but also according to the pathology itself. These exercises include exercises
      focusing on flexor or extensor muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      morphological changes in the neck muscles of cervical spinal stabilization exercises focused
      on flexor and extensor muscles applied to healthy individuals. At least 27 healthy male
      subjects between the age of 18-30 are planned to be included in the study. Individuals will
      be divided into 3 groups by simple randomization method. In one group cervical stabilization
      exercise program focused on the flexor muscles will be applied and the other group cervical
      stabilization exercise program focused on the extensor muscles will be applied for 8 weeks.
      Individuals in the control group will only be evaluated without exercise. In the study, by
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method as the main evaluation, muscle anatomical
      cross-sectional area and T2 relaxation time measurements will be made and morphological
      changes in muscles will be determined. These evaluation procedures will be performed on
      longus colli, sternocleidomastoid, semispinalis cervicis, multifidus and upper trapezius
      muscles. As additional evaluation methods, muscle strength and muscle endurance tests, normal
      joint motion measurements, posture evaluation and MRI measurement of cervical spine curvature
      will be performed. All evaluations will be performed at the beginning and at the end of these
      8 weeks and the effects of the exercises applied on the muscles in the two groups will be
      examined.
