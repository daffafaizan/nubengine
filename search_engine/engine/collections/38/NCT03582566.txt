      language and literacy learning. Though there are computer games that claim to improve
      phonological awareness and working memory, it is unknown if these games will improve language
      and literacy skills for children who have hearing loss.

      The investigators will first determine if the games are effective for improving language and
      phonological awareness in children with hearing loss relative to an active control condition.
      Secondly, the investigators will determine if gains in phonological awareness and working
      memory translate into gains in language and literacy skills relative to active control.
