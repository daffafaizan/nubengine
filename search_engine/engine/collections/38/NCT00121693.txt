      of music therapy in fall prevention has not been reported in the literature. This
      investigation will provide experimental support to the assumption that music therapy may
      prevent falls and that certain music can affect increases in postural stability using
      randomly selected subjects, validated posturography and a full experimental design.

      Computer dynamic posturography (CDP) tests will provide stability scores in volunteer
      subjects who have had no previous history of falls or vertigo. Subjects will be randomized
      into several different music listening groups and one control group. Examiners will be
      blinded as to the music listened to and the outcome measurements. Subjects will be blinded as
      to their posturographic measurements. The music listening groups will be given a daily
      specific music listening task. CDP tests will be obtained 10 minutes, 1 week and 1 month
      after subject's treatment. Music selection will include Mozart, Nolwenn Leroy and others
      suggested to change human stability.
