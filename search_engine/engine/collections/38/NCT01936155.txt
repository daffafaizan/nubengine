    
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) will be facilitated through the use of a
      two-channel, research stimulator, with the patient in a semi recumbent position, using
      UltraStim electrodes. Two 5 cm x 5 cm electrodes will be placed over the soleus muscle for
      calf stimulation. The participant will be allowed to ramp up the stimulus level themselves to
      get used to the sensation and determine their maximum tolerated stimulus level.

      A goniometer will be used to assess mobility at the knee and ankle joints. Transcutaneous
      oxygen measurements (tcpO2) will be assessed using the PERIMED Periflux System 500 tcpO2
      monitor.

      The level of oedema will be measured using the figure of eight measurement, tape
      circumference measurement and water displacement measurement.

      Comfort will also be assessed by use of a 100mm non-hatched visual analogue scale (VAS). Each
      participant will be asked to indicate their level of comfort following the application of
      NMES. VAS pain scores of 30 mm or less will be categorised as mild pain, between 31 and 69 mm
      as moderate pain, and scores of 70 mm or greater as severe pain.
