      According to BVO study the only effective management of it is macular photocoagulation for
      macular thickening that persist after 3 months.But we may miss a golden time which resulted
      to photoreceptor degeneration due to macular edema during this period. VEGF inhibitors newly
      have been shown that may be effective on a wide range of retinovascular diseases that
      resulted to macular edema or new vessels formation. In this study we aim to show the outcomes
      of one of this VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab) on complications of BRVO in a sham controlled
      clinical trial.
