      and standard of care as the Activa PC system. After implantation and standard clinical
      programming, participants in our research study will be asked to return for additional
      research visits where the recording sub-circuit of the device will be activated and local
      field potentials (LFP) will be recorded in the device and transmitted through telemetry to a
      base station for storage and future analysis. The sensing, or recording, sub-circuit will be
      disabled, non-invasively, at the end of each research visit to minimize impact to battery
      life of the device.
