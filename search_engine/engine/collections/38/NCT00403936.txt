      treatment and served as his/her own control. 100 subjects were recruited from the
      student/staff population of the university, were 18 y/o or older with no condition affecting
      pupillary activity. Pupillary activity was measured with a PLR100 pupillometer and included
      pupillary diameter, pupillary response latency, maximum constriction velocity and maximum
      redilation velocity. Subjects were adapted to a dim light environment, measures taken,
      treatment given at either third or fourth time period and measures retaken. The study was
      approved by the NSU IRB. Subject numbers were sufficient to have statistical power to find an
      effect. The study found an effect of treatment on maximum size, showing a decrease with
      treatment.
