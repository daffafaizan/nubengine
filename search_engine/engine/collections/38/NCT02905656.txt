      trial, which is a treatment that promotes cessation among all smokers, including those not
      ready to quit.1 One implication of this design is that success is based on percent abstinent
      at a given point in time and do not tie a follow-up to a determined quit date (since smokers
      not ready to quit often don't typically set formal quit dates).

      Investigators research led to a four condition treatment design as the main independent
      variable of interest. Participants will be randomly assigned to four treatment conditions:
      (1) Brief advice; (2) motivational interviewing; (3) rate reduction; and (4) combination of
      motivational interviewing and rate reduction. All four intervention conditions will receive
      three sessions once a week, ideally, but can extend to a 6 week time period, each
      approximately 30 minutes in length, provided over a period of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the
      participant's circumstances. Upon the completion of the main components, Booster sessions
      will be administered in 2-month increments throughout the intervention period (2 month, 4
      month, & 6 month follow-up) in conjunction with study assessments. The window for the Booster
      sessions will be as indicated above 2M, 4M, and 6M after enrollment, but we will continue to
      try and reach them to complete the booster session for 4 weeks. For example, 2 month booster
      window opens at 8 weeks after enrollment and we will try to complete that 2 month booster
      within 4 weeks. Twelve months after randomization, prolonged abstinence will be measured.
