    
      DERM, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support tool, has been shown to be able
      to accurately identify Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and other conditions from historical
      images of suspicious skin lesions (moles). This study aims to establish how well DERM
      determines the presence of these conditions in images of skin lesions collected in a clinical
      setting.

      Suspicious skin lesions that are due to be assessed by a dermatologist and a patch of healthy
      skin will be photographed using three commonly available smart phone cameras with a specific
      lens attachment. The images will be analysed by DERM, and the results compared to the
      clinician's diagnosis (all lesions) and histologically-conformed diagnosis (any lesion that
      is biopsied).
