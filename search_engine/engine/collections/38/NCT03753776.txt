      Principal therapy consists in radiotherapy, that is locoregional, using radiations to kill
      cancerous cells.

      Radiotherapy has sides effects as radiodermatitis, concerning about 90 percent of women
      treated. Radiodermatitis could be described with three factors : redness, heat, and edema.

      Risk of flushing could be reduced by hygienic rules concerning hydratation, clothes, and
      toilet.

      Nowadays, no treatment proved homeopathic efficacy to prevent radiodermatitis. This treatment
      is popular but also contested. No clinical trial proved its efficacy for this indication. The
      present study aims at evaluating Radium bromatum efficacy (homeopathy), compared to placebo,
      to prevent radiodermatitis apparition for women treated for breast cancer.
