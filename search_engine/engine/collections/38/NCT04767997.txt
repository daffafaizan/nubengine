      participate in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional study for
      approximately 15 since the signature of the informed consent. Participants will first be seen
      at the Screening visit when they will be administered several questionnaires to determine
      eligibility (assessing symptoms of insomnia, work-related stress, psychological distress and
      other sleep disorders). Participants will receive a 2-week sleep journal and an actigraphy to
      record their sleep patterns. At visit 2 returning participants will be randomized to receive
      probiotics or placebo for the following 12 weeks. During this visit, participants will be
      administered questionnaires assessing sleep quality, work-related productivity, quality of
      life, and mood. Participants will also be asked to bring to site a stool sample and saliva
      samples.

      Participants will be asked to return at 6 weeks for visit 3. During this visit participants
      will be administered questionnaires (insomnia, sleep quality, work-related stress and
      productivity, quality of life, mood and psychological distress).

      They will also bring two saliva samples. Two weeks prior to visit 4, participants will be
      asked to complete another sleep journal and be dispensed another actigraphy which shall be
      returned at visit 4. Lastly, participants will return on for visit 4 at week 12 in which the
      same questionnaires as visit 3 will be administered. Participants will also be asked to bring
      to site another stool sample and two saliva samples.
