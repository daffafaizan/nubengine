      shorter length of stay can achieve higher patient engagement scores, while simultaneously
      increasing the productivity of the unit. This is achieved by making more beds available for
      new patients coming from the operating room (OR). One thought was that coffee would benefit
      the investigator's patients experience through a number of pathways. Initially, the stimulant
      effect of coffee would create a more alert patient. A more alert patient is more likely to
      comprehend home care instruction and be ready for discharge earlier. Coffee is often used as
      a remedy for morning sickness. Ideally the act of drinking coffee or even smelling the coffee
      may decrease the occurrence of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) in investigator's
      patient population. Finally, patients frequently state that the inability to drink their
      morning coffee is often more difficult than not being able to eat prior to surgery. By
      allowing those to drink coffee in PACU this would make the patient feel that they are being
      cared for on an emotional level, in addition to a physical level.
