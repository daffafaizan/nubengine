      laboratory which has been able to measure the FR obtained from cancer cells in culture which
      has been added into blood. We would like to study if this method is able to measure the FR in
      stored plasma samples obtained from patients with ovarian cancer, so that it may be developed
      as a method for selecting patients for FR-target treatments such as BGC 945.
