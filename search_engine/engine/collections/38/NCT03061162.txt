      therapy in treating gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis. Radiation therapy
      uses pulsed low dose rate high energy X rays to kill tumor cells and make less side effects
      than conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Palliative radiation therapy may
      help gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis live more comfortably.
