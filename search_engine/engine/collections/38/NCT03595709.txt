      (NNRTI). The recommended dose of EFV is 600 mg daily; however, a phase II study showed no
      significant difference in viral suppression rates across the different EFV groups (200 mg,
      400 mg, and 600 mg) at 24 weeks. The week 96 analysis of ENCORE 1 study confirmed the durable
      virological non-inferiority of EFV 400 mg to the standard 600 mg dose when given as initial
      therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). Fewer EFV-related
      adverse events (AEs) and fewer treatment discontinuations were also observed in the reduced
      dose group. The efficacy and safety findings provide robust evidence to redefine the EFV dose
      for HIV treatment.
