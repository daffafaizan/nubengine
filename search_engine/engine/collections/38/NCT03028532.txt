      modulator (SERM) with a therapeutic indication to treat female infertility. Though
      FDA-approved only for use in women, clomiphene is often prescribed off-label to males to
      treat male infertility and secondary hypogonadism due to its ability to increase serum
      testosterone levels. Numerous clinical studies have documented both the effectiveness for
      these indications and safety of clomiphene administration in males. Increasing the
      concentration of circulating testosterone can have additional effects, including the
      enhancement of performance in sports. As such, clomiphene is already abused by athletes in
      several sporting disciplines, including mixed martial arts, cycling, and bodybuilding.
      Therefore, clomiphene is a prohibited substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code .
      Though the parent compound and metabolites of clomiphene are directly detectable in routine
      anti-doping screening, the urinary detection window and the effect of clomiphene
      administration on other anti-doping markers are unknown and thus the foci of this study.
