      newborn children. When initial conservative treatment or nerve surgery fails, muscle/tendon
      transfers are the only current treatment options available to regain a functional arm. During
      this extensive surgery a healthy donor muscle is transposed to exert a different function.
      After long-term denervation the muscle is irreversibly changed. Muscle atrophy, fattening,
      fibrosis, decrease in capillary to muscle fiber ratio and decline in the number of satellite
      cells, which are responsible for post-natal muscle repair, is seen. For neuromuscular
      diseases, cell therapy aiming at rescuing muscle damage by delivery of cells that can
      differentiate into skeletal muscle, might be a promising approach. Safety questions remain
      whether stem cell injection results in non-muscle tissue formation like inflammatory cells or
      connective tissue formation in the transplanted muscles. Furthermore, it remains to be
      determined whether these stem cells undergo functional integration and enhance muscle
      function. The objective of this pilot study is to assess functional and morphological
      improvement of the m. biceps brachii after autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell
      injection.
