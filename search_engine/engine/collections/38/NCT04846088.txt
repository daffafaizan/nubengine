      days prior to enrollment, randomization and confinement.

      Following the Screening Visit, eligible subjects will be scheduled for a Day 1 Check-in visit
      to complete procedures to confirm eligibility. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and begin
      confinement at the clinical site for 10 days and 9 nights. In addition, on Day 1, subjects
      will use at least one nicotine pouch (7 mg nicotine) but no more than 3 pouches to
      familiarize themselves with the investigational product (IP). Subjects will participate in
      separate Test Sessions for plasma nicotine PK assessment, one for each IP. Each Test Session
      will last for approximately 3 hours following the start of the IP use, and will include
      collection of plasma samples for PK assessments prior to, during, and following IP use.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by the Principal Investigator (PI) (or
      designee) by assessing adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements, physical examinations
      (including an oral examination), and clinical laboratory tests. Mandatory physical and oral
      examination will be performed as part of end of study or early termination procedures.

      The clinical site will attempt to contact all subjects who used at least one IP (including
      subjects who terminate the study early) using their standard procedures approximately 7 days
      after the last IP use to determine if any AE has occurred since the last study visit. A
      return visit may be scheduled for follow-up assessments at the discretion of the PI or an
      appropriately qualified designee.
