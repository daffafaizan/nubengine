      months to years of costly intervention. Preventing venous ulcers from recurring is ideal,
      however, healing time is variable, possibly due to inadequate patient/clinician communication
      and surveillance. An aftercare summary is a detailed set of self-care instructions designed
      to help patients understand and influence preventative factors under their control. They have
      successfully been used in patients with cardiac disease and are currently being tested to
      help prevent diabetic foot ulcers. We propose the use of an aftercare summary to help prevent
      ulcer recurrence in veterans with recently healed venous ulcers.
