      and who refused to be bleached Mann Whitney test was used.For each pair of scales it was
      determined if any one of them predominated over its counterpart by Wilcoxon rank test before
      and after bleaching . To corroborate the statistical power of this study was calculated
      post-hoc with the NEO-FFI scores values between the comparisons and showed a high statistical
      power (0.99) by G-Power software.
