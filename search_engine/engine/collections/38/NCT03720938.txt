      children. For this reason, academic performance decreases and obesity associated diseases
      such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart diseases, depression, and cancer might ensue.
      Children usually do not prefer to perform outdoor PA due to several causes including low
      sense of self perception.

      So far studies have shown an almost equivalent energy spent through AVGs to the physical
      activity of moderate intensity. Games have been previously demonstrated to prevent excess
      weight. There were no studies of AVG in children with varying weights, inactivity and
      technology preoccupation. Similarly, no qualitative research of AVG in children exploring
      enjoyment levels and attitude changes were encountered.

      Thus, the investigators aim to find the quantitative effect of AVG on physical fitness
      parameters like weight, BMI and FR. Other aims are studying factors for motivation or
      continuance of the games as well as the feelings and perspectives of the participant
      children's parents for the games.
