      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the few therapeutics that showed
      evidence of efficacy to increase level of consciousness and functional communication in some
      Minimally Conscious State (MCS) patients, and in some Vegetative State (VS) patients (1, 2,
      3, 4), with no side effects reported.

      However the mechanisms by which tDCS improves consciousness are poorly understood and the
      electrophysiological effects of the stimulation have never been studied in disorders of
      consciousness patients.

      In this study, the investigators will use detailed clinical examinations (Coma Recovery Scale
      - Revised (5)) and electrophysiological assessments (quantitative high-density EEG and
      event-related potentials) (6, 7) and event-related potentials (8, 9) together with a standard
      morphological MRI to assess the effect of a open-label single session of left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex tDCS stimulation administered as routine care.

      The primary goal is to investigate electrophysiological response to tDCS and its relation to
      behavioral response to better understand how tDCS affects consciousness in disorders of
      consciousness patients.
