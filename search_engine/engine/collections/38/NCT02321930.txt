      The patients meeting inclusion criteria will be started on tofacitinib 5mg po bid. Patients
      will be recruited from the UCLA Rheumatology Clinics. Inclusion criteria will include the
      following: meeting ACR 1987 RA criteria, DAS28≥3.2, age≥18, and PDUS>10 (see below for more
      details). Patients who are deemed unsafe to enroll will be excluded. Ultrasound measures
      (PDUS/GSUS) and MBDA scores will be obtained at screen, baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months. In
      addition, we will also obtain HAQ-DI, CDAI, and DAS28 at the same time points. In addition,
      we will have a 6 week visit for capturing adverse events, concomitant drugs, drug
      dispensation, and evaluation of adherence. Currently, there are several US measures to
      evaluate therapeutic response in RA patients that have been used in the literature. Some US
      studies evaluate all joints involved in RA, which is time consuming. At present, there is no
      consensus as to the ideal ultrasound scoring system. However, we will utilize a 34-joint US
      scoring system to evaluate response to therapy in this proposal (see Table 1). Our research
      team has expertise in MSUS (given several workshops/lectures nationally) and we have
      proficiency in designing/conducting MSUS clinical trials. We currently have 4
      ultrasonography-rheumatologists at UCLA who are ACR certified in MSUS.
