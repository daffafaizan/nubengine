    
      There are two conditioning regimens in this protocol for children >6 months. Alemtuzumab
      (Campath), Fludarabine and Melphalan are used. The regimens differ by the timing and dosing
      of Alemtuzumab (Campath). The two timings are distal and intermediate.

        -  Distal campath is initiated 22 days prior to the allogeneic transplant.

        -  Intermediate campath is initiated 14 days prior to allogeneic transplant.

      The conditioning regimen for children with immunodeficiencies <6 months omits melphalan, and
      substitutes two days of busulfan. This regimen is successfully used in the UK, and has been
      successful in a 3 month old infant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) who
      engrafted with a haploidentical donor.
