      I. To precisely define the impact of soy on myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in a
      human model clinical trial.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (SOY BREAD): Participants consume 2 slices of soy bread daily for approximately 20
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Concurrent with the intervention, participants
      will be staring androgen deprivation therapy at the direction of their medical oncologist.

      ARM II (WHEAT BREAD): Participants consume 2 slices of wheat bread daily for approximately 20
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Concurrent with the intervention, participants
      will be staring androgen deprivation therapy at the direction of their medical oncologist.
