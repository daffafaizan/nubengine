      providing analgesia to the hip joint. The analgesic value of this block in the setting of hip
      arthroscopy is unknown. This study aims to compare a preoperative PENG block to placebo block
      prior to outpatient hip arthroscopy under general anesthesia. The primary outcome measure is
      immediate postoperative pain as measured by numerical rating score in the post-anesthesia
      care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes include opioid consumption, opioid-related adverse
      events, patient satisfaction, chronic opioid usage, and pain scores at other time points.
