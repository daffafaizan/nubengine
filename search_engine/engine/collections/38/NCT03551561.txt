      is a complication that is potentially associated with any type of surgical procedure, it also
      represents an expressive burden in terms of morbidity and mortality, as well as additional
      costs for health care systems around the world. It is regarded that the efficiency of the
      pre, per, and postoperative skin preparation depends on both the adopted antiseptic and the
      application method, with Chlorhexidine currently being the most used drug in such
      preparation. However, the manner, timing, or timing of cutaneous antisepsis action is
      unclear. Objective: Comparing antisepsis techniques using chlorhexidine-based soap associated
      with ethyl alcohol and alcoholic chlorhexidine versus chlorhexidine-based soap associated
      with alcoholic chlorhexidine, in surgical orthopedic procedures. Methods: It is a primary,
      randomized, analytical and single-center clinical trial, consisting of 170 patients, which
      were distributed between 2 randomized groups, where Chlorhexidine-based Soap + Alcoholic
      Chlorhexidine were tested on the group CSAC and Chlorhexidine-based Soap + 70% Ethyl Alcohol
      + Alcoholic Chlorhexidine were tested on the group CSAAC. Cultures were performed in the
      Mannitol and EMB (Eosin Methylene Blue) media after being collected at the pre, post-skin
      preparation and end of the surgical procedure
