    
      This study will be performed in patients with shoulder pain due to excess of nociception
      associated with chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome in asymmetrical unilateral trapezius muscle
      trigger points.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to two treatment arms: Active (A) (n=20) and Sham (S)
      (n=21). Group A will receive actual treatment with trigger point dry needling. Group S will
      receive a sham treatment, with the needle inserted superficially in the skin, without
      reaching the muscle underneath it.

      The duration and pain elicited during active and sham dry needling will be controlled for.
      Patients will be evaluated one week before needling (D-7), on the day of dry needling (D0)
      and seven days after the procedure (D+7).

      Patients will fill out the Brazilian version of the Douleur Neuropathique 4, Beck Depression
      Inventory, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), McGill Pain Questionnaire-SF (SFMPQ), Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale and Global Impression of Change, and also a 14-day Carnet to more
      accurately evaluate their daily pain before and after the treatment.

      For the evaluation of neurologic changes, we will evaluate local hyperalgesia, tactile,
      mechanical, static and thermal sensitivity with thermal quantitative sensorial testing (TQS),
      and also mapping of the painful area, before and after treatment in both D0 and D+7.
