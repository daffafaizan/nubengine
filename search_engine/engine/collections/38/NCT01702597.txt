      Ankle sprains often result in ankle instability, which is most likely caused by damage to
      passive and neurological structures. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a neuromuscular training
      method improving those neurologic parameters impaired. The aim of this study is to compare
      the current gold standard functional treatment to functional treatment plus WBV in patients
      with acute unilateral unstable inversion ankle sprains.

      Methods/Design:

      60 patients, aged 18-40 years, presenting with an isolated, unilateral, acute unstable
      inversion ankle sprain will be included in this bicentric, biphasic, randomized controlled
      trial. Patients will be randomized by envelope drawing. All patients will be allowed early
      mobilization and pain-depending weight bearing, limited functional immobilization by
      orthesis, PRICE, NSARDs as well as home and supervised physiotherapy. Supervised physical
      therapy will take place twice a week, 30 minutes per session, for 6 weeks, following a
      standardized intervention protocol. During supervised physical therapy, the intervention
      group will perform similar exercises on a side-alternating sinusoidal vibration platform as
      the control group. Two time dependent primary outcome parameters will be assessed. Short-term
      outcome after six weeks will be postural control quantified by the sway index. Mid-term
      outcome after one year will be assessed by subjective instability, defined by the presence of
      giving-way attacks. Secondary outcome parameters include return to pre-injury level of
      activities, residual pain, recurrence, objective instability, energy / coordination, Foot and
      Ankle Disability Index and EQ 5D.
