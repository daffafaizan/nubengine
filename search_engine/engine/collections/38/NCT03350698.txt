      This will entail a blood-draw sample (less than 1 teaspoon) that will be sent to FOCUS labs
      for evaluation. This will be paid for by funding received from Merck.

      The three-dose vaccination schedule will be followed with injections at month 0, 2, and 6.
      Gardasil 9 dosing will be per the recommended and approved labeled guidelines.
      Post-vaccination titers would be measured at month 7, which is in alignment with the methods
      of previous studies. This will entail a blood-draw sample (less than 1 teaspoon) that will be
      sent to FOCUS labs for evaluation.
