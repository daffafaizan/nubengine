      function of the vascular endothelium due in part to abnormalities in nitric oxide signaling.
      Endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the development of congestive heart failure and
      exercise intolerance that have been well-documented in Fontan patients. Therapeutic
      interventions to improve endothelial function in adults with heart failure have mainly
      focused on increasing the synthesis or decreasing the degradation of nitric oxide. We propose
      a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin C, an antioxidant that
      protects NO deactivation, in subjects with single ventricular anatomy after Fontan
      palliation. The specific aims of this study are to compare NO signaling, endothelial function
      and exercise capacity in Fontan subjects to that of a control group that is frequency-matched
      to case subjects by age and sex, and to assess NO signaling, endothelial function and
      exercise capacity in Fontan subjects after 4 weeks of oral vitamin C (or placebo) therapy.
      These results have particular importance because improving the endothelial response in Fontan
      patients has the potential to reduce the risk of developing congestive heart failure and
      improve exercise capacity. Furthermore, assessing endothelial function and the effects of
      therapies aimed at improving vascular health may be generalizable to many other chronic
      pediatric conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk such as obesity, diabetes
      mellitus, and hypertension.
