      indications macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) directly by each
      physician. For each patient, the first injection date of Aflibercept is defined as the index
      date.

      Electronic files from each ophthalmologist, containing patient medical records, will be
      periodically transmitted according to the milestones of the study with a maximum of 4
      transfers (at Q2 2016 for the first transfer and then every 9 months thereafter).

      As each electronic transfer will be independent of each other and as patients' data will be
      anonymized by physicians before each transfer, data comparisons will be not possible between
      the four electronic files transfers planned over the study period.
