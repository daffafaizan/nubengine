    
      Asparaginase treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children is jeopardized by a huge
      toxicity burden and the toxicities are often preventing further treatment. The most common
      asparaginase associated toxicities are hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, thromboembolism and
      osteonecrosis.

      In the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol asparaginase associated toxicities have been registered since
      the protocol opened in July 2008. In addition asparaginase enzyme activity measurements have
      been done before every asparaginase administration and analyzed retrospectively.

      This study evaluate the association between risk and severity of asparaginase associated
      toxicities and asparaginase enzyme activity levels in children with ALL treated in the
      NOPHO-ALL 2008 protocol.
