    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of using a mobile health delivery unit
      ("mobile unit") to deliver "one stop" integrated health services - particularly medication
      for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and medication for HIV treatment and prevention - to people
      who inject drugs (PWID) with opioid use disorder (OUD) to improve uptake and use of MOUD, and
      uptake and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The
      intervention arm receiving health services in the mobile unit will be supported by peer
      navigation. An active control arm will receive peer navigation to health services available
      at community-based agencies. Impact (cost-effectiveness, mathematical modeling) and
      implementation factors (mixed methods to identify barriers and facilitators of the
      interventions) will contextualize findings from the efficacy analysis. The impact of the
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the study population will also be assessed.
