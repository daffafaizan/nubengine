      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in
      patients aged 65 years and older. Many hospitalizations for CHF are potentially preventable
      if the warning signs of decompensation are recognized and treated before the situation
      becomes emergent. Home-based intervention programs have reduced unplanned readmission rates
      for patients with CHF by up to 50 percent. Using advanced telecommunications technologies it
      is now possible to provide greatly improved access and availability of services in a more
      timely and cost effective manner directly to patientsï¿½ homes. Although telehealth offers a
      number of theoretical advantages, few empirical studies have compared telehealth to
      traditional delivery modes, and virtually no studies have compared the effectiveness of
      alternative telehealth applications.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and resource use of two telehealth
      interventions to traditional care provided for recently discharged outpatients with CHF. Four
      hypotheses will be tested. Compared to subjects who receive usual care, subjects who receive
      telehealth interventions (telephone or interactive video) following discharge will: 1) have
      lower readmission rates; 2) report improved quality of life, self-efficacy, and satisfaction
      with care; 3) use fewer resources, including hospital days, urgent care visits, and telephone
      calls; and 4) have higher survival rates.

      Methods:

      The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. We will compare usual care to an
      intervention delivered by either telephone or interactive video to veterans following
      discharge from the hospital. A total of 198 subjects will be enrolled over three years.
      Subjects in the treatment groups (telephone or interactive video) will receive the
      intervention for 90 days following discharge from the hospital. Data to be collected includes
      measures of quality of life, self-efficacy, satisfaction, resource use, and mortality.

      Status:

      Project work is ongoing.
