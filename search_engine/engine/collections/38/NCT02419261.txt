      safe technique, avoiding muscle weakness, and by this way limiting the risk of fall.
      Injection of local anaesthetics in the adductor canal does not block the sole saphenous
      nerve. Demonstration of a proximal spreading, around the branches of the femoral nerve have
      been made. The aim of this study is to assess a possible spreading from the adductor to the
      the popliteal fossa, where sciatic nerve and its branches are located. Pinprick test all
      around the knee and the leg, combined with motor assessment of the muscle of the leg and the
      ankle will be realised. This assessment was compared with femoral nerve blockade, classically
      used for analgesia after this kind of surgery (anterior cruciate ligament repair)
