      To investigate the potential performance of incobotulinumtoxin-A (BTXA) in patients submitted
      to TMJ surgical arthroscopy. Besides the acceptable good outcomes of TMJ arthroscopy, the
      authors believe that using a single injection of BTXA into the temporalis and masseter
      muscles could reduce joint loading and pain, improving TMJ arthroscopy results.

      The proposed explanation for this study:

      TMJ arthroscopy is a minimal invasive surgical technique for different types of
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ) internal derangements. Besides the acceptable outcomes of TMJ
      arthroscopy, the authors believe that adding to this treatment a single injection of BTXA
      into the temporalis and masseter muscles could reduce joint loading, improving TMJ
      arthroscopic results.
