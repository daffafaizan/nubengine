    
      This Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled clinical study of Safety and Efficacy of Pro-ocularâ„¢ 1% in
      Daily Scleral Lens Wearing Patients with Ocular Graft-versus-Host Disease (oGvHD) will
      evaluate the the investigational drug's effect on signs and symptoms of oGvHD and
      subject-reported hours of duration of comfortable and serviceable scleral lens wear time.

      The study will enroll 38 subjects. In the first 12 weeks, subjects will be randomized 1:1
      active to placebo. At week 12, placebo subjects will cross-over to active drug treatment. At
      week 24, all subjects can opt into an open label phase.

      In clinic visits will occur at weeks 0, 12 and 24 with remote telephone assessments at weeks
      6 and 18. For subjects who opt into the open-label phase, in-clinic visits will occur at
      weeks 36 and 52.

      Safety monitoring for adverse events will be performed at all onsite and remote visits.
