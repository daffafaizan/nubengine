    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the autologous anti-CD19/anti-CD20 CAR-expressing naive/memory T
      cells (CART19/20), including determination of the maximum tolerated dose and assessment for
      replication competent lentivirus (RCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical response. Ia. Overall response rate. Ib. Duration of remission. Ic.
      Progression-free survival. Id. Overall survival. II. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR transgenic
      T-cell persistence. IIa. T-cell monitoring and analyses. IIb. Evidence of B-cell aplasia.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the serum levels of cytokines associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
      in subjects exhibiting > grade-2 CRS following CART19/20 cell treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells.

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes 5, 4, and 3 days before cell infusion.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells IV on day 0. Patients with cytokine
      release syndrome may also receive tocilizumab IV on day 2 at the discretion of the clinical
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily for 14 days, on days 30,
      45, 60, 70, 90, and 120, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for a minimum of 15 years.
