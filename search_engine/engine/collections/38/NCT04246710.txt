      metastatic and recurrent. Substantial neoplastic tissue is only available for the resectable
      group. This is unfortunate as the other groups are those that would benefit the most from
      molecular characterization and identification of markers, which may be predictive and/or
      provide therapeutic stratification. For these categories of patients, only fine needle
      aspiration or small biopsies could be obtained until now. However, the introduction of new
      needles, specifically designed to acquire larger high quality biopsy samples under endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS), has now made it possible to test prognostic, predictive and therapeutic
      stratification markers. However, the applicability of EUS-fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB)
      samples for this purpose has yet to be clinically validated. The working hypothesis of this
      proposal is that the molecular sub-classification of PDAC on EUS-FNB tissue samples could be
      applied for prognostic stratification and therapeutic decision strategies in both resectable
      and unresectable patients using DNA and RNA biomarkers.
