      provide feedback to the user. The use of mass-market sensors such as accelerometers offers a
      promising solution for the general public due to the growing smartphone market over the last
      decade.

      Two previous studies allowed to propose a function named PredEE, which has been tested on
      normal-weighted volunteers.

      This EE estimation function has been tested and improved with data collected from 43
      overweight volunteers equipped with smartphones and two or three research sensors (Fitmate,
      Armband and Actiheart in controlled conditions, and Armband and Actiheart in free-living
      conditions). Research sensors' data serves as reference during the evaluation and improvement
      of the proposed function.

      This EE estimation function using the smartphone technology is dedicated to light- and
      moderate-intensity activities, and the investigators believe it can be a new way to help
      people controlling their daily physical activity level.
