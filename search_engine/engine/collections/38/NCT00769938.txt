      and in the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. When these patients have to undergo
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stenting, there is also an indication for
      treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. However, triple therapy is known to augment the risk
      for bleeding complications.Unfortunately, no prospective data are available to solve this
      issue. Nevertheless, it all comes down to finding the ideal therapy in patients with both
      atrial fibrillation and percutaneous intervention to prevent thrombotic complications (e.g.
      stent thrombosis) without increasing the risk of bleeding. This prospective randomised study
      will assess the hypothesis that in patients on warfarin therapy and indication for elective
      percutaneous intervention, the combination warfarin & clopidogrel 75 mg/day is superior to
      triple therapy treatment in reducing the risk of bleeds while equally safe with respect to
      the prevention of thrombotic complications
