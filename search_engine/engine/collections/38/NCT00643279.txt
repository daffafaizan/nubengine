      study. The purpose of the randomized study was to test the safety of an implantable
      hemodynamic monitor (IHM) and pressure sensor lead. The premise of this study was to compare
      the effectiveness of a novel heart failure management strategy based on information obtained
      from the IHM system in reducing heart failure morbidity compared to a strategy based on
      standard medical care alone.

      After baseline evaluation and verification that entrance criteria were met, all subjects were
      implanted with a Chronicle IHM and pressure sensor lead. Following successful implantation,
      subjects were randomized to either the CHRONICLE group or CONTROL group. Subjects randomized
      to the CHRONICLE group were managed using Chronicle, specifically trended RV and estimated PA
      pressure, heart rate and activity data, whereas subjects randomized to the CONTROL group were
      treated conventionally without the use of the Chronicle data. In the case that implantation
      was not successful, subjects were exited from the study if no procedure related adverse
      events were identified; procedure related adverse events were followed through to resolution
      before the subject were withdrawn from the study.

      Subjects remained randomized until their six month clinic visit had been completed. Following
      the subject's six month visit, clinicians were granted access to the CONTROL subject's
      trended Chronicle data on the Chronicle website, and subjects were seen in the clinic for a
      protocol-required visit every six months until exit from the study.
