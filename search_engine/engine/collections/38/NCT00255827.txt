      be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 25,000 will die of the disease, making it the fifth
      leading cause of U.S. cancer deaths this year despite all current therapy. This protocol
      attempts to exploit an approach to pancreatic cancer immunotherapy using a naturally
      occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in an attempt to vaccinate patients
      against their pancreatic cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with surgically
      resected pancreatic cancer will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a
      vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines (HAPa-1 and HAPa-2)
      that have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and
      immunological responses.
