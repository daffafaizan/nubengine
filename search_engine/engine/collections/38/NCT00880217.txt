    
      This will be a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      investigator nor the patient know the name of the assigned study drug), placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in patients with adult ADHD. The study
      population will include approximately 426 male and female patients, 18 to 55 years of age
      (inclusive) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD, who will be randomly assigned (like flipping a
      coin) in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 6 treatment groups (1 milligrams per day [mg/d]
      JNJ-31001074, 3 mg/d JNJ-31001074, 10 mg/d JNJ 31001074, 80 mg/d atomoxetine HCl, 54 mg/d
      controlled-release [OROS] methylphenidate HCl, or placebo). Study centers will make every
      attempt to include approximately 4 women for every 10 men randomized. The study will consist
      of 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 7 days; a 42-day double-blind treatment phase; and a
      7-day post-treatment phase, in which the investigator staff will call patients 7 days after
      the last dose of study drug, to ask about any adverse events. The total duration of patient
      participation will be approximately 8 weeks. During the screening and double-blind treatment
      phases, patients will have periodic assessments at visits (screening, Day 1, Day 4, Day 7,
      Day 14, Day 28, and Day 42) of the following: severity of ADHD symptoms, including
      inattention and impulsivity; daily function; sleep experience; and cigarette consumption and
      cigarette craving. In addition, patients will be asked to include an adult household member
      to complete the observer version of the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-O:SV) at the
      beginning and end of the study. Patients will take one oral capsules each day in the morning
      upon awakening, either JNJ-31001074 (1, 3, or 10 mg), matching atomoxetine HCL (40 or 80 mg),
      matching OROS methylphenidate HCl (36 or 54 mg), or matching placebo. For atomoxetine HCl,
      patients will receive 40 mg/d for the first 3 days, and 80 mg/d for the remainder of the
      study. For OROS methylphenidate HCl, patients will receive 36 mg/d for the first 3 days, and
      54 mg/d for the remainder of the study.
