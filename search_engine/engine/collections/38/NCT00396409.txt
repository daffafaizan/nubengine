      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to demonstrate the benefit of pre- and
      co-seasonal combination therapy with anti-IgE (omalizumab) and specific immunotherapy
      (Depigoid) in patients with seasonal allergic asthma and co-morbid seasonal allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis. During the open-label period, all patients received Depigoid monotherapy
      for two follow-up seasons every 4 weeks, 26 injections in total. The extension period was
      performed to evaluate the influence of omalizumab on the follow-up treatment with Depigoid in
      seasonal asthma.

      This study was a follow-up to the core IGE025ADE03 study, in which patients received
      omalizumab treatment. In this follow-up study, no patient received omalizumab.
