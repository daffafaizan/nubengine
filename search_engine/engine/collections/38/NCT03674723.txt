      which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine as well as 3
      different amount of Mung beans complemented with rice or wheat. The Mung beans will be cooked
      in a stew served on its own or served with the rice or wheat. The quality of the protein in
      the Mung beans will be compared to the quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving
      you 4 reference diets containing amino acids patterned after the amino acid content of egg
      protein. The amount of Mung beans you receive will be provided in a random order.

      Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min intervals for 1 hour. Breath
      collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th meal every 15 minutes until
      30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will be collected during each of
      the 3rd study day.
