      (CY+) is defined as stage IV disease. In NCCN clinical practice guidelines, it is suggested
      that positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of visible peritoneal implants should be
      considered as M1 disease and surgery as initial treatment is not recommended for patients
      with positive peritoneal cytology. However, in the Japanese gastric cancer treatment
      guidelines 2014, it is suggested that standard gastrectomy can be proposed for patients with
      no other non-curative factors and if the CY+ status was revealed after surgery, postoperative
      treatment with S-1 can be recommended as the tentative standard. Previous studies have also
      proved that extensive intraperitoneal lavage(EIPL) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal
      Chemotherapy(HIPEC) are effective methods for the treatment of peritoneal metastasis.

      In order to optimize the treatment strategy of this part of patients, this trial is designed
      to compare the effectiveness of 2 treatment strategies.
