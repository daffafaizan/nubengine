      Following induced sedation, hypoxia or hypercapnia may follow . Monitoring the CO2 level
      during respiration (capnography) is non-invasive, easy to do, relatively inexpensive, and has
      been studied extensively . End-tidal carbon dioxide is the level of CO2 released at the end
      of an exhaled breath . Capnography provides information about ventilation, perfusion and
      metabolism . Capnography devices are configured as either side stream or mainstream. Side
      stream devices can monitor both intubated and non-intubated patients, while mainstream
      devices are most often limited to intubated patients .

      The Dual guard (made in China) sets a standard in endoscopic practices; it incorporates an
      endoscopy bite block with oxygen delivery and CO2 monitoring for use in upper endoscopy
      procedures through to recovery . It improves patient safety and meets current guidelines for
      consciously sedated patients. The Comfort Rest Bite Block fits securely in the mouth,
      protecting both endoscope and patients' teeth. Simultaneous oral and nasal O2 delivery and
      CO2 sampling for patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy, in either a lateral or supine
      position. Arterial blood gas test results show the patient's acid-base balance, which is
      measured by the hydrogen ion concentration present in the blood, its oxygen saturation,
      partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), concentration
      of bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess and base deficit . Itcan provide information about a
      surgical patient's physiological state, oxygenation, ventilation and indicate the primary
      source of a disturbance (ie, respiratory or metabolic) in homeostasis .
