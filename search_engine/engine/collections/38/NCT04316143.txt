    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre study in patients with PAH who are currently on stable
      treatment with at least one PAH medication. It is planned to evaluate the PK profile (24 hour
      profile and trough levels) and the safety, tolerability and efficacy of four different
      zamicastat doses. Each patient will start treatment with the lowest dose (50 mg zamicastat
      once daily) and the dose will be up-titrated to the individual highest tolerated dose (HTD)
      i.e. up to 200 mg zamicastat once daily.

      A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically review the safety data and will issue
      a recommendation if the doses can be used as planned.

      This study will consist of:

        -  A screening period, 5 to 12 days: visit V1

        -  Up to four dose finding periods, 14 days each:

             -  Dose A: visits A1, A2 and A3

             -  Dose B: visits B2 and B3

             -  Dose C: visits C2 and C3

             -  Dose D: visits D2 and D3

        -  Maintenance period, 42 days: visits MPV1, MPV2 and MPV3

        -  Follow-up period, 14 to 28 days: visits FU (down-titration) and FU
