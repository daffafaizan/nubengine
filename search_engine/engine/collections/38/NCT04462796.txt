      diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (ICSD-3 diagnostic criteria) will be recruited from OSF
      Healthcare Saint Francis Medical Center sleep center and Illinois Neurological Institute.
      RLS/WED patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria during the initial clinic visit
      will be offered study participation. Standard treatment options will be discussed prior to
      the enrollment. Patients will be reassured that not participating in the study will not
      affect the future care they receive at OSF HealthCare. The potential risks and benefits of
      the study will be provided and, if the patient is interested, informed consent will be
      obtained. If the subject withdraws consent or does not finish both pre and post evaluation,
      we will replace the subject with another new recruit. The subject will come to the clinic for
      2 visits, a pre-magnesium visit and a post-magnesium visit. Following the completion of the
      pre-magnesium visit, the subject will be given 200 mg elemental magnesium daily (will be
      instructed to take with food at dinner) for 8 weeks. Both Visits the following study
      procedures will be performed: magnesium level, (International Restless Legs Syndrome) IRLS
      scale, Kohnen Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (KRLS-QOL) scale and
      (Multiple Suggested Immobilization (MSI) test. The post magnesium visit will be schedule at
      the completion of the 8 week dose of magnesium.
