        -  Determine the response rate (partial response or complete remission) in patients with
           metastatic melanoma treated with vaccinia-tyrosinase vaccine, fowlpox-tyrosinase
           vaccine, and high-dose interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the immunologic response, measured by the reactivity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
           and serum immunoglobulins against tyrosinase and melanoma cells, in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccinia-tyrosinase vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 followed
      by fowlpox-tyrosinase vaccine IM on days 15 and 29. Patients then receive high-dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours beginning on day 30 for up to 12 doses
      and again beginning approximately 3 weeks after the initial dose. Patients with stable
      disease or a minor, mixed, or partial response may receive additional courses of
      fowlpox-tyrosinase vaccine (2 doses) and IL-2 as above in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course
      beyond achieving CR.

      Patients are followed annually for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
