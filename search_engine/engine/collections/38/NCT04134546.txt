      significant peri operative morbidity and mortality(1, 2) reduced long term survival(3) and
      quality of life(4, 5) and high rates of subsequent litigation6. It should be regarded as
      preventable.

      The advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bile
      duct injury and its subsequent management. Population based studies(6.7) suggest a
      significant increase in the incidence of injury (0•1 to 0•5 per cent) following the
      implementation of the laparoscopic approach(8) Bile duct injury should be regarded as
      preventable, but over 70 per cent of surgeons regard it as unavoidable(9). Although most
      injuries occur within the surgeon's first 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, one third
      happen after the surgeon has performed more than 200; it is more than inexperience that leads
      to bile duct injury(10). It has been suggested that the commonest cause of common bile duct
      injury is misidentification of biliary anatomy (70-80 per cent of injuries)(11,12),a
      reduction in risk if surgeons perform routine intraoperative cholangiography Recognition of
      bile duct injury at the time of cholecystectomy allows an opportunity for the hepatobiliary
      surgeon to assess its severity and the presence of any vascular injury
