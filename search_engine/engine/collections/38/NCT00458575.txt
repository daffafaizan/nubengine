      human safety study. Nine adult men and women with advanced RP with LP only (first 5
      participants) or not better than HM bilaterally (subsequent 4 participants) in both eyes will
      be enrolled. Participant 5 may have combination visual acuity of LP in the treated eye and no
      better than HM in the fellow eye. Treatment will proceed on a cohort basis ie, Cohort I:
      Participant 1; Cohort II: Participant 2; Cohort III: Participant 3 and 4; Cohort IV:
      Participant 5, 6, and 7; and Cohort V: Participant 8 and 9. The initial participants for each
      cohort must have completed at least 4 weeks of post-treatment follow-up before participants
      in the next cohort may be treated. There are 2 safety assessment phases in this study: the
      main phase approximately 12 months from the time the participant is eligible to enter the
      study and the long-term safety follow-up phase of 4 additional years. The total length of the
      participation in the study could last up to 5 years (including both the main and safety
      follow-up phases).
