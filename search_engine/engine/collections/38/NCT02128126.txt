      high risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). ISA101/ISA101b is a novel therapeutic synthetic long
      peptide (SLP) vaccine targeting HPV16 which is being developed and has shown efficacy in
      patients with high-grade premalignant vulvar lesions caused by HPV with only minor toxicity.
      For most advanced cancers, chemotherapy remains the treatment modality of choice but has been
      considered to be immunosuppressive. However, accumulating evidence indicates that many
      modalities of conventional chemotherapy not only are less immunosuppressive than previously
      thought but in fact can exert favorable effects on the tumor micro-environment by interfering
      with suppressive immune cells and by stimulating the release of immune activating molecules
      by tumor cells. Thus chemotherapy may enhance tumor-specific immunity and synergize with
      cancer immunotherapy. Addition of pegylated interferon alpha (IFNα) two-b (IIb) to
      vaccination might even further improve the immune response. This multicenter, open label,
      non-randomized Phase I/II study will be performed to assess the safety and tolerability of
      the ISA101/ISA101b vaccine, and the immune modulating effects of ISA101 (with or without
      pegylated IFNα)/ISA101b when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with or without
      bevacizumab.
