      worsen, and how exercise and nutritional supplements may impact this process. The
      investigator would like to see whether a nutritional supplement (Remune) with or without a
      walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP©®, Exercise for Cancer Patients)
      can improve symptoms in patients with lung or gastrointestinal cancers with weight loss and
      cachexia. The investigator would also like to find out if this nutritional supplement and
      exercise intervention improves physical performance, day-to-day function, quality of life,
      and how the supplement and/or exercise may affect different markers in the blood over time.
