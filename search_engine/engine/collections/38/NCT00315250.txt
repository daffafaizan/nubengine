      neurologist and have a questionable diagnosis of PD will be recruited to participate in this
      study. Subjects will be referred by the neurologists to the Institute for Neurodegenerative
      Disorders (IND) in New Haven, CT.

      All subjects will be clinically evaluated at IND by a two movement disorders experts. At the
      baseline visit all subjects will also undergo [123I]ß-CIT SPECT ANAM, voice acoustics,
      olfactory, Spiral and biochemical testing. Each movement disorders expert will make an
      initial clinical diagnosis at baseline and again within three months follow-up. At the three
      month visit one movement disorder expert will be provided the DAT imaging data and will
      review that data with the subjects and referral physician. The other movement disorders
      physician will remain blind to the imaging and all other biomarker data. The blinded movement
      disorders expert will provide a final clinical diagnosis at the 12 month follow-up visit,
      which will represent the 'gold standard' diagnosis in this study. Statistical analysis to
      determine the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM, voice acoustics, olfactory, Spiral and
      biochemical testing compared to [123I]ß-CIT SPECT, and the gold standard clinical diagnosis
      will be completed. All subjects with DAT deficit and 10% of those without DAT deficit will be
      asked to return for repeat evaluation at 24 months.
