      ill individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and arrhythmias. This project utilizes the
      concept of 'hot-spotting' in that investigators will aim to target individuals with the
      highest health care needs, which investigators have defined to be patients with these
      diagnoses who showed the highest health care utilization rates over the previous 12-month
      period based on reimbursement data from a large health care third party administrator.
      Investigators aim to determine if wireless monitoring can reduce health care service
      utilization and thus health care costs for the small number of patients who spend the
      greatest number of health care dollars, thereby cutting the overall amount of health care
      spending dramatically.

      Furthermore, investigators will be assessing whether or not access to health measurement data
      and the possibility of receiving feedback from a study staff member will increase the
      compliance of patients to their medication regimen, recommended diet and exercise. It is
      anticipated that armed with their own health data, these patients will be less likely to need
      acute care visits

      Study participants will be employees of Scripps Health or dependents of employees covered
      with Scripps insurance, administered by third-party administrator, Health Comp. In addition,
      patients will be currently enrolled or willing to enroll in Health Comp's Disease Management
      program. Investigators predict that in addition to participation in the program, wireless
      monitoring will be associated with decreased inpatient health service utilization (hospital
      admissions, days of hospitalization) and decreased outpatient health service utilization
      (emergency department visits, need-based primary care clinic visits, and need-based specialty
      clinic visits). Investigators predict that these decreases will translate into significant
      reductions in health care costs for the treatment group relative to a control group and
      relative to pre-monitoring utilization rates.
