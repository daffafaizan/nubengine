      blood coagulation analysis and which is suitable for use in surgical and intensive care
      settings. The Quantra System employs a patented technology named sonorheometry, which was
      invented at the University of Virginia.

      Sonorheometry uses ultrasound pulses to characterize the dynamic changes in viscoelastic
      properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot lysis. The initial assay performed
      on the Quantra System will be the surgical assay for monitoring hemostasis during major
      surgical procedures in adult patients.

      A clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the analytical performance as well as compared
      to existing coagulation monitoring technology
