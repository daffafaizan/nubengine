      (Arm A) or rituximab in combination with chlorambucil (Arm B). The primary objective of this
      study is to compare the efficacy of acalabrutinib relative to chlorambucil plus rituximab in
      subjects with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia without del(17p) or TP53
      mutation.
