      be accomplished by measuring the rate of glucose binding in various brain regions by Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) after glucose load with exenatide injection and compare it with
      placebo injection measured in the same subject. The changes will be compared with peripheral
      and hepatic glucose metabolism and lipolysis.
