    
      The Ventavis® (iloprost) Registry is a multicenter, observational, U.S.-based study that
      longitudinally follows patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who have been
      receiving therapy with Ventavis® for at least 3 months. Patients diagnosed with WHO Group I
      PAH and who are on a stable regimen of commercial Ventavis® will be followed for a maximum of
      2 years from the time of enrollment. All data will be collected via patient interview and/or
      review of the medical record, as well as from I-neb® downloads using INSIGHT software.
      Adherence with Ventavis® will be compared before and after targeted instruction on inhalation
      techniques by a respiratory therapist or designee, as well as before and after participation
      in PAH patient support groups (if applicable). Quarterly data collection will include capture
      of PAH and non-PAH medications and Ventavis® adherence data; Ventavis® adherence data will
      also be collected one month after study entry.
