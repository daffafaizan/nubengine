      providing a computer-based program (CBT4CBT), used for the treatment of substance use
      disorders, in a church setting. Forty Black adults with a current DSM-5 alcohol or substance
      use disorder will utilize the 'CBT for CBT' program over a period of 8 weeks. Primary
      outcomes will be acceptability and feasibility of providing the treatment in a church
      setting. If found to be acceptable and feasible, with preliminary promise for reductions in
      substance use, the next step would be to adapt the computer intervention for this population
      and conduct a randomized controlled trial.
