      little is known about the predictive value of single factors.

      In addition to medical (physical) factors, depression, anxiety, somatization and avoiding
      coping styles are considered as relevant for the successful recovery process. These factors
      may be defined as "psychological distress" and could be used as predictors for perioperative
      complications and failed surgical treatment.

      Postoperative outcome is defined (1) as postoperative complications and organ dysfunction and
      (2) alteration of quality of life.

      Our sample includes adults undergoing extensive surgical interventions in trauma and
      orthopaedic surgery, urology, general surgery, and neurosurgery. The defined variables are
      measured using standardized and validated questionnaires prior to surgery and in follow-up
      visits.
