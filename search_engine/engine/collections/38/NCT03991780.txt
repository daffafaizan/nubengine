      recipient's immune system recognises the transplant kidney as foreign and attacks it. One
      common form of rejection is due to the recipient developing antibodies against their kidney
      transplant. Spleen tyrosine kinase is a molecule present in immune cells which is important
      in the process of antibody mediated damage. Fostamatinib is a drug which inhibits spleen
      tyrosine kinase.

      This clinical trial will recruit 10 patients who have a renal transplant and a diagnosis of
      antibody mediated rejection. Patients will be given Fostamatinib for 12 months and will
      undergo a renal biopsy at 6 months and at a 12 months in order to determine whether the
      histological signs of antibody mediated rejection have either improved or not progressed.
