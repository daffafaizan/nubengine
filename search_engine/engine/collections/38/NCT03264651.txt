      breast cancer and the masking of malignancy within the breast. Previous chemoprevention
      studies have revealed that only tamoxifen is efficacious in premenopausal women in the
      reduction of breast cancer. In order for this to occur mammographic density has to be
      reduced. Unfortunately the side effect profile of tamoxifen is such that not many women are
      taking up this therapeutic intervention. This trial is trying to establish a combination
      therapy to reduce mammographic breast density.

      This phase 1 pilot study is combining oral enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor
      modulator, and oral anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, to study the impact of this
      combination treatment on mammographic breast density and breast elasticity. Safety and
      tolerability we also analyzed.
