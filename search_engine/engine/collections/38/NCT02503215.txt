    
      Investigators will apply the following methods:

        -  Sleep study, performed through polysomnography

        -  Fluid redistribution, by bioimpedance analysis

        -  Autonomic nervous system evaluation, by spectral heart rate variability analysis.

      The study protocol comprises two moments: baseline evaluation (in patients with diagnosed
      sleep apnea) and after using compression stockings for a one-week period.
