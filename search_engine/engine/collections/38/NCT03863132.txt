      flow from the heart into the Aorta, and is associated with symptoms like fatigue,
      breathlessness, dizziness, fainting, and chest pain. For many of the patients suffering from
      severe aortic stenosis surgical or catheter-assisted repair or replacement of the damaged
      aortic valve has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment option.

      Probably about 20-30% of patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis display a deviation
      from the usually observed disease pattern: These patients do not show the typical high
      pressure difference between the left ventricle (heart chamber) and the aorta (transvalvular
      gradient; "paradoxical" low flow/low gradient aortic stenosis). For these patients it is not
      yet clear, if microsurgical repair of the aortic valve (transcatheter aortic valve repair -
      TAVR) should be a treatment option as well.

      REBOOT-PARADOX evaluates whether TAVR is advantageous compared to optimal medical Treatment
      alone for patients suffering from paradoxical aortic stenosis. Two thirds of the
      participating patients will be treated by TAVR, one third will receive medical Treatment
      alone.
