      last four decades, several classification systems have been proposed for epileptic seizures.
      The recent position paper of the International League Against Epilepsy defines 63
      seizure-types. While this complex system might be useful for detailed phenotyping, currently
      there is no evidence that each of these seizure-types needs different clinical management
      strategy, and many clinicians find it difficult to implement.

      To help physicians with optimizing the choice of AEDs, the investigators developed a
      simplified seizure classification, consisting of the minimal number of seizure-types,
      necessary for choice of AEDs, and the investigators developed an algorithm that identifies
      the patient´s seizure-type, based on a set of 10 simple questions, that can be answered by
      physicians even without extensive training in epilepsy. The current form of the algorithm was
      developed for patients whose seizures started in adolescence or adulthood (at the age of 10
      years or older).

      In this study, the investigators aim to validate the diagnostic algorithm, by comparing the
      seizure-type identified by the algorithm with the diagnosis and seizure-type as defined by
      trained experts, in the clinical workup of the patients.
