      expansion of harm reduction services for people who inject drugs (PWID) and people who use
      opioids (PWUO) residing in high risk areas of rural southern Illinois. This study record
      describes one component of the larger Ending transmission of HIV, HCV, and STDs and overdose
      in rural communities of people who inject drugs (ETHIC) study Community Response Plan (CRP)
      framework, specifically the expansion of harm reduction services intervention (HRS). The aim
      is to assess the effectiveness of expansion of evidenced based harm reduction services
      through our CRP framework comprising: a) geographically targeted recruitment based on hot
      spot and vulnerability analyses, b) community engagement, c) recruitment via Respondent
      Driven Sampling (RDS), d) expanded surveillance for HIV and HCV, and e) concomitant HCV and
      opioid use treatment capacity expansion through the Extension of Community Healthcare
      Outcomes (ECHO) model. Examination of facilitators and barriers impacting implementation of
      service delivery is evaluated through mixed methods process evaluation. The Type 1 Hybrid
      design is supported by conditions including the existing evidence based for benefits and
      minimal harm of "harm reduction services" and strong base for applicability of this
      intervention in the study setting (ie rural opioid use)
