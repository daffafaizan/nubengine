      physicians need a tracking system for specific treatment modalities, and data to determine
      the impact of endoscopic ultrasound for patients with gastric variceal bleeding. Gastric
      variceal bleeding is a severe complication of portal hypertension with significant morbidity
      and mortality with limited therapeutic options. Currently, there is no database in existence
      for endoscopic ultrasound clinical research for specific procedures. Also, there is limited
      data regarding the outcome of endoscopic sclerotherapy with cyanoacrylate in the United
      States.
