      than 28%. The TACE treatment, under the theoretical basis of blood supply of Liver cancer, is
      obviously better than the other non-surgical therapy, in terms of tumor regression, AFP
      decrease, survival time and the evaluation of the quality of life. Licartin injection is a
      antibody drug with new target and the only drug that China own the intellectual property
      rights. It has specific high affinity with HAb18G/CD147, the liver cell membrane antigen.
      Labeled 131I is taken to the liver tissue, owning high-dose concentration and releasing Î²
      particles to liver cancer cells to and kill cancer cells.

      The Second Military Medical University, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, planed to use
      the treatment of Licartin combined with TACE for the patients of unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma and evaluate the difference of tumor size, AFP change, TTP, the overall survival
      rate between different treatment group.
