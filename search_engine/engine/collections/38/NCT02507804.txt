    
      This is a randomised, controlled, single-centred study to compare the quality of Adverse
      Events (AE) and Concomitant Medication (CM) reporting, patient satisfaction, care experience
      and quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and managed with/without a
      diary for Patient Reported Outcome Measures.

      164 subjects will be enrolled and randomised in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by line of therapy
      (first line vs second line or higher line), treatment intent (curative vs palliative) and
      ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2-3).

      All subjects will receive standard chemotherapy delivered as per institutional practice. They
      will also receive counselling on monitoring and reporting side effects, medication and
      experiences as per standard practice.

      All subjects will complete a study questionnaire and EQ-5D forms in the Outpatient Department
      prior to the consultation and delivery of chemotherapy.

      Subjects randomised to Arm A will use the PROMs diary to record side effects, medication and
      experiences associated with cycles 1-6 of chemotherapy. The diary will be reviewed by the
      study team to collect AE and CM information. AE/CM will be recorded in source documents as
      per usual practice.

      Subjects randomised to the control Arm B will discuss side effects, medication and
      experiences associated with cycles 1-6 of chemotherapy at clinical consultations as per
      standard practice. This may include the use of notes, diaries or other methods at their own
      discretion. Arm B subjects may not use a PROMs diary. The study team will collect and record
      AE/CM information in the source documentation as per usual practice.
