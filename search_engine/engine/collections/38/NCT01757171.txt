    
      Prior to initiating protocol therapy, patients will undergo screening evaluations, to be done
      within 30 days of protocol initiation unless otherwise noted.

      Patients who are taxane na√Øve will be assigned to arm A and patients who have had prior
      taxane therapy will be assigned to Arm B. Each arm will be analyzed separately for the
      primary study endpoint of 3 month progression free survival rate (PFS), as defined as the
      time from the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death. Cabazitaxel
      will be administered 20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks.

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until
      disease progression; intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment;
      unacceptable adverse event(s); patient decides to withdraw; general or specific changes in
      the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment
      of the investigator.

      Patients will be followed for 6 months after removal from study or until death, whichever
      occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
