      patient nor investigator knows which patient gets which study medication, i.e. CG5503,
      placebo, oxycodone), placebo and active control study. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of orally administered tapentadol (CG5503) prolonged-release (PR) at
      doses of 100-250 mg (base) twice daily in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study will consist of five periods: screening (to assess
      eligibility), washout (3-7 days with determination of a baseline pain intensity), titration
      (of dose over 3 weeks to the optimal individual level), maintenance (investigational drug
      intake for 12 weeks with adjustments allowed), and follow-up (2 weeks after end of
      treatment). The study hypothesis is that the study drug will be more effective than placebo
      in reducing patients' pain intensity. The secondary objectives include the collection of
      pharmacokinetic (related to how the body absorbs, distributes, changes and excretes the drug)
      information for dose verification. The efficacy objectives will be assessed by comparing the
      baseline pain level to the pain level during the maintenance period. This will be done by
      looking at the patients' pain diary information (electronic diaries).
