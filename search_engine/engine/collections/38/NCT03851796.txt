      parent (BMI > 25 kg/m2). Families will participate in one of two 4-month treatments: 1)
      TEENS+ Parents as Coaches (PAC), engaging parents as helpers in their child's weight
      management, or 2) TEENS+ Parent Weight Loss (PWL), engaging parents in their own weight
      management. All adolescents will participate in TEENS+, which includes behavioral support,
      nutrition education, and supervised physical activity.

      For adolescents, the intervention will consist of weekly behavioral weight management group
      sessions and weekly 1 hour exercise sessions. Each adolescent also has a monthly individual
      session with a behavior coach. Parent groups meet weekly for 1 hour according to treatment
      arm (PAC or PWL). All PWL sessions are separate from their adolescent. Bi-weekly sessions in
      the PAC arm are combined with parents and adolescent. Assessments will consist of
      anthropometric measures, psychological surveys and dietary and PA evaluations. Assessments
      will be completed at baseline, 2 months, 4 months (post-test), 8 months and 1 year.
