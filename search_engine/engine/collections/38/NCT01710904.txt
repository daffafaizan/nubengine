      weeks and are monitored during study 3 visits. Parameters assessed are pain relief,
      constipation, use of laxatives, use of analgesic rescue medication, use of concomitant
      medication, quality of life and safety of Targinact® treatment. These parameters, except for
      safety assessment, are compared between Targinact® treatment and previous analgesic treatment
