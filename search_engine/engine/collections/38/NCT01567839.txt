      primary mandibular first molar infiltration of 1.8 mL of 4% articaine with 1:100,000
      epinephrine, 1.8 mL of 4% prilocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 1.8 mL of 4% lidocaine
      with 1:100,000 epinephrine in three separate appointments spaced at least one week apart.
      With the crossover design, 180 infiltrations will be given for the first molar and each
      subject will serve as his or her own control. Ninety infiltrations will be administered on
      the mandibular left side and ninety administered on the mandibular right side. The order of
      the three injections will be assigned randomly and the dentist and subject will be blinded
      about which anesthetic the subject is given. The anesthetics used in this study are not
      experimental. An electric pulp tester will be used to test the lower back teeth (molars and
      premolars) for anesthesia in 3-minute time intervals for a total of 60 minutes. The pain of
      injection and postoperative pain will be recorded in a survey. The data will be statistically
      analyzed.
