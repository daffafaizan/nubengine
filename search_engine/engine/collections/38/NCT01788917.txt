      cardiovascular risk factors and prevent lifestyle diseases.

      The major dietary source of EPA and DHA is seafood (seaweeds and fatty cold water fishes),
      but they can also be found in lean red meat, in organ meats such as liver and brain.
      Vegetarians who do not eat meat or fish, have very low or negligible intakes of EPA (< 5 mg
      EPA/d) and DHA.

      The purpose of the present study is to explore the tissue distribution and inter-conversion
      of ALA to n-3 LC-PUFA as consequence of linseed oil supplementation in vegetarians.

      Eight vegetarians (3 m; 5 f) who do not eat meat, fish or seaweeds such as algae foods since
      least two years ago and two subjects (1 m; 1w) who consume the normal western style diet
      living in Jena (Germany) entered the study. The participants consumed 10 mL linseed oil per
      day for 10 weeks. The resulting daily dose of ALA was approx. 5.7 g/d.
