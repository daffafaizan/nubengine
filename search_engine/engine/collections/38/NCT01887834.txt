    
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effects of the three strain probiotic,
      Kyo-Dophilus, on the symptoms associated with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome. A previous
      pilot clinical trial identified individuals with severe IBS to be most likely to benefit from
      the treatment provided in this trial.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of Kyo-Dophilus on the
      symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in an adult population diagnosed with
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome by ROME III criteria and classified as severe through the Irritable
      Bowel Severity Scoring System and to measure quality of life and global well-being of
      patients through the Adequate Relief Criteria and the Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of
      Life Questionnaire.

      The secondary objective is to assess the tolerability of the treatment through the use of
      Adverse Event Reporting Forms.
