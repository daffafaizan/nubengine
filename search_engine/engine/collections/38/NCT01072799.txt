      Part A is to evaluate the safety of the H1N1 VLP vaccine and to evaluate immunogenicity and
      select a dose for Part B. In Part A, 1,000 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to a
      1:1:1:1 schedule (5µg, 15µg and 45µg doses of H1N1 VLP vaccine or placebo. Subjects will
      receive two intramuscular (IM) injections (0.5mL/dose) of the H1N1 VLP vaccine or placebo 21
      days apart. Blood for HAI assays will be collected at 3 time points (baseline, Day 14 and Day
      36). Subjects will be followed for all adverse events (AEs) from the first day of the study
      through 21 days after the second dose (Day 36). Subjects will be followed for serious AEs and
      significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) to the end of the study 6 months post-dose 2 (Day
      194).

      Once the first 500 subjects are enrolled into Part A, enrollment will be halted until 3 days
      of safety follow-up data are reviewed by the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). A
      second data review will occur following Day 14 visit for Part A to select the dose to be
      administered in Part B.

      Part B of the study will be conducted to evaluate safety and accumulate enough safety data to
      potentially move forward with broader use of the vaccine assuming favorable results. In Part
      B, a total of 3,250 - 3,750 subjects will be randomized to receive the selected dose of H1N1
      VLP vaccine or placebo. A total of 3,000 H1N1 VLP vaccine recipients at the selected dose or
      higher, and 1,250 placebo recipients will be enrolled in Parts A and B. Following completion
      of Day 36 in Part A, data may be reviewed to assess 1 injection vs. 2 injections in Part B.
