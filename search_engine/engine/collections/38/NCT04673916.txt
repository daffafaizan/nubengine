      clobetasol (clobetasol gel 0.05%), or an anti-inflammatory mouthwash (mouthwash which
      contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)
      for 3-months. At baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1), patients were subjected to clinical
      and oral assessments and were evaluated for the symptoms (Numerical Pain Scale, NRS score)
      and signs (Thongprasom's score) of OLP. Data were calculated using T-test for the dependent
      variable, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Witney u test.
