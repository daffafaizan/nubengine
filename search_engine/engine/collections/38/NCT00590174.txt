      patients enrolled at 19 centers in Korea. Among all patients enrolled in the ZEST (Comparison
      of the Efficacy of Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent versus Sirolimus-Eluting Stent versus
      PacliTaxel-Eluting Stent for Coronary Lesions) trial, event-free patients who survived the
      first 12 months without nonfatal MI or repeat revascularization will be randomized to
      discontinue clopidogrel therapy at 12 months after DES implantation. All patients will be
      followed for another 12 months.
