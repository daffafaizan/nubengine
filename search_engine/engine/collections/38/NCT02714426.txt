      and selected time-varying covariates. The study will involve comparison of two groups of
      adults aged 65 and older. Half the participants (n=20) will be randomized to received eight
      weeks of mindfulness-inspired training, while the other half (n=20) are not.

      Groups will be compared in the amount of change experienced in measures of attentional
      control. In addition, the association between changes in emotion regulation, perceived
      mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering with changes in attentional control will be
      examined, as well as whether this association differs between persons who did and did not
      receive mindfulness-inspired training. Measurement will include both paper-and-pencil and
      computer-administered tests.
