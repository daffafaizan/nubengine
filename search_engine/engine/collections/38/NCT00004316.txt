    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients with interstitial cystitis are
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 pain control therapies.

      The first group is treated with capsaicin. A second group is given individually titrated
      doses of capsaicin: the dose is increased as tolerated or until symptomatic response is
      acceptable. A control group receives a placebo. Therapy for all groups is administered
      intravesically every week for 5 weeks.

      Patients with vulvar vestibulitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pain control therapies. One
      group applies topical capsaicin cream to the painful area 4 times a day for 6 weeks. The dose
      is individually titrated if burning discomfort persists and the patient is compliant with the
      application schedule. The control group applies a placebo.

      Patients with vulvar vestibulitis may continue or cross to capsaicin for 6 additional weeks.
