      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. According to investigators previous work,
      participants with ADHD have executive dysfunction. Previous studies show that tryptophan is
      associated with cognitive problems in participants. Analyzing differences in tryptophan
      metabolites (Indolepropionic acid [IPA], indoleacetic acid [IAA], and kynurenic acid [KYNA])
      between participants with ADHD and healthy controls could provide insight into underlying
      disease pathology of cognitive deficits. In this one-year project, investigators will perform
      an analysis of tryptophan metabolites in serum to identify potential biomarkers for the
      executive dysfunction of ADHD.
