      I. Determine the antitumor activity of bortezomib in patients with persistent or recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
