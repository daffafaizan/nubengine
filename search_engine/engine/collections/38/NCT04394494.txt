    
      -  Patient arrive to physical therapy with low back pain (physician referral or
           self-referral)

        -  Patient complete standard clinic medical and insurance intake forms

        -  Based on the intake forms, patients are screened by the physical therapists against the
           inclusion criteria and if met, asked to participate in the study

        -  Upon agreement, a written consent is signed

        -  Patients complete research intake forms:

             -  Demographic information

        -  Age

        -  Gender

        -  Duration of LBP

        -  Location of LBP (body chart with grid allocation)

             -  Pain rating (NPRS): Numeric Pain Rating Scale

             -  Fear-Avoidance (Physical and Work Subscales) (FABQ)

             -  Pain Catastrophization Scale (PCS)

        -  Patients undergo a standard physical therapy interview

        -  Patients undergo a standard physical therapy examination

        -  Patients undergo a directional preference test to determine if they are potentially
           responsive to extension exercises

        -  Once patients are shown to be responsive to extension, they are alternately allocated to
           receive motor imagery of extension exercises (experimental group; [EG]) or physical
           extension exercises (control group, [CG]).

        -  Prior to the treatment lumbar extension ROM will be measured via a standardized
           procedure

        -  Upon completion of the tests, patients will receive one of two allocated treatments

      Following the treatment, patients will undergo repeat measures of:

        -  Spinal extension ROM

        -  Pain rating

        -  Fear of movement

        -  Pain catastrophization Patients will be asked to return to physical therapy in 2 to 3
           days (standard care)

      Upon return, measurements will be repeated of:

        -  Pain rating

        -  Fear of movement

        -  Pain catastrophization

        -  Spinal extension ROM This marks the end of data collection (and study) of the individual
           patient - Following the tests the patient is treated per the discretion of the therapist
           as the data collection has been completed
