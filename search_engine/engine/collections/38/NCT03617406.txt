      standard LDDSE will be performed. The stroke volume (SV) will be recorded. The addition of VC
      with the passive leg raise method at peak dobutamine dose will be performed. A
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with low dose dobutamine and a bolus of normal saline
      will be performed as a validation method to measure AVA with the planimetry method. The SV
      will be recorded. Proportion of patient receiving the diagnosis of true severe AS defined as
      a combination of AVA <1.0 cm2 and ∆SV ≥ 20% will be compared between standard LDDSE and LDDSE
      with addition of VC. Calculating sensitivity, specificity, performing ROC curve analysis and
      calculating the Youden-index, the accuracy of the test method (LDDSE plus passive leg
      raising) for the detection of truly severe AS in comparison with the reference method (TEE)
      will be determined.
