    
      This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound using microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid; DefinityÂ®) when used to
      evaluate renal lesions in two different populations; patients with known renal tumors (Cohort
      1) and patients with a risk factor for renal malignancy in whom their screening ultrasound
      shows an indeterminate or possibly malignant renal mass (Cohort 2).
