      of Obstetrics and Gynecology between 10.02.2017 and 10.08.2017 with 221 patients who had
      undergone hysterectomy for benign disorders. The patients who were admitted to the hospital
      with the hysterectomy indications for benign pathologies were visited before the operation
      and a detailed anamnesis was obtained. Physical and pelvic examinations with transvaginal
      ultrasound examinations were performed by the same investigator. Demographic characteristics,
      obstetric and gynecologic histories were noted. The amount of percieved pain was measured
      with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Observing myometrial cysts, enlarged uterus, heterogeneous
      myometrium and or focal nodular areas during transvaginal sonography was considered to
      suggest adenomyosis. The hysterectomy specimes were evaluated by department of pathology. The
      diagnosis of adenomyosis was based on the presence of glandular extension â‰¥2.5 mm below the
      endometrial myometrial interface.

      In order to develop a scoring system a regression analysis was carried out to find the
      parameters that were associated with the presence of adenomyosis. Number of parities,
      dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea VAS scores, age of menarche, presence of uterine tenderness and
      detection of heterogenous myometrium and myometrial cysts during ultrasonography were found
      to be the significant parameters.
