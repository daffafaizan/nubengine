    
      The Zimmer Maxera Cup is a monoblock construct that consists of a preassembled shell and
      liner. The ceramic liner articulates with a ceramic femoral head for a ceramic-on-ceramic
      large diameter head articulation.

      The BIOLOXÂ® delta ceramic liner (insert) is preassembled to lock into the tapered shell's
      cavity and articulate with BIOLOX OPTION ceramic femoral heads, sizes 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48
      mm and standard BIOLOX delta ceramic femoral head sizes 32, 36, and 40 mm.

      This is a single center post-market clinical evaluation. A consecutive series of 32 patients
      treated with a Maxera Cup (outer diameter 64 mm or 66 mm) between Nov 2011 and Feb 2018 will
      be identified and invited to participate in the study.
