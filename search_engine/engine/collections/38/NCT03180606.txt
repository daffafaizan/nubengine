      shift in elderly care, with outcome measures not only related to primary medical or
      functional measures. The analyses will widen the view to overall societal costs and effects
      of changes in key institutions of social security as well as to hidden mechanisms in the
      governance system of care and health care of elderly.

      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the extent to which a differentiated
      (personalized) and targeted primary care intervention provided to a statistically predicted
      risk population of elderly, results in care that is more effective and of higher quality than
      that of a control group receiving standard care. In a pragmatic multicenter primary care
      setting (n= 1600), an evidence based prediction model to find elderly (75+) with high risk
      for complex medical care or hospitalization is used followed by a differentiated and directed
      medical and social care to this risk group, in comparison to usual care. The intervention
      will include all the latest evidence based tools in the care of elderly (multi-professional
      team, social support, medical care home-visits, telephone support, general practitioner
      visits, etc).

      The investigators also aim to study the care model in a broader sense; experiences of the
      elderly, their social networks and diversity. Finally, the project will also investigate how
      the health care system, from specific health care professionals (primary care nurses,
      doctors, para-medical staff) to management levels and politicians influence the
      implementation of the present and future care models. One specific subproject focuses on the
      mechanisms behind the inability of steak holders/politicians and top administrative
      executives to find efficient governance principals for elderly care and health care, despite
      already available knowledge sources.
