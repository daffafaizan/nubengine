      Program Companies (RPC) are required to submit FDA assessment reports on a regular basis. The
      present study is one of several program evaluation components carried out in support
      Assessment 5: Surveillance monitoring for misuse, abuse, overdose, addiction, death and
      intervention taken. This study will evaluate the impact of the ER/LA opioid REMS program on
      the incidence of ED visits and hospitalizations for overdose/poisoning and death among
