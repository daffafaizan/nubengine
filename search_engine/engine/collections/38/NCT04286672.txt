      common malignancy in males and seventeenth most common in females.

      In Egypt, bladder cancer represents a massive health burden where it is one of the commonest
      cancers representing 6.9% in both sexes and 10.7% among men. Its distribution is 8.8% in
      lower Egypt, 14.2% in middle Egypt and 12.6% in upper Egypt.Almost 50% of patients will
      experience recurrence of their disease within 4 years of their initial diagnosis.The
      prognosis of bladder cancer is poor as a result of highly invasive properties of tumour
      cells.

      The optimal treatment selection depends on early diagnosis as well as accurate staging and
      grading.Currently there is a need for new molecular bio markers that can help clinicians to
      identify patients requiring early, aggressive treatment.

      Metadherin (MTDH) is an oncogene known as Astrocytic elevated gene-1(AEG-1).It was firstly
      identified in 2002 at fetal astrocytes of persons exposed to HIV-1 and then known as a vital
      oncogene mediating carcinogenesis,prognosis,invasion and cancer metastasis. AEG-1 expression
      is raised in bladder cancer tissues relative to normal tissues, and serves as a poor
      prognostic factor.
