      receive either steroid given IV or with the nerve block, the subject is anesthetized and the
      subject will receive either an IV injection of 5 cc steroids or placebo, and 20 cc local
      anesthetic plus placebo or steroid in the nerve block, the block will be placed under
      ultrasound to insure proper placement of block, the dose of steroid is based on weight, 0.1 -
      0.15 mg/kg. The investigator will record the time of block and IV injection. The subjects
      will be called by the study PI after 24 hours to determine the time of duration and again at
      48 hours if needed. This is a randomized, double blind study, neither the subject or the
      anesthesiologist giving the injection will know what is being given. The medications will be
      prepared and dispensed by the Research pharmacist, a randomization chart will be obtained by
      the research pharmacist.
