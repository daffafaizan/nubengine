      steroid with rituximab and steroid with cyclophosphamide to eradicate anti-factor VIII
      antibodies in Chinese patients with acquired hemophilia A.

      Patients will be randomized to two regimens: methylprednisolone 0.8mg/kg/day (or equivalent
      corticosteroid doses) for 3 weeks (then tapering gradually,8 weeks in total) with rituximab
      (375mg/m2 for one dose) or methylprednisolone 0.8mg/kg/day (or equivalent corticosteroid
      doses) for 3 weeks (then tapering gradually,8 weeks in total) with cyclophosphamide
      2mg/kg/day until inhibitor negative(no longer than five weeks).

      Patients will be randomized to the treatment cohorts according to the biostatistical methods.
