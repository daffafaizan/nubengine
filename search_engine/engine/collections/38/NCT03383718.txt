      myocardial ischaemia in patients with moderate coronary artery stenosis, although the
      prognostic value for "hard" endpoints such as myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death
      is equivocal.

      Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe non-invasive functional test
      for myocardial ichaemia evaluation. There are robust data confirming the prognostic value of
      DSE regarding the same "hard" endpoints.

      In patients with SCAD there are clear recommendations in the recent guidelines both for DSE
      guided or FFR guided revascularization but the data about prognosis is limited, especially in
      the case of FFR guidance. The outcome is also equivocal if there is a difference between the
      invasive and non-invasive test result.

      In patients with acute myocardial infarction, more than 50% of patients have multivessel
      disease. There are clear recommendations for the management of infarct related artery,
      however controversy still exists for the management of angiographically moderate NCLs.

      In DSE vs. FFR prospective trial, the Investigators plan to perform both the DSE and FFR
      tests in the above mentioned clinical settings, to investigate the correlation between them.
      The causes of differences between them would be investigated as well as the prognostic impact
      of reclassification by a second test (either DSE or FFR).

      If both tests are positive, revascularisation is planned to be performed (PCI Group). In
      cases of either double negative or mismatching tests, optimal medical therapy will be chosen
      (OMT Group) with clinical follow up of at least 2 years.
