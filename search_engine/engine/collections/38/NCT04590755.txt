      fathers and their primary school-aged children, to prevent overweight and obesity. There is
      focused on increasing (co-) physical activity and limiting individual and joint screen time.
      The project specifically targets fathers and their children because the literature shows that
      now often only mothers participate in lifestyle interventions, and fathers are
      underrepresented and difficult to involve. However, fathers play an important and unique
      role, independently of the mother, in shaping the child's behavior.

      The Run Daddy Run intervention was developed based on the Intervention Mapping Protocol, a
      theoretical framework that is often used to develop interventions in a systematic way using
      empirical evidence and theoretical insights. A co-creation approach was also used for the
      intervention development, which is a bottom-up approach in which the target group (fathers in
      this case) is actively involved in the development of the intervention. The result of this
      approach is contextually appropriate intervention and intervention strategies.
