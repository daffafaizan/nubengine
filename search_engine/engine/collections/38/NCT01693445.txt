      combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer.
      Oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and 5-FU have different mechanisms of actions and do not share the
      toxicity profiles. Since they have a synergistic effect, many clinical trials have been
      conducted recently to evaluate the efficacy of triplet combination consisting of oxaliplatin,
      irinotecan, and 5-FU, and demonstrated that the triple combination regimen was effective and
      resulted in survival benefits with favorable toxicity profiles.

      S-1 and capecitabine are novel oral fluoropyrimidines and different phase III trials have
      shown that these oral agents are at least as active and effective as 5-FU with a superior
      safety profile.

      Biweekly triple combination of S-1 with oxaliplatin and irinotecan (OIS) is an interesting
      alternative to increase convenience and to simply the treatment delivery.

      In the present study, we attempt to determine the feasibility of OIS combination, the maximum
      tolerated dose and the recommended doses of the agents used, and to preliminarily evaluate
      the antitumor activity in untreated patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer.
