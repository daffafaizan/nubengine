    
      Stroke patients will be assessed on 2 days with an interval of 3 days (Friday - Monday).

      Day 1 (Friday): shear wave velocity (SWV) will be assessed by 2 assessors in randomised
      order. Each assessor will evaluate SWV of 6 shoulder muscles (m. supraspinatus, m.
      infraspinatus, m. rhomboid major, m. deltoideus, m. pectoralis major, m. pectoralis minor).

      At the end of the assessment secondary outcome measures will be assessed.

      Day 2 (Monday): SWV will be reassessed by assessor 1 to measure test-retest reliability.

      Position of the patient will be changed. SWV of the pectoralis major and minor muscle will be
      reassessed.

      Assessor 2 will perform a transversal stretch of the m. pectoralis major or a passive
      mobilisation of the hand at the hemiplegic arm of the stroke patients. Assessor 1 will
      reassess the SWV of the pectoralis major and minor muscle to assess if there is an immediate
      effect of the intervention. Assessor 1 will be blinded for the intervention.

      Healthy controls (matched for age, gender and BMI):

      Only one test day to assess SWV of 6 shoulder muscles. Secondary outcome measures will be
      assessed after SWE assessment.
