      results counseling in HIV primary care will increase completion of Pap testing in a group of
      women attending the Johns Hopkins Hospital Moore Clinic for HIV Care. The study is informed
      by the Health Belief Model (HBM), which posits that screening behavior will increase if
      persons at risk for disease have a cue to action that increases their perception of
      susceptibility to and severity of the disease. In this study, the HPV test and results
      counseling are cues to action that also correctly identify those women at high risk for
      disease. To achieve these aims, 111 women who are late for Pap testing will be recruited for
      participation while they are at an HIV care appointment. They will be randomized to HPV
      self-collection and results counseling, or to receive usual care. Six months after
      enrollment, medical records will be reviewed for completion of Pap testing in the intervening
      months.
