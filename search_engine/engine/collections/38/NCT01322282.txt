    
      This study is designed to evaluate if a test formulation of cetirizine 10 mg orodispersible
      tablet (ODT) taken with and without water is bioequivalent to a marketed reference
      formulation of cetirizine 10 mg tablet (Benadryl One A Day, McNeil Products Ltd, UK) taken
      with water. This study will also evaluate the tolerability of test and reference
      formulations.
