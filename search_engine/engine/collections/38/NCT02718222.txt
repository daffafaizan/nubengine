      planning to implement, through its nationally-affiliated Associations of Gynaecologists and
      Obstetricians, an intervention program on post-partum IUD (PPIUD) services. As part of this
      Program, FIGO is responsible for information material, training providers, improving
      facilities, quality of service, and monitoring the program. Independent of the
      implementation, this study will measure the impact and performance of this intervention in
      three (Sri Lanka, Nepal and Tanzania) of the six countries participating in the FIGO project
      entitled: "Institutionalization of immediate post-partum IUD (PPIUD) services as a routine
      part of antenatal counselling and delivery room services in Sri Lanka, Kenya, India,
      Tanzania, Nepal and Bangladesh." The FIGO intervention will take place over a nine-month
      period in Tanzania (nine months in the first group of three hospitals and three months in the
      second group of three hospitals), and over a fifteen-month period in Nepal and Sri Lanka
      (fifteen months in the first group of three hospitals and nine months in the second group of
      three hospitals). Investigators will study both the impact of the intervention on the uptake
      and subsequent continued use of PPIUD and the extent to which the intervention leads to the
      institutionalization of postpartum IUD services in the hospitals during and after the FIGO
      intervention and to what extent the service diffuses to other hospitals or providers. The
      institutionalization and diffusion of the intervention will be measured by interviewing and
      following up trained providers, review of hospital records and baseline, during intervention
      and post-intervention facility surveys.
