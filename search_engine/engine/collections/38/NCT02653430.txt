      prevalence surged to 35.1% according to China Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance 2010. An
      estimated 44% of the burden for diabetes has been attributed to these weight problems, as
      well as 23% and 7-41% of the burdens for ischaemic heart disease and specific cancers. So
      now, obesity is a very serious disease, and it is not easy to lose weight or maintain proper
      weight.

      With the failure of non-surgical strategies, bariatric surgery has emerged as the most
      effective therapeutic option for the treatment of severe obesity. From the beginning, there
      are a lot of types of operation which have been created and then been abandoned. Now, the
      most common is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), gastric banding, and
      biliopancreatic diversion. In recent years, the international status of SG surgery gradually
      went up. Since 2013, SG has been recommended as the preferred option of bariatric surgery by
      the American Weight Loss Society. However, the underlying mechanism of SG procedure is not
      fully clear.

      In fact, clinical and translational studies over the last decade have shown that a number of
      gastrointestinal mechanisms, including changes in gut hormones, neural signalling, intestinal
      flora, bile acid and lipid metabolism can play a significant role in the effects of this
      procedure on energy homeostasis. This is a long-term follow-up and interventional study in
      individuals who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe obesity with or without diabetes.
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of SG on weight and blood sugar control
      and underlying mechanisms by metabolomics, metagenomics, functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) ,adipose tissue expression chip and etc.
