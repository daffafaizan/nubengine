        -  the use of electronic pill dispensers since the first prescription to visualize the
           level of compliance of each patient and study with her the various factors that can
           limit it.

        -  motivational, semi-directed and scheduled drug interviews at regular intervals
           throughout the study over a period of 18 months to visualize the compliance rate (ratio
           of the number of tablets taken by the patient on the number of tablets to be taken
           theoretically over the period), to evaluate the presence or absence of iatrogenesis
           specific to hormone therapy and to ensure adequate medical follow-up.
