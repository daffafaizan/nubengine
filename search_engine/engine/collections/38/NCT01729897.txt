      gastroscopy due to the large number and significant suffering of the patients. Also,
      development and exploration of anesthesiology will be bound to prompt the development and
      exploration of painless gastroscopy. However, the anesthesia risk of painless gastroscopy are
      usually higher than that of general anesthesia performed in operating room due to the
      condition, monitoring and equipments as well as the staffing for its implementation. Thus,
      the finding of a safe and convenient approach for general anesthesia will have a profound
      impact on a full promotion and implementation of comfortable care.

      Etomidate, with the main advantage of little effect on circulatory and respiratory systems,
      and the features of rapid onset and metabolism, may be helpful to guarantee the safety of
      painless diagnosis and treatment, thus appropriate for the procedure with short duration of
      anesthesia. However, there is controversy regarding whether analgesic should be used in
      combination, as well as how to given the combined regimen.
