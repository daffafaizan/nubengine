      health effects. Chronic stress is detrimental to quality of life and, potentially, length of
      survival among cancer survivors. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship (MBCS) is a four-week
      standardized mindfulness program, adapted for cancer survivors from Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR). MBCS teaches formal mindfulness practice (meditation) and informal
      mindfulness during daily activities. Mindfulness has been shown to help stress, fatigue,
      sleep complaints, and other symptoms but has not been extensively studied in cancer
      survivors. This study will enroll cancer survivors at the Greenville Health System Cancer
      Institute Center for Integrative Oncology and Survivorship to undergo the MBCS four-week
      mindfulness program, with assessments before, immediately after, and three months after the
      intervention. The assessments will include 1) questionnaires to measure lifestyle, stress,
      meditation habits, and sleep impairment, 2) blood tests to measure various biomarkers (e.g.,
      inflammatory cytokines), 3) using a BodyMedia's SensewearÂ® armband for a week to measure
      sleep and physical activity, and 4) salivary cortisol levels. The forty participants will be
      randomized to either the intervention arm, the four-week MBCS mindfulness program, or the
      control arm, a brief control/breathing course. After the three month post assessment,
      participants in the control arm will have the opportunity to take the MBCS course. Results of
      the study will be used to develop new care models that improve cancer survivor stress and
      symptoms using mindfulness.
