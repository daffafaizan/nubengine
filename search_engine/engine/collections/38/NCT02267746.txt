      Fabiorâ„¢ (Tazarotene) Foam, 0.1% is a safe and effective topical therapy used for the
      treatment of acne vulgaris. Actavis has developed a generic formulation of Tazarotene Foam,
      0.1%, and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this
      formulation.
