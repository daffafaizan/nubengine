      dysphagia. Previous studies have demonstrated the most common etiology for pediatric VFMI is
      cardiothoracic surgery which is possibly due to a variety of mechanisms.The investigators
      hypothesize that universal screening of neonates for VMFI following congenital cardiac
      surgery (CCS) will lead to a more accurate incidence and earlier diagnosis of VFMI. They
      believe that earlier identification will lead to changes in feeding regimens that may
      decrease length of stay (LOS), decrease time to oral feeding, earlier otolaryngologic
      intervention if indicated, and decreased rates of readmission for pulmonary or feeding
      complications. The investigators will also use this information to design a refined algorithm
      for targeted screening of patients who are more likely to have VFMI based on patient and
      surgery characteristics.
