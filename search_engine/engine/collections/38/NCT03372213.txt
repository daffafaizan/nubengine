      Survey (NHANES) (2003-2006 and 2011-2014). De-identified data was collected from demographic
      questionnaires and 24 hour dietary recalls. We assessed intake of calories, solid fats, added
      sugars, and servings of non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits, and whole grains, by food
      source in SNAP participants and income-eligible nonparticipants. Associations between SNAP
      participation and dietary intake were analyzed using multivariate linear regression
      controlling for relevant sociodemographic characteristics.
