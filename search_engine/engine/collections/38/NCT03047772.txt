      survival rate of implanted cells in the damaged tissue. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase
      inhibitor, has multiple biological activities independent of cholesterol-lowering action.This
      study is performed to find out more information about the strategy with Atorvastatin therapy
      to improve the survival of implanted cells, autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
      transplantation. Patients between 30 and 75 years of age who receive autologous bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells transplant may be eligible for this study. These patients receive
      autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation intracoronary undergoing
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with regular or high dose of Atorvastatin treatment. The
      objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.

      Heart function tests may include the following:

      Electrocardiogram (EKG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes placed on
      the chest transmit information from the heart to a machine.

      Echocardiogram (Echo) is an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create an image of the
      heart and examine the function of the heart chambers and valves.

      Gated acquisition scan is a nuclear medicine test that uses a small amount of radioactive
      chemical injected into a vein. A special scanner creates an image of the heart for examining
      the beating motion of the muscle.

      MRI evaluates function of the heart chambers the beating motion of the muscle.
