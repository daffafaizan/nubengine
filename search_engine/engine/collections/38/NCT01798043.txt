      progressive left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. This has led to an interest in alternative
      right ventricular pacing sites. Only very few studies investigated the effect of alternative
      right ventricular pacing sites using three dimensional imaging. Using cardiac MRI volumetric
      left- and right ventricular analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction is more accurate
      compared to trans-thoracic echocardiogram. St. Jude Medical has developed a MRI conditional
      pacemaker system enabling for the first time to investigate alternative pacing sites using
      cardiac MRI.

      Patients already implanted with an MRI conditional pacemaker system from St. Jude Medical
      will be enrolled in that study and subdivided into 4 groups (right ventricular pacing lead
      positioned apically or septally subdivided in patients paced for <50% of time or 50% or
      more). All patients will undergo cardiac MRI at enrollment and again 12 months later.
      Patients paced <50% of the time will undergo cardiac MRI with and without pacemaker
      stimulation at both visits.
