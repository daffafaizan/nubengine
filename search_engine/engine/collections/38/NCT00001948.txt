    
      Because of multi-drug regimens known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV
      infection can now be considered a chronic, manageable disease for many people in the United
      States. However, these therapies come with complex medication administration regimens and
      numerous side effects and distressing symptoms, which may impact significantly on a person's
      health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the HR-QOL
      and symptom distress (the degree of discomfort from specific symptoms) in individuals
      participating in the NIAID protocol, "Immunologic and virologic studies of intermittent
      versus continuous HAART in the treatment of HIV disease". In that study thirty-five subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive continuous HAART therapy and 35 subjects will receive
      interrupted therapy. In this, a companion study, HR-QOL and symptom distress will be measured
      at seven time points during the 88 weeks of the protocol. Data will be analyzed using
      repeated measures and multivariate statistical tests.
