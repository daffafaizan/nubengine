    
      Objective To evaluate the effect of a 3-year diet- and exercise lifestyle intervention, based
      on general public health recommendations, on glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and
      metabolic cardiovascular risk factors in Dutch subjects with impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT).

      Research design and methods 147 IGT subjects (75 male, 72 female) were randomized to the
      intervention group (INT) or control group (CON). 106 subjects (52 INT, 54 CON) completed 3
      years of intervention. Annually, glucose, insulin and FFA concentrations were determined
      during fasting and after an oral glucose tolerance test, in addition to measurements of body
      weight, serum lipids, blood pressure and maximal aerobic capacity.
