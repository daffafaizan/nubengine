      37 million living with HIV, who have initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and
      middle-income countries (LMIC) as of end of 2015, there were an estimated 5,700 new HIV
      infections each day and a total of 2.1 million new HIV infections in 2015, of which 66% were
      in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Key populations within the generalized HIV epidemics in SSA,
      including female sex workers (FSW), have received insufficient attention, with data
      indicating that they are at disproportionate risk with limited access to prevention and
      treatment services. Globally, new infections among key populations and their sexual partners
      accounted for 36% of all new HIV infections in 2015. HIV prevalence among FSW is 29.3%
      worldwide. While reliable HIV prevalence estimates are lacking, younger FSW <25 years may be
      at significantly greater risk due to the confluence of biological, behavioral and structural
      risk factors.6 Mathematical modeling suggests that the proportion of new HIV infections
      attributable to sex work is likely to increase over time.

      In settings where key populations contribute substantially to HIV burden, as in Kenya,
      effective integrated prevention strategies are urgently needed for populations such as FSW
      and can have a substantial impact on reducing new HIV infections.

      In 2012, HIV prevalence among Kenyan 15-64 year olds was 5.6%, with 1,192,000 people living
      with HIV, but was markedly higher (15.1%) in the region of Kenya, formerly named Nyanza
      Province. HIV prevalence is 14.1% among FSW and 7.6% among male clients of sex workers (MC).
      FSW contribute significantly to new HIV infections in Kenya,14 with modelled estimates
      showing that 1 in 3 new HIV infections can be attributed to key populations.
