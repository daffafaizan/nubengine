    
      Aim: To determine the effect of sildenafil on urinary incontinence.

        1. Episodes of urinary incontinence will be recorded using a 3 day bladder diary.

        2. Quantitative assessment of urinary incontinence will be performed at baseline and after
           treatment using a Pad Test.

        3. Muscle strength will be assessed through use of a perineometer.

        4. To evaluate macrocirculatory blood flow in pelvic organs, women will be assessed with
           noninvasive imaging before and after randomization to sildenafil.

        5. Secondary outcomes will include evaluation of muscle and vaginal mucosal thickness.
