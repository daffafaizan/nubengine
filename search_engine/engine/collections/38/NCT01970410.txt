      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase(
      DHODH), the forth enzyme in the de novo synthesis pathway of pyrimidines.Activated
      T-lymphocytes utilize both the de novo pyrimidine and salvage pathways of pyrimidines
      ribonucleotide synthesis.After mitogen stimulation, teriflunomide inhibits in vitro T cell
      proliferation, DNA and RNA synthesis and expression of cell surface and nuclear antigens that
      are directly involved in T-cell activation and proliferation.

      Natalizumab (NTZ) is a FDA approved treatment for relapsing-forms of multiple sclerosis (MS)
      with pivotal studies showing an annualized relapse-rate (ARR) reduction of 68%, a reduction
      of new gadolinium (Gd+) lesions by 92% and a reduction of disability of 42% compared to
      placebo.NTZ is highly effective in controlling MS but the risk of developing progressive
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) increases with the duration of the use of natalizumab.
      It can have a serious and life threatening complication in about 1 in 500 to 1 in 250
      patients who have had more that 18 infusions due PML and who have a detected antibody (Ab)
      for the JC virus. The risk of PML is much greater in patients who have had prior
      immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. The combination of detected anti-JCV Ab , duration of NTZ
      treatment of greater than 24 months and prior IS increases the risk of development PML to an
      incidence of 11 per 1000 treated patients. So there is a need to have an alternative MS
      disease modifying treatment (DMT) to use for patients at risk to develop PML from NTZ
      treatment that might be sufficiently effective for MS so as not to have the patients' MS
      worsen while lowering or eliminating the risk of PML.
