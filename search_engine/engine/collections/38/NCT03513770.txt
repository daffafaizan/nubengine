      MSNA response to venous distension (Aim1), and if a COX blockade will alter vein sizes during
      venous distension (Aim2). Each subject will serve as their own control.

      Aim 1:

      An IV will be inserted in the antecubital fossa of one arm, and the wrist-to-elbow occlusion
      will be performed.

      To block the COX system, 6 mg ketorolac tromethamine in 10 ml saline will be infused into the
      forearm over 1 minute (Infusion 1). After 10 minutes, a second infusion of ketorolac
      tromethamine (up to 3 mg) in 5% of the forearm volume of saline,( ~40-60 ml) will be infused
      into the occluded forearm at a rate of ~ 30 ml/min (Infusion 2). Five minutes of data will
      then be collected before releasing the upper arm cuff. Infusion 1 is to block the COX
      pathway, while infusion 2 is to induce venous distension.

      In the saline control trial, saline (without ketorolac) in identical volumes as those in the
      COX blockade trial will be performed on a separate day.

      Aim 2:

      The subject will lie supine inside the MRI scanner. The subject will be instrumented with
      cuffs for the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure on one arm, and cuffs for automated BP and
      HR measurements from the other arm, The images will be obtained before and during the
      wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure. The sizes of veins (i.e. cross sectional area) will be
      measured offline.
