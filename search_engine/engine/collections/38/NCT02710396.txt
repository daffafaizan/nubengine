      processes. The resultant mutations can be separated into two categories - (i) mutations that
      provide selective advantage for clonal expansion and (ii) mutations that do not result in
      growth advantage. The latter have been termed passenger mutations, while the former are
      referred to as driver mutations. It is widely believed that the number of driver mutations in
      a cancer sample is limited to a handful, usually two or more but less than ten. In contrast,
      the genome of a cancer can harbor more than a million somatic mutations most of which are
      considered to be passengers.

      Several studies have shown that the passenger mutations may not be oncogenic drivers but may
      be of importance in adaptive immune resistance of a tumor. In particular the relevant
      mutations are likely to be the nonsynonymous exonic mutations in tumors; these may give rise
      to novel proteins that differ from their wild type counterparts and are immunogenically more
      relevant. The study will explore if there is a relationship between the genetic mutations and
      the success of pembrolizumab.
