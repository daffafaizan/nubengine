      installed for various reasons and that is ready for closure. The investigators intend to
      randomly allocate them a mean of closure, either primary or secondary. Once the fistula is
      closed, the investigators will follow them over a substantial period of time to compare
      outcomes of each mean of closing. Different questionnaires will be used to best evaluate a
      range of variables.
