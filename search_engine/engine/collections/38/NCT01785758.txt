      molecules of this agent in the plasma and originating a complex which is highly stable, and
      mainly eliminated by the kidneys. In patients with end stage renal disease, this complex
      remains in the circulation for days. Previous studies have shown that sugammadex adequately
      reverses the blockade induced by rocuronium in such patients, and no evidence of recurrence
      was observed after a dosis of 2 mg/Kg administered to reverse a moderate level of blockade.
      To our knowledge, nothing has been published so far on the reversal of profound blockade by
      sugammadex in patients with renal failure.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in the reversal of
      profound neuromuscular block (NMB) induced by rocuronium in patients with end-stage renal
      failure and compare it to patients with normal renal function.
