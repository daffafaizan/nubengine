      degeneration of basal ganglions and substantia nigra occurs. Balance disorders are one of the
      common problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. These balance disorders; loss of
      postural reflexes, insufficiency in postural adjustments, rigidity in the trunk and
      extremities, and many disorders such as akinesia. Because of balance disorders in patients
      with PD, increase in addiction to daily life activities, causes physical disability. In the
      case of PD pulmonary problems may be the leading cause of mortality and mortality.
      Respiratory symptoms in these patients cause problems in weakness, swallowing, coughing,
      voice and speech functions. When the investigators look at the current literature, the effect
      of balance and respiration on Parkinson's patients is found to be seperately but their effect
      on each other is not sufficiently emphasized. For this reason, the researchers' aim to
      investigate balance and postural control in patients with Parkinson's disease and to increase
      the strength of respiratory muscles and to improve balance and postural control.
