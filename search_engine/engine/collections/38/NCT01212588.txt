      safety, efficacy, and good tolerability in the treatment of psychotic major depression (PMD).
      Like BPD, Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyper-responsiveness appears to play a
      role in PMD pathophysiology. Belanoff et al. (2002) hypothesized that mifepristone causes a
      normalizing "resetting" of HPA axis rhythm, accounting for its efficacy in PMD. Mifepristone
      produces a marked (2- to 3- fold) compensatory increase in central cortisol levels via its
      antagonism of GR-II receptors. This consequent central cortisol elevation may then be able to
      counteract abnormally heightened corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) activity via enhanced
      negative feedback mechanisms.

      This is a proof of principle study of mifepristone in the treatment of individuals with BPD
      and histories of childhood abuse, which aims to translate neurobiological research concerning
      HPA axis abnormalities in BPD into a novel clinical intervention for patients. This project
      will also explore an innovative approach to the structure of pharmacotherapy for BPD.
      Specifically, we will employ the circumscribed (finite) drug administration period used in
      prior studies of mifepristone in neuropsychiatric illness, which differs from the current
      clinical practice of indefinite daily usage of medications. We hypothesize that mifepristone
      will beneficially impact stress response neurobiology and consequently ameliorate associated
      BPD symptoms.
