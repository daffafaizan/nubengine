      promulgated by important professional societies in the past 10 years. The impetus to do so
      came from the observation that practicing physicians were using a wide array of approaches to
      this common infection, many of which were substandard.

      The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) have
      been leaders in this field, publishing recommendations separately between 1993 and 2003. The
      PI served on the IDSA committee and coauthored the publication in 2000 and the update in
      2003. In 2004, a decision was made by the two professional societies to merge the committees
      and make a single joint set of recommendations; the PI is a member of that joint committee
      and a new document is being prepared for publication.

      The PI has observed a tendency to apply these guidelines to cases that might masquerade as
      CAP but are actually attributable to other conditions, such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and
      histoplasmosis. Further, the recommendations do not adequately cover pneumonia due to
      Staphylococcus aureus.

      The purpose of the research is to identify cases from the consult records of the Infectious
      Disease Section at the VAMC, Houston, and to compare them with other cases of CAP in order to
      determine whether there are features that might enable non-CAP cases to be distinguished from
      CAP.
