      cavity and patency of the fallopian tubes after injection of a radio-opaque dye through the
      cervix. It is typically performed in the evaluation of infertility or to diagnose uterine
      anomalies. It is the most common method of tubal evaluation in the developing countries
      because it is cheap, readily available and requires less expertise. Unfortunately, HSG can
      cause discomfort or pain for the patient during or after the procedure, and this evokes
      anxiety and fear for many patients. Up to 72 % of women complain of significant discomfort
      with this test.

      by blocking the sodium channels in the cell membrane, thereby preventing transmission of the

      peripheral nerve blocks if an intermediate duration is required.
