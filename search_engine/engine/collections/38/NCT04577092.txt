      aim of this study is comparing the effect of motor-cognitive DTT (mCdtt) and motor-motor DTT
      (mMdtt) on balance, fear of falling, walking functionality and muscle strength in older
      adults. A total of 50 participants aged 60 and over (mean age: 67.72±7.33 years), having a
      score ≥ 24 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), being in category of walking ability ≥ 4
      according to the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), having no problem in visual ability
      and hearing were included for this study. The participants who received mCdtt (Group 1)
      counted back from the two-digit number and the participants who received mMdtt (Group 2) held
      half-filled glasses with 90o flexion elbow with both hand while performing exercises. The
      intervention program had lasted for 8 weeks. To assess balance, fear of falling, walking
      functionality and muscle strength of participants, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Falls Efficacy
      Scale International (FES-I), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Hand-held dynamometer were used,
      respectively.
