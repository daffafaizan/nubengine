      cycle of chemotherapy, white blood cell count must have recovered adequately in between
      cycles. Traditionally, this regimen has been given with the use of a medicine called Neulasta
      (Pegfilgrastim) to speed the recovery of the white blood cell count in order to maximize the
      chances that the next cycle of chemotherapy can be given on time.
