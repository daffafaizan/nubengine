      with at least 36 months depending upon placement of the prosthesis. a cross-sectional study
      calling patients to whom implants have placed them in two private practices (CICOM, Badajoz
      and Nart Clinica Dental, Barcelona, Spain) in the last 36 month to conduct clinical and
      radiographic study was performed. This procedure is justified because of the high frequency
      of peri-implant disease (30%) and since there is no predictable and effective treatment, only
      prevention can improve the success rate and functionality.

      - Clinical examination

      A previously examiner (AN) calibrated perform all clinical measurements. The following
      clinical parameters were measured at six sites per implant (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal,
      distolingual, lingual and mesiolingual):

        1. Presence of plaque is recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        2. Degree of gingival redness recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        3. Depth bag measured from the gingival margin to the base of the bag in mm;

        4. clinical attachment level (CAL) by the number of exposed threads measured

        5. Bleeding on probing (BOP) recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        6. Discharge is recorded as 0 (no) or 1 (presence)

        7. keratinized gingiva (mm)

             -  Radiographic parameters A previously calibrated examiner perform radiographic
                measurement from the neck of the implant in the mesial and distal aspect of the
                implants using a digitized periapical. The software used for measurements will be
                ImageJ (approved by the American National Institute for Research - 'NIH')
