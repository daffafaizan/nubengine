      decreasing body weight and body fat. The beneficial effects of whole grains on body weight
      may be explained by the larger volume and relatively low energy density of whole grain food
      thus leading to increased satiation. Reducing visceral fat is of particular importance as
      visceral adiposity has been associated with increased risk for metabolic diseases and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The proposed study is a randomized, 2-parallel arm controlled feeding study. Subjects will be
      fed one of two weight maintenance diets (refined grain and whole grain) for 6 weeks, followed
      by a 6 week controlled weight loss period where subjects are fed the same diets, but at a
      reduced calorie level, designed to elicit weight loss (~2 lbs per week). Diets for both
      groups will have the same nutrient profile (percent of calories from fat, protein,
      carbohydrates, etc.); however, the whole grain (WG) group will substitute whole grains for
      refined grains in their grain intake (breads, tortillas, cereals, etc.). The WG group will be
      expected to take in 6-9 servings of whole grains per day on both diets. Plasma endpoints will
      be measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-week diet periods. Blood samples also will be
      taken at the mid-point of each period and held for analysis if deemed appropriate after
      initial data is reviewed. Endo-PAT will be conducted at baseline and at the end of each diet
      period as well as DEXA and MRI testing.
