      quality spirometry tests. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a distance-learning tool
      for training primary care providers and their medical assistants in the use of spirometry to
      assist in managing obstructive lung disease (asthma and COPD). This tool is called
      "Spirometry Fundamentalsâ„¢: A basic guide to lung function testing". It is a computer-based
      training program that teaches primary care providers and their staff what spirometry is, how
      it can be used, the techniques required to perform high-quality spirometry, and clinical
      interpretation of the spirometric data.

      We evaluated the effectiveness of Spirometry Fundamentals in the primary care setting by
      conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Study participants were primary care
      physicians (MDs or DOs) and their staff (medical assistants (MAs) or nurses (RNs)) and were
      recruited as study pairs. The role of the MDs was to utilize spirometry in clinical care by
      ordering spirometry tests based on their clinical judgment, and the role of the MAs was to
      perform the spirometry. The patients performed the spirometry as part of their usual care
      were not considered study subjects.
