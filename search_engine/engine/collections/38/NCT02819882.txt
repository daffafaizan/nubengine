      diagnosed (from January 2016) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease
      (either after a recurrence or as first diagnosis). No treatment regimen will be protocol
      specified. This is an observational study in which clinical decisions concerning the optimum
      management strategy for a particular patient are taken independently of and/or prior to, any
      decision by the physician to invite a patient to participate in the study. The treating
      physician will make all treatment decisions according to his/her regular clinical practice
      independent of this study. Patients enrolled on the study are free to withdraw their informed
      consent for the use and disclosure of health information at any time and when asked, patients
      are not obliged to provide a reason. Patients may request discontinuation from the study at
      any time.

      The date and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation from the study must be recorded in
      the electronic case report form (eCRF). An attempt will be made to determine the date of
      discontinuation and final status (i. e. withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death) of
      any patient who discontinues from the study. However, the treating clinician is encouraged to
      follow the patient as long as possible, until patient death or through study end. The Sponsor
      has the right to terminate the study at any time. The Sponsor will notify the investigator if
      the study is placed on hold or if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.
