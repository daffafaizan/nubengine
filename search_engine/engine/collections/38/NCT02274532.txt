      to grasp and manipulate common objects. We will perform extensive testing of the myoelectric
      SHpro by asking subjects to perform a wide variety of ADL tasks in a structured environment
      onsite at Mayo Clinic Rochester. These data will be used by the Mayo Clinic, ASU, and the IIT
      research teams to modify the SHpro design to adapt it for use by people with amputations
      while focusing on the SHpro socket design, surface electromyography (EMG)-based control
      (typically used in commercially available prostheses today).

      We will quantify the ability of patients with below-elbow amputation to perform the above
      tasks using the prosthetic terminal device version of the SHpro. We hypothesize that people
      with amputations will learn to use the SHpro and perform grasp and manipulation tasks to a
      greater level than that allowed by their current terminal devices.

      The long-term objectives of this exploratory study are to design and build a low-cost,
      high-performance prosthetic hand terminal device that will be accepted by patients with
      below-elbow amputation and allow them to perform a wider range of ADL tasks than allowed by
      today's commercially available prostheses. The data collected through the proposed studies
      will provide an important foundation for optimizing the design of the SHpro for future
      testing on a large number of people with limb loss. Future studies will also assess the
      extent to which the SHpro's functionality and acceptance might benefit from embedding
      additional synergistic hand motion patterns in the SHpro.
