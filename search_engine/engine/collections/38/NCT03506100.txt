      exhales volumes of air as a function time. It is the most important and most frequently
      performed pulmonary function testing procedure, having become indispensable for the
      prevention, diagnosis and evaluation of various respiratory impairments. However, there have
      been only a few studies addressing the effect of physical activity on pulmonary function test
      results and investigating the association between body composition and respiratory parameters
      in sports activities [1,2,3]. The objective of this study was verify if there are differences
      in spirometry values in children aged between 6 and 12 years who practice swimming
      complemented with water walking at the end of each session and those who only practice
      swimming. In this study participated 28 subjects (mean age, 7.68 ± 1.16 years) and was
      divided into two groups: swimming group (SG) (N=9) and swimming complemented with water
      walking group (SWWG) (N=19). The study was performed in 12 weeks with 3 moments of evaluation
      (M1, M2 and M3) , with two sessions per week of 45 minutes each, we wanted to identify the
      benefits in pulmonary function - Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1
      second (FEV1) and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). The water walking activity occurred in the end
      of each session for 6 minutes, performed in straight line with the water level at the
      children's chest. The spirometry tests were realized with the microQuark Spirometer®. For the
      analysis of the results, we used descriptive statistics, the Shapiro Wilk test for testing
      the normality of the sample and for the inferential statistics the Mann-Whitney tests,
      Friedman's Anova, and d-Cohen for the magnitude of effect.
