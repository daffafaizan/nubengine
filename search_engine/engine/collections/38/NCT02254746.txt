    
      Primary objective phase I:

      To irradiate the prostate gland which might albeit contain microscopic disease with
      tumoricidal doses of SBRT, and to escalate the dose of SBRT in the visible prostatic tumor
      towards the best tumoricidal dose without exceeding the normal tissue tolerance and toxicity
      in patients with organ confined T2-T3 N0 prostate carcinoma.

      Primary objective phase II:

      To determine the rate of acute toxicity grade 2 or more defined as toxicity occurring
      immediately after the first fraction of radiotherapy and up to 90 days after the start of
      radiotherapy treatment.

      Secondary objectives phase II:

        -  To determine efficacy measured by PSA failure using Phoenix definition.

        -  To determine long-term late toxicity (>90 days after treatment start).

      Exploratory endpoint phase II:

      â€¢ To determine the feasibility of achieving dose constraints in the organs at risk using high
      technology radiotherapy.
