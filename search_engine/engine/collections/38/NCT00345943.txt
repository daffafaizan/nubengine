      suggested by their binge-eating and purging, as well as the high incidence of drug abuse and
      shoplifting in this population. Understanding dysfunction in the frontostriatal circuitry
      that mediates self-regulatory control processes will aid development of new therapeutics for
      the impulsivity associated with BN. We are conducting a longitudinal study to better
      understand the development and persistence of BN.

      Participation in this study includes 4 sections: Neuropsychological Tests, Diagnostic
      interviews, Pregnancy Test, and MRI scan. All efforts are made to coordinate procedures into
      one day, and they require between 4 and 5 hours of the participant's time. The option of
      splitting participation into two study days is also offered for participants who find it more
      convenient. Participants are compensated with $100 in the form of a check, which is mailed to
      their home address. Participants will be invited back for follow-up visits.
