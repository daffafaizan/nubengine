    
      A total of up to 260 patients > 65 years old diagnosed of Multiple Myeloma with symptomatic
      disease and that have not received previous chemotherapy for MM will be included.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods: Pre-treatment,
      Treatment and Follow up.

      The Pre-treatment includes Screening and baseline visits. After providing informed consent,
      patients will be evaluated for study eligibility and then Patients will be randomized one to
      one to receive Melphalan+Prednisone+Velcade (Group A) or Thalidomide+Prednisone+Velcade
      (Group B). All of them will received the induction treatment up to 30 weeks. After 4 weeks,
      without progression and unacceptable toxicity, Patients will be again randomized one to one
      to receive maintenance treatment: Thalidomide+Velcade (Group M1) or Prednisone+Velcade (Group
      M2) during three years.

      Once the treatment period has finished a follow up will be carry out. During this period we
      will evaluated response, progression-free survival and global survival every three months.
