      and maintenance. Induction is designed to induce (or bring about) myeloma into remission.
      Each patient enrolled on this study will be randomly assigned to receive the above treatment
      alone or in combination with a drug called thalidomide. Some patients may be eligible to
      receive the transplant as an outpatient, based on general health and other factors.After
      recovery from the transplant phase of the study (approximately 6 weeks), patients originally
      assigned to thalidomide will resume taking it and will continue taking it throughout the rest
      of the study treatment. All patients will receive post-transplant consolidation treatment,
      which in earlier studies has been found to be helpful in maintaining patients response after
      transplant. Therefore, all patients will receive a combination of drugs called "D PACE" which
      consists of Dexamethasone, Cis-Platinum, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, and Etoposide. If you
      are also taking thalidomide, you will continue taking it throughout, and the treatment is
      called "DT PACE" to include the thalidomide. No sooner than 4 weeks, and no later than 12
      weeks after consolidation and if your myeloma remains in remission after consolidation
      therapy is complete, you will begin the last phase of the study, which is maintenance.
      Maintenance is designed to keep your myeloma in remission long-term.
