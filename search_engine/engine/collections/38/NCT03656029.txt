    
      Participants will attend the laboratory for 4 separate sessions, separated by about a week.
      In each session, participants will receive one of 3 doses of smoked cannabis or a placebo.
      Participants will not know which dose they are receiving. Participants will complete
      questionnaires, do cognitive tests and drive on a driving simulator before and after smoking
      the cannabis or placebo cigarette. Blood, urine and oral fluid will be collected throughout
      the 7-8 hour session to determine levels of THC and its metabolites. These values will be
      correlated with measures of driving impairment.
