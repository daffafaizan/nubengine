      the ages of 6 and 12 months will be recruited for participation in the study. They will be
      randomized to receive supplementation with ARP or placebo, and will be followed for a period
      of one year, with weekly home visits and monitoring of all episodes of diarrhoea. In
      addition, every two weeks, surveillance stool samples will be collected and tested for
      rotavirus to identify asymptomatic infections by PCR. All episodes of diarrhoea will be
      investigated intensively for bacterial, viral and parasitic agents of diarrhoea using both
      conventional and molecular techniques and all cases will be treated appropriately at the
      study clinic or referral hospital as required. Monthly anthropometric measurements will be
      carried out to estimate rates of growth and to identify growth faltering. Blood samples will
      be taken at 4, 8 and 12 months for estimation of anti-rotavirus IgA and IgG antibodies.
      Studies on intestinal absorption and permeability will be carried out at recruitment, 6 and
      12 months by the lactulose:mannitol test (measured by HPLC detection of sugars). All
      rotavirus strains obtained will be characterized by genotyping.
