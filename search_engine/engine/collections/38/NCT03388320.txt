    
      A-CHESS is a smartphone application developed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison based on
      self-determination theory, with a previous randomized clinical trial showing that use of the
      app resulted in significantly fewer risky drinking days in patients leaving treatment for
      alcohol-use disorders. The application is downloaded to the participant's smartphone, and
      provides ongoing access to peer support and educational materials, monitoring of the risk of
      relapse, and delivery of reminders and encouragements to the patient. The application also
      has a survey platform to assess and reassess the participants' most recent alcohol
      consumption, quality of life, and experience using the application. We anticipate that use of
      the A-CHESS app will result in decreased drinking and improved abstinence, identifying a
      potential intervention to offer patients with ALD to improve their mortality, liver disease,
      and likelihood of liver transplant candidacy status.
