      cardiovascular diseases. A prothrombotic rebound phenomenon after aspirin cessation has been
      reported. ASA withdrawal is associated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiac events.
      In individuals with previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cessation of ASA may
      cause stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction. However, many patients undergo non-cardiac
      surgery within the first two years after PCI. Perioperatively, two counteracting risks have
      to be taken into account, first, the risk of thromboembolic complications, if ASA medication
      is discontinued and second, the risk of surgical bleeding, if ASA therapy is continued.
      However, factors contributing to preoperative decision-making for ASA-withdrawal are still
      unclear.

      This study aims to assess independent factors associated with the clinical decision to
      discontinue ASA preoperatively in patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. In
      particular this study aims to determine if the presence of coronary stents is independently
      associated with ASA discontinuation. Furthermore this study assesses, if
      benefit-risk-estimates (numerical rating scales) of the patients and the supervising
      physicians are associated with the decision to withdraw ASA.

      Study design

      Patients on long-term ASA undergoing non-cardiac surgery as well as their supervising
      anesthesiologist participate in a preoperative survey. Detailed information about ASA
      medication, perioperative ASA use, comorbidities, factors that might be associated with the
      decision to discontinue ASA preoperatively and benefit-risk-estimates (numerical rating
      scales) are sampled by questionnaires.
