    
      Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck, anal canal, cervix, esophagus or
      lung will be assessed before start of radiotherapy and 1-2 weeks after start.
      Multi-parametric MRI and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron
      emission tomography (PET) will be performed in parallel to metabolomic analyses of tumour
      tissue. The investigators will correlate changes in imaging bio-markers to corresponding
      changes in tissue or blood bio-markers by repeated imaging and biopsies for better
      understanding of the image parameters.

      The data from the two assessments will be used for identifying imaging bio-markers,
      predictive for outcome. The patient data will be divided into one set of data for hypothesis
      generation and another set for validation.
