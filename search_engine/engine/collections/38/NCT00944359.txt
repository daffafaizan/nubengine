    
      This is a single-center cluster- and household-randomized, partially masked, community-based
      efficacy trial of zinc supplementation. The study sample consists of 5 study groups in one
      region, with 34 clusters randomly assigned to 3 types of intervention communities.

      Communities will be randomly assigned to 1) early intervention communities, 2) later
      intervention communities, 3) non-intervention communities. Within each intervention cluster,
      children will be randomly assigned to the intervention group at the household level. Children
      aged 6-27 months at enrollment will be eligible. The study duration is 12 months.

      The investigators will assess the relative impact of daily preventive zinc supplementation (7
      mg zinc/d for one year), intermittent preventive supplementation (10 mg zinc/d for 10 days
      every three months for one year), and zinc treatment during episodes of diarrhea (20 mg
      zinc/d for 10 days beginning with each episode of diarrhea during one year). Outcomes that
      will be assessed include the incidence and duration of all episodes of diarrhea, the
      incidence of malaria, physical growth, and (in a sub-group) biochemical indicators of zinc,
      iron and vitamin A status.
