    
      This protocol is a Phase II Open Label Clinical Trial of a technology-based application
      "On-Plan" (OP) which is expected to improve adherence to boceprevir-based triple therapy in
      subjects with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C infection compared to historical controls from
      the University of Louisville. OP uses a combination of smart phone and computer-based social
      support to correct non-adherence and manage side effects as well as contingency management
      (positive reinforcement) when patient-reported compliance is documented by pill counts and/or
      electronic compliance monitors. 52 consenting subjects prescribed boceprevir-based triple
      therapy for chronic genotype 1 HCV according the U.S. prescribing information will be
      enrolled and all will receive the OP application. A Simon's two stage procedure will be
      utilized to minimize risk while preliminary efficacy/safety data are collected on this
      innovative "app" for HCV therapy.
