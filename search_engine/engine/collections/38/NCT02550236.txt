           of Leipzig (Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases - LIFE). The measurements
           are performed in a well-equipped research centre located on the premises of the
           University Hospital of Leipzig.

        -  The study collects detailed information from clinical examinations, questionnaires and
           interviews and includes a collection of several types of biological materials at various
           time points (urine, stool, hair, blood for direct analyses, genomic DNA, dried blood
           spots, paxgenes (for RNA isolation and expression/eQTL studies). Children and
           adolescents from 0 to 20 years at baseline and their families are included. Participants
           are followed annually over a period of several years irrespective of the age at the
           first participation in the study until they reach the age of 20.

        -  Prenatal examinations are conducted in the 24th and 36th week of gestation and postnatal
           examinations in the 3rd, 6th and 12th month in the offspring. The birth cohort study
           collects detailed information from clinical examinations, questionnaires and interviews
           and biological materials (blood, cord blood, placental tissue, breast milk, hair, urine
           and stool)

        -  In addition, the LIFE Child study focuses in the disease cohort LIFE Child OBESITY and
           disease free controls in more detail. The aim of these subgroups is to examine
           aetiological associations and comorbidities with more in-depth methods.
