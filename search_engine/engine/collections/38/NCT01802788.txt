    
      This is an international multicenter, prospective, non-randomized clinical investigation
      without concurrent or matched control, designed to assess the mid-term safety and performance
      of the Portico valve in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis whom are high risk
      for surgical valve replacement. The primary endpoint is 1 year all-cause mortality. In
      addition, the performance and safety profile of the Portico valve will be further evaluated
      at 30 days, 1 year, and annually through 5 years post-implant.

      The investigation will be conducted at approximately 65 centers in approximately 15 countries
      in Europe, Middle-East, Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
