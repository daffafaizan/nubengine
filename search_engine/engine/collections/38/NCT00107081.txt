        -  At presentation with FN (fever and neutropenia) and during an initial inpatient
           observation period of 8 to 22 hours, empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics
           are given. Type and dosage are chosen by the treating physician.

        -  Patients randomized to continued intravenous antibiotics continue with these
           antibiotics.

        -  Patients randomized to oral antibiotics receive a combination of oral ciprofloxacin (25
           to 30 mg/kg/day, top dose 1500 mg/day) plus oral amoxicillin (65 to 80 mg/kg/day, top
           dose 2250 mg/day), both given in two doses per day.

        -  In both groups, the study gives guidelines (for certain situations) and rules (for other
           situations) when to change and when to stop antibiotics.

      Details on clinical and laboratory controls

        -  During antibiotic therapy, patients are seen daily, either as inpatients or as
           outpatients according to randomization. Complete blood counts are performed at least
           every second day.

        -  After stopping antibiotic therapy and until resolution of severe neutropenia (if
           applicable), patients are seen every other day, with a complete blood count.

        -  Patients randomized to outpatient management have the possibility to contact at any time
           of the day (and night) a pediatric oncologist in case of problems, in order to discuss
           necessity for emergency control and/or rehospitalization.
