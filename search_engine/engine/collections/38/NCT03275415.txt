      birth Wt 500-1499 gm, 2) respiratory distress shortly after birth and requires resuscitation
      3) failure to NCPAP within 4 hrs after birth, defined as: a) FIO2 ≥ 0.30, pressure > 5cmH2O
      b) severe retraction c) apnea d) PCO2 ≥ 60 mmHg. Exclusion criteria: 1) lethal
      cardiopulmonary status 2) severe congenital anomalies. Sample size will be determined based
      on a one-third (33%) improvement of the current incidence of BPD or death in the selected
      population (from 50%→33%), allowing a type I error 0.05, type II error 0.10 (power 0.90), 182
      infants in each group would be needed and 190 in each group would be a safe target number.
      The infants will be randomly assigned to control (C) (Curosurf/placebo) or intervention (I)
      (Curosurf/budesonide); given q. 12 hrs for a maximum of 3 doses unless the infant is
      extubated or require FIO2 <30%. Appropriate amount of placebo will be used as it does not
      affect the biophysical property of curosurf (PAS abstract 2017 San Francisco) Primary outcome
      of study is death or BPD defined by NICHD criteria. Follow up study of neuromotor and
      cognitive function and pulmonary states will be done at 1-2 years of corrected age.
