      elixir. Despite its standard use, this pain control is typically not as effective as a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID). The problem with using NSAIDs for
      post-tonsillectomy operative pain is the significant increased risk of rebleeding.

      Celecoxib is an NSAID that is a COX-2 inhibitor; the drug is designed to act as an NSAID
      without the increased risk of rebleeding or hemorrhage.

      This study is a double blind, randomized study; neither the study participant or the study
      investigator knows if the participant is receiving celecoxib or a placebo (sugar pill). The
      blinded list is maintained by the research pharmacists and can be unblinded when needed (such
      as in an emergency).

      Participants begin taking the study medication the night before surgery and continue through
      10 days post-operative. Participants are asked to complete a journal that catalogs the amount
      of standard post-operative medications taken, the amount of pain experienced, and any other
      comments.

      Participants are contacted by phone at 5 and 10 days post-op.

      Study participation ends at the standard 3-week post-operative check-up.
