      symptoms, delay disease progression, and, perhaps, partially restore damaged brain cells in
      PD patients. GM1 ganglioside is a chemical that is normally found in the brain and is a
      normal part of the outer covering or membrane of nerve cells. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of GM1 to standard PD treatment. In addition to studying clinical measures of
      motor and cognitive functioning, the investigators will use PET (positron emission
      tomography) scanning to image the brain and the dopamine nerve endings in a subgroup of
      patients. Patients with mild to moderate idiopathic PD will be divided into 2 groups. One
      group will receive GM1 for 24 weeks and the other will receive placebo. At the end of this 24
      week period, all patients will enter into a 96 week treatment period in which all patients
      will receive GM1.

      In parallel, a group of standard-of-care patients with mild to moderate PD will be monitored
      over a 1 to 2 year period to assess the natural progression of PD. These patients will
      receive the same clinical evaluations as the treatment group subjects but they will not
      receive the experimental medication.
