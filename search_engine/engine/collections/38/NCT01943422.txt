    
      -  Dose-selection and dose-expansion study of combination therapy with high-dose interferon
           alfa-2b and vemurafenib.

        -  Vemurafenib at standard dosing with a 2 week lead-in period to exploit potential
           immunomodulatory effects. Concurrent HDI following this (week 2 onwards) at standard
           induction (4 weeks) and maintenance (48 weeks) doses.

        -  Modified Storer's "up and down" dose escalation schema using 3 fixed dose levels for HDI
           and a fixed sample size that allows efficient identification of recommended phase II
           dose.

        -  36-63 patients will be enrolled depending on toxicity parameters. oIn the dose-selection
           portion, 3 patients will be enrolled per dose level, starting from the lowest dose
           level. Enrollment will occur serially allowing for the observation of toxicity during
           the observation period.

      oIterative enrollment of up to 3 subjects per cohort will be continued until a total of 30
      evaluable subjects have been enrolled.

      oThe dose level at which the RLT rate is the closest to 1/3 will be considered as RP2D.

      oDuring the dose-expansion portion of the trial, depending on the number of patients treated
      at RP2D during the dose-selection portion, additional patients may be enrolled - the accrual
      target is 36 patients treated at RP2D.
