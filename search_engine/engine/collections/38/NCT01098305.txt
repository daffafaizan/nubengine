      yet rates have remained constant over the past few years. In contrast, the rate of smokeless
      tobacco use in India is 20%. Smokeless tobacco is a carcinogenic and responsible for ~10,000
      deaths/year from oral cancer in India. Unfortunately, there have been remarkably few
      intervention trials in India for smokeless tobacco users. To date, no trial has evaluated the
      new FDA approved medication, varenicline, for smokeless tobacco use. We will conduct a
      randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence at the
      National Drug Dependence Treatment Center (NDDTC) at the All India Institute of Medicine
      (AIIMS) in New Delhi with 237 smokeless tobacco users. The primary aims of this trial are to:
      1) enhance research capacity at the NDDTC (i.e., train AIIMS staff to implement the
      behavioral counseling protocol with pharmacotherapy, data collection and management
      procedures); 2) assess the efficacy of varenicline for increasing biochemically confirmed
      7-day point prevalence smokeless tobacco quit rates at the end-of treatment; and 3) assess
      longitudinal patterns of relapse and recovery following treatment with varenicline. The
      results of this trial may guide future investments to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline
      for smokeless tobacco dependence in the US, which is critical since smokeless tobacco use in
      the US may increase in the coming years and no approved pharmacotherapy for this drug
      dependence exists in the US or around the globe.
