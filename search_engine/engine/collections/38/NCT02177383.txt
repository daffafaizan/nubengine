      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on athletic performance. The described effects of PUFAs
      on the fat metabolism may be modulated by the expression and activity of transcription factor
      genes, suppressing or expressing genes associated with the synthesis and oxidation of fats
      and in oxidative stress and inflammation.

      The investigators' working hypothesis is based on the polyunsaturated fatty acids, given its
      pro-oxidative character and also by its action on transcription factors can modulate the
      antioxidant response and oxidative damage induced by physical activity.

      In the field of professional sports and leisure use of food and / or antioxidants in the
      belief that these elements prevent muscle damage is very established. Most studies in
      athletes supplemented with antioxidant nutrients revealed no significant effects on physical
      performance, but it has shown that supplements protect against tissue damage induced by
      exercise. Recent studies have reported that over 35% of the Spanish people eat diets low or
      very low quality, which is clearly shown that over 10% of Spaniards have poor intakes (<2/3
      IDR) riboflavin (men) , folate (women), vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E.

      The overall objective of the study is to establish situations improving athletic performance
      and study the oxidative balance by manipulation of feeding patterns and consumption of
      nutritional supplements and investigate the involved mechanisms. The aim of this study is to
      establish scientific basis for design functional foods improving athletic performance and
      health and avoiding the negative consequences of the oxidative damage induced by
      overexertion.
