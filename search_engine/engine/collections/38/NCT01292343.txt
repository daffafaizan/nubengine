      bacteria and oral inflammation prior to third molar surgery, and on the incidence of
      inflammatory complications after the surgery. If proven effective, dentifrice containing
      triclosan may be recommended prior to tooth extractions and replace antibiotics and other
      antimicrobial products as a prophylactic procedure before oral surgery procedures.
