    
      This is a single-dose, open-label, randomized two-way crossover study to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of a test formulation, versus an equivalent dose of a commercially available
      reference drug product, in 36 adult subjects, under fasted conditions. Drug administrations
      are separated by at least 49 days.

      Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse rate) were obtained at baseline (Hour 0), and
      at post-dose Hours 3, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 360, and 1056.

      Of the 36 subjects enrolled into the study, 31 subjects completed the study in its entirety.
      Five (5) subjects were dropped out from the study.
