      expressing tumor cells, with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with
      unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. These two drugs
      act through distinct and possibly complementary modes of action.

      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial. Patients given LV and pembrolizumab
      during dose escalation will be monitored for frequency of dose-limiting toxicities to
      determine a recommended doses for expansion cohorts. In addition to safety measures,
      objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and other efficacy
      outcomes will be assessed.
