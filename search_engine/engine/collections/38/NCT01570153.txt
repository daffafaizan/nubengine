    
      Our specific aims are to:

        1. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of pro-B type natriuretic peptide
           (NT-pro-BNP), soluble (s)ST2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and
           bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) for predicting in-hospital worsening
           renal function (WRF) in patients evaluated in emergency department (ED)with acutely
           decompensated heart failure (ADHF)compared to a model of clinical variables alone.

        2. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of NT-proBNP, sST2, NGAL, and BIVA for
           identifying the correct cause of in-hospital WRF in patients evaluated in the ED with
           ADHF.

        3. Evaluate the individual and collective ability of NT-pro-BNP, sST2, NGAL, and BIVA for
           predicting outcomes (all-cause death, all-cause re-hospitalization, initiation of renal
           replacement therapy by 180 days) in patients with ADHF.
