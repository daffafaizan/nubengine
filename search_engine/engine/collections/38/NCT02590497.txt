      I. Determine the correlation between the genetic and neuroimaging signature of glioblastoma.

      II. Determine the correlation between the neuroimaging signature of glioblastoma and
      prognosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI before and after gadolinium contrast administration, including
      3-dimensional (3D) volumetric T1-weighted sequence, fluid attenuated inversion recovery
      (FLAIR) sequence, diffusion weighted imaging, and perfusion MRI. Tissue samples are also
      analyzed for the tumor genetic profile.
