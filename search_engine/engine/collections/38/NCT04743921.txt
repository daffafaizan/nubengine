      beneﬁts in pain and functional outcomes through support of the ligamentous structures.
      Bracing is both an eﬀective and economical treatment for osteoarthritis and serves as a
      crucial option in the treatment of knee OA to aid in both delaying surgery and as options for
      young patients, or patients that are not ideal surgical candidates. Although knee sleeves are
      commonly utilized treatment modalities, there is a signiﬁcant paucity of literature on the
      eﬀects of thermo-active braces in the treatment of knee OA. This investigation will examine
      this non-operative treatment modality and study it eﬀect for the treatment of knee OA
      specifically by investigating the Reparel Knee Sleeve. The Reparel Knee Sleeve is a Class I
      Medical Device (510(k) exempt) and used in general sports medicine practice for the
      alleviation of knee pain. The authors expect that the Reparel thermos-active knee sleeve will
      have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on pain relief from knee OA.
