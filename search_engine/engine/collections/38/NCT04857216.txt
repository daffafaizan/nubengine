      to which the block is applied, by performing sympathetic, sensory and motor blocks. Brachial
      plexus blockade; It is a peripheral nerve blockage that can be used in surgical operations to
      be performed on the upper extremity and can be performed at the level of interscalene,
      supraclavicular, infraclavicular, costoclavicular, axillary and terminal nerves.

      The costoclavicular brachial plexus block has been used as an alternative to lateral sagittal
      infraclavicular block, due to its ease of application, its rapid onset of action and its high
      success rate. The effectiveness of the block is measured by sensory, motor and sympathetic
      block effects. The sensory block can be evaluated by cold or pinprick test, and motor block
      by traditional methods such as the patient's response to verbal commands and can be
      objective.

      Sympathetic block manifests itself with vasodilation and an increase in blood flow rate and
      can be measured with the more quantitative perfusion index (PI). The perfusion index
      represents the ratio of pulsatile blood flow to static blood flow in peripheral tissue and
      can be measured continuously and noninvasively from a pulse oximeter. Successful peripheral
      nerve blockade; It is seen as local vasodilation, increased local blood flow, some increase
      in skin temperature and loss of sensation in the extremity due to the blockage of sympathetic
      fibers. It can be a guide in determining the effectiveness of the block because it is
      noninvasive and easy, providing rapid evaluation, without requiring patient cooperation to
      evaluate the success of the block.
