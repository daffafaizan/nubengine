        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of cyclosporine, daunorubicin, and cytarabine in older
           patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the frequency and prognostic significance of functional and
           phenotypic P-glycoprotein expression and cytogenetics in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive cyclosporine IV and daunorubicin IV continuously on
           days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7. Patients who achieve complete
           response (CR) after chemotherapy receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) IV
           or subcutaneously beginning on day 15 or 20 and continuing until blood counts recover.
           Patients who maintain CR after 2 courses of induction therapy proceed to consolidation
           therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive treatment as in induction therapy with
           cyclosporine and daunorubicin on days 1-2 and cytarabine on days 1-5. Patients achieving
           CR receive an additional course of chemotherapy beginning at least 14 days after
           completion of the first course of cytarabine.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-64 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.
