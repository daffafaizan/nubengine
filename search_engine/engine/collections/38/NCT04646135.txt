      with the production of active metabolites, can lead to difficult management of sedative
      therapy and ventilatory weaning. The active metabolites, whose production is variable,
      determine in fact a difficulty in establishing a precision therapy, thus making it necessary
      to identify new molecules for sedation in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Lorazepam
      (LZ) is a benzodiazepine with an intermediate duration of activity, administered by
      continuous infusion or intermittent bolus, which has the advantages of higher potency
      compared to other benzodiazepines, a low cost and a metabolism that does not produce active
      metabolites. However, the presence of propylene glycol (PG), an excipient present in
      intravenous LZ formulations, although generally well tolerated, is potentially associated
      with episodes of tissue toxicity due to accumulation phenomena; this may represent a risk in
      cases where LZ is administered in high doses. This study, based on pharmacokinetic models
      obtained from data already available in the scientific literature, aims to define the
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of LZ for the analgosedation of pediatric
      patients admitted to intensive care and subjected to mechanical ventilation. Preliminary
      evaluation of sedative efficacy will be carried out through COMFORT-B scale assessment.
