        -  To determine the efficacy of permanent brachytherapy with iodine I 125 seeds in patients
           with localized prostate cancer.

        -  To determine the safety of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo permanent brachytherapy seed implantation comprised of iodine I 125 into the
      prostate. Some patients may receive combination treatment (e.g., external beam radiation
      therapy (EBRT) or hormone therapy in addition to brachytherapy).

      Quality of life and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is assessed and compared.
