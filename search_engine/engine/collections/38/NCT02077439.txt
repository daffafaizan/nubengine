    
      This study will investigate the recovery in hand and upper limb functions when the physical
      training is assisted by an exoskeleton robotic hand system.

      Subjects with a pure unilateral motor paresis after a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). All
      subjects should have sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions as well as understand
      the content and purpose of the experiment, and also should be able to sit up for 1 hour.

      During the training, you will be asked to do the hand open and hand grasp by
      Electromyography-driven robotic control strategy.

      There will be evaluations on the upper limb motor functions before and after the 20-session
      of training and follow up session by clinical assessments on functional recovery.
