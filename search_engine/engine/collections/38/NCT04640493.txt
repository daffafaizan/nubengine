      (SDB) in advanced heart failure patients. This project proposes to carry out research that
      addresses the established, but in clinical practice under-recognized association between
      Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and a worse prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF).
      SDB is highly prevalent in the HF population. Multiple studies have shown that HF accompanied
      by SDB is associated with an increased mortality compared to the absence of SDB. Two major
      types of SDB are prevalent in HF: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Central Sleep Apnea
      (CSA). Mechanistically, it has been proposed that SDB impacts the neurohumoral axis and
      systemic metabolism and therefore has particularly detrimental effects on the HF patient
      population. Therapeutic options for the treatment of SDB are limited. Heart Failure is a
      multisystemic disease leading to maladaptive cardiac and systemic metabolic changes.
      Recently, with SGLT2-Inhibitors a new drug class has been approved for the treatment of
      advanced heart failure. This is the first drug class in the HF drug armamentarium targeting
      cardiometabolic mechanisms. This study seeks to improve the health of individuals with heart
      failure by exploring whether SGLT2-Inhibition has a beneficial effect on SDB (OSA and CSA) in
      advanced heart failure patients and therefore may be a novel therapeutic option for the
      treatment of SDB in advanced HF. The specific aim of this project is to assess the effect of
      therapy with a SGLT2-I on SDB in ambulatory advanced HF patients by using the
      WatchPAT-derived apnea-hypopnea index as well as subjective measures of sleep quality using
      the Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
