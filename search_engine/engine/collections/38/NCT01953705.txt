      brain MRI derived white matter hyper-intensities (WMH) over 3 years in a population at risk
      for dementia. This trial is designed to collect preliminary data into the mechanism by which
      PUFA therapy operates on the brain with special attention to the vascular components.

      The randomized, double-blind and controlled trial will rigorously test PUFA effects versus a
      placebo in non-demented elders over 3 years. This biomarker based trial will enroll 100
      elders. Aim 1 will assess PUFA effects on neuroimaging parameter changes. Aim 2 will assess
      PUFA effects on blood-based biomarkers of endothelial health, and Aim 3 will collect
      preliminary data on PUFA effects on neuropsychological and functional parameters with special
      attention to the executive and speed of processing skills and gait speed.
