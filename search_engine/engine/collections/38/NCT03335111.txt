      patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Patients with anterior circulation
      acute ischemic stroke are enrolled and divided into control group and experimental group.
      Patients in experimental group are administrated with BAIPC within 3 days from the occurrence
      of stroke. The National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) will be evaluated at
      different time point to analyze the influence of BAIPC to acute ischemic patients. The level
      of IL-4, IL-6，TNF-α as well as the frequency of different sub-populations T cells in the
      blood at different time point will be detected to explore the possible mechanism of BAIPC
      protective function.
