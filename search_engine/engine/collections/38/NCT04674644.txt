      survey questionnaire working in public and university hospitals, including general dentists
      or specialists. The tool utilized for data collection was a designed online Google Forms
      questionnaire.

      This survey was implemented by using a questionnaire that included socio-demographic data
      (age range, gender, marital status, systemic disease, professional area, years of clinical
      experience, number of patients treated daily, smoking status, alcohol consumption, vs),
      epidemic-related questions and scales measuring the fear and anxiety levels of the
      participants.

      Fear of COVID-19 Scale is an unidimensional scale seven-item scale assessing anxiety
      regarding COVID-19 developed by Ahorsu et al. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale from 1
      (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) with scores ranging from 7 to 35. A higher score of
      the FCV-19S represents a greater level of fear. In the study, the bi-factor model and
      two-factor model consisting of the "emotional response" factor (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and
      "physiological response" factor (items 3, 6, and 7) were used.

      Coronavirus Anxiety Scale is an unidimensional tool that assesses the physiological reactions
      anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked to rate 5 items on a
      5-point Likert-type scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day over the last 2 weeks).
