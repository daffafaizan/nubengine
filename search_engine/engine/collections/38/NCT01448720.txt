    
      This is an open-label (patients and study staff will know the identity of treatments
      assigned) study of paliperidone palmitate in patients with acute an exacerbation of
      schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 4 months. Eligible
      patients without a documented history of exposure to oral risperidone or paliperidone
      extended-release (ER), or intramuscular (IM) RISPERDAL CONSTA or paliperidone palmitate will
      receive oral risperidone 1 mg/day or extended release (ER) OROS paliperidone 3 mg/day for at
      least 3 days before the first injection of the study drug (paliperidone palmitate) for
      tolerability testing. Paliperidone palmitate will be administered to patients as an
      intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid (upper arm) or gluteal (buttocks) muscle.
