      to aid in the diagnosis of VAP. However many studies have shown that chest x-ray is neither
      very sensitive nor specific for pneumonia, and computed tomography, though has the highest
      diagnostic accuracy, is not routinely performed due to logistics, safety concerns, economics
      and radiation exposure.

      Emerging studies including meta-analyses have shown high sensitivity and specificity of lung
      ultrasound in diagnosing pneumonia. When combined with clinical and microbiological features
      it has shown to be helpful in early diagnosis of VAP, but a study to show whether such early
      detection improves outcome is lacking.
