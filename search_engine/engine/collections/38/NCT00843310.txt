      therapy with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (autologous
      transplantation), can induce remission but relapse and death are inevitable. A growing body
      of literature suggests that consolidation therapy with autologous transplantation does not
      confer additional survival benefit and may have increased procedure-related morbidity and
      mortality in patients over 65 years old. Autologous transplantation is no longer recommended
      as standard care for this population. In addition, certain patients may not be eligible for
      autologous transplantation due to co-morbid medical conditions or may elect not to undergo
      the procedure for personal reasons.

      The historic standard of care for multiple myeloma patients who were not eligible for
      autologous transplantation for consolidation was induction therapy with melphalan/ prednisone
      (MP), often followed by some form of maintenance therapy after achievement of complete or
      partial remission. A recent phase 3 study showed that the addition of thalidomide to MP (MPT)
      demonstrated higher overall and complete response rates. For patients who are eligible for
      autologous transplantation, thalidomide/ dexamethasone (Thal Dex) induction therapy is
      considered the standard of care, but a phase 2 study of lenalidomide (Revlimid)/
      dexamethasone (Rev Dex) induction therapy demonstrated higher overall and complete response
      rates compared to Thal Dex. In addition, lenalidomide has a favorable side effect profile
      compared to thalidomide. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the combination of
      Revlimid/ melphalan/ dexamethasone (ReMeDex) induction therapy for myeloma patients who are
      not planned for autologous transplantation due to age restriction or other factors may
      demonstrate higher overall and/ or complete response rates with fewer side effects.
