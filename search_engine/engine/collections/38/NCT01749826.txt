      by acute and chronic opioid exposure. Preliminary evidence in animal models show that acute
      opioid exposure leads to decreased inflammatory responses, while chronic opioid exposure
      causes increased inflammatory responses, as measured by local cytokine release at the site of
      injury. Translating these findings to humans will lead to important new mechanistic knowledge
      that may ultimately improve our ability to treat pain.
