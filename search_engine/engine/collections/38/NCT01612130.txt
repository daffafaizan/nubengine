      third molar surgery. Study design: A single oral dose of either valerian (100 mg) or placebo
      was randomly administered one hour before each surgical procedure to 20 volunteers between 17
      and 31 years of age. Anxiety level was assessed through questionnaires, physiological
      parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) and the observation of signs.
