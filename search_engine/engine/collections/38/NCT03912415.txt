      Regimen as the first-line treatment for advanced cervical cancer. Subjects will receive study
      therapy Q3W until progression of the disease or signs of unacceptable toxicity. In the
      absence of dose-limiting toxicity chemotherapy should be continued for at least 6 cycles,
      then, upon Investigator's decision and/or subjects' wish, the use of chemotherapy can be
      stopped while maintenance therapy with BCD-100/Placebo with or without bevacizumab (depending
      on initial therapy choice) continues until disease progression.
