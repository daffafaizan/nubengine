      take place at 1-3 clinical centers in two phases. Phase 1 will include treatment of five
      patients with a three month stent indwell period at one clinical center. Phase 2 will include
      treatment of five additional patients with a 3-6 month stent indwell period at 1-3 clinical
      centers. Expected duration of participation for each patient is approximately 27 months for
      Phase 1 and approximately 27-30 months for Phase 2. All patients, regardless of phase, will
      be followed for 24 months after stent removal. Post-removal follow-up visits will occur at 1,
      3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
