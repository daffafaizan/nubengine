      million envenomations annually. Fatalities and hospitalizations occur annually, particularly
      in the Indo-Pacific regions. A new topical jellyfish sting inhibitor based on the mucous
      coating of the clown fish prevents 85% of jellyfish stings in laboratory settings.

      Clown fish inhabit within the tentacles of sea anemones, which have stinging cells similar to
      those of jellyfish, yet clown fish are not stung by the sea anemones. In controlled
      laboratory environments, the jellyfish sting inhibitor, Safe Seaâ„¢ when applied to volunteers'
      arms, prevented 100% of Chrysaora fuscescens stings and 70% of Chiropsalmus quadrumanus
      stings. Of the C. quadrumanus stings that occurred, their intensity was diminished. The field
      effectiveness is unknown. This is a field test to determine the real world effectiveness of
      Safe Sea to prevent jellyfish stings.
