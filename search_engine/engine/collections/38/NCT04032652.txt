      reaching the terminal ileum. The tablet dissolves at a pH 7 or greater, allowing mesalazine
      release in the terminal ileum and throughout the colon; hence, it would be anticipated that
      this form of 5-ASA will produce higher concentrations in the left colon in patients with
      active ulcerative colitis compared to other immediate release forms of 5-ASA. However,
      preliminary research using dynamic computer modeling and simulation predicted that patients
      with active ulcerative colitis (characterized by an increased stool frequency) treated with
      Asacol® and Lialda (another delayed release formulation) will achieve very low 5-ASA levels
      in the sigmoid colon and rectum. The model predicts that these 5-ASA preparations will be
      relatively ineffective in treating the left side of the colon in active ulcerative colitis.
