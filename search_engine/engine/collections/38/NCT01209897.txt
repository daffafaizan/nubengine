      a set of four smoking cessation booklets. These booklets cover different aspects of the
      smoking cessation process, and are designed to help smokers who differ in their levels of
      motivation to quit smoking. The purpose of the study is to compare different ways of matching
      booklets to smokers who vary in their motivation to quit smoking. Adult smokers (N=1,826)
      will be recruited via newspaper ads, fliers, and possibly other methods, depending on
      response rates. Participants will enroll in the study by telephoning the research staff in
      response to the advertisements. The smoking cessation booklets and surveys will be sent via
      US Mail. Smokers will be assigned randomly to one of three intervention conditions.
      Participants at baseline will answer a series of survey items regarding their motivation and
      plans (or lack thereof) for quitting smoking. The three intervention conditions differ in
      that each employs a different method of matching smokers to one of the four booklets.
      Essentially, we are comparing different strategies for allocating booklets to smokers.
      Participants will be surveyed two weeks and two months after receiving their smoking
      cessation booklet.
