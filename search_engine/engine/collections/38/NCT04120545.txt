      with placebo control.

      The size of the sample will be 56 participants who come to referral hospitals. They will be
      randomized in two groups: control or experimental.

      The variables of the study will be collected at three time points: before the intervention,
      during the intervention and at the end of the intervention.

      The statistical analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. For the main outcomes
      variables a two factor ANOVA will-be performed (intervention-time) with a post-hoc analysis
      with kruskal wallis correction correction. Statistical significance will be defined as p
      <0.05
