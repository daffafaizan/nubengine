      granulocyte transfusions, and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Despite the fact
      that the role of leukocyte antibodies in these reactions was first described almost 50 years
      ago, and that TRALI is now the leading cause of transfusion related fatalities, much remains
      uncertain concerning the role of HLA antibodies in these reactions. The primary purpose of
      this study is to retrospectively and prospectively determine if the incidence and nature of
      transfusion reactions differs in Clinical Center (CC) patients that were transfused with
      platelet components from donors with HLA antibodies and those without HLA antibodies. In
      addition, this study will prospectively determine the incidence of HLA antibodies in the NIH
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) platelet donor population. In this natural history
      study a 10-mL blood sample will be drawn from 600 platelet donors at the time that they are
      in the DTM donating platelets and it will be tested for HLA antibodies in the DTM. The blood
      sample for HLA antibody testing will be collected with other samples collected as part of the
      regular platelet donation process. Reactions in platelet transfusion recipients will be
      assessed by reviewing CC and DTM patient records.
