      adult service. This is a study to determine the predictive value of quantifying
      concentrations of specific MMPs. Coupling this with a specialized collection sample
      collection system and a calibrated fluorimetry allows for the rapid assessment of MMP
      concentrations. This assay has been validated as a predictor of failed wound healing in a
      published clinical study involving chronic open wounds.
