    
      Diaphragm function will be assessed through phrenic nerve stimulation allowing to measure the
      twitch airway pressure during airway occlusion (expressed in cmH2O). It will be assessed
      during a spontaneous breathing trial for each patient with a known critical illness
      neuromyopathy. The diaphragm (thickness and course) will be studied by ultrasound assessment
      as well. Peripheral limbs force will be evaluated by the MRC score. A total of 40 analysable
      patients will be included.

      All these measurements will be made at the time of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)
      during the weaning phase. No modification of the clinical practices of the care should be
      modified by the study. The twitch airway pressure during airway occlusion will be assessed at
      the begining of the SBT. The other measurements will be performed 30 mn after the SBT if this
      one will be well tolerated.

      Participants will be followed for the duration of ICU stay.
