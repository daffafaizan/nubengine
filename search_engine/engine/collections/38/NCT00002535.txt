      number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) obtained from the tumor specimen of patients
      with advanced melanoma. II. Determine the efficacy of administering concurrent indomethacin
      to maximize immune effector cell function in situ during interleukin-2/TIL therapy in these
      patients. III. Determine the relationship between the phenotypic character of TIL (generated
      in culture from the patient's tumor) and the response to therapy. IV. Correlate the lytic
      activity or lymphokine production of TIL (generated in culture from the patient's tumor) with
      clinical response to therapy. V. Generate and use lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in
      those patients who do not have TIL available for therapy and evaluate LAK cells in the same
      manner as TIL.

      OUTLINE: Patients with resectable tumors and with adequate generation of TIL are treated on
      Regimen A; those with unresectable tumors or insufficient TIL are treated on Regimen B. The
      following acronyms are used: CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 IL-2 Interleukin-2 (Cetus),
      NSC-373364 LAK Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells TIL Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Regimen
      A: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin;
      plus CTX; IL-2-activated TIL; IL-2. Regimen B: Prostaglandin Inhibition Therapy plus
      Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Indomethacin; plus IL-2-activated LAK; IL-2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued over 3 years. If 0 of the first 10
      patients, no more than 1 of the first 15 patients, or no more than 2 of the first 20 patients
      respond, accrual will cease.
