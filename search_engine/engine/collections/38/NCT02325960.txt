      of metformin (≥1500 mg daily) will be randomized (1:1) to receive exenatide or insulin
      glargine for 16 weeks. Exenatide will be administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection
      30- 60 minutes before breakfast and dinner; the dose was 5 μg twice-daily for the first 4
      weeks of treatment and 10 μg thereafter. Insulin glargine will be administered once daily at
      bedtime by subcutaneous injection. The dose of insulin glargine will initiate at ≥8 IU
      once-daily, and titrate based on a dosing algorithm targeting fasting blood glucose (FPG)<6.1
      mmol/L. Titration is only allowed in first 4 weeks. At the end of the study, data will be
      collected and analyzed.
