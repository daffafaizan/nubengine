      humans by converting into nitric oxide bioactivity. Here we will study if vegetables that
      naturally contain high amounts of nitrate (green leafy vegetables) can lower blood pressure
      and whether any effect is attributed to the nitrate anion. High nitrate vegetables are
      compared with vegetables low in nitrate (e.g. tomatoes, sweet pepper). After a 2 week run in
      period where all subjects receive vegetables low in nitrate, the participants are randomized
      to one of three interventions. One third of the patients receive high-nitrate vegetables + a
      placebo pill (KCl), one third receives low-nitrate vegetables + placebo and the third group
      receives low-nitrate vegetables + a nitrate pill (KNO3). The nitrate content in the pill is
      precisely matched to the nitrate content in the high-nitrate vegetable group.
