      Studies have consistently demonstrated an increased rate of prone positioning in African
      American infants, but very little is known about the reasons why African American parents use
      the prone position more often than other racial groups. Furthermore, no studies have taken
      advantage of the observed socioeconomic status associated variablility in SIDS and prone
      sleeping within the African American community. By examing within-group differences, it is
      possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions (i.e. comparisions of white and
      African American) to identification of potentially modifiable factors that might respond to
      culturally acceptable interventions within a disadvantaged group.
