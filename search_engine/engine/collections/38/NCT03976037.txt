    
      This randomized controlled trial of consenting women undergoing induction of labor with
      combined misoprostol and Foley catheter seeks to efficacy of vaginal versus buccal
      misoprostol route of administration.

      This project will include 216 women presenting at Christiana Care Health System. Women will
      be included if they are at least 37 weeks gestation, have a singleton pregnancy, have intact
      membranes and are undergoing an induction of labor using a Foley catheter combined with
      misoprostol. Following admission, women will be randomized into either vaginal or buccal
      misoprostol.

      Women will be randomized with equal probability to the intervention group using block
      randomization stratified by party.

      Patients will receive 25 micrograms of misoprostol along with the insertion of a16F Foley
      catheter. Misoprostol can be repeated up to five additional times for a maximum of 24 hours
      or a total of 6 doses if the patient is not contracting more than 3 times per 10 minutes. The
      remainder of labor management will be at the discretion of each woman's obstetric provider.

      Prior to discharge from the hospital, baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained
      via chart review
