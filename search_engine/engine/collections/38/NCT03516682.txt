    
      Parents of children less than 11 months of age will be identified as delayed or missing
      vaccinations due to logistic barriers in the Kaiser Permanente Colorado population. Parents
      identified will be randomized to the intervention arm or the usual care arm. Those in the
      intervention arm will receive automated reminders for the 6 month and 12 month vaccine
      visits. Reminders will include scheduling information as well as access to a website with
      vaccine and scheduling information. They will also have an opportunity to provide preferences
      in how they receive the automated reminders (text, phone or email). There will be 2 reminders
      before the 6 and 12 month visits and 2 after the 6 and 12 month visits. Parents will be
      excluded from receiving reminders if they have received vaccines within the time frame when
      they are eligible to receive another vaccine or have a well child visit scheduled.
