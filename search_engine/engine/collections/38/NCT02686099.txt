    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new technology for sternal closure that combines
      rigid plate fixation with a cerclage material in patients undergoing a cardiac surgery
      subsequent to a full median sternotomy. This study will evaluate intraoperative outcomes
      related to the surgical technique and performance of the device, sternal healing and
      stability, sternal wound complications and postoperative recovery (e.g. pain and functional
      status) in patients closed with this device. For comparative purposes, a control group of
      wire cerclage patients will be included.
