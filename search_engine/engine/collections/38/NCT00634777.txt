    
      - The primary objective is to assess the negative predictive value (NPV) of PET as a single
      examination in correctly predicting the absence of remaining invaded lymph nodes after
      chemoradiotherapy for advanced HNSCC.

      Secondary objectives include :

        -  The evaluation of the suitability of a wait and see approach without neck dissection in
           patients considered as complete responders ( based on clinical evaluation and imaging
           assessment including PET : all these diagnosis tools should be negative to consider a
           patient as a complete responder); this suitability will be estimated using the negative
           predictive value of the overall assessment of a complete response including PET-FDG but
           also the clinical evaluation and imaging.

        -  The evaluation of the ability of PET-FDG to correctly predict remaining pathologically
           invaded lymph nodes (PPV) after chemoradiotherapy for advanced HNSCC in patients with a
           postchemoradiation positive PET a (and who will therefore be considered with less than a
           complete regional or locoregional response and who will undergo at least neck
           dissection.
