    
      1. Goals:

           Compare quality of analgesia and quality of recovery between bilateral ESP bilateral
           catheters versus Opioid analgesia in paediatric patients for liver transplantation
           reduce the peri operative opioid consumption

        2. Methodology:

             -  Selection criteria:

                  -  Age > 1 to 15 years old

                  -  Have a clinical indication for Liver transplantation ( list for surgeries
                     listed in full proposal)

                  -  Agree to participate in the trial ( Parents or guardians)

             -  Exclusion criteria:

                  -  Refusal participation.

                  -  Allergy to LA

                  -  Intubated ventilated pre-operation

                  -  Severe coagulation disorder

                  -  Coma

                  -  Prediction of large volume liver implanted

                  -  After surgery performed

                       -  Large volume implanted with a need of post operative controlled
                          ventilation

                       -  Organ failure

                  -  Unstable patient

             -  Study design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

           Patients who agree to join the study will be randomized into 2 groups:

           Group 1 (Control group): standard of care in Liver Transplantation for paediatric
           recipients: Intra-operative analgesia by Opioid sufentanil and post operative analgesia
           by patient controled analgesia assisted by nurse opioid morphine based on the protocol
           established by Prof Lee Vinmec transplantation surgical committee Group 2 (treatment
           group): Standard peri-operative analgesia for paediatric recipients in institution since
           we use regional anaesthesia as first line treatment for peri-operative analgesia
           Bilateral ESP catheters with continuous regional analgesia by infusion of local
           anesthestic (Ropivacaine) based on the guidelines by paediatric society of
           anesthesiologists and based on our recent article published in regional anaesthesia and
           pain medicine

           Sample size: We expected to reduce the peri operative opioid consumption by 85% for
           liver receipt The sample size of 10 patients per group is required to detect such
           changes assuming a confidence interval of 95% with a power of 90% and alpha = 0.05.
           Considering 20% of drop-out, the total sample size is 40 patients (20 patients each
           group)

        3. Project outcomes:

      The Primary outcome correlation between

        -  Pain quality evaluated by

        -  Opioids consumption The secondary outcomes

        -  Time to extubate

        -  Time to discharge from Intensive care Unit (ICU) we will create criteria to determinate
           when patient will discharge from ICU to go to high dependency In most of advanced
           hospital they don't keep a long time patient in ICU and send the patient to high
           dependency unit in surgery As in Institution we don't have we will keep the patient in
           ICU

        -  Time to discharge from hospital

        -  Time to first intake

        -  Any complication related to one type of analgesia
