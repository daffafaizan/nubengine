      tumor surgery after which valacyclovir pills are taken for 14 days. Two courses of AdV-tk,
      each followed by valacyclovir, are given as adjuvant to standard of care therapies (surgery
      and/or chemoradiation) which have been shown to work cooperatively with AdV-tk to kill tumor
      cells. Arm A is for resectable tumors in which the first course is given prior to surgery and
      the second is at the time of surgery. Arm B is for locally advanced disease in which both
      AdV-tk injections are administered by needle injection into the tumor before and during
      chemoradiation. The hypothesis is that this combination therapy can be safely delivered and
      will lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.
