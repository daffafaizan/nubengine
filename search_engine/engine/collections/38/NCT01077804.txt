      a six-month period in 1995 (June-November) at KPMCP Northern California were interviewed by
      telephone at 6-month intervals to ascertain whether their child had varicella or herpes
      zoster in the 6 months prior to interview. Follow-up continued for a minimum of 14 years
      after vaccination.
