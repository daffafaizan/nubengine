      biopsychosocial factors can be involved. This condition is associated with a high
      socio-economic burden. The standard of care treatment for chronic neck pain in clinical
      practice is a combination of advice, passive manual treatment techniques and neck exercises.
      The implementation of exercise for the treatment of chronic neck pain is indeed recommended
      in several clinical guidelines. Nevertheless, exercise programs show positive though limited
      effects, which can be explained by its biomechanical and physiological effects on muscles and
      joints, but a current lack of taking into account important biopsychosocial and
      neurophysiological factors. For instance, specific local exercises can lead to acute pain
      flare-ups, hampering patient satisfaction and the adherence to exercise programs. While it is
      shown that general aerobic exercise leads to decreased generalized pain sensitivity, also in
      the affected body parts, both immediately and on the longer term, although on the longer term
      the effects on local pain sensitivity are better for specific local exercises.

      It can be hypothesized that a blended treatment program in which local specific neck
      exercises are combined with general aerobic exercise in counteractive amount will avoid pain
      flare-ups and maladaptive exercise perceptions, positively influencing treatment adherence
      and generating the most optimal clinical outcome due to the local and general effects.

      Therefore the aim of this project is to investigate the effect of a blended treatment program
      (I) to a specific exercise program alone (C1) and to a general aerobic exercise program alone
      (C2) on pain intensity and cost effectiveness (primary outcome measures), and also on Global
      Perceived Effect, other pain-related outcomes, quality of life and functionality, lifestyle
      factors, and health-economic measures (secondary outcome measures) (O) in chronic
      non-specific neck pain patients (P).
