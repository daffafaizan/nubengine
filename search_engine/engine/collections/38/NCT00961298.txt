    
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is commonly associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome(IBS).
      The etiology of IBS remains unknown and it is often refractory to treatment. Duloxetine has
      demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of GAD as well as other pain disorders including
      fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy.

      We plan to study 30 subjects with diagnoses of IBS and GAD between the ages of 18 and 65
      years. There will be a single-blind placebo-run-in for the first 2 weeks, followed by
      open-label duloxetine for 12 weeks flexibly titrated to 120 mg/day. Subjects will be informed
      that they will receive placebo for 2 weeks during the trial. All study visits will be at
      Allegheny General Hospital Department of Psychiatry. The study consists of a total of nine
      office visits.
