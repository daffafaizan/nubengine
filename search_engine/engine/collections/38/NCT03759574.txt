      perioperative approach and is essential in preventing postoperative morbidity and reducing
      hospital length-of-stay. Intact orthostatic blood pressure regulation is essential for early
      postoperative mobilization. However, early postoperative mobilization can be delayed due to
      postoperative orthostatic hypotension (POH) defined as a fall in systolic pressure > 20 mmHg
      and/or diastolic pressure > 10 mmHg or due to postoperative orthostatic intolerance (POI),
      characterized by dizziness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision or syncope during mobilization.
      Although these conditions are well-known clinical problems that can delay early mobilization,
      relatively few data are available on pathophysiological mechanisms and possible treatments.

      Several prospective studies with standardized mobilization procedures have already
      established that the incidence of POI and POH after THA is 38-42% at 6 hours after surgery.

      Previous studies on patients undergoing prostatectomy and THA have also demonstrated that
      attenuated vasopressor response and a concomitant reduction in cardiac output (CO) and
      cerebral perfusion during postural changes after surgery contributes to POI and POH.
      Strategies aiming to reduce the incidence of POI and POH by pain management, vasoconstrictive
      treatment with alpha-1 receptor agonist, optimized fluid management with goal-directed fluid
      therapy and reduction of surgical stress-response with pre-operative high-dose glucocorticoid
      did not solve the problem.

      The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of POI and POH remain to be elucidated and this is
      therefore the aim of the current prospective observational study.
