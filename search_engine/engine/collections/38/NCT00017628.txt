      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) harvesting. PBSCs are collected over several days. Patients who do not mobilize
      sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest. Harvested PBSCs or bone marrow then undergo
      T-lymphocyte depletion.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5 and methylprednisolone IV
      daily on days -4 to -1. Patients also undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -4
      to -1. Lymphocyte-depleted PBSCs or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF
      SC daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts have recovered for 3 days.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years.
