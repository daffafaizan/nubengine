      recently found that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) using transient external
      compression of the upper arm prior to cardiac surgery was effective for reducing the
      occurrence of AKI (37.5% compared to 52.5% with sham; absolute risk reduction (ARR),15%; 95%
      CI, 2.56% to 27.44%; P=0.02). Fewer patients treated with RIPC received renal replacement
      therapy (RRT) (5.8% versus 15.8%; ARR, 10%; 95% CI, 2.25% to 17.75%; P=0.01). Moreover, the
      investigators found that the effectiveness of this intervention was strongly associated with
      the release of cell-cycle arrest biomarkers into the urine. Patients with urinary tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
      ([TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]) ≥ 0.5 (ng/ml)(ng/ml)/1000 before surgery had a significantly reduced rate
      of AKI compared to patients with lower urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] concentration (relative risk
      (RR), 67%; 95% CI, 53% to 83%, P<0.001) whereas the biomarker concentrations after surgery
      predicted AKI as previously shown. This effect makes sense because cell-cycle arrest is
      thought to be part of the protective mechanisms endothelial cells use when exposed to stress.
      Stimulating these responses with RIPC should reduce AKI. Importantly, only 56% of patients
      treated with RIPC achieved an increase in urine [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] to ≥ 0.5, and only in this
      group was the intervention effective-patients that did not achieve this level showed no
      benefit.

      Our goal is to eventually design and conduct a Bayesian 2-stage adaptive design sequence
      trial to evaluate the effectiveness of RIPC to prevent AKI in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. The dimensions of dose include duration, intensity and number of cycles. However,
      before this trial can be designed we need to answer 4 questions: i. Do baseline urinary
      [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels predict AKI (enrichment)? ii. Do [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] changes elicited
      by RIPC predict protection (RIPC efficacy measure)? iii. Is there a dose-response
      relationship between RIPC "dose" and [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]? iv. Is a dose-escalation RIPC
      protocol where doses are increased for non-responders, feasible and safe within the
      anesthesia workflow for cardiac surgery cases (practical)?
