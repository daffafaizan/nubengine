      be interviewed in the holding area and informed signed consent will be obtained. Patients
      will be induced with general anesthesia in keeping with standard practice. At the end of
      surgical procedure, before the patient is extubated, the Surgeon will secure the 2 catheters
      of the ON-Q pump at two levels of the fascia near the incision site. First the surgeon will
      instill at the wound site a bolus dose of 30 ml of 0.9% saline with 10 mg Ketorolac in Group
      I, or 30 ml of saline with 0.5% Ropivacaine and 10 mg Ketorolac in Group II patients. Then
      the continuous infusion with the ON-Q pump will be started at 4 ml/hr, and Group I patients
      will receive saline with Ketorolac at 5 mg/hr not to exceed 120 mg per day, and Group II will
      receive saline with 0.5% Ropivacaine plus Ketorolac at 5 mg/hr. Patients will be extubated,
      as per standard anesthetic practice. All patients will receive anti ulcer medication. On
      arrival at the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), the patient will receive an i.v. PCA pump,
      which will administer Morphine Sulfate 2 mg in incremental doses on demand by the patient.

      A blinded investigator will collect the study data from each patient at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hrs
      postoperative periods. The data collected would include 1) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores
      for pain at rest, on coughing and on moving, 2) PCA demands by the patient and actual
      deliveries of morphine, 3) "rescue" analgesic requirements (for pain score of 4 or greater).
      4) VAS scores for Nausea, drowsiness, and satisfaction, and 5) number of vomiting.
