      assigned into two groups: 1) sevoflurane-based general anesthesia group, and 2)
      propofol-based general anesthesia group. Each group will need 221 patients to detect 1/3 of
      decrease or increase in the rate of POCD of one group compared with another group at about
      one week after surgery, assuming the overall rate of POCD at this time is about 40% at this
      time. Considering about 10% loss to follow-up, we will have 250 patients in each group. In
      addition, investigators will need 184 subjects in the control group. The data of these
      control subjects will be used to normalize the data of the two studied groups to diagnose
      POCD. The subjects in control groups will also be elderly but without the exposure to
      anesthesia and surgery.
