      using standard questionnaires with closed-ended response choices. Questionnaires for
      physicians will be developed and tested using best practices for instrument development. The
      questions will be tailored to the study aims and the information provided in the the vial
      preparation instruction card, the intravitreal injection procedure video, and the Eylea
      product monograph.

      Other questions will obtain information needed to assess potential differences across
      subgroups and identify any biases (e.g., demographics, experience with Eylea).

      The questionnaire will be tested through cognitive interviews with physicians. Questionnaires
      will be tested in local languages, to assure that the introductory material, consent forms,
      and questionnaire items (question stems and response choices) are culturally appropriate and
      easily and correctly understood by individuals similar to those who will participate
