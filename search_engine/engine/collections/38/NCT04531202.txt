      availability of resources). It is appreciated that settings will vary in terms of clinical
      infrastructure, resources and capacity. This study will enrol eligible patients (adults) with
      confirmed or suspected infection with a pathogen relevant to the study objectives.
      Recruitment of patients with Day 1 (enrolment) data and biological samples is the priority.

      Observational analyses will be stratified according to available data. Outcome data for
      primary and secondary objectives will be derived from data from routine clinical and
      laboratory assessments performed as part of standard inpatient medical management at the
      treating site, documented using proportionate case report forms (CRF; either paper or
      web-based electronic 'eCRF'). Clinical and laboratory data will be collected throughout the
      acute illness period according to local resources. Priority at all times will be given to the
      collection of clinical information. Research data will be integrated as much as possible with
      information available from hospital and regulatory files.
