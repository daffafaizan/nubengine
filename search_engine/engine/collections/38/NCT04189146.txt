      in-person course. Briefly, this course is a 1-2 day in-person course, in which participants
      will learn a simple 21 minute practice called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, also known as
      Shambhavi Kriya. Shambhavi Kriya is a powerful and purifying energy technique which
      incorporates the breath. This practice is said to align the body systems so that the body,
      mind and emotions function in harmony. More information about the course can be found on the
      ISHA foundation website: https://www.innerengineering.com/ieo-new/completion/.

      Registrants are asked to complete a series of seven online modules prior to the start of the
      in-person course. The online series provides the participants with an opportunity to
      intellectually explore the basics of life using methods that are distilled from the essence
      of yogic sciences. The course imparts wisdom to manage the body, mind, emotions, and the
      fundamental life energy within.

      Importantly, the course modules and the in-person meeting and subsequent meditation and yoga
      practices would occur regardless of whether or not a person decided to participate in the
      study. The only study procedure imparted includes requesting the participants to complete a
      series of surveys over a one-year period.

      This study only involves administration of electronic surveys at six different time points.
      These time points include: at the time of consent; after completing the Inner Engineering
      Online modules but before the in-person course begins; after the completion of the in-person
      course; at 6 weeks; 6 month and 12 months. These surveys can take up to 15 minutes to
      complete. Electronic reminders will be sent to participants who have not completed these
      surveys within a week.
