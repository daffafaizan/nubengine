        1. To study the natural course of tennis elbow/spontaneous recovery of chronic (lasting for
           over 12 months) tennis elbow and the results of surgery in a pragmatic setting.

        2. To investigate the patients' expectations of the treatment, and define the patient
           acceptable symptomatic state, or PASS, in tennis elbow.

        3. To investigate the effect of pain behaviour on treatment results and PASS.

        4. To delineate the existence of a potential "response shift" -phenomenon in patients with
           a tennis elbow.

        5. To determine the feasibility of a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomised trial by
           finding out the actual number of patients in each center and those that may be suitable
           for the FINITE-RCT. The investigators will also test the functioning and response of the
           planned outcome measures in this environment and for this purpose.

      Study setting The study is carried out as a prospective open-label multi-center cohort study.

      The study was originally planned with a follow-up up to 10 years, but the cost-benefit of the
      long term follow-up was evaluated after the completion of one year data collection, and the
      decision was made to shorten the follow-up to include two year data, but no further
      follow-ups.
