      local recurrence after having a lymphadenectomy for stage 3 melanoma. The control arm is
      surgery alone with radiotherapy reserved for those who recur. The study arm is surgery plus
      post-operative radiotherapy. All 3 major node sites are eligible. The radiation dose
      administered is 48Gy in 20 fractions. It is likely to be the only study of its kind ever
      performed. The target is 230 patients.
