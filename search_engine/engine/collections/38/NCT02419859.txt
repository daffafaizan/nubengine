    
      This is a prospective, single center, open-label, uncontrolled study to assess the efficacy,
      safety, and patient reported outcomes of insulin delivery with PaQÂ® in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin therapy with or
      without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's participation in
      the study is comprised of three phases: screening/baseline evaluation, transition to PaQ use
      and optimization, and PaQ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an orderly
      transition to PaQ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret the final
      data.
