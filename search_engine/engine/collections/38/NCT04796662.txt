    
      The purpose of the study is to collect data that are parameters of post-IOL implantation
      safety:

        -  Questionnaire on subjective quality of vision

        -  Centration and anteroposterior position of the IOL (using biometry)

        -  Presence and quantification of any inflammation or pigment present in the anterior
           chamber (flare meter)

        -  Refractive outcome, with calculation of customized A-constant of the CT Lucia 601 IOL
           in-the-sulcus and quantification of higher-order aberrations (HOA)

        -  General safety-parameters:

             -  Visual acuity

             -  Intra-ocular pressure

             -  Presence of macular edema or retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning (SD-OCT)

             -  Any adverse ophthalmic events
