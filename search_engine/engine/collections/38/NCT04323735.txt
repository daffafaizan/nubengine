    
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common outpatient infection world-wide, and for
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic bladder (NB), it is the most common
      infection, secondary condition, cause for emergency room visits, and infectious cause of
      hospitalization. Despite its prevalence, attempts to ameliorate UTI among people with SCI are
      stymied by long-standing diagnostic challenges which arise from evidence gaps around "gold
      standard" diagnostic tests (urinalysis and urine culture) that have lower sensitivity and
      specificity for UTI in this population. A high prevalence of chronic inflammation leading to
      persistence of white blood cells (WBC) in the urine confounds the utility of WBC count,
      pyuria, and leukocyte esterase as biomarkers for UTI; nitrites in urine indicate the presence
      of only specific (but not all) organisms, many of which are present to a greater extent in
      the urine of people with SCI; and people with SCI have a high prevalence of asymptomatic
      bacteriuria. These physiologic changes render the gold standard diagnostic tests less useful
      for identifying UTI in persons with SCI.

      SA1. Estimate healthy, asymptomatic state variability of urine NGAL (uNGAL), white blood
      cells (uWBC), nitrite, cultivable bacteria, and the urinary microbiome.

      SA2. Estimate the effect of intravesical LGG dose on urinary symptoms (primary outcome),
      uNGAL, uWBC, nitrites, cultivable bacteria, and the urine microbiome (secondary outcomes).
