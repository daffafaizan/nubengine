      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat oral doses of pazopanib at lower doses than those
      previously studied. The first part of the study is designed as an open-label, non-randomized,
      single session, parallel-group, sequential dose-rising to investigate pharmacokinetics of
      single oral doses in healthy adult subjects. In the second part of the study, healthy elderly
      subjects will participate in one 14 day repeat-dose session, randomized to receive either
      pazopanib or placebo. Dose escalation within Part 2, is based upon emerging safety and PK
      data from each preceding repeat dosing cohort from at least 7 days of safety data as well as
      emerging safety and PK data from single dose. The elderly population chosen for the second
      part of the study will more closely reflect the target population for the AMD indication. The
      results from the current study will assist in the dose selection of the subsequently planned
      study in patients with AMD.
