      applications of BOS-356 gel or vehicle gel to the face during a 14-day treatment period.
      Doses will be escalated in successive cohorts with BOS-356 gel 0.1%, 0.4%, and 0.7%.

      In Cohort 4, participants will be randomized to receive BID topical applications of BOS-356
      gel or vehicle gel to the face, upper chest, upper back, shoulders, and posterior neck during
      a 28-day treatment period. The dose of BOS-356 to be used in this cohort will be determined
      based on safety and tolerability data from Cohorts 1-3.

      In Cohort 5, participants will complete a 7-day run-in period to receive BID topical
      applications of vehicle gel to the face. Participants will be randomized to receive BID
      topical applications of BOS-356 gel or vehicle gel to the face during a 28-day treatment
      period. The dose of BOS-356 to be used in this cohort will be the same as the dose used in
      Cohort 4. Cohorts 4 and 5 may proceed in parallel.
