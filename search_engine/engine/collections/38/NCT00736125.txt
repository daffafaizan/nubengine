      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) or memory impairment following surgery. Transcranial doppler
      (TCD) monitoring of blood flow to the brain has detected cerebral emboli in 60% of patients
      following release of the thigh tourniquet during total knee replacement or arthroplasty
      (TKA). These cerebral embolic events may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for
      postoperative cognitive problems.

      The standard surgical technique for TKA involves cleaning the bone surfaces with pulsed
      saline lavage prior to cementation and prosthesis insertion. The CarboJet Assisted technique
      utilizes carbon dioxide lavage to clean and dry the femur canal and bone surfaces prior to
      cementation and implantation. Because it removes fat globules and marrow particulates from
      the bone surfaces, it is hypothesized that the use of a carbon dioxide lavage technique in
      TKA will result in fewer thromboembolic events and increased cement penetration compared with
      the standard technique using pulsed saline lavage. Cement penetration affects the strength of
      the bone-cement interface and, therefore, contributes to implant longevity.
