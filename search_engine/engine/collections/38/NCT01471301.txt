      involvement. Approximately 1-2% of patients with SLE have joint inflammation similar to
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are no well-designed studies of lupus arthropathy.

      Primary objectives: To evaluate the ultrasonographic examination of the hands in patients
      with systemic lupus erythematosus and make its correlation with examination of patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) established and with clinical, serological, radiological and
      functional.

      Material and methods: a transversal study will be carried out on patients diagnosed with with
      SLE and RA.

      Clinical Instruments: count of swollen and tender joints, visual analogue scale (VAS) for
      pain (0-10 cm), edema and for disease activity; disease activity (DAS 28 and SLEDAI), hand
      grip strength and pinch (Jamar dynamometer and Preston Pinch Gauge); functional
      questionnaires (HAQ and DASH). It will be observed the presence of "puffy hands", Raynaud's
      phenomenon and presence of autoantibodies.

      Radiographic instruments: evaluation of radiographs of hands and wrists according to the
      Sharp score modified by van der Heijde. Ultrasonographic Instruments (quantitative and
      semi-quantitative measures): synovial hyperplasia, synovial blood flow (Power Doppler), bone
      erosions and cartilage. The joints that will be evaluated: radiocarpal, distal radioulnar,
      first to fifth metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal. Ultrasonographic
      interobserver reproducibility will be carried out in 10% of the patients. All the examinators
      will be blind for each other findings. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP will be investigated in
      RA patients. Statistical significance will be set at 5%.
