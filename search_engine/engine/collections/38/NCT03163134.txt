      Considerably high postoperative CSF leaks were reported and were a major cause of concern due
      CSF fistula increasing risk of infection. Since external lumbar drain can lower CSF pressure
      and is believed to prevent post operative CSF leak, it was used commonly after EEA. With
      improvements in EEA skull base reconstructions using a nasal septal flap in the recent years,
      postoperative CSF leaks have been reported in much lower rates. With this improvement in
      reconstruction techniques, the use of lumbar drain may not be necessary as it may not
      significantly lower the risk of CSF leak further. In this prospective randomized study, we
      will randomize subjects at high risk for CSF leak to either receive a prophylactic lumbar
      drain or to not receive a prophylactic lumbar drain and compare the rate of CSF leaks and
      other complications in the two groups.
