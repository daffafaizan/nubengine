    
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of ficlatuzumab versus placebo when administered with erlotinib in
      subjects with previously untreated metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BDX004 Positive Label.

      Prior to screening, subjects will have tested positive for a sensitizing EGFR mutation to
      determine eligibility for treatment with erlotinib. During screening, subject serum samples
      will be tested using the investigational companion diagnostic (BDX004) test. Only those
      subjects who have a BDX004 Positive Label will be enrolled. Subject randomization will be
      stratified by EGFR mutation type and smoking status (ever versus never smokers). Subjects
      will be designated as never smokers if they have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their
      lifetime. Radiographic tumor assessment, to include CT or MRI of chest and abdomen, will be
      performed every 4 weeks for the first 8 cycles, and every 8 weeks thereafter, using the same
      imaging modality per subject. Safety assessments will be performed on an ongoing basis.
