      performed and 177 patients per group will be necessary to confirm a 20% difference of
      efficacy of the block at 30 minutes (α=0,05; β=0,1). Epidural catheter will be inserted and a
      standardized analgesic protocol will initiate. The efficacy of the block will be assessed
      after 30 minutes and at delivery. The apparition of adverse effects during puncture and
      labour will be annotated. The need for repuncture of the block and the repercussion of the
      technique on the delivery and the fetus will be recorded as well. At 24 hours, investigators
      will assess the incidence of pain at the site of puncture (PSP) and the level of maternal
      satisfaction on a 0 to10 numeric scale.
