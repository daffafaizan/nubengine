      Primary

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with previously untreated,
           extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treated with pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the response rate in patients 70 years and older treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the toxicity of this regimen in patients 70 years and older.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (< 70 years vs
      ≥ 70 years).

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease in the CNS
      only may receive whole-brain radiotherapy and then continue chemotherapy after completion of
      whole-brain radiotherapy for up to 6 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 77 patients at least 46 who are < 70 years of age and at
      least 24 who are ≥ 70 years of age) will be accrued for this study within 20-26 months.
