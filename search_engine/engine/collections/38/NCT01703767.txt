      health conditions at the present time. Many GW1 Veterans are still unhappy with their health
      care at the VA, and other stakeholders are critical of how the VA has dealt with GW1
      Veterans' issues. For these reasons, the Gulf War Veterans' Illness Task Force (GWVI-TF) was
      set up to find ways to improve the situation.

      The present survey study addresses one of GWVI-TF's missions, that is, to identify gaps in VA
      services, and to discover opportunities to better serve GW1V. Caring for GW1V is a top
      priority for VA health care providers, which is all the more pressing for the following
      reasons: 1. medical science of Gulf War Illness and environmental exposures is still at its
      infancy, 2. most providers have not received any focused education about how to take care of
      GW1V and the unique medical problems these veterans face, 3. a lack of provider knowledge
      that GW1V may receive may lead to decreased satisfaction on the part of GW1V and may result
      in GW1V perceived health service quality that is compromised.

      In this pilot study, we focus on #2 and #3, to determine how we may understand veterans'
      perceptions of their medical treatment to ultimately improve GW1V medical health outcomes.
