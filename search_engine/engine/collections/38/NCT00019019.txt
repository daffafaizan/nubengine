        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with
           carboxyamidotriazole in patients with advanced solid tumors or refractory lymphomas.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Identify diseases for which this combination appears active.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) daily with paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day
      8 and every 3 weeks thereafter. Course 1 is 28 days and all other subsequent courses are 21
      days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment.

      Sequential dose escalation of CAI is followed by sequential dose escalation of paclitaxel.
      Dose escalation in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
