      overdose, and substance abuse-related economic costs is rapidly increasing. Despite the
      prevalence of Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD), only 10% of SUD patients receive treatment. The
      initial link into care is often one of the hardest barriers to overcome due to wait times,
      complex systems to navigate, and fluctuating motivation. Hospitalization is often a time when
      patients are more receptive to SUD treatment. One potential effective treatment approach is
      peer recovery support services. Currently at Greenville Memorial Hospital, there is no direct
      link between hospitalization and outpatient care for patients with SUD, making it difficult
      to start or continue the recovery process. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the
      impact of the initiation of peer recovery services during hospitalization on addiction
      severity and quality of life. By establishing a successful inpatient link to recovery
      treatment, this study may lead to the development of an effective method of care that can
      readily be implemented into the healthcare system.
