    
      -  Conducting an initial small, controlled trial to assess for therapeutic biologics
           activity (proof-of-concept) that suggests the potential for clinical benefit of COVID-19
           patients.

        -  20 Moderate COVID-19 patients

        -  Moderate COVID-19

        -  Positive testing by standard RT-PCR assay or equivalent testing

        -  Symptoms of moderate illness with COVID-19, which could include any symptom of mild
           illness or shortness of breath with exertion

        -  Clinical signs suggestive of moderate illness with COVID-19, such as respiratory rate ≥
           20 breaths per minute, saturation of oxygen (SpO2) > 93% on room air at sea level, heart
           rate ≥ 90 beats per minute

        -  No clinical signs indicative of Severe or Critical Illness Severity

        -  Our trial duration will be 4-week duration.

        -  0.1mg / 0.5 ml COVID-19 Spike-GM-CSF Protein Lactated Ringer's Injection

        -  Intradermic Injection, ID

        -  Negative testing COVID-19 by standard RT-PCR assay or equivalent testing after injection
           2 weeks.
