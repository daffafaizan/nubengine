      flows. To do this, 6 electrodes are applied to the thorax and a low intensity and high
      frequency electrical current is transmitted. The impedance is recorded and the variations of
      the impedance represent the changes in intra-thoracic volume and thus the volume of systolic
      ejection. This measurement can be done at rest but also during exercise during the walking
      test. A test of the NO / CO coupled transfer measurement is also performed.

      The devices that will be used in this project are the Physio-FlowÂ® system and Masterscreen NO
      / CO coupled transfer measurement device
