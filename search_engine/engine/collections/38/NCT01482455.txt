      which is generally explained by lipid induced inhibition of myocellular insulin signalling,
      It remains unclear whether lipids also impair transcapillary transport of insulin and glucose
      which could thereby become rate-controlling for glucose disposal Increased accumulation and
      availability of lipids cause impaired skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. It is yet unclear
      if transcapillary transport of insulin and glucose is impaired by acute elevation of free
      fatty acids and represents a rate-limiting step during the development of short-term
      lipid-induced insulin resistance. We determined the changes of interstitial glucose and
      insulin in skeletal muscle of healthy volunteers during intravenous administration of
      triglycerides and heparin or glycerol under physiologic and supraphysiologic hyperinsulinemic
      conditions.
