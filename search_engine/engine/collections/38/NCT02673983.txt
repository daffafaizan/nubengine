      clinicians. Several motility disorders are caused by pathological changes in the
      neuromuscular network in the intestinal wall. To obtain a diagnosis a full-thickness biopsy
      is required. At present, this kind of biopsy is usually obtained by a laparoscopic surgical
      procedure, requiring full anesthesia, operating room and several days of postoperative care
      in the hospital. Today, there is lacking a more minimal invasive approach for obtaining
      full-thickness biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract. A new device has been developed
      called full-thickness resection device (FTRD), which has proved useful and safe from removing
      polyps in the gastrointestinal tract (Schmidt A Endoscopy 47;8, 719-725). The specific aims
      of this study is to determine if FTRD safe for obtaining full-thickness biopsies form the
      gastrointestinal tract and whether these FTRD biopsies be used for clinical diagnosis of
      patients with suspected intestinal motility disorders. If these aims can be achieved FTRD
      would be of potential great value for patients and health care in the management of patients
      with gastrointestinal disorders. 40 patients will be included, i.e. 10 patients will undergo
      FTRD biopsy in the sigmoid colon, distal ileum, jejunum and duodenum. Patients will undergo
      the biopsy procedure under conscious sedation at the Endoscopy Unit in Malm√∂, Region Skane
      and stay one night at the hospital to detect any complications. A venous blood sample will be
      taken before and 24 hours after the biopsy for examination of systemic inflammatory changes.
      All biopsies will examined by an expert in neuromuscular pathology.
