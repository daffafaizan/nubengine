      daily and provide trough plasma concentrations of free drug that will suppress replication of
      HIV-1, including strains containing key resistance mutations observed after failure of
      treatment with currently available NNRTIs. This study will provide an assessment of safety
      and a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of DPC 083 when administered at a dose of 100 mg
      once daily in combination with 2 NRTIs, in a population of HIV-1-infected patients who are
      failing treatment with an NNRTI-containing regimen.

      Patients receive DPC 083 once daily in combination with 2 NRTIs. The 2 NRTIs are selected by
      the investigators, based on HIV-1 genotyping results. Analyses for patient safety and drug
      efficacy are done at Weeks 8, 24, and 48 using results from clinical laboratory tests and
      physical exams. Patients continue to receive DPC 083 and NRTIs until the last patient
      enrolled in the study completes 48 weeks of treatment. Patients return for post-therapy
      follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months following early termination or study completion. Some
      patients may participate in a substudy which evaluates changes in HIV-1 levels in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
