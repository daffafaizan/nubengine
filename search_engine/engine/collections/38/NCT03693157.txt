      many years. Nowadays, FFR-guided PCI is highly recommended for the assessment of physiologic
      ischemia in intermediate coronary lesions. FFR-guided PCI has been performed in National
      Taiwan University Hospital(NTUH) for many years. Nevertheless, the method of FFR measurement
      in NTUH is different from that in literature. In this study, the investigator would like to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NTUH experience in FFR prospectively. First, the
      investigator will record any intracoronary (IC) injected adenosine-related complications,
      such as bradyarrhythmia or chest discomfort. Second, the investigator will follow up on the
      clinical outcome of the participants for 2 years, record if any target lesion failure, target
      vessel failure, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. Finally, left
      ventricular diastolic pressure, serum pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), and high
      sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP) will be checked and determined their relationships
      with the maximum dosage of IC adenosine.
