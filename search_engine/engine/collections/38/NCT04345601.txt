      frozen for later use.

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam and history

        -  SARS-CoV-2 test

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan

        -  A urine pregnancy test, when applicable

      The patient will be randomly assigned to a study group. We'll use a computer to put the
      patient into study group A (study drug) or group B (control) by chance (randomized). Patients
      randomized to the control group, will receive the standard treatment for their respiratory
      infection.

      These tests are done to assess the patient's eligibility to receive the cells. On the day
      that the patient is scheduled to receive the cells they will be pre-medicated with Benadryl
      and Tylenol. The patient will then receive a single intravenous (into the vein) infusion of 2
      x 10^6 cells/kg of MSCs. The patient will be monitored closely for two hours after the
      infusion.

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusion and afterwards. As
      part of the research study, the patient will be evaluated daily for 7 days and then weekly at
      weeks 2, 3, and 4. The evaluations that will be done at these visits include:

        -  Physical exam and history

        -  SARS-CoV-2 test

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan
