      2019 (COVID-19) were reported in 189 countries and territories worldwide. As of this time,
      there had been 367 total confirmed cases of COVID-19, including four deaths in Mexico. The
      clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 are wide, asymptomatic infection, mild
      upper respiratory tract illness, and approximately 5% of critically ill patients with
      COVID-19 have presented rapidly progressive respiratory failure, development of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. On March 24,
      2020, the Secretary of Health of Mexico, formally declared the beginning of phase 2. It has
      been estimated that many confirmed cases of COVID-19 would occur, thus would result in a
      significant increase of hospital and ICU admissions.
