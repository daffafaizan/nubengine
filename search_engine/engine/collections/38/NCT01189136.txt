      removed after surgery), they may be offered participation in this trial. Patients are
      randomized to receive active treatment or a sham treatment. A small, accupuncture-type needle
      is inserted through the skin just above the ankle. A small, battery-powered generator will be
      attached to the needle. The generator will give a low-voltabe stimulation which is adjusted
      for comfort level and applied for 30 minutes. After treatemnt, the voiding trial will be
      repeated.
