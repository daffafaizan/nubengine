      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and around two million people have died from this deadly disease
      worldwide. The pulmonary symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 vary from mild respiratory
      symptoms to severe respiratory failure. Of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, 40% will progress
      to ARDS.

      Radiologically, most of those infected by SARS COV 2 have bilateral lower lobes ground-glass
      opacities with or without consolidation. However, long term lung impairment may develop
      particularly interstitial lung disease (ILD), the fibrotic type. Besides, pulmonary fibrosis
      (PF) is recognized sequelae of ARDS, and several studies have shown that protective lung
      ventilation tends to diminish the radiographic abnormalities following ARDS.

      Colchicine has anti-fibrotic effects as a microtubule-destabilizing agent. In an in vitro
      study using human lung fibroblasts, colchicine inhibited myofibroblast differentiation via
      Rho/serum response factor (SRF) dependent. In COVID19 cases, colchicine was used by where
      they assessed its impact on the inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes.
