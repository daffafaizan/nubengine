      be randomly assigned to be corrected with Restylane and then re-treated at 4 ½ months. The
      opposite side will be treated with Restylane and not re-treated until 9 months. Both
      nasolabial folds will be re-treated at 18 months. Each subject will serve as their own
      control, allowing comparison of the outcome between the contralateral sides.

      This is a multi-center U.S. trial with a planned enrollment of 75 subjects at three centers.
      The goal of the study is to enroll and complete follow-up for 60 evaluable subjects. In order
      to compensate for early discontinuations, a total of at least 75 subjects will be recruited
      and treated.

      After giving written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo a screening
      evaluation and initial treatment (Visit 1). The two nasolabial folds will be randomized for
      treatment so that one side will be designated for re-treatment with Restylane at 4 ½ months;
      the other at 9 months. At month 18 (Visit 7) both nasolabial folds will be re-treated.
      Follow-up visits will be scheduled through 36 months after initial treatment or touch-up.
