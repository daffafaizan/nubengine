      The supplement contains selected strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria which have been
      well studied in human clinical trials. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated
      improvements in cognitive function and mood after supplementation with various combinations
      of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

      The specific strains present in the current investigation have been studied in a number of
      clinical trials in which no adverse events were linked to the strains. The benefits of
      probiotic supplements on health is well established, and has led to an increase in use, as
      well as the addition of probiotic strains in dietary supplements. Despite this, only a small
      number of controlled trials have directly investigated the cognitive benefits associated with
      probiotic supplementation.

      The current study therefore aims to investigate the anti-fatigue effects of a probiotic
      supplement after a period of cognitive demand. We will be measuring the effects of the
      probiotic supplement compared to a placebo using assessments of mental fatigue, cognition,
      memory and mood.
