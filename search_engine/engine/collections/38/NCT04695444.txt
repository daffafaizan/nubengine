      cavity to the oral cavity through the posterior wall of the pharynx more smoothly than
      conventional PVC tube, thus reducing blockade of tube advancement, nasal/pharyngeal mucosal
      bleeding, and intubation time. In addition, investigators would like to compare the technique
      of nasal intubation using by connecting rubber suction catheter to PVC tube tip.
