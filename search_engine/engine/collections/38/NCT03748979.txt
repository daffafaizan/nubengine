      participants and participants with narcolepsy. This study will look at the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of TAK-925.

      This study will consist of three parts. Part A will be a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multiple rising dose (MRD) study in healthy participants. Part B is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MRD study in participants with narcolepsy. Part
      C is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multiple repeat dose
      study in participants with narcolepsy. Part A' is a single dose study in healthy
      participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 96 participants planned as total. All participants except
      Part A' will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

      Part A:

        -  TAK-925 (Dose Levels A1-A6)

        -  Placebo

      Part B:

        -  TAK-925 (Dose Levels B1-B4)

        -  Placebo

      Part C:

        -  TAK-925 (Dose Levels C1-C2)

        -  Placebo

      Part A':

      â€¢ TAK-925 (Dose Levels A'1-A'2)

      All participants will be asked to take TAK-925 or Placebo at the same time each day from Day
      1 to Day 7 in Parts A, B and C, and take TAK-925 on Day 1 in Part A'.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall study period is approximately
      15 days in Parts A, B and C, and approximately 7 days for Part A'. Participants will be
      partly admitted to a hospital during the study.
