      to compare two groups of patients admitted with febrile pulmonary embolism . In the first
      group of patients, the use of antibiotics will be guided by clinical (clinical group). In the
      second group, the use of antibiotics will be guided by the algorithm (PCT group). The guided
      by the PCT algorithm is only given aid the clinician in the therapeutic management without
      its application only requires the doctor in charge of the patient. So if your doctor may
      advocate (or deemed necessary) to continue (or start) antibiotics even if the PCT algorithm
      would allow him to stop (or not initiate).
