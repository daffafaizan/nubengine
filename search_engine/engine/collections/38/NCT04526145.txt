      nutrition, altered sleep, sedentary behavior, psychosocial stress, and emotional
      dysregulation, thereby reducing negative impacts on the brain, since all these factors
      contribute to neural inflammation and increased BP. Health-promoting self-care behaviors have
      the known short-term effect of enhanced cognitive function (processing speed, attention, and
      executive function) through the use of The Repeatable Neuropsychiatric Battery (RBANS) which
      is also an innovative component of OUR Project. Thirty middle-aged Black women (45-65 years
      old) with a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension will be enrolled. The development of this
      group-delivered intervention will be an iterative process, and the research team will use
      this pilot data to submit an R21 for a 12-week intervention through the National Institutes
      on Aging.
