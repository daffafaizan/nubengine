    
      This two cohort (Cohort A and B) single-center, randomized, controlled study is being
      conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BBI-2000 for the prevention (Cohort A) and
      treatment (Cohort B) of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions.

      Subjects in Cohort A will initially receive either pre-treatment with BBI-2000 or vehicle, on
      an area on the back. Diphencyprone (DPCP) will then be administered, via Finn chamber, to the
      same area on the back. The treated area will then be assessed to determine if BBI-2000 was
      effective in preventing a contact hypersensitivity reaction.

      Cohort B will first be sensitized with DPCP as in Cohort A. Indicated regions of the back
      will then be challenged to illicit a DTH reaction. Following the challenge, indicated regions
      on the subject's back will be treated with either (A) BBI-2000, (B) vehicle, (C) no topical
      application or (D) clobetasol propionate. The efficacy of BBI-2000 will be evaluated by
      monitoring response of the area of contact hypersensitivity reaction.
