      strength, balance and gait. These problems contribute to prolonged physical disability,
      return to work or deterioration of work capacity and thus lead to a negative impact on
      quality of life.

      In addition to studies showing that quality of life and functions may be affected adversely
      after burn, there are studies showing that burn percentage, health-related quality of life
      and functional outcomes are affected. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of
      burn area (with or without joint), percentage of burns and hypertrophic scar on the patient's
      function in patients with lower extremity burns.
