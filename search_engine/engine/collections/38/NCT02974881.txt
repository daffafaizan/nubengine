    
      This is an exploratory clinical study designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and
      performance of the Highlife TMVR System in a population of patients with severe symptomatic
      mitral regurgitation, who are not suitable for surgical or approved percutaneous treatments
      according to the judgement of the Heart Team. The data gathered in this study will allow to
      evaluate the feasibility of mitral replacement using the HighLife™ TMVR system and
      characterize the safety and performance profile of the HighLife™ TMVR System.

      All patients will be followed periodically up to 12 months after the intervention and long
      term safety and performance will be collected annually up to 5 years.
