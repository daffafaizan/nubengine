    
      LCM is an investigational drug that is being studied as a treatment in male and female
      patients who are diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee and require therapeutic doses of
      NSAIDs, COX-2 NSAIDs and/or paracetamol. This trial will be conducted exclusively in Europe.

      The study has an adaptive 3-stage group sequential design.

      The trial will last a total of 17 weeks. There will be a 2 week period to wean off current
      medication, followed by a 4 week period where the patient will receive placebo (inactive
      drug) or gradually increasing doses of LCM up to the target dose of 400mg/day. The target
      dose or placebo will be maintained for 8 weeks followed by a 1 week reduction period then a 2
      week safety follow up period.

      The last subject is expected to be enrolled in December 2007.

      The study was terminated based on the outcome of the planned first interim analysis, which
      was performed as defined in the protocol in a subset of patients. It was decided not to
      continue the trial. No safety concerns were identified.
