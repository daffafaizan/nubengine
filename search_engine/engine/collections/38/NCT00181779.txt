      role in the management of pediatric bipolar disorder. Aripiprazole is a novel neuroleptic
      recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and it has a unique
      pharmacological profile believed to be fundamentally different from other available
      antipsychotics. Many previous studies have reported increased efficacy of Aripiprazole
      compared to placebo. Unfortunately, Aripiprazole has not been investigated in children and
      adolescents, and as such, safety and efficacy has not been established for these populations.

      This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether Aripiprazole is efficacious
      and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar spectrum
      disorder. The study results, gathered from an 8 week open-label treatment period and
      subsequent 10 month extension period, will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.
