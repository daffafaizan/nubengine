      In phase I of the study, we intend to assess the response of individuals to a variety of
      different mechanical perturbations generated by a robotic system for treadmill-based gait
      training (Lokomat by Hocoma AG). Such response is quantified as a displacement from the
      baseline (i.e. gait cycles with no mechanical perturbation) trajectory of motion of the foot
      during the swing phase of the gait cycle. This portion of the study is expected to allow us
      to identify mechanical perturbations that are suitable to study motor adaptation.

      In phase II of the study, we plan to carry out experiments using the above-mentioned robotic
      system to assess the magnitude of the motor adaptation to the mechanical perturbations
      identified in phase I as suitable for the study. The magnitude of the motor adaptation is
      quantified as the percentage of the deviation from the baseline trajectory of motion of the
      foot that subjects compensate for when exposed to the perturbation during multiple
      consecutive gait cycles.

      It is worth noticing that the robotic system utilized to generate the mechanical
      perturbations (i.e. Lokomat by Hocoma AG) is not programmed by the company to generate the
      mechanical perturbations evaluated in this project. Our research group wrote the programs to
      generate such perturbations. It is also worth emphasizing that the 510K FDA clearance does
      not cover the modifications implemented by our research group.
