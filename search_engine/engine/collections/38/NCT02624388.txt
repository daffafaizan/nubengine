    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones on the short term untoward effects of myelosuppressive
      chemotherapy used to treat pediatric cancers. Newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 1-21 years
      will be registered to the study and informed consent will be obtained prior to any
      study-related procedures. Stratification will be based on length of chemotherapy cycles,
      between 14 day and 21 day cycles. Within strata registered subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      one of two schedules:

      Arm A: Subjects will receive genistein daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and
      placebo during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

      Arm B: Subjects will receive placebo daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and
      genistein during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

      Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy during each cycle with clinical labs,
      cytokine panels, and physical exams. Drug compliance will be monitored by use of a patient
      diary as well as monitoring of serum genistein levels. Adverse events will be monitored
      starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 through 30 days following the last day of protocol therapy
      (genistein/placebo).
