    
      This is a pilot, open-label study of PEG-BCT-100 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      leukemia or lymphoma who have satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled or when 10 evaluable subjects are included in the
      study. Evaluable subjects are defined as subjects who have received 4 consecutive doses of
      PEG-BCT-100 1600U/kg within 6 weeks from the first 1600U/kg dose and completed the first
      disease response assessment.

      After the initiation of trial treatment, safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the
      study. Adverse event (AE) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTC AE v4). AE and serious AE (SAE)
      will be detected and recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) until 15-28 days after the last
      dose of PEG-BCT-100.

      Patients who achieve complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete blood count
      recovery (CRi) following the 4 consecutive 1600U/kg doses may continue PEG-BCT-100 at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) following the 4
      consecutive 1600U/kg doses can continue treatment up to disease progression. Further
      continuation will be determined by the clinical judgment of the Investigator. Patients who
      have disease progression will be discontinued PEG-BCT-100.

      Blood samples for PK and PD analysis will be collected and analyzed.
