      etiology that occurs mostly in southern China. Intestinal flora imbalance is believed to be
      associated with a variety of organ malignancies. Currently, the relationship between
      intestinal flora and NPC is not clear, although many studies have shown that intestinal flora
      can be used as a biomarker for many cancers and to predict cancer.

      To compare the differences in intestinal flora compositions and biological functions among
      patients with familial NPC (NPC_F), patients with sporadic NPC (NPC_S) and healthy controls
      (NOR), we compared the intestinal flora DNA sequencing and hematological testing results
      between every two groups using bioinformatic methods.
