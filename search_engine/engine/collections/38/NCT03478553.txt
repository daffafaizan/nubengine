      pulmonary fibrosis. The investigators aim is to identify and explore genetic loci that affect
      development of pulmonary fibrosis and also explore related environmental exposures.
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the interstitial lung diseases under the
      broader umbrella of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP). The investigators hypothesize
      that inherited genetic factors are associated with pulmonary fibrosis. To investigate the
      genetics of pulmonary fibrosis, the investigators plan to enroll individuals with pulmonary
      fibrosis and their family members.
