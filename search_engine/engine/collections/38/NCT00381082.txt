      applied twice separated by a one week interval. MOOV Head Lice Treatment was applied on Day
      0, Day 7 and Day 14. The cure rate (absence of live lice) one day after the first
      administration for all products was a secondary outcome measure. The cure rate at 7 days
      after the final administration (Day 14 for Banlice or KP24 and at Day 21 for MOOV Head Lice
      Treatment) was the primary outcome measure. Siblings were treated if these were found to be
      infected as an enrolment criteria.
