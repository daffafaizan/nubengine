      evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to multidisciplinary medical and
      lifestyle management of diabetes and body weight. The original trials were each designed to
      assess feasibility over a relatively short duration of follow-up (1-3 years). Individually,
      each trial lacked the sample size and duration of follow-up to meaningfully inform clinical
      decision making. Together, with the funding provided by the NIH for longer follow-up, the
      Consortium trial can provide a unique national resource to address timely and unanswered
      clinical questions related to the durability of these alternative management approaches in
      patients with T2D and obesity. Together, participants from these studies represent the
      largest cohort with diabetes (one third having a BMI <35 kg/m2) ever to undergo randomized
      assignment to bariatric surgical procedure vs. medical/lifestyle intervention.
