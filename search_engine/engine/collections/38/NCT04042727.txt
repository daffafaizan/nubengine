    
      Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used sedative/anxiolytic agent in the ICU with sympatholytic
      properties that can cause a decrease in heart rate. Eligible patients will be randomized into
      one of two groups: SOC plus Dex arm or SOC plus placebo (normal saline) arm. Study drug
      infusion will be administered at an infusion rate of 1Î¼g/kg/hr via IV, and will not include a
      loading dose. Four 6-second telemetry rhythm strips will be collected per hour, starting one
      hour prior to study drug infusion, during the eight hour infusion period, and two hours post
      infusion cessation). Degree of heart rate control and time to heart rate control for both
      groups will be analyzed.
