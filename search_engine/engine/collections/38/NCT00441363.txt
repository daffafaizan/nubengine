      mg/day), administered either as monotherapy or combined with sulfonylurea therapy,
      significantly reduced HbA1c, fasting and post-prandial glucose and fasting and post-prandial
      triglycerides in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical studies that
      combined Cycloset® with metformin were not as part of the original Cycloset® clinical program
      because metformin was not commercially available in the United States at the time that the
      studies were initiated. The present study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety
      of Cycloset® compared to placebo when added to metformin monotherapy in persons with type 2
      diabetes mellitus who are not adequately controlled on metformin therapy alone.

      A sufficient number of individuals will be screened to enroll up to 326
      subjects;approximately 276 subjects are expected to complete treatment through study
      termination (Week 26). The study population will consist of individuals currently treated
      with metformin, for at least 3 months prior to the study start. Subjects who have ever
      received exogenous insulin therapy as part of an outpatient diabetes treatment regimen are to
      be excluded, as are those taking oral anti-diabetic agents other than metformin within 3
      months of screening (e.g., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones,alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, or
      meglitinides). Subjects may be male or female(surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or using
      appropriate contraceptive methods if of childbearing potential), age 18 to 75 years,
      inclusive, and are to have a screening HbA1c value of ≥ 7.5% and <11.0% and a screening body
      mass index (BMI) in the range of 25 kg/m2 to 42 kg/m2, inclusive.
