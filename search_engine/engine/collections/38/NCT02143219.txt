    
      METHODOLOGY :

      Phase II study, opened, multicentric

      MAIN OBJECTIVE :

      The main objective is the simultaneous evaluation of the objective rate of answer and
      toxicity of her(it) of the protocol FOLFIRINOX administered to doses adapted at patients of
      70 and more years old.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE :

        -  Efficiency evaluation;

        -  Tolerance evaluation;

        -  Quality of Life (QoL) and clinical profit.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

      An analysis in two stages is planned, according to the method of Bryant and Day with a risk ÃŸ
      5 % to reject wrongly an effective treatment and of acceptable toxicity and a risk a=10 % to
      accept wrongly a not rather effective or too toxic treatment.

      The study will be considered as successful if:

        -  we obtain at least 11 tumoral answers and

        -  maxi 30 patients on 72 are in loss of autonomy (decrease of their ADL).

             -  All the patients who will have received at least an injection will be eligible for
                the evaluation of the toxicity

             -  The evaluation of the efficiency will be made after 3 cures at least unless early
                termination where the scanner will be anticipated.

             -  All the toxicity will be increased according to criteria of toxicity NCI-CTC v4.0.

             -  The evaluation of the tumoral answer (CR, PR and SD) will be made according to the
                criteria RECIST-v1.1.
