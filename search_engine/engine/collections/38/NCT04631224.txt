      Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies) in which the French center ICM participates
      since 2011 (principal investigator Pr Alexandra Durr). The clinical registry EFACTS has
      included 604 FA patients to date who are followed annually with the goal of collecting
      clinical and biological information via a database. In Paris, 50 FA patients are followed and
      receive a complete evaluation at each visit: clinical evaluations, blood test, cardiac
      evaluation, and neuropsychological evaluation. In addition, ORFA will be closely linked with
      the CERMOI project, entitled "Integrated functional evaluation of the cerebellum" which will
      study visual motor disturbances in FA. This project received funding in 2014 through the
      IHU-A-ICM, Institute of translational and neuroscientific research which includes 4 research
      teams at the ICM. CERMOI will combine clinical examination, recording of ocular movements,
      vestibular testing, gait and posture tests.

      ORFA will enable to assess the difficulties in articulation and hearing in FA patients and
      correlate this data with clinical and biological data collected in EFACTS. 50 francophone FA
      patients will be followed for 2 visits with a one-year interval in between.
