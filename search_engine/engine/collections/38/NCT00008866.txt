      the need for new classes of agents. Hydroxyurea, an agent broadly used for its antineoplastic
      properties, has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 in vitro and in vivo when combined with the
      nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor didanosine (ddI). There is an urgent need
      to prospectively test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of hydroxyurea in late-stage,
      treatment-experienced patients.

      Patients undergo genotypic analysis after registration to Step 1. Genotypic antiretroviral
      resistance test (GART) along with a patient's antiretroviral drug history will be used to
      select an optimal antiretroviral drug regimen (non-study drugs) for each patient. Patients
      willing to initiate the GART-based regimen are randomized at Week 5 into Step 2. They are
      stratified, first by level of ddI resistance, then within each strata by CD4+ T cell count,
      and then assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms to start all study drugs (ddI and hydroxyurea) and
      non-study antiretroviral drugs on the day of randomization. Patients in Arm A receive ddI and
      hydroxyurea placebo; Arm B, ddI and hydroxyurea placebo that is replaced by hydroxyurea after
      8 weeks; and Arm C, ddI and hydroxyurea. Patients receive treatment for 48 weeks. Patients
      are checked regularly for immunologic, virologic, and metabolic parameters. Patients may
      elect to participate in substudy A5070s, which explores the effects of study treatment on T
      cell populations and other immunologic evaluations.
