      either 3 months of aerobic ergometer training or a sedentary control group.

      Before and after the intervention period maximal exercise capacity is assessed by
      ergospirometry, endothelial function is determined by high-resolution A-mode ultrasound, and
      muscle mass is determined by CT. Skeletal muscle biopsies are obtained at begin and after 3
      months and are analyzed for markers of muscle catabolism/anabolism.
