      worldwide, oral squamous cell carcinoma represent more than 90% of all oral malignances.

      Standard treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma is surgical resection with free margin.
      Negative margin status is an important for control local recurrence and improve outcome in
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Frozen section
      biopsy is useful tool for intraoperative assessment of resected margins and control of local
      recurrence, allowing for additional resection intraoperatively in case of positive margins.
      However in the least developed countries with limited resource, the frozen section is not
      available in a majority of centers, in addition to that if present in developed countries, it
      somewhat considered time and cost consumer.

      Toluidine blue(TB) is metachromatic stain, easily available, economical, with high affinity
      for DNA and RNA. It is rapidly uptaken by malignant epithelium which contain quantitatively
      more nucleic acid than normal tissue. It has been widely used as screening tool for malignant
      and premalignant lesion.

      The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of toluidine blue in the assessment of
      intraoperative tumor margin after excision of oral squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC)in comparison
      to H&E stain on frozen section.
