      for pregnant parents and assistance of the partnering health and human service agencies with
      referrals to desired services, while 75 experimental group families will receive the same
      services and aid, plus a 6-session prenatal intervention with a post-natal booster session.
      The intervention addresses the importance of safe, healthy families for early infant
      development, the impact a cooperative and sustained coparenting alliance can have in
      promoting positive infant development, challenges unmarried parents face cultivating a
      coparenting alliance together when their commitment to one another as romantic or married
      partners is in doubt, and ways to surmount these obstacles, maintain rapport, and sustain a
      strong alliance. All 150 participating families, both at intake (prior to the intervention)
      and then again at 3 and 12 months post-partum, will report beliefs about fatherhood; extent
      of depressive symptomatology; and quality of the mother-father partnership.
      State-of-the-field coparenting observations will be conducted at each follow-up, along with
      measures of parental stress, domestic violence, perceived coparenting support, father
      engagement, and infant socioemotional adjustment. Analyses will examine impact of the
      intervention on promoting more supportive, coordinated post-partum coparenting alliances and
      more positive adult and infant outcomes. Exploratory analyses will examine questions relevant
      to father associations with child adjustment and whether this coparent intervention can
      reduce domestic violence.
