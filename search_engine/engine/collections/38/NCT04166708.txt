      elements of Spanish culture. It is both physically and mentally demanding, with the emphasis
      on footwork technical execution and the aesthetic of arms and trunk movements. Years of
      training are necessary to achieve any level of proficiency as professional flamenco dancer.

      Therefore proper execution of the movements minimize the risk of injury accompanying foot -
      ground contact which was reported by several studies. The most suffering parts of the
      dancer's body are the cervical and lumbar spine, knee and foot.

      Despite the growing number of studies on flamenco dancing, there is a lack of investigations
      focused on understanding how does the flamenco dancer's body work to mitigate an injury risk.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the parameters related to this issue:
      vertical Ground Reaction Force, Centre of Mass displacements and knee joint kinematics of the
      supporting leg They will be registered and analyzed during footwork performance.

      A female professional flamenco dancer will perform a footork test called ZAP-3. It is a
      sequence of single strikes of the feet performed continuously for 15 seconds as fast as
      possible. 3D lower extremity kinematic data is used to collected using a five-camera motion
      analysis system (Vicon; Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Kistler force platform will use to
      record the Ground reaction forces .
