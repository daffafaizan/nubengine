    
      The objectives are to assess the long-term risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy
      (mHT) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, cerebrovascular, cognitive, and mood
      health in women treated with transdermal 17Î²-estradiol (tE2) or oCEE compared to placebo
      within three years of menopause, which is considered to be the "critical window" for mHT.

      The Primary Objective is to determine the differences in Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers ,
      cerebrovascular lesion load and brain structure in postmenopausal women who were treated with
      one of two mHTs vs. placebo after 13 years post-randomization and 9 years after the end of
      mHT administration phase.

      This project is proposed as a continuation to the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
      (KEEPS), a nationwide, multi-center, randomized blinded study of mHT in recently menopausal
      women.

      The current investigation will include assessments conducted within a six-week interval over
      2- 3 visits, Participants will be on study for up to 3 months while completing medical
      assessment, questionnaires, blood work, neurocognitive studies, ECG, brain MRI, brain PET.
