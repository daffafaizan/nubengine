      stenosis, there is some disagreement regarding its efficacy in treating patients with central
      and lateral recess stenosis. The current study seeks to randomize patients indicated for
      Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion (LLIF) into one of two groups: direct decompression and
      indirect decompression. Enrolled participants will be evaluated before surgery, during their
      hospital course and post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. Operative
      details, complications, reoperation rates, patient reported outcomes, clinical and
      radiographic outcome measures will be compared.
