      proteins which are capable of assembly into particles. The presence of gag gene products in
      addition to envelope glycoprotein should assist in humoral and cellular immunologic responses
      to internal HIV-1 viral proteins. The pseudovirion vaccine has been tested in preclinical
      trials in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates with good safety and
      immunogenicity profile.

      A total of 78 volunteers will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive pseudovirion
      vaccine and/or the placebo/adjuvant. All volunteers will receive injections intramuscularly
      at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Group I (30 volunteers): pseudovirion vaccine w/adjuvant or w/o adjuvant. Group II (30
      volunteers): pseudovirion vaccine w/adjuvant or w/o adjuvant. Group III (18 volunteers):
      adjuvant (QS21 or alum) or saline placebo. NOTE: Group I will receive appropriate adjuvant or
      saline placebo at Month 3 without pseudovirion vaccine.
