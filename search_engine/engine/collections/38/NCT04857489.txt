    
      The study will enroll 40 RRMS patients (age 18-55, expanded disability status scale (EDSS)
      0-6), and 40 age-, sex- and race-matched Healthy Controls (HCs). The study subjects will be
      enrolled at the Thomas Jefferson University MS clinic, which serves as a tertiary referral
      center.

      The inclusion criteria are confirmed diagnosis of RRMS according to McDonald's diagnostic
      criteria12, age 18-55 inclusive, extended disability status score (EDSS) 1.5-5.5, and no
      immunomodulatory therapy at the time of the study. Treatment-free period will be at least 4
      weeks for IV Methylprednisolone, Interferon-beta, Glatiramer acetate, Fingolimod, Tecfidera
      and Natalizumab. Patients previously treated with immunosuppressive therapies, including
      Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Mitoxantrone and Cyclophosphamide will not be enrolled in the
      study. Exclusion criteria will include concomitant infection, significant medical and
      psychiatric condition at the discretion of principal investigator. Pregnant women, and
      patients participating in other research trials will not be enrolled in this study. 40
      healthy controls matched for age, sex and race with the group of RR MS patients will be
      enrolled in the study as a control group.

      Aim 1. A. Identify the phenotype changes in CD4+CD25+CD127- nTregs in RRMS patients.

      Transcriptional profiling of sorted CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs will be performed using RNAseq in
      the first cohort of 10 HCs and 10 RRMS patients. CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg cells will be sorted
      from magnetic beads separated CD4+ cells. cDNA will be generated using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra
      Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing. The detection of differentially expressed genes between
      RRMS patients and HC-derived Treg cells will permit the functional characterization of Treg
      cells in RRMS. The RNA seq experiments and data analysis will be performed by Dr. Paolo
      Fortina and Dr. Adam Ertel at TJU Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. The differential gene
      expression in RRMS Tregs identified by RNAseq will be confirmed via RT-PCR and western
      blotting.

      Flow cytometry studies using the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from the
      second cohort of HCs and RRMS patients (10 donors in each group) will be used to determine
      changes in the expression of the Treg protein markers in RRMS patients. Individual Treg
      markers confer specific mechanisms of suppression. For the comprehensive Treg phenotypic
      profiling, we will determine the percentage of CTLA-4, CD39, GZB, perforin, GITR, OX40,
      HLADR, TNFR2, Tim-3, programmed death receptor (PD-1), and LAG3-positive cells within the
      CD4+CD25+CD127--gated Tregs. FOXP3, GZB and perforin expression will be determined using
      intracellular staining, as well as Tregs' TGF-B, IL-10 and IL-35 cytokine secretion, which
      may contribute to their suppressive function (2x106 PBMCs per 14 color staining).

      Aim 1.B. Characterize the functional deficit of nTregs in RRMS. Functional suppression assays
      will compare Treg suppressive function in a third cohort of 10 HC and 10 RRMS patients.

      Our hypothesis is that Treg co-cultures with Teff cells from HCs will increase the
      concentration of TGF-B, IL-10 and IL-35 and decrease the concentrations of IFN-y and IL-17A
      in culture supernatants (SNs) in comparison to the suppression assays using Treg and Teff
      cells from RRMS patients. In order to examine the susceptibility of Teff cells in RRMS
      patients in comparison to HCs, the suppression assays will be performed in a cross-over
      design experiments:

        1. RMS Tregs+RRMS Teff cells

        2. HC Tregs+HC Teff cells

        3. RRMS Tregs+HC Teff cells

        4. HC Tregs+RRMS Teff cells

      Sorted 2x104 CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs per condition will be co-cultured with autologous Teff
      CFSE-stained CD4+CD25-CD127+ cells in the presence of aCD3 (0.5 ug/ml) and aCD28 (1 ug/ml)
      mAb and 105 irradiated antigen presenting cells (PBMCs - CD4+ cells) at 1:1 and 1:10 ratios.
      We will measure proliferation via CFSE dilution in the Teff cells and cytokine secretion in
      the SNs of cell cultures to determine to what extent Treg cells from RRMS patients exhibit
      decreased suppression in comparison to HCs. The IFN-y, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-10, TGF-B
      and IL-4 cytokine measurements will be performed using ELISA.

      Aim 1.C. Determine the effects of IL-7 on the nTregs' suppressive function in RRMS.

      Since our preliminary data have identified IL-7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation and FOXP3
      expression, as well as IL-7 in-vitro induced Treg proliferation, we will correlate the serum
      IL-7 levels with the Treg numbers (% of CD4+ cells x total number of cells) and their
      suppressive function, and examine the effect of pre-incubation of Tregs with this cytokine to
      their suppressive function.

      Aim 2.A. Determine the phenotype of iTreg cells in RRMS patients. Flow cytometry studies of
      the IL-10+CD4+ and TGF-B+CD4+ cells derived from RRMS patients and HCs will identify
      disease-specific phenotype of iTregs, which may reflect functional changes of iTregs in RRMS.
      We will examine the same samples from cohort of RRMS patients and HCs enrolled in Specific
      Aim 1.A. Flow cytometry studies of the gated CD4+IL-10+ and CD4+TGF-B+ cells will be
      performed using surface marker staining for CD39, CTLA-4, PD-1, ICOS, CD46, CD49b and LAG-3
      and intracellular staining for FOXP3, IL-35, GZMB, pSTAT3, the repressor of GATA-3 (ROG), the
      aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and c-Maf transcription factors.

      Aim 2.B. Identify the mechanisms of deficient nTreg induction of iTregs in RRMS.

      We will perform the suppressive assay as described in Aim 1.B using CD4+CD25+CD127-Treg and
      CD4+CD25-CD127+ Teff cells derived from the fourth cohort of 10 HCs and 10 RRMS patients.
      After 4 days of co-culture, CD25+ Treg cells will be removed using magnetic beads, and the
      remaining CD4+CD25- cells will be irradiated and replated at a 1:10 ratio with autologous
      CD4+CD25- T cells, and stimulated by plate-immobilized aCD3 and aCD28 mAb for an additional 5
      days in order to demonstrate the suppressive effect of iTregs. Cell proliferation (measured
      by 3[H] incorporation) and TGF-Î² and IL-10 secretion in the SNs will be measured to determine
      the iTreg suppressive function induced by CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs in the effector CD4+ cells.
      In the second co-culture, we will also examine to what extent the iTreg induction is mediated
      via cell-to-cell contact (blocked by a permeable membrane) or by soluble cytokines (blocked
      by aIL-10, aTGF-B or aIL-4 mAb).

      Aim 2.C. Characterize the effect of the iTreg-produced immunoregulatory cytokines on the
      reconstitution of immune tolerance.

      We will measure the IFN-y, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-9, and IL-10, TGF-B and IL-35
      levels in the SNs of the above co-cultures of iTregs and CD4+ cell derived from RRMS patients
      and HCs at 48 h. We will measure the expression of the MHC class I and II, CD80, CD86, CD40
      and CD58 in the remaining PBMC samples obtained in Specific Aim 2B in 10 HCs and 10 RRMS
      patients in CD19+-gated B cells, CD14+-gated monocytes, and CD1c-gated DCs using flow
      cytometry, as reported in our previous study 43. We will examine to what extent iTreg numbers
      and iTregs' IL-10 and TGF-B production, as well as IL-10 and TGF-B serum levels correlate
      with the inhibition of MHC and costimulatory molecules' expression in B cells, monocytes and
      DCs in HCs and RRMS patients.
