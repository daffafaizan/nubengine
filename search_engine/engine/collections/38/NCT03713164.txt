    
      Based on the limited knowledge about the difference in bacterial metabolism of a mixture of
      ellagitannins, punicalin, punicalagin and EA in PJ compared to pure EA leading to intestinal
      formation of different urolithins (urolithin A, B and iso-urolithin A), the objective of this
      study is to perform a cross over acute bioavailability study of 1-day consumption of either
      PJ or EA. Primary endpoint will be the formation and bioavailability of EA and urolithins.
      Secondary endpoints will be A) effect on the fecal microbiome and B) correlation of urolithin
      formation to the lipid/cholesterol status of the study participants.
