      between those liver transplant recipients who are positive for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      who are at high risk and those who are at low risk for graft loss secondary to early
      recurrence of HCV.

      An assessment of the recipient's donor-specific immune status can be achieved by measuring
      T-cell activity, specifically alloreactive primed (donor-specific) T cell activity. It has
      been shown that detection of IFN-y in short-term enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-spot (ELISPOT)
      assay is consistent with the presence of primed memory T cells (6). In the transplantation
      setting, T cells of an allograft recipient that secret IFN-y after short in-vitro exposure to
      donor cells represent a prior sensitization of recipient to donor antigens in vivo.
      Clinically interpreted - this priming event may signify the presence of an up-coming, or an
      on-going, rejection episode. Our limited preliminary data suggest an additional potential
      clinical value for the in-vitro assessment of donor-specific IFN-y production in predicting
      those liver transplant recipients at higher risk for recurrence of Hepatitis C.
