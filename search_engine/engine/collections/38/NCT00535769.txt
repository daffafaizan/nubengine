      improving adherence to topical agents. We will conduct a randomized, single-blinded,
      controlled trial to assess the impact of automated reminder system on adherence rates to
      sunscreens. This study will involve designing an electronic monitoring device specifically
      for topical agents and creating a platform for an automated reminder system. The electronic
      monitoring devices will be adaptable to tubes of varying shapes and sizes, and they will send
      SMS messages to a central server in real-time each time the tube is opened. We will create a
      text-message reminder system to send reminders to users' cellular phones over a secured
      network. Our hypothesis is that the electronic monitoring and reminder system will increase
      patients' adherence to topical agents. We will measure the impact of the intervention on
      adherence rates and assess patients' views on the reminder system. This project will allow us
      to engineer a novel device to electronically monitor adherence to topical agents and to use
      communication technology to change patients' behavior.
