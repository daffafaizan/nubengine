      recruited. At study entry, within 14 days of screening procedures, subjects will commence
      maraviroc dosed at 150 mg twice daily. For the rest of study period antiretroviral therapy
      will comprise:

        -  Truvada™ one tablet once daily at 0900

        -  Kaletra™ two tablets twice daily 0900 and 2100

        -  maraviroc 150 mg twice daily at 0900 and 2100

      Subjects will attend for regular clinic visits during study treatment phase.

      On day 15, subjects will attend the unit in the morning prior to usual dosing time. Blood
      with be drawn to assess plasma maraviroc concentration pre dose and pre lumbar puncture. A
      lumbar puncture will be performed under standard aseptic techniques to asses CSF maraviroc
      concentration and routine CSF parameters.

      On completion of this study visit, subjects will cease maraviroc, continue on their usual
      antiretroviral regimen and attend for a follow up visit 10 days later.
