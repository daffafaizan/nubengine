      5% to 17%, with toddlers (ages 2-5) at 10%. Among children and adolescents the consumption of
      low-energy-dense foods, such as fruit and vegetables (F&Vs), remain below current
      recommendations. Therefore, strategies to increase low-energy-dense F&V intake and decrease
      high-energy-dense food intake aimed at young children are essential. Antecedents, or cues,
      can trigger eating. Therefore, manipulating food presentation can be utilized to produce
      certain behaviors. Dietary variety and course sequence are two examples of this relationship.
      It has been well established that high dietary variety leads to greater consumption patterns
      compared to low DV diets in adults. High DV has only been tested with problematic foods, and
      not with the goal of increasing F&V intake. Additionally, serving a first course meal can act
      as a preload to decrease intake of the second course entr√©e. Dietary variety and course
      sequence manipulations have been experimentally tested with caloric intake goals but never
      with the goal of increasing F&V intake. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine
      the extent to which manipulation of dietary variety and course sequence affects fruit intake
      and overall energy intake in preschool-aged children.
