      in pre- and postmenopausal women who will undergo surgery for breast cancer. Subjects will
      either receive estetrol or placebo during a 2 week treatment period.

      Several biological markers, such as a cellular growth marker and cell death markers, will be
      assessed in the tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue before and after the treatment
      period. In addition, receptor studies will be performed. During the 2 week interval between
      diagnosis of breast cancer and surgical resection, no therapy for breast cancer is usually
      administered.
