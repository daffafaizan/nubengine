      from the first group will undergo treatment, while the second group of age matched
      individuals will serve as a control. It will be a prospective, randomized, blinded study.
      Each patient will be randomized at the beginning of enrollment in the study and will receive
      a randomization number. The following parameters will be followed: 1. Best corrected
      spectacle acuity (BCSA) 2. The steepest keratometry measurement (KMax) as measured by
      computerized corneal topography 3. Apical corneal thickness 4. Corneal mechanical resistance.
      These measurements will be repeated at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12, 18, and 24 months
      following treatment.
