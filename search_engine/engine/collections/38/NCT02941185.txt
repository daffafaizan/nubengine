      upon exposure to sun light. Although major function is on bone metabolism, in recent years
      other effects of Vitamin D attracted attention. Low neonatal vitamin D levels were reported
      to be associated with increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD) and sepsis.

      Vitamin D level in the fetus and the newborn is mostly dependent on maternal vitamin D
      levels. Most of the vitamin D is transferred to the fetus during third trimester and as a
      result preterm newborns especially those with <32 weeks gestational age are born with lower
      vitamin D stores. But there is no consensus regarding the adequate dose of vitamin D
      supplementation for preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
      supplementation of 200-400 IU/d vitamin D for preterm infants. And the European Society of
      Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends 800-1000 IU/d
      vitamin D supplementation for preterm infants.
