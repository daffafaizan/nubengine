    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of infusing gene-modified, HIV-protected
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) after high-dose chemotherapy for treatment of
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma.

      II. To observe the change in gene-modified cell levels before and after antiviral treatment
      interruption.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      II. To describe time to disease progression, progression-free survival, treatment-related
      mortality, time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, and incidence of infections.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of procedure on HIV-specific immune reconstitution.

      II. To observe the effect of HIV infection on the presence of gene-marked cells as determined
      by deoxyribonucleic (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients undergo high-dose chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy according to
      institutional guidelines.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant with LVsh5/C46
      (Cal-1) transduced autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) on day 0.

      Note: Patients continue to receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) throughout
      treatment, with a 7-day break for apheresis. Patients may be eligible for a structured
      treatment interruption of up to 12 weeks after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      with gene-modified cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 15 years post-HCT.
