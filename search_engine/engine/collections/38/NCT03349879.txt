      between 2008 and 2012, familial correlations for 25(OH)D will be estimated in different types
      of family relation pairs in 28551 subjects from 10882 families. The relative contribution of
      additive genetic and shared or individual environmental factors for variance of 25(OH)D level
      will be calculated using variance component method. Interactions between paternal and
      maternal vitamin D status for 25(OH)D level of offspring will be evaluated.
