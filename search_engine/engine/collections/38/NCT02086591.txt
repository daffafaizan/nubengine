      therapeutic approaches for relapsed and refractory Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). Given the
      incurability of indolent lymphomas, innovative strategies for treatment are needed. For
      aggressive lymphomas such as Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), novel treatments are
      particularly relevant since one third of patients have disease that will relapse or is
      refractory to standard therapy. Outcomes for this remaining group of patients are very poor.
      To address this unmet need, we have identified the antimicrobial agent doxycycline as a novel
      drug repurposed for lymphoma treatment based on results from a small molecule screen against
      Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Through preclinical work in his laboratory, my basic
      science collaborator Dr. Jiyong Zhao has found that doxycycline inhibits proliferation and
      survival in both activated B cell (ABC) type and germinal center B (GCB) type Diffuse Large B
      Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, as well as in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and follicular lymphoma
      (FL) cell lines. Based on this preliminary data, we propose an open label, single center
      phase II study of doxycycline in patients with relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). We have
      selected a dose and schedule (200 mg BID by mouth daily) based on maximum antimicrobial dose
      use, and acceptance of tolerability in several studies. The planned correlative studies
      should help to identify potential biomarkers for response to doxycycline, such as plasma
      matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and provide further insight into potential mechanisms of
      doxycyline action hypothesized from results of prior laboratory studies.
