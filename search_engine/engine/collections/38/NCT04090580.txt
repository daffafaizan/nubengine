      oxidative stress and inflammatory disease biomarkers (VCAM-1) on new onset type 2 DM
      patients. Methods: The investigators will include 36 patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosis
      with an Hba1c â‰¥ 7.5% and â‰¤ 9%, with BMI > 25 and <45 kg/m2, drug-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects
      enrolled will be randomized 1:1 to either receive a daily dosage of dapagliflozin 10 mg and
      2000 mg metformin for 12 weeks (n=18) or 2000 mg metformin (n=18). Patients who do not
      tolerate metformin at 2000mg dose will be downtitrated to 1500 mg daily. In case patients do
      not tolerate 1500 mg daily, they will be excluded. Patients who do not achieve glycaemic
      control, another antihyperglycaemic drug can be used.

      Both groups will be monitored for 7 days using either iProâ„¢ CGM system (Medtronic,
      Northridge, CA) or Dexcom G6 CGM (Dexcom Inc, San Diego, CA), or other available in Mexico.
      Basal continuous glucose monitoring will start at week 1 (first visit), and removed at day 7
      and final continuous glucose monitoring will start at week 11 and removed 7 days after (final
      visit).

      The main variables of interest are going to be in order of importance the delta of change
      (before and after study entry) of: 1.- glycaemic variability, 2.- change in Hba1c. 3.- change
      in oxidative stress status, 4. change in VCAM-1, 5.- change in weight, 6.- Blood pressure and
      7.- waist circumference; before and after SGLT2i. The expected results are: compared to
      standard treatment, dapagliflozin arm will have lower glycaemic variability, higher reduction
      in Hba1c, lower oxidative stress, lower inflammsatory biomarker levels, and lower blood
      pressure
