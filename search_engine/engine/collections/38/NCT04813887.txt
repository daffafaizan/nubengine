      between 23% (acne) and 75% (pigmentary changes) of pregnancies in France. Some dermatological
      changes require medical advice to identify a possible pathological rash.

      These pathological rashes can be dangerous for the mother or the fetus. It is therefore
      essential to recognize them for a quick specialized treatment. They include: intrahepatic
      cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic eruption during pregnancy,
      atopic eczema, generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancy.

      In view of the demography of dermatologists in the Vendee, 18 dermatologists in 2020 in all
      establishments (hospitals, clinics, practices), the general practitioner is at the center of
      these considerations.

      The aim of this study is to assess the situation of skin disease during pregnancy and to
      evaluate the care pathway in a healthcare sector (Vendee) for these pregnant women?
