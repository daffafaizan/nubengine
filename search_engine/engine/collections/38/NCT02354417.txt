    
      A maximum of 18 eligible male and female subjects (1 to 18 years old, inclusive) will be
      enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 3 to 5 centers within the U.S. These 18
      subjects will consist of 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each. The cohorts will be defined by age: 1
      to 4 years; > 4 to 12 years; and > 12 to 18 years. These cohorts will be enrolled
      simultaneously.

      All subjects will be admitted to the hospital, per institutional practice, and will receive a
      myeloablative conditioning regimen, after which they will receive an HLA-matched or partially
      matched ProHema-CB unit on study Day 0.
