      because lumen and stent dimensions can be accurately determined by intravascular ultrasound
      (IVUS). However, randomized studies investigating this strategy have yielded inconsistent
      results. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the potential advantages of IVUS
      guidance would be most apparent in Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) intervention and try to
      evaluate the impact of IVUS-guided chronic total occlusion intervention with drug-eluting
      stents on mid-term angiographic, IVUS and clinical outcomes.
