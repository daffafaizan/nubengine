      hours after the administration of a 2 mg dose of lorazepam or placebo in cognitively normal,
      50-65 year old APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers, and determine the differential impact of
      lorazepam on cognition at each time point. Twenty carriers and 20 noncarriers matched for
      age, sex, and education will be drawn from a database of persons who have already undergone
      genotyping for an ongoing study at the Mayo Clinic, excluding people with evidence of
      depression or cognitive impairment and other medical, neurological or psychiatric conditions.
      Using a double blind, crossover design, subjects will receive either placebo or a 2 mg dose
      of lorazepam after baseline testing. Equivalent tests will be repeated 2.5 and 5 hours post
      challenge. The data analysis will compare APOE e4 carriers to noncarriers.
