      brain injury in children with various stages of nerve and motor development in a large sample
      of studies. The study of neonatal brain injury is only limited to intraventricular
      hemorrhage(IVH),periventricular leukomalacia(PVL), Down's syndrome(DS), premature birth of
      these four conditions, and the number of samples in the single digits, there is no
      representative of the disease population. Therefore, from the newborn to the infant
      development of the critical period, the investigators will refer to the previous treadmill
      parameters set on the research results, optimize the application of neonatal treadmill. The
      study hypothesized that neonatal treadmill stimulation with brain-injured children could
      improve his / her staggered gait characteristics and long-term nerve development through
      large sample data. It is important to preserve and analyze the gait characteristics and the
      changes of nerve development in every stage of growth and development of neonates with brain
      injury so as to provide clinical evidence for rehabilitation intervention. It is of great
      significance to judge whether this technique can be used in the early stage of brain injury
      in neonates.
