    
      This is a single-centre, randomized, controlled, parallel group, assessor-blinded trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Personalized Mobile Phone Video Recording in addition to
      standard care, compared to standard care alone, in improving inhaler technique among patients
      with asthma.

      Patients are randomised to either Personalized Video Recording with standard clinical
      practice group (intervention) or to standard clinical practice group (control) in 1:1 ratio.

      Subject's inhaler technique assessment is performed by using a standard checklist of steps
      according to the type of inhaler used by subject.

      All inhaler technique assessment and asthma control questionnaire will be administered before
      the intervention/control treatment by a blinded assessor. Both intervention and control
      treatment will be administered by the same investigators.
