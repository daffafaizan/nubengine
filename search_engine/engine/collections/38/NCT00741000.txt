      These injuries can result from poor posture, sports or occupation and can lead to
      degenerative changes. Cervical range of motion (ROM) is also affected by these injuries. When
      active ROM is restricted, the injury is of muscular origin. Pain with passive ROM indicates
      ligamentous injury whereas restricted passive ROM indicates blockage within bone or soft
      tissue. The normal range of motion in the cervical spine is 80-90 degrees flexion, 70 degrees
      extension, 20-45 degrees lateral flexion and 90 degrees of rotation. A common mechanism of
      cervical spine injury is axial loading. Axial loading can create a buckling effect within the
      cervical spine and decrease its ability to move normally, creating a limited ROM.
