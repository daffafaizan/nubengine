      ECG, blood pressure machine with automated AF detection algorithms). Subjects screening
      positive on any test will attend for a 12-lead ECG within 24 h. For all patients with AF
      detected, clinical characteristics and medications will be compared at baseline and 90Â±14
      days later.
