      there is no spread of pollen. Some old studies indicate that rust fungi on other plants may
      act as allergens to humans (1-6). In Norway, some patients report typical symptoms of
      allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and asthma from August to October which stops when temperature
      falls below zero (Celsius). Based on several patient experiences we hypothesize that MB may
      cause seasonal airway allergy during autumn. In this pilot study we will compare 30 patients
      with suspected allergy to MB with a control group of 15 non-allergic individuals. All 45
      participants will answer the MeDALL (mechanisms of the development of allergy) questionnaire
      (7) about allergic diseases and daily register allergic symptoms (8) in the period from 1st
      of August to 15th of October 2020. Daily variations in symptoms will be compared with daily
      variations in spread of MB spores registered in pollen traps. Sensitization to MB will be
      tested with skin prick test and specific IgE in serum and allergy to MB with nasal
      provocation test and basophil activation test (BAT).

      Identification of allergens and production of MB extracts for testing will be performed by
      Luxembourg institute of Health (LiH)(9-12) and BAT by Oslo University hospital (13-14)
