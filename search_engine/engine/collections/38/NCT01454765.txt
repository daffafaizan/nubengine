      and therefore limits genetic research approaches in biomedical models. To overcome this
      problem experimental generation of haploid stem cells has been done in animal models. haploid
      cells are easier for genetic manipulations, such as knock-in and knock-out of genes, and
      therefore should make a better experimental model. The investigators aim at generating
      haploid stem cells from human haploid germ cells.
