      Primary: To determine whether administering adjuvant chemotherapy (four cycles of
      platinum-based doublet regimen) plus PORT (50 Gy, 2 Gy once daily over 5 weeks) will improve
      3-year DFS compared with adjuvant chemotherapy alone in patients with completely resected
      stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.

      Secondary: To compare treatment-related toxic effects, 3-year OS, failure-free survival, and
      the patterns of failure.

      OUTLINE: Eligible patients were randomized equally, using simple randomization, to either
      PORT or observation group.

      Arm I: Patients undergo PORT using 3D-CRT or IMRT (50 Gy, 2 Gy once daily over 5 weeks) after
      adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Arm II: Patients undergo adjuvant chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
