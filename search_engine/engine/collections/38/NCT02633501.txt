        -  The subset 1 included the first randomized subject of each study center. Subjects were
           randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 0.05 or 0.1 mmol/kg BW of P03277 and 0.1
           mmol/kg BW of gadobenate dimeglumine.

        -  Subset 2 was composed of all subjects (except the first one of each study center)
           selected by the study center. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to
           receive 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 mmol/kg BW of P03277 and 0.1 mmol/kg BW of gadobenate
           dimeglumine.

      During the course of the study, two MRIs were obtained from each subject: one unenhanced and
      P03277-enhanced MRI; and one unenhanced and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI. MRI images
      were evaluated off-site by 3 independent blinded readers for the primary endpoint (CNR).
