      barrier where it limits entry of substrate drugs into the central nervous system. Raltegravir
      (MK-0158), a new HIV-1 integrase inhibitor and potentially major addition to the therapeutic
      armamentarium against HIV, is a substrate for P-gp. Studies are warranted to elucidate the
      relevance of P-gp transport for raltegravir in the central nervous system.
