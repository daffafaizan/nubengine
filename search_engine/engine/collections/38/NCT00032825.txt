      androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC). We have demonstrated synergy in prostate cancer
      in an in vitro model. This is an open label phase I study of high-dose ketoconazole plus
      weekly docetaxel in patients with metastatic AIPC. The primary objective of this study will
      be to determine the side effect profile of ketoconazole when combined with weekly docetaxel
      therapy and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended phase II dose
      (RPIID) of docetaxel when combined with high dose ketoconazole. Since ketoconazole may alter
      the metabolism of docetaxel, this study will evaluate potential drug interactions and adverse
      events between these two agents. Ketoconazole dose will be 600mg per day (given 200 mg, three
      times a day), plus 30mg of hydrocortisone (20mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening), plus
      docetaxel 10-43 mg/m(2) in a dose escalation, repeated in 28-day cycles, comprising weekly
      treatments for three consecutive weeks followed by one week off. Each patient will be
      evaluated every four weeks for the duration of the study.
