    
      This is a multi-center, open-label (doctors and patients know which drug is being given),
      Phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, safety and
      tolerability of TMC125 dosed once daily with tenofovir/emtricitabine with and without
      darunavir/ritonavir in antiretroviral naive HIV-1 infected patients. There will be an
      optional open-label extension phase to evaluate effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      continued tenofovir/emtricitabine with darunavir/ritonavir all dosed once daily for 48 weeks.
      This study will be conducted in the United States at up to 5 sites where 20 patients will
      initially receive TMC125 400mg with tenofovir DF/emtricitabine FDC 300/200 mg all dosed once
      daily for 14 days. On Day 15, a blood sample will be obtained and intensive TMC125
      pharmacokinetic (PK) values and fasting lipids (check of total cholesterol, direct LDL, HDL,
      triglycerides) following a 10 hour fast (no eating) will be assessed. Patients will then add
      darunavir / ritonavir 800/100 mg once a day to the regimen for Days 15 - 29. On Day 29
      intensive PK sampling for TMC125, darunavir and ritonavir will be performed and fasting
      lipids will be evaluated. On Day 29, patients will discontinue TMC125 and continue
      darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg and tenofovir DF/emtricitabine FDC 300/200 mg all dosed once
      daily. On Day 43, fasting lipids will be assessed. At this point, patients may enter the
      optional open-label extension phase of the study and continue treatment with
      darunavir/ritonavir 800mg/100 mg and tenofovir DF/emtricitabine FDC 300/200mg all dosed once
      daily through 48 total weeks of treatment. The study will consist of a total of 8 visits
      including 2 intensive PK visits. Within 4 weeks after the Screening Visit, the study site
      should have received all data to determine a patient's eligibility for the study. The
      Baseline Visit (Day 1) will be followed by a study visit on Day 8. An intensive PK visit will
      occur on Day 15. After modification of therapy on Day 15, a study visit will occur on Day 22.
      A second intensive PK visit will occur on Day 29. On Day 43 a study visit will occur at which
      point study therapy will be discontinued unless the patient elects to continue in the
      optional open label extension phase of the study. Patients electing to continue in the
      open-label extension will have 4 additional study visits at Week 12, 24, 36 and 48. All
      patients will be asked to return for a 4-week follow-up visit after the completion of study
      treatment.

      During the treatment period, the patient will be seen at regular visits during which the
      investigator will assess the patient's medical condition, any Adverse Events and study drug
      compliance. Laboratory evaluations for effectiveness and safety will be done at regular
      visits as well as blood pressure monitoring. All patients will receive TMC125 400 mg orally
      (by mouth) once daily. Tenofovir DF 300mg/emtricitabine 200mg will be dosed once daily orally
      as the fixed dose combination. Darunavir/ritonavir will be dosed 800/100 mg orally once
      daily. All doses should be administered following a meal.
