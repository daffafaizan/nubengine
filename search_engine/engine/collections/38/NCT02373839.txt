      The current definition of pre-eclampsia is a new onset hypertension (>140/90mmHg) and
      proteinuria (>0'3g per 24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Pre-eclampsia affects 3% to 8%
      of all pregnancies and it is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and
      mortality.

      It has been subclassified by clinical severity in severe and non-severe and by gestational
      age at the diagnosis in early and late onset pre-eclampsia (>34 weeks of gestation).

      Pre-eclampsia is associated with abnormal placentation and uterine angiogenesis. Pregnant
      women with preeclampsia show lower circulating levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), a
      proangiogenic factor related to placental angiogenesis, compared with healthy pregnant women.
      Moreover evidence has been found regarding the role of PlGF as a predictor of adverse
      pregnancy outcome and requirement of delivery.

      The only definitive treatment of the disease is delivery. In patients with non-severe
      preeclampsia between 34 and 37 weeks there is no consensus regarding the ideal time of
      delivery.

      AIM: The aim of this study is to assess whether circulating levels of PIGF at 34 weeks could
      help to identify those women that may benefit from labor induction and those where delivery
      can be delayed until 37 weeks with low risk for maternal complications.
