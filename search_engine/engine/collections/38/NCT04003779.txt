      be a serious threat to patient safety. Fall rates continue to be unacceptably high. The
      purpose of this project is to increase the safety of a hospital room for patient mobility,
      using innovative simulation strategies and patient-centric design.

      An innovative simulation environment will be built to enable rapid assessment of room layout
      and fixture positioning and patient stability. The results from multiple simulations will be
      used to fabricate a prototype room layout that will be tested by patients with Parkinson
      disease and reviewed and updated with input from other relevant stakeholders. A final room
      prototype will be built and tested. Results will be translated and shared with all
      stakeholders and disseminated for implementation.
