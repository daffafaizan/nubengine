      component of human behavior regarding one's engagement in self-initiated, self-directed,
      adaptive, purposeful, culturally relevant, organized activity. Rehabilitation through
      occupation is a process, stemming from interactions among the three domains: (a) performance
      areas; (b) performance components; and (c) performance contexts. At the core of the
      occupational therapy is a sub-process created by patients and therapists through their
      actions and reactions to treatment. It is a significant sub-process because it sets into
      motion the use of occupation as therapy. It is believed that the appropriate, therapeutic use
      of occupation affects "performance" or how one functions.

      There is a need to develop ways to articulate and measure complex therapeutic interventions
      themselves. This is especially true of those treatment approaches which integrate human
      relationships, collaborative problem-solving, and the targeted doing of unique, personally
      relevant occupations. Occupational therapy is a health profession characterized by such
      interventions. The capacity to delineate key process variables may lead to credible
      examination of process-outcome relationships. Ultimately, results from the proposed study may
      provide information needed to further establish patient outcomes from occupational therapy
      interventions.
