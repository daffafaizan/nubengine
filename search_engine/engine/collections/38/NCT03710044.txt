    
      40 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD will be treated with a 3-week course of high-dose CsA,
      which is a standard-of-care treatment regimen. After 3 weeks, all responders shift to oral
      low-dose CsA treatment (2-2.5 mg/kg/day) until onset of a second flare or until Week 16 (Day
      113).

      In case of a second AD flare, the subjects shift back to oral high-dose CsA treatment (4-5
      mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks.
