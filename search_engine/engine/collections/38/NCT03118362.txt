      development of metabolic acidosis in comparison with an acetate-free balanced solutions:
      Ringer lactate (chloride concentration of 111 mmol/L) and 2) to determine Acetate & gluconate
      clearance during fluid resuscitation of severely burn patients Plasmalyte® (chloride
      concentration of 98 mmol/L) . Severely burn patients will be randomized to receive
      Plasmalyte® or Ringer Lactate for initial fluid resuscitation during the first 5 days
      following admission.
