      Study Description:

      This study measures atherosclerotic plaques in the vessels of prostate cancer patients in
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), then finds correlation between the plaque and
      clinical biomarkers. These biomarkers include laboratory tests, pathologic findings,
      underlying risk factors, demographic information, and outcomes of the patient.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: Measure atherosclerotic plaques on contrast-enhanced computed tomography
      (CECT).

      Secondary objective: Find correlation between plaque measurement and clinical biomarkers of
      prostate cancer patients.

      Study Population:

      Up to 1,000 NIH Clinical Center patients.

      Description of Sites/Facilities conducting research:

      NIH Clinical Center

      Study Duration:

      10 years
