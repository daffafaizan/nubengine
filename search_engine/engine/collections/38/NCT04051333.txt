      factor for ALS disease progression and survival. In the recently completed E-Health
      Application To Measure Outcomes Remotely (EAT MORE) clinical trial (sponsored by the ALS
      Association), the investigators found that nutritional counseling supported by a mobile
      health (mHealth) app was associated with 0.5 points/month slower ALSFRS-R progression
      (p=0.17) and improved quality of life (p=0.09).

      The investigators are now designing an ALS-specific app that can be used by everyone with
      ALS, including those who do not live near ALS Centers. The app would help to address gaps in
      the delivery of ALS care by providing nutritional counseling, helping patients to manage and
      track their disease symptoms, and communicating with their providers. After the initial
      design has been tested by a group of NEALS patients and their caregivers, the study will
      advertise the app widely to recruit a larger group of ALS patients to measure nutrition and
      outcomes.
