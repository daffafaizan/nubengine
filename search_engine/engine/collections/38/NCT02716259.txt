    
      Design: randomized clinical trial, parallel design, double blinded.

      Sample: 120 patients from the Cardiology Department of Hospital Severo Ochoa (Legan√©s,
      Madrid) suffering from established cardiovascular disease and generalized moderate/severe
      periodontitis. Sixty patients will be randomized to test group (scaling and root planing +
      systemic antimicrobials), and the other 60 subjects will be included in the control group,
      consisting on delayed periodontal treatment (supragingival prophylaxis + placebo).

      Study visits:

      Visit 1: screening Visit 2: baseline data collection (medical history, clinical variables,
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, vascular function) Visit 3: panoramic x-ray, blood
      samples, randomization and first treatment session.

      Visit 4: second treatment session. Visit 5: 24 hours inflammatory biomarkers assessment.
      Visit 6: 7 days inflammatory biomarkers assessment. Visit 7: 1 month follow up (clinical
      variables) Visit 8: 3 months follow up (clinical variables, vascular function) and supportive
      periodontal therapy.

      Visit 9: 6 months follow up (clinical variables, GCF samples, inflammatory biomarkers,
      vascular function) and supportive periodontal therapy.
