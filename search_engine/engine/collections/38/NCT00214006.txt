      and the variables that cause certain plaques to become symptomatic.Patients enrolled in this
      study will be those patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy. This will include both
      symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and there are a variety of atherosclerotic risk
      factors representing this patient population.Patients may or may not have had strokes or
      transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).Pre-operatively patients will be reviewed for their medical
      history and atherosclerotic risk factors. Plaque removed during routine carotid
      endarterectomy will be examined for study purposes.
