      polyphenol-rich supplement vs. placebo to consume daily on human cognitive function.
      Polyphenol-rich supplement and placebo will be provided as capsules matched for appearance.

      The study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups (2 arms)
      placebo-controlled, multicentre interventional design. Two groups, each of 102 volunteers,
      are studied. One group of volunteers will consume the polyphenol-rich product while the other
      one will consume the placebo product.

      Each volunteer will be seen for 3 visits at the investigational site, will have 2 follow-up
      calls and mid-term dietary survey. Baseline and follow-up visit will include cognitive
      assessment with the CANTAB battery. CANTAB tests will cover several aspects of memory:
      visio-spatial learning and episodic memory, verbal recognition memory and visio-spatial
      working memory. Moreover, psychological and mood components will be evaluated (mnesic
      complaint, depression, fatigue). Physical activity and food habits will also be recorded.
      Finally, biological parameters will be assessed (lipid profile, glycemia, insulinemia, CRPus,
      thyroid stimulating hormone, transthyretin, plasma level of phenolic compounds).
