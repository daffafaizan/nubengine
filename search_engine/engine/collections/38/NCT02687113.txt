      successful and safe procedure, safe route of electrode and lesion visibility are essential
      for RFA, and the conditions are usually evaluated on pre-RFA planning ultrasonography (USG).
      However, RFA is sometimes aborted due to limited sonic window of various cause and
      challenging identification of small isoechoic tumors or hepatocellular carcinomas among
      dysplastic nodules . Therefore, precise targeting and assuring safe route would be of
      clinical importance. In this preliminary study, investigators attempted to determine US and
      CT/MR fusion technique would be able to improve RFA feasibility in patients with liver tumors
      in comparison with conventional US alone technique.
