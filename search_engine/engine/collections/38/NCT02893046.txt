      ,000. It appears that prevention, screening, care management, medical and social care of
      patients can be significantly improved especially among the most vulnerable populations.
      Indeed, these new HCV infections are mediated by drug-using people, prisoners, migrants, men
      who have sex with men (MSM) and who are supported too late and without real access to
      treatment.
