      radiotherapy (20 fractions). They will be treated with weekly Gemcitabine (100mg/m2) or daily
      Nicotinamide (60mg/kg)/Carbogen (2% carbon dioxide, 98% oxygen at 15 litres per minute) if
      clinically appropriate.

      As part of standard treatment patients will have a staging CT scan at diagnosis and a
      radiotherapy planning CT. Cone beam imaging will also be performed. Response will be assessed
      as standard with cystoscopy at 3 months and CT scan at 12 months.

      As part of the study patients will undergo 4 additional MRI scans. These will take place in
      the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th weeks of treatment. These MRI scans will include anatomical images
      - with full and empty bladder as well as cine data (with a scan every minute for 10 minutes)
      to assess intra fraction motion. They will also include a diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)
      sequence, which will be used to assess if early prediction of response is possible. The
      frequency of cone beam imaging will be increased from 6 scans (minimum) as standard of care
      to 20 scans to allow for daily imaging.

      The 1st MRI scan will be contoured to outline the tumour bed, clinical target volumes (CTVs)
      and OARs. A variety of planning strategies will be developed including standard planning
      target volume (PTV) margins, a plan of the day (POTD) approach, a POTD+ as well as an online
      adaptation model. These models will be used to assess coverage of CTV and PTV, and the
      feasibility of increasing radiation dose to the tumour bed, as well as dose to OARs using the
      scans obtained during the radiotherapy treatment. The practicality of each approach will also
      be assessed. Inter and intra fraction organ and tumour bed motion will also be analysed in
      order to develop patient specific models.
