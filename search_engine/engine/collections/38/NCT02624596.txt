      economy over $2 billion annually and represents a significant public health problem. This
      study aims to build on our discovery that a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, has
      rapid (in hours) and robust therapeutic effects in OCD. The proposed projects test the acute
      mechanism of action of ketamine at the level of molecules, circuits, and network synchrony to
      determine how NMDA receptor antagonism modifies the underlying pathology of OCD to relieve
      repetitive thoughts and behaviors.
