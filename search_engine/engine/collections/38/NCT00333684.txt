    
      Thirty (30) participants in the randomized portion of the study will be selected who have
      been classified as having moderate to severe facial lipoatrophy based on the three
      investigators evaluations.

      These patients will be divided into two groups -

      The Treatment Group - 15: At Day -1, the Treatment group will be established by the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0 they will complete
      QOL Surveys and will receive treatment with Bio-Alcamid in the affected facial area(s). At
      Day 7, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a
      touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 6. The participants
      will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 12. The Treatment Group
      will continue with follow-up sessions at week 24, 48, 60 and at 96 weeks. Professional
      clinical photographs will be taken at each visit.

      The Control Group - 15: At Day -1, the Control group will be established by the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0, they will complete
      QOL Surveys. They will return for visits at baseline and week 6 as well to complete QOL
      Surveys. At Week 12, they will complete the QOL Surveys and will receive a BA treatment. At
      Week 13, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a
      touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 18. If not, these
      participants will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 24. The
      Control Group will continue with follow-up sessions at week 48, 60, 96 and at 104 weeks.
      Professional clinical photographs will be taken at each visit.
