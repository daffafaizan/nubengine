      ages between 37 weeks to 42 weeks) who need heel lancing for newborn screening. Subjects are
      randomly assigned to low level laser group or breast milk group. Subjects in breast milk
      group are given 5ml expressed breast milk by mouth using a syringe tube inserted to the
      participant's oral cavity over a 2-minute period. LaserPen is applied to the local point for
      20 seconds where heel-lancing will be performed in the low level laser group. Then heel
      lancing is performed and two observers who are blinded to the intervention record the
      physiological (heart rate and oxygen saturation) and behavioral parameters (duration of
      crying and modified neonatal facial coding scores) following the procedure. Heart rate
      variation of participants is record by CheckMyHeart ECG monitor. The salivary swab method is
      used to detect the infant's salivary cortisol and amylase level as biomarker for stress
      evaluation. During the study course, digital cameras continuously record participants'
      behavior. Independent t-test, chi-squared test and one way ANOVA are used for statistical
      analysis.
