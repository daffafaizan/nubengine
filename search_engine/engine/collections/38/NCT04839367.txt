    
      This is a multi-centre, blinded review, dose ranging, non-randomized study of
      64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA administered to participants with confirmed Prostate Cancer. 30 eligible
      participants will be allocated (1:1:3) to 1 of 3 dosing cohorts to be administered with
      64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA 100 MBq, 150 MBq or 200 MBq. PET/CT scan images will be sent to blinded
      central readers to assess the capacity of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA to detect primary Prostate Cancer,
      and to detect secondary Prostate Cancer in comparison to the Reference Standard, to assess
      image quality of the various dose cohorts, and to assess the PET/CT scan features of
      64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA in comparison standard of care.
