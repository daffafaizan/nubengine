      Primary

        -  To correlate CYP2D6 score (0 vs 1-2) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients
           with metastatic breast cancer treated with tamoxifen citrate.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate CYP2D6 score (0 vs 1 vs 2) and PFS of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To correlate CYP2D6 score (0 vs 1 + 2) and the proportion of these patients who are PFS
           at 6 months.

        -  To correlate endoxifen concentration with response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To correlate CYP2D6 with response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To correlate the presence of candidate estrogen receptor (ESR) 1 and 2 variant alleles,
           UGT7, SULT1A1, and other candidate genes to PFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.

      Blood, plasma, and tissue samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.
