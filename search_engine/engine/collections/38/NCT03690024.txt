      coli (STEC) and is one of the most common etiologies of acute kidney injury (AKI) and an
      important cause of acquired chronic kidney disease in children [2]. The incidence of HUC
      tends to parallel the seasonal fluctuation of E.coli o175 : H7 infection which peaks between
      June & September. Nowadays, the incidence increases and is typically observe in infants and
      children, especially those aged 6 months to 4 years. A complicated disease course is defined
      as the development of one or more of the following manifestations: neurological dysfunction,
      severe bowel injury, pancreatitis, hemodynamic instability (symptomatic hypotension,
      multi-organ failure), cardiac (congestive heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis,
      arrhythmia) or pulmonary involvement (pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome),
      hematologic complications (hemorrhage), and death [1].

      Many laboratory and clinical markers upon admission have been associated to severe forms of
      the disease, including high initial leukocyte and hematocrit levels, major extrarenal
      complications, dehydration and recently, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine
      (Cr) ratio [1], [4-6]. Treatment of D+HUS remains supportive; thus, early identification of
      high-risk patients can optimize their management [1-3].
