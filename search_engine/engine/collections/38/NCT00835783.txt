      FDG-PET/CT in the diagnosis of infection and inflammation. The aims are to establish the
      diagnostic value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
      values, interobserver and intraobserver variation.

      Part project A FDG-PET/CT in patients with blood culture positive for staphylococcus aureus
      and unresolved origin of infection.

      Part project B FDG-PET/CT in patients with fever of unknown origin.

      Part project C FDG-PET/CT in patients suspected of vascular graft infection.

      Additionally, we wish to establish an optimal imaging protocol (necessity of fasting,
      consequences of antibiotic therapy prior to imaging, and the need of contrast),
      interpretation criteria, and the value of standard uptake values (SUV).
