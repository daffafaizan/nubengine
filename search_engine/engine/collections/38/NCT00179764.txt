      whole-body radiation treatment followed by the stem cell transplant. This type of transplant
      not only suppresses or kills off the immune system, but is very toxic to the bone marrow.
      This study uses a chemotherapy regimen that will suppress the patient's immune system;
      however, it is non-myeloablative (not toxic to the bone marrow). It does not use whole-body
      radiation treatment. This approach can minimize the short- and long-term effects of
      transplantation. Other studies have shown that using chemotherapy followed by bone marrow
      transplantation without whole-body radiation can produce similar results as treatment with
      whole-body radiation.

      Patients will be given chemotherapy with Fludarabine and Busulfan prior to the stem cell
      transplant. This treatment not only destroys diseased cells, but it also kills normal bone
      marrow cells. Following this experimental treatment, the patient will be given the stem cells
      through a central venous catheter (tube inserted in a vein). When the healthy stem cells are
      given to the patient, they will replace the destroyed bone marrow cells and produce new blood
      cells. The Allogeneic (not one's own) stem cells used in this experimental transplant will be
      obtained from a related matched donor or from an unrelated matched donor located through the
      National Marrow Donor Program.
