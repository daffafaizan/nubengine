      after a 12-hour fast and a three-day food and physical activity diary with accelerometry. The
      patients recover very rapidly from the surgery and will be able to participate to the
      proposed investigations the week after their hospitalization on an outpatient basis on the
      earliest week day between 8 and 12 days after the surgery procedure. The metabolic study is a
      6-hour meal test using Positron Emitting Tomography (PET).
