      worldwide.Registries on Out Of Hospital Cardiac arrest(OOHCA) not only contribute to research
      and surveillance but also provide inputs to improve the links in the Chain of
      Survival.Whereas various registries on OOHCA exist and are ongoing globally ,registries and
      studies on OOHCA are limited in India.The awareness on Cardiovascular Health, Cardiac Arrest
      and CPR is less in India when compared to some developed countries.A study done earlier noted
      the lack of awareness on Cardiovascular Health,cardiac arrest and CPR in a cohort of Indian
      population.This study pointed the need to increase awareness on CV health,cardiac arrest and
      CPR among Indian population(abstract presented by Dr Srinivas Ramaka at the World Congress of
      Cardiology,2016).There is a dire need to improve the survival of victims of OOHCA in India.

      With this background and understanding,the need for a Registry on OOHCA ,the Warangal Area
      Out Of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Registry has been initiated in January 2018 as a Pilot study
      in India.

      Objectives:1.To collect available OOHCA data for one year from a selected geographical area
      in India following an International standard format(Utstein Template) tailored to India.

      2.To compile reports which might be useful to improve the links in the survival of OOHCA
      victims.

      Methods and study design:This is an Observational study of a cohort of Out of Hospital
      cardiac arrest victims. Geographical area:Warangal and surroundings ,Telangana state. Time
      frame--January 1 ,2018 to December 31,2018.As it is both a surveillance and research
      study,the project is proposed to be continued mostly for another year 2019 depending on
      logistic support and feasibility.
