      invasive method to study retinal changes associated with multiple sclerosis induced optic
      neuritis. The retina is a unique structure in that it is an unmyelinated part of the central
      nervous system (CNS). However, it is uncertain which layer of the retina provides the best
      correlation with MS disease. The investigators propose a prospective, case-control study to
      compare OCT measurements from different parts of the retina of MS patients with optic
      neuritis, those without optic neuritis, and healthy controls. The investigators will then
      correlate the OCT measurements to clinical measures of disease. This will allow future
      studies to use OCT technology as a primary outcome in studying MS axonal and cell body injury
      of the CNS, as well as evaluating strategies in treating MS.
