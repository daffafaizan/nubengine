      referred to the physiotherapy treatment.

      Each patient will be checked twice by the physiotherapy team, in the first and in the last
      physiotherapy treatment. Test muscle strength of QUADRICEPS, GLUTEOUS MEDIUS and HAMSTRING
      will be measured by Dynamometer (the dynamometer expressed in a quantitative way the muscle
      force) The population will randomized separated in trail and control group. The control group
      will receive before physiotherapy COLD HOT or Electrotherapy treatment depends on the patient
      and physiotherapy prefer.

      of cycling cold/hot/cold/hot treatment (2*7 min cold: 10…15 degrees; 2*7 min hot: 39..42
      degrees,). During this 28 minutes the patient also receive tolerable intensity Premodulated
      Interferential current with sweep Beat frequency (3Hz…200Hz), Carrier frequency 5kHz ;
      Electrodes setup: Thermo Electrode and 2 Regular Electrodes After the treatment the control
      and trail group will evaluate with 0-10 visual analogue scale VAS, Oxford Knee Score and
      WOMAC The population will receive treatment twice a week for one month.
