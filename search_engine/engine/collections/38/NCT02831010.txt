      infants, with a corresponding increase of attention to encephalopathy of prematurity (EOP)
      and the following neurological disorders. Studies suggested that hypoxic-ischemic injury and
      perinatal infection might be the two main risk factors of EOP, including white matter injury,
      neuronal-axonal diseases and cerebellar hemorrhage, which have a strong impact on
      neurological outcomes. Sequelae like cerebral palsy or mental retardation become a burden to
      both the family and society. Therefore, the risk factors of brain injury become the critical
      issue of both Obstetrics and Neonatology. More importantly, little is known about the
      morbidity of neurodevelopmental impairment and its risk factors in China. Thus, the aim of
      our study is to explore the perinatal risk factors of encephalopathy of prematurity and the
      morbidity of the following neurodevelopmental impairments in preterm infants with gestational
      age <32 weeks in China.
