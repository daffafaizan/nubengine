    
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover cognitive neuroscience study,
      the investigators are evaluating whether the COMT inhibitor tolcapone impacts memory and self
      regulation, as measured both behaviorally (via cognitive testing) and neurophysiologically
      (via functional MRI). A new study arm that does not include use of tolcapone, nominally
      equivalent to the placebo arm only, is now also included to address performance on cognitive
      testing alone.
