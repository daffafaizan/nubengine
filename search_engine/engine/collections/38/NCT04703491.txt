      TreadWill helps the participants learn the concepts of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
      and practice mindfulness in an interactive manner. It also has games based on Cognitive Bias
      Modification (CBM) and an empathetic chatbot. We hypothesize that participants using
      TreadWill will show a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and will show engagement
      with the program. To test this hypothesis, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial.
      We will randomize participants into three groups: experimental, active control, and waitlist.
      Participants randomized to the experimental group will get access to the full-featured
      version of TreadWill as described above. Participants randomized to the active control group
      will have access to a limited version of TreadWill designed to deliver basic CBT in plain
      text format. The waitlisted participants will be put on a waitlist for 6 weeks.
