      the developed world and is a major morbidity associated with diabetes, often leading to pain,
      suffering, and a poor quality of life for patients. Chronic diabetic foot ulcers are
      estimated to occur in 15% of all patients with diabetes and precede 84% of all
      diabetes-related lower-leg amputations.The pathophysiology of chronic diabetic ulcers is
      complex and still incompletely understood, the most important predisposing factors being
      diabetic neuropathy and vasculopathy. Both micro and macroangiopathy strongly contribute to
      development and delayed healing of diabetic wounds, through an impaired tissue feeding and
      response to ischemia. HIF-1α and VEGF, as well as the NO production from iNOS, may contribute
      to limitation of hypoxic injury by promoting angiogenesis and wound healing. Experimental and
      pathological studies suggest that suggest that he incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) may improves VEGF generation, and promote pancreatic islet viability through the
      up-regulation of HIF1α.

      Therefore, aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the augmentation of GLP-1, by
      inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), such as vildagliptin, on HIF-1α, VEGF and
      iNOS in diabetic chronic ulcers.
