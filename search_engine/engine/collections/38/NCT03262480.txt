      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two equal groups, according to
      computer-generated randomization sequence into:

        -  Stroke volume optimization group (SVO group).

        -  Central venous pressure dynamic group(CVPdyngroup).

      Stroke volume optimization group (SVO group):

      Colloid aliquots of 200 ml 6% hydroxy ethyl starch 130/ 0.4 (Voluven, Fresenius kabi,
      Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) will be administered within 10 minutes and stroke
      volume response will be recorded .If stroke volume increase by more than 10 % for 20 minutes,
      the aliquot will be repeated. No further aliquots will be given once stroke volume failed to
      increase >10%. The last stroke volume without rise of > 10% will be defined as optimum stroke
      volume (SVopt).When stroke volume decreases by 10% below (SVopt), this will be defined as
      trigger stroke volume (SVT). Stroke volume will be followed every 30 minutes during surgery
      and every 4 hours for 24 hours postoperatively .

      Central venous pressure dynamic group (CVPdyn group):

      Colloid aliquots of 200 ml 6% hydroxy ethyl starch 130/ 0.4(Voluven) will be administered
      within 10 minutes and CVP response will be recorded. If CVP failed to rise sustainably for
      more than 2 mmHg for 20 minutes, the aliquot will be repeated. No further aliquots will be
      given once CVP increases more than 2 mmHg above the recorded one.The last CVP with sustained
      rise of>2 mmHg will be defined as CVP maximum (CVPmax).When CVP decrease below (CVPmax)by 3
      mmHg, this will be defined as trigger CVP (CVPT).CVP will be followed every 30 min during
      surgery and every 4 hours for 24 hours postoperatively
