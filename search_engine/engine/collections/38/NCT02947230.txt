      published physical activity guidelines. This may be in part due to lack of access to
      evidence-based information on mobility and aging, and knowledge of strategies to maintain or
      improve mobility with age. The McMaster Optimal Aging Portal (the Portal) was launched in
      2014 to increase public access to trustworthy health information. Now the investigators want
      to know if easy-to-understand evidence-based messages change what people know and do to stay
      healthy and mobile.

      Sequential, explanatory mixed-methods design consisting of a two-armed randomized controlled
      trial and a qualitative process study to explore quantitative findings in depth.

      Consent forms and a baseline survey will be sent to all interested participants. Following
      baseline data collection, participants will be stratified by previous Portal use, and
      randomized to the Knowledge Translation (KT) intervention or control group. During the
      12-week KT intervention, intervention group participants will have access to the Portal and
      will receive mobility- focused weekly email alerts including blog posts and evidence
      summaries relevant to mobility and be invited to follow a Twitter and Facebook feed; a unique
      hashtag will be created to identify and collate relevant mobility information. Control group
      participants will be able to access the Portal in a 'self-serve' fashion, but will not
      receive targeted KT strategies.
