      ovarian epithelial cancer treated with ILX-295501. II. Determine the number of patients with
      at least 50% decrease in CA125 when treated with this regimen. III. Determine the time to
      tumor progression, overall survival, and toxicity profile in this patient population treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX-295501 once weekly for 3
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3
      months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
