    
      The human cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme is a polymorphic enzyme yielding ultrarapid
      metabolizer, extensive metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer, and poor metabolizer (PM)
      phenotypes. Enrollment in the study was limited to participants predicted to be CYP2C19
      extensive metabolizers or CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, as determined by genotyping analysis.
