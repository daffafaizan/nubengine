      incorporating routine clinical sequences as well as non-contrast research sequences. The
      patient will also undergo clinically indicated standard-of-care imaging such as PET/CT, CT,
      Technetium-99m bone scan or MRI with contrast as determined by the patient's oncologist. When
      the standard-of-care imaging has not yet been performed upon enrollment, the research MRI
      will ideally be performed on the same day as the standard-of-care exam. However, scheduling
      constraints and patient time constraints may preclude scheduling both scans on the same day.
      In this case, the scans will be performed within a week 90 days of each other. An experienced
      radiologist will read both scans and results will be provided to the patient's oncologist for
      clinical follow up.

      Patients receiving additional standard-of-care imaging within 12 months after the research
      MRI may be asked to return for an additional whole body MRI scan within 90 days of their
      standard-of-care scan. The additional research scan will be requested of patients that have
      evidence of progression during ongoing standard of care treatment and monitoring. The
      additional scan would be requested of those patients to compare baseline scans to those that
      are completed during standard of care imaging. This would be an additional tool to verify
      disease progression or treatment response.
