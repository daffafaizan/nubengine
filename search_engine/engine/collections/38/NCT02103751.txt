      the USA although Japan is one of the top four tobacco consuming countries, this study aims to
      determine biomarkers of both level of exposure and CVD-related biological effects in Japanese
      smokers compared to non-smokers.

      Biomarkers of Exposure (BoExp) include 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP),
      4-(methylnitrosaminoi)-1-(3-pyridil)-1-butanone (NNK), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, pyrene
      and 0-toluidine (o-TOL). CVD-related biomarkers include white blood cell (WBC) count, high
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine in plasma; complemented with urinary
      8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), urinary 11-DTXB2, plasma
      fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and von
      Willebrand Factor.
