      unaffected siblings of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although evidence
      suggests that family functioning may be a predictor of adaptation in caregivers of children
      with chronic illnesses, little research has been conducted on the relationships between
      aspects of family functioning and the adaptation of unaffected siblings. Evidence in the
      literature suggests that aspects of family functioning may play a key role in adaptation.
      Moreover, the role of DMD-specific communication in facilitating sibling adaptation has not
      yet been explored in the literature and further insight may be derived from exploring this
      relationship. The goals of this study are to better understand the relationship of family
      functioning with the adaptation of unaffected siblings, as well as to explore the timing,
      extent (depth and content), and the characteristics of initiation of discussion of
      parent-sibling communication around DMD. Currently, some evidence exists to direct the
      creation of interventions that reinforce a family-centered approach to facilitate adaptation
      of family members to living with a child with a chronic health condition. Nevertheless, more
      insight is needed to understand how family processes affect individual adaptation, especially
      that of the unaffected sibling, in order to maximize the effectiveness of future
      interventions with this population.
