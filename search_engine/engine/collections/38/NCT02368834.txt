      important treatment for ADHD. The adherence to the medication is extremely low. This study
      aims to investigate the the effect of a psychoeducation program for parents of ADHD children.
      The investigators intent to recruit 80 ADHD families. They will be randomized to intervention
      group and control group using a block randomization design. The intervention group will
      participate in a psychoeducation program, which includes a presentation from a specialist in
      ADHD at the baseline, with parent manual provided, posters, and two group sessions at the end
      of the 2nd and the 4th weeks. The control group only receives general consultation. The
      knowledge towards ADHD and its treatment, parents' behavior intent, medication adherence,
      clinical symptoms, and parents' satisfaction will be assessed and compared at the end of the
      1st and 3rd months after intervention.
