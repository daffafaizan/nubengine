      endometrial biopsy will be randomly divided into three equal groups. To ensure blinding the
      investigators will use the double dummy technique in which group 1 will receive Tramadol
      100mg (Trama®, Global Napi, Giza, Egypt) orally in addition to a placebo similar to
      Celecoxib, group 2 will receive dexketoprofen 25mg (neo ketadex 25, Marcryl, Egypt) in
      addition to a placebo similar to Tramadol, and group 3 will received a placebo similar to
      Tramadol and a placebo similar to Celecoxib. All drugs will be given 2 hours before the
      procedure. An independent person will generate the allocation sequence using computer
      generated random numbers.

      Statistics:

      Quantitative data will be statistically represented in terms of mean ± standard deviation (±
      SD) while categorical data will be represented as frequency and percentage. Comparison of
      quantitative data will be done using ANOVA test for independent samples while categorical
      data will be compared using Chi squared test or Fisher exact test when appropriate. A
      probability value (p value) less than 0.05 will be considered significant.
