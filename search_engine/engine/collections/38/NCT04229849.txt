      cancer after chemotherapy failure. Anrotinib combined with triplizumab have showed
      synergistic effect in the tumor treatment, and they have demonstrated robust antitumor
      activity in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with negative driving gene. However,
      there is no related report on the efficacy in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anrotenib
      plus toripalimab in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In
      addition, the investigators will explore the possible mechanisms of anrotinib combined with
      toripalimab in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and screen out biomarkers that
      can predict the efficacy of combination therapy.
