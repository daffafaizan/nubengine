      therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device programmed to DDD-70 or DDDR-40 compared to a CRT device
      programmed to DDD-40 in heart failure patients. The effect of atrial support pacing in heart
      failure patients will be assessed using a clinical composite rating. A sub-study will
      evaluate the effect pacing mode has on exercise capacity in this heart failure population.
