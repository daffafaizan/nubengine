      compared to Oseltamivir as an adjuvant therapy among adult COVID-19 patients. This study will
      be conducted in a hospital setting, recruiting adult COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate,
      and severe symptoms. Subjects will be randomly given Favipiravir or Oseltamivir as an
      adjuvant therapy to standard COVID-19 treatment. Patients will be followed up for 21 days
      after the first dose of intervention given. The primary outcomes of this study are clinical
      improvements determined by laboratory measurements and radiology results. The secondary
      outcomes are adverse events, hospital length of stay (LOS), and Case fatality rate (CFR)
