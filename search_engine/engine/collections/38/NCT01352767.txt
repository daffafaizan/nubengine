    
      A randomised, controlled, cross-over study with inpatient and outpatient phases. The
      inpatient phase length will be two days, which include a "Control" day without activating the
      InSuPad and a "Test" day where the InsuPad is activated. The outpatient phase length is 8
      weeks: 4 weeks without the device-"Control", and 4 weeks with the device-"Test". Each subject
      will be randomly selected into one of two groups, group "A" and group "B". Forty (40) type I
      subjects who are meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria as outlined below and who provide
      written Informed Consent will be enrolled in the study.

      During the inpatient phase subjects will have standardized breakfast and dinner and venous
      blood samples will be taken for insulin and blood glucose measurements. Comparison of the two
      days ("control" and "test") will enable us to evaluate the effect of the device on post
      prandial glucose levels and insulin levels.

      During the outpatient (daily life) phase subjects will be required to perform at least 5 self
      blood glucose measurements (SMBG), three before each meal and two at 90 minutes post
      breakfast and dinner. Comparing the SMBG measurement from the two periods will enable us to
      evaluate the effect of the device on post prandial glucose levels. The subjects will be
      contacted over the phone by the study staff to verify compliance with the protocol.
