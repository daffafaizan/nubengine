      therapy as an intervention for patients with neuropathic pain. The subjects in this research
      study will be recruited through medical practice. Participants who are enrolled will undergo
      8 consecutive weekly ultrasound sessions. Targeting for treatment will be based on patient
      MRI scans using stereotaxic techniques.
