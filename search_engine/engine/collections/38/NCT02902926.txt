      timely diagnosis and treatment effect is not ideal and frequent treatment, seriously affect
      the quality of life, and cause the corresponding economic and social burden.At presentï¼Œa
      number of studies suggest that fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and
      monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) can induce IBS symptoms.Data from large randomized
      controlled trials are limited, leaving clinicians with the challenge of providing patients
      with reliable guidance based on minimal evidence.

      This study will compare the effect of low FODMAPs diet and usual diet instruction on
      Intestinal flora, intestinal short chain fatty acids and quality of life by two groups.The
      results will answer the effect and long-term safety of Low FODMAPs diet.
