      addiction in chronic pain patients. As such, novel, multimodal interventions are needed to
      effectively target key mechanisms in the risk chain from chronic pain to opioid misuse and
      addiction. The secondary aim of this study is to explore possible cognitive, affective, and
      psychophysiological mediators of intervention effects on pain, opioid craving, opioid misuse
      behaviors, and well-being.
