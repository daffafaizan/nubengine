      diagnosis of COVID-19 receiving supplemental oxygen were recruited from DHQ Hospital
      Faisalabad. patients were grouped into two A & B. We collected baseline data on demographics
      and anthropometrics. After baseline data collection, all the patients were helped into the
      prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of three hours. After that
      patients in group B performed alternate nostril breathing for 10 minutes with help of
      therapist. Clinical data were re-collected on 3rd day of intervention one hour after
      returning to the supine position in group A and after alternate nostril breathing in group B.
      The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2]/
      fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO2]) between baseline and resupination,
      and General psychological state through GAD-7 General anxiety disorder questionnaire.
