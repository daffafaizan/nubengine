      to beginning treatment. Patients will engage in a split face trial, where each participant
      uses the vehicle on one side of the face and active ingredient treatment cream on the other
      side. Baseline facial photography and OCT imaging will be performed on both sides of the
      face. One side of the face will be randomly chosen as the treatment side, and the other as an
      intrinsic control. Each day, the participant will wash their face in the morning with a
      standard cleanser, dry their face, then apply the medication to one side of their face and
      the vehicle to the other side of their face. The patient will then apply a standardized
      sunscreen SPF 30 to the entire face. Each night, the patient will again wash their face with
      the standard cleanser, and apply the two medications to the proper sides of the face.
      Patients will participate in a follow-up clinic visit 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks
      after beginning treatment. At each visit, photographs and OCT images will be taken of both
      sides of the face. At week 12, participants will take a survey to determine their
      satisfaction with the product and their subjective assessment of their skin changes and stop
      using the products and continue only the sunscreen. Four weeks after cessation of using the
      creams, they will return for photography and OCT imaging at a final visit.
