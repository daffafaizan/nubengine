      Biodex: Biodex system is a muscle strength testing and rehabilitation instrument used in the
      testing and rehabilitation services for shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle. Modes of
      operation for exercise and testing include isokinetic, passive, isometric, isotonic, and
      reactive eccentric. Patients are tested for their muscle performance for the required number
      of repetitions in the required mode. The muscle performance is measured by calculating the
      average peak torque (in Nm) and analyzed across the group of patients.

      Goniometer: A manual devise used to measure joint range of motion. Visual Analogue Scale: A
      scale with 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain, and 10 being severe pain.

      Measurement procedure:

      All the subjects posted for surgery will be tested prior to and again 6 weeks following
      surgery for:

      Shoulder Pain is measured using a visual analog scale. Shoulder Range of motion is measured
      using a standard goniometer. Shoulder Muscle performances are measured using Biodex.
