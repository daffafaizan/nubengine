    
      The present study is initiated to evaluate vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide in patients
      with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and
      neck cancer. Specifically, the present study aims at the following questions:

        -  Evaluation of potential toxicity of the vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide

        -  Evaluation of the immune response in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a-positive
           cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer before vaccination and
           after vaccination with P16_37-63.

      In this context, the present study shall demonstrate whether application of P16_37-63 in a
      vaccination approach is associated with the induction of peptide-related toxicity. Hence, the
      study marks the first step towards the application of P16_37-63 in humans, as it provides
      information on the safety of P16_37-63 as vaccination agent for the first time. Moreover, the
      study shall provide initial information, whether vaccination with P16_37-63 can induce
      p16INK4a -specific immune responses in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive
      cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer. Thus, it shall provide
      information, whether P16_37-63 has the potential to elicit peptide-specific immune responses
      and therefore represent a suitable target for the induction of tumor antigen-specific immune
      responses in this population.

      The present study marks an important milestone towards a potential application of P16_37-63
      as therapeutic agent in the management of patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive
      cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer. Long-term goal of this
      approach is to develop novel tools for the palliative and/or adjuvant therapy of patients
      with advanced advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive tumors.
