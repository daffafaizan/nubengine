    
      TG-2349 oral solution has been investigated in a phase I/IIa study (study number: TG-2349-01)
      in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. The study
      demonstrated that TG-2349 was safe and well-tolerated when given to healthy volunteers at
      single oral doses up to 800 mg, and at five-consecutive daily oral doses up to 600 mg.
      Co-administration of TG-2349 with food resulted in a significant increase in bioavailability,
      and therefore concomitant food intake with dosing is recommended.

      To further advance the clinical development of TG-2349, a new capsule formulation was
      developed to replace the current TG-2349 oral solution. The objectives of this study (study
      number: TG-2349-02) are to evaluate the PK and relative bioavailability of TG-2349, given as
      a new capsule formulation and as the original formulation of oral solution, after a single
      oral dose of 400 mg under fed condition in healthy volunteers, and to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and ethnic differences of the TG-2349 capsule formulation.
