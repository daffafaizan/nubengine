    
      This is a multicentre, parallel group, event-driven, registry-based randomised controlled
      trial (R-RCT), double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients without diabetes
      presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) and a reduced left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); defined as LVEF < 50% or definite evidence of Q wave MI
      on ECG. In the study the effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo, given once daily in addition
      to SoC therapy will be evaluated for the prevention of hospitalisation for HF or CV death.
