    
      This double-blind clinical trial is conducted on a maternity and newborn (N*) ward. Each
      time, during at least one month, one of the four selected solutions (glucose 10%, 20%, 30%
      and placebo) will be administered orally, 2 minutes prior to the venipuncture. The pain from
      the skin puncture will be scored using a validated pain scale (the "Leuven" pain scale).
