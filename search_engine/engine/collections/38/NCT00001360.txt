    
      Objective:

      Our goal is to study the functional organization of the intact human brain by combining
      cognitive tasks and neuroimaging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to measure brain
      activity in healthy human subjects engaged in performing cognitive tasks. These tasks will
      address specific questions concerning the neural systems that mediate perception, attention,
      memory, decision-making, emotion, plasticity and social interactions. fMRI and MEG,
      respectively, will be employed to investigate the spatial and temporal aspects of these
      neural systems.

      Study Population:

      Normal volunteer participants aged 18-65, who are in good general health will be recruited
      from the local community and studied under this minimal risk protocol.

      Design:

      Subjects will perform cognitive tasks in behavioral and/or neuroimaging sessions (fMRI or
      MEG).

      Outcome Measures:

      Behavior as performance on cognitive tasks, and brain activity (fMRI and MEG) will be
      combined to yield information about the neural correlates and processes underlying different
      aspects of human cognition including visual perception, memory, learning, emotion, social
      cognition, decision-making and attention.
