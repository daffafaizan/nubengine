      always possible for pediatric non-cooperative patients with severe anxiety. In these cases,
      unpleasant dental experiences may lead to dental phobia when they become adults. For such
      patients requiring short-term dental procedures, sedation can best choice.

      In sedative procedures of patients it is necessary to delivery oxygen to the patient's
      respiratory system. This can achieved by means of nasal cannulas or interface masks like
      nasal mask which are connected to the oxygen flowmeter of the anesthesia machine.
      Investigators hypotezed that oxygen delivery via non-invazive machanic ventilation with nasal
      mask which is connected to the anesthesia-breathing circuit unit could be better than nasal
      cannula connected to the oxygen flowmeter of the anesthesia machine during deep sedation for
      dental treatment.
