    
      The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), also known as bombesin receptor subtype II
      (BB2), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors. GRPR is
      over-expressed in various types of human tumors including breast cancer. RM26, a GRPR
      antagonist with high affinity, was discovered by peptide backbone modification of bombesin
      analogues.To target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neoplastic cells of human breast
      cancer, peptide NOTA-RM26 was synthesized with a PEG3 linker between NOTA and RM26, and then
      labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to assess its clinical
      diagnostic value in patients with breast tumor.
