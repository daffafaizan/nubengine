      abdomen, this trial could be considered. Before operation, laboratory test results, image
      result, patient's medical history, and baseline quality of life will be checked and reviewed.

      When optimal cytoreduction (residual tumor<1cm) is attained, this HIPEC (hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy) could be considered. For the primary advanced epithelial
      ovarian cancer, HIPEC will be performed at random. For the recurrent ovarian cancer, HIPEC
      will be performed after completion of cytoreductive procedures. Usually, HIPEC takes one and
      half hours after cytoreductive surgery.

      After cytoreductive surgery followed by HIPEC, adjuvant chemotherapy will be added. The cycle
      of chemotherapy will be determined according to the patients' clinical outcomes. The
      laboratory test results, image result, patient's medical history, and baseline quality of
      life will be checked after the operation, during chemotherapy, and after chemotherapy.

      Cytoreduction: an operation to remove ovarian cancer and its metastatic disease

      There will be an interim analysis when 50% of patients are enrolled.

      At the interim analysis, a statistical test will be performed. The nominal significance
      levels will be determined later. The exact nominal significance level will be determined
      based on the exact number of events at the time of the interim analysis. The Stopping
      boundaries will be calculated using an O'Brien-Fleming error spending function
