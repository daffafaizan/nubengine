      Primary Objective: To ascertain whether FDG-PET scanning can detect lesions that would
      preclude pulmonary resection in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging
      procedures.

      Secondary Objectives: To use the data collected to generate hypotheses to be used in future
      studies, such as which types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET is best able to
      identify.

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) IV followed 45-60 minutes later by positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging. Confirmatory studies, such as biopsy, fine needle
      aspiration, or other imaging studies are then conducted to confirm the PET findings.

      Patients with no mediastinal nodal or distant metastases identified by FDG-PET scan may
      undergo thoracotomy and pulmonary resection within 1 month of evaluation.

      Patients are followed at 5-6 months after surgery.
