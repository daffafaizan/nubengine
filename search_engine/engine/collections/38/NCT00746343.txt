      weight reduction by increasing physical activity and improving nutrition and dietary habits,
      while at the same time providing optimal psychiatric care and medical monitoring. This will
      allow us to investigate the role that improvements in sleep/wake and social rhythm
      regularity, diet, and physical activity have in improving psychiatric and functional
      outcomes. In order to examine another set or possible pathways (i.e., that it is the
      amelioration or psychiatric symptoms that leads to the improvements in physical health), we
      will contrast outcomes of subjects receiving IRRI with those of subjects receiving
      psychiatric care with medical monitoring (PCMM), which incorporates the same optimal
      psychiatric care plus monitoring of medical conditions. These aims will be achieved in a
      24-month randomized treatment trial of 144 adult subjects with bipolar I disorder.
