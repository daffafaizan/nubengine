      Evaluation. The study examines the effect on wound healing using incisional Negative Pressure
      Wound Therapy (iNPWT) compared with standard postoperative dressings in women with a BMI >=
      30, who has a Caesarean Section (CS). We expect to find a lower frequency of wound
      complications when using iNPWT directly on primary suturing compared to standard
      postoperative dressings in this high-risk subpopulation.

      Women, who have given informed consent, will be randomised to either intervention or control
      group via a computer-generated randomisation program. Elective and emergency CS will be
      stratified to ensure roughly equal numbers in each category of CS in each arm of the study
      and permit valid separate and pooled analysis. The analysis will be carried out on an
      intention to treat basis.

      The iNPWT or standard postoperative dressings will be applied in theatre immediately
      following the operation. In the intervention group the therapy will be left in situ for five
      days corresponding to the date of removal of stitches. In the control group the dressing will
      be left in situ for at least 24 hours as standard procedure. Women, who do not wish to
      participate, will be asked for permission to use their data in the analysis.
