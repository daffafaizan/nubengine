      1, and the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance of TAK-831 after single oral
      administration in Period 2 in healthy adult male participants, by collecting plasma, urine,
      and feces samples for drug concentration analysis, and plasma, whole blood, urine, and fecal
      samples for total radioactivity analysis and metabolic profiling.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2
      periods: Period 1 (ABA study period) and Period 2 (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
      elimination [ADME] study period). In Period 1 (ABA study period), all participants will
      receive single unlabeled oral dose of TAK-831 as tablet and microdose of 50 mcg
      (approximately 1 mcCi) [14C]TAK-831 as intravenous infusion, followed by a washout period of
      at least 7 days before the dose in Period 2. In Period 2 (ADME study period), all
      participants will receive a single dose of 500 mg (approximately 100 mcCi) [14C]TAK-831 as an
      oral suspension.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including screening period. Participants
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
