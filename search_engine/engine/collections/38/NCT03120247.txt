      analgesic drug for use in intensive care. However, it has a number of unique pharmacodynamic
      properties, which also make it useful in anesthesia including; decreased MAC, analgesia
      without respiratory depression and a significant reduction in catecholamine secretion. Also
      it has been used off-label as an adjunctive agent for sedation and analgesia in patients in
      the critical care unit and for sedation during non-invasive procedures in radiology. It also
      has a potential role as part of anesthesia care to prevent emergence delirium and
      post-anesthesia shivering.

      Oral trans-mucosal administration is relatively easy and convenient, it also reduces first
      pass metabolism and has been used successfully for fentanyl, ketamine, and midazolam
      premedication.

      The current literature is focused in studying the sedative and analgesic effects of
      intravenously administered dexmedetomidine. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic studies
      undertaken on alternative routes of dexmedetomidine administration are lacking. The
      pharmacokinetic properties of trans-mucosal administration of dexmedetomidine have been
      demonstrated in one study only, and the clinical effects of non-parenteral administration of
      dexmedetomidine have been described in anecdotal case reports.
