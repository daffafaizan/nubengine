      inflammatory reaction to infection leads to a life-threatening of organ dysfunctions. Sepsis
      and septic shock are major causes of death in intensive care units worldwide. Sepsis remains
      the most important cause of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) with 15%-20% of patients
      with sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) prescribed RRT . In addition to association with short
      term mortality, AKI is also linked to the later development of CKD, ESRD, and long-term
      increased risk of death

      NETosis is a unique form of neutrophil cell death that is characterized by the release of
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA web-like structures decorated with
      highly cytotoxic protein components. Release of NETs leads to bystander tissue damage
      (including the kidneys) and drives a fatal course of disease in sepsis patients.

      The plasmapheresis is a medical procedure, where pathogenic components are being removed from
      the blood by adsorbers outside the body in an extracorporeal circulation. For removal of the
      pathogenic substances the plasma is separated from the blood to pass the adsorber. The
      purified plasma is merged with the solid blood components thereafter and returned to the
      patient. The NucleoCapture device provide highly selective removal of neutrophil
      extracellular traps from human blood during plasmapheresis procedure.
