      undergoing general anesthesia with neuromuscular blocking agents versus obturator block.
      Transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s) (TURBT) is a commonly performed procedure to
      diagnose and treat bladder cancer. The obturator nerve is located lateral to the bladder wall
      in the pelvis prior to innervating the adductor muscles of the thigh. Depending on the
      location of the tumor(s), electrocautery or surgical stimulation may result in stimulation of
      the obturator nerve, resulting in adduction of the leg, which is called the adductor reflex
      or spasm. This may occur violently and unexpectedly, and result in bladder perforation,
      bleeding, or cancer dissemination.
