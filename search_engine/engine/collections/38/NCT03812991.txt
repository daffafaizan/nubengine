      control group will not be prescribed calcitonin. Participants will complete research only
      Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) to
      assess subjective pain and function. Two-week follow up visit post discharge: participants
      will complete Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess
      subjective pain and function. Participants will be referred for a standard of care DEXA bone
      density scan if they have no previous diagnosis of osteoporosis and no history of previous
      scan within a year. Six weeks post discharge: participants will complete Iowa pelvis score
      questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess subjective pain and function.
      Participants will undergo standard of care radiographic analysis of pelvic ring injury with
      AP/inlet and outlet pelvic x-rays 4. Twelve weeks post discharge: Participants will complete
      Iowa pelvis score questionnaire, SF-36 questionnaire and VAS to assess subjective pain and
      function. Participants will undergo standard of care radiographic analysis of pelvic ring
      injury with AP/inlet and outlet pelvic x-rays - Participants will perform a timed up and go
      (TUG) test.

      After informed consent is obtained, all patients who meet eligibility criteria will be
      randomized into one of two groups. Randomization will be achieved by numbering 50 sealed
      white envelopes (25 control, 25 treatment). There is no blinding to the randomization. It
      would be difficult to blind the participants, or the research personnel. We do not believe
      there will be any significant bias that can be corrected with blinding.
