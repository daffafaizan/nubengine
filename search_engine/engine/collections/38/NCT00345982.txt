      drug of choice for these patients but 2/3 will not respond adequately to clozapine. In the
      study clozapine treatment is augmented with sertindole. Patients are randomized to either
      clozapine or sertindole for 12 weeks and continue in a open-label study with sertindole for
      12 weeks. The purpose of the open-label study is to determine whether clozapine dosage can be
      reduced due to the addition of sertindole.
