      one of two groups: intervention or control. Referring physicians to the intervention group
      will be faxed a brief Choosing Wisely form (intervention) based upon the recommendations of
      the Canadian Rheumatology Association's (CRA) Canada Choosing Wisely campaign, while
      referring physicians from the control group will not receive the form (non intervention).
      Analysis will be based upon the results of a three question survey faxed to all referring
      physicians at year one and at year two and on future referrals from the referring physicians
      to determine if there is a reduction in the group of ordering physicians that received the
      intervention (Choosing Wisely form).
