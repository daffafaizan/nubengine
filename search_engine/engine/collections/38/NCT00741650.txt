      pain in Norway. The intervention focuses on attempting to treat musculoskeletal pain outside
      the traditional medical system as much as possible, to avoid the establishment of a patient
      identity and passive patient behavior. In addition, participants are given reasons to stay
      active, and not advice to stay active.

      Ibedrift is a randomized controlled trial with the aim of studying the effect of a new
      treatment regime for musculoskeletal pain, focusing on didactic information about low back
      pain with peer support. Those participants not in the control group will have the option of
      contacting a peer advisor, a non health professional trained by the iBedrift crew to give
      information about back pain and reasons to stay active. For those who have not recovered
      within a short period of time, and who are randomized to full treatment, the peer advisor can
      send them directly to health personnel for a brief intervention consisting of a medical
      examination with screening for conditions that need treatment, counseling and education.

      The intervention was done in 2 Norwegian municipalities for all local government employees.
      Randomization was done at the level of working units (schools, offices etc) which allows for
      more message containment.
