      of non-responsive to medical therapy PAF. ECG recordings will be obtained during sinus rhythm
      before and after PV ablation with a 3 - channel digital recorder for 10 minutes, and
      digitized with a 16-bit accuracy at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The P wave will be analyzed
      using the Morlet wavelet. Other parameters to be analyzed include 12 lead surface ECG, the
      burden of main and secondary morphologies and echocardiographic indexes of left atrial
      mechanical function. Follow-up visits will be held in 3, 6 and 12 months after the ablation
      procedure.
