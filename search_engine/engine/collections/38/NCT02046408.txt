      the 5A's intervention to patients then prompts providers for reinforcing next steps. CF-5A's
      could efficiently and effectively promote smoking cessation while educating providers about
      cessation resources and appropriate follow-up. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model,
      clinically tailored strategies to promote CF-5A's implementation will be developed and tested
      to ensure the appropriate use and uptake of this new service delivery model. Development of
      the model, materials, and strategies will occur in years 1 and 2.

      Baseline data collection occurs in year 2, followed by a randomized trial of CF- 5A's where
      the provider is the unit of randomization. Provider use of the 5A's will primarily be
      assessed with a brief phone call to the patient after the primary care visit has occurred.

      Although focused on 5A's for smoking cessation, this study examines the underlying
      implementation science of computer-aided service delivery models with important implications
      for the integration of other substance use or behavioral health interventions in primary
      care. Implementation factors will be assessed using qualitative interviews and brief pre-post
      surveys.
