      healing rate between azathioprine (58%) and 5-aminosalicylate (21%). With a two-tailed test
      of α = 0.05 and 1 - ß = 0.8, 52 patients were required.

      The placebo drug which is identical to azathioprine will be provided by Celltrion drug
      company.

      Differences in the categorical variables between the groups are examined with χ2 or the
      Fisher exact test. For comparisons of continuous variables, a Student t test is used.
