      I. Determine clinical response rates in patients with advanced melanoma treated with
      gp100:209-217(210M) melanoma vaccine and low-dose interleukin-2.

      II. Assess response duration and progression-free intervals in these patients receiving this
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on
      day 1 and interleukin-2 SC on days 1-5 and 8-13. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR)
      receive 3 additional courses after achieving CR.

      Patients are followed every 9 weeks for 3 years or until disease recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
