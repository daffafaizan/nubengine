    
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for 25% of
      all childhood malignancies. Treatment of childhood ALL has a high success rate, with
      long-term event-free survival of >85%. Treatment success, however, has not come without cost.
      Recognition of long-term health problems related to childhood cancer therapies is growing.
      Both during and after therapy, children treated for ALL are at risk for fatigue, reduced
      physical activity, poor dietary intake, and excessive weight gain, which are driven by
      physiological (chemotherapy-induced) changes and social (home/environmental) factors. The
      goals of this pilot study are to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      efficacy of a parent-targeted, phone-delivered nutrition and physical activity program to
      prevent unhealthy weight gain among 60 childhood ALL survivors, 4-10 years of age.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the phone-delivered parent-targeted
      nutrition and physical activity intervention or a standard-of-care control group.
      Intervention success will be benchmarked by changes in key weight-related behaviors (physical
      activity and dietary intake) over the 6-month trial, and initial impact of the intervention
      on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, fatigue, and body composition will be
      examined.
