    
      A Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an antibody conditioning regimen,
      known as JSP191, in patients with SCID undergoing blood stem cell transplantation. Blood Stem
      Cell transplantation offers the only potentially curative therapy for SCID.

      The biological conditioning regimen, JSP191, is an antibody that binds to CD117. CD117 is the
      receptor for Stem Cell Factor on blood forming cells. CD117 binding to Stem Cell Factor is
      critical for survival and maintenance of blood forming stem cells. The binding of JSP191 to
      CD117 blocks CD117 from binding to Stem Cell Factor on blood forming stem cells. In the
      absence of CD117/Stem Cell Factor binding, hematopoietic stem cells that are currently
      occupying the bone marrow niches in SCID patients are depleted.
