      (split-course or with a concomitant boost) improves the locoregional control rate over
      standard fractionation radiotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the
      head and neck. II. Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients
      treated with different radiotherapy fractionation schemes. III. Determine the acute and late
      toxicities of each fractionation schedule. IV. Compare the quality of life on the two
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Irradiation of primary tumor and involved and
      at-risk nodal areas using linear accelerators with photon energies of 1.25-6.0 MV (dual
      energy arrangements may also use a beam greater than 6.0 MV), electrons of 4-25 MV, or Co60.
      Standard fractionation. Arm II: Radiotherapy. Targets and equipment as in Arm I.
      Hyperfractionation. Arm III: Radiotherapy. Targets and equipment as in Arm I. Accelerated
      split-course hyperfractionation. Arm IV: Radiotherapy. Targets and equipment as in Arm I.
      Accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,080 patients (270/arm) will be accrued over 5.75 years. If
      excessive toxicity is noted in any arm after entry of 324 and 634 patients, that arm may be
      closed.
