    
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of (A) 2 weeks
      of high dose of ribavirin ("loading", ≥26 mg/kg/day for 14 days followed by ≥13 mg/kg/day)
      followed by concentration targeted (≥ 2.5 mg/L (10.25 μmol/L) 28 days after initiation of
      ribavirin therapy) dosing of ribavirin vs. (B) 4 weeks of ribavirin dosing before initiation
      of PEG-interferon dosing ("priming", ≥13 mg/kg/day) followed by concentration targeted (≥ 2.5
      mg/L (10.25 μmol/L) 28 days after initiation of ribavirin therapy) dosing of ribavirin in
      combination with peginterferon alpha-2a in interferon naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C
      (CHC) virus genotype 1 infection as compared to (C) standard-of-care dosing of ribavirin (≥13
      mg/kg/day without monitoring of ribavirin concentrations) in combination with peginterferon
      alpha-2a.
