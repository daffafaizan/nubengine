      given through intact human skull to brain tumor in up to ten (10) subjects. These subjects
      will be followed over a 3-month period with contrast MRI and clinical exams.

      The objectives are:

        1. To evaluate the safety of ExAblate TcMRgFUS treatment delivered through intact human
           skull to the brain, during the treatment, and during the follow-up period of 3 months.

        2. To evaluate the effect of thermal ablation in the target tumor with contrast MR imaging
           to identify viable tumor, and non-viable thermally ablated tissue.
