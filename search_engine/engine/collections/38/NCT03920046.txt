      procedure, the anesthetist is obtained a medical history and carried out a physical
      examination and clinical assesment. Then the parents smoking habits are documented about to
      detect the magnitude of passive smoking. Endoscopist and anesthesiologist are blinded to the
      patients passive smoking history. Then the sedation is applied and esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      procedures performed. Side effects (e.g laryngospasm, coughing) during the study are
      recorded.
