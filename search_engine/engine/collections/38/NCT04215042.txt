      patients undergoing imaging diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (contrast-induced acute
      kidney injury, CI-AKI). Extracellular volume expansion at the time of contrast media
      administration may represent important protective strategies that play a major role in the
      prevention CI-AKI.

      Bio-impedance analysis is an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate tool for evaluating a patient's
      hydration status, and can be performed at the bedside within minutes [Maioli, Journal of
      American College Cardiology 1014;63:1387-94]. In this study we defined patients with "lower
      fluid status" with high risk of CI-AKI (Male with resistance/ height ratio > 315 Ohm/meter
      and Female > 380 Ohm/meter). Bio-impedance analysis IVA may represent the optimal tool to
      monitor the adequacy of volume expansion and protective strategy delivery.

      Infusing a standardized amount of fluid before the procedure may not result in the same
      effects in all patients. Moreover, standardized fluid infusion for 24 hours in patients that
      present with "normal fluid status" assessed by the bioimpedance analysis, can represent a too
      expensive preventive option both in terms of care and discomfort for the patient. In this
      study we analyze the possibility of a non-inferiority preventive protocol that involves a
      lower infusion of saline solution with a shorter administration time.
