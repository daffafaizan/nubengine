      health problem in low-income countries. Supplementing mothers with certain individual
      micronutrients has been shown to confer health benefits, although the evidence is not clear
      for multiple micronutrients. We aim to test, in a cluster-randomized, double-masked,
      controlled trial whether giving a daily multiple micronutrient supplement (similar in
      composition to the UNICEF antenatal supplement) will enhance infant survival and birth
      outcomes such as birth weight and gestational duration in a rural population in Bangladesh.
      Over the duration of 2-3 years a community-surveillance in the northwestern, rural Districts
      of Gaibandha and Southern Rangpur, the trial plans to identify and recruit 45,000 pregnant
      women based on 5-weekly histories of amenorrhea confirmed by urine-testing, and supplement
      them with either a multiple micronutrient supplement or an iron-folic acid supplement (as the
      standard of care control for pregnancy) and monitor pregnancy health, birth outcomes and
      vital status and health of liveborn infants through 6 months of age. In a ~3% sub-sample of
      mothers, additional measures of nutritional and health status will be evaluated in the 1st
      and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, and at 3 months postpartum (with infants), that include
      anthropometric and body composition (bioelectrical impedance) assessment, collection of
      biospecimens (eg, phlebotomy and breast milk sampling for micronutrient and other analyte
      concentration determinations), and other clinical assessments. The trial will generate
      evidence from which to examine the safety and efficacy of an antenatal through postnatal
      maternal micronutrient supplement intervention in order to inform and guide antenatal
      nutrition policies and programs in South Asia.
