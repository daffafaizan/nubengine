    
      We will utilize a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois (BCBSIL), a highly
      supportive wellness partner, with a strong history of investment in the health of its
      employees and subscribers. The combined Activity/Dietary (AD) intervention is administered by
      health professionals trained in motivational interviewing as healthy lifestyle coaches.

      Over the first 6 months, the coaches provide:

        -  individualized counseling based on a comprehensive assessment of baseline clinical,
           functional and behavioral factors that are barriers to healthy physical activity and
           dietary behaviors

        -  group education, the content of which is modeled after the highly successful Diabetes
           Prevention Program physical activity/dietary intervention, and customized for those with
           knee symptoms.

      Follow-up assessments continue for 6 additional months.

      Specific aims are to:

        1. assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of the JointADventure
           intervention at this worksite

        2. estimate the effectiveness of the intervention to decrease body weight, improve dietary
           habits, and increase objectively-measured physical activity

        3. to improve objectively measured functional performance

        4. to improve self-reported arthritis-specific and generic health status and health utility
