      Impairments in cardiac performance are major contributors to hearts from otherwise eligible
      organ donors not being transplanted. Deficiencies in pituitary hormones (including thyroid
      stimulating hormone) may contribute to hemodynamic instability and replacement of thyroid
      hormone has been proposed as a means of improving stability and increasing hearts available
      for transplantation. Intravenous thyroxine is commonly used in donor management. However,
      small controlled trials have not been able to demonstrate efficacy.

      Methods: This multicenter study will involve organ procurement organizations (OPOs) across
      the country. A total of 800 heart-eligible brain dead organ donors who require vasopressor
      support will be randomly assigned to intravenous thyroxine for at least 12-hours or saline
      placebo. The primary study hypothesis is that thyroxine treatment results in more hearts
      transplanted. Additional outcome measures are time to achieve hemodynamic stability (weaning
      off vasopressors) and improvement in cardiac ejection fraction on echocardiography.

      Discussion: This will be the largest randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of
      thyroid hormone treatment for organ donor management. By collaborating across multiple OPOs,
      it will be able to enroll an adequate number of donors and be powered to definitively answer
      the critical question of whether treatment increases hearts transplanted and/or provides
      other hemodynamic benefits.
