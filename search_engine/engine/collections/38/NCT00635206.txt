      acceptance of and adherence to positive pressure therapy in participants who are newly
      diagnosed with OSA and who meet objective criteria for PAP failure during their initial
      encounter with CPAP in the sleep laboratory.

      This hypothesis will be tested using a two-arm, randomized, double-blind design. Participants
      failing to tolerate CPAP therapy in the sleep laboratory during their titration night will be
      randomized to a BiPAP速 Auto with Bi-Flex速 titration or a CPAP titration night in the lab.
      Participants will then go home with their respective therapy for three months.
