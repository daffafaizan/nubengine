      Medical device (Vectraplex by VectraCor ltd) in patients who are undergoing cardiac
      investigations. This technology is based on the principle of vector ECG and an analysing
      system that computes a composite score termed a Cardiac Electrical Biomarker (CEB TM).

      CEB has been validated in the detection of STEMI with high sensitivity and specificity in the
      detection ECG changes characteristic to STEMI. The CEB may be a more accurate way of
      identifying heart injury and causes of chest pain compared to standard tests, which could
      lead to faster diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

      The diagnostic utility of the CEBTM in the following:

        1. Acute chest pain assessment in the A&E department.

        2. Acute chest pain assessment in the Primary Care Surgery.

        3. Performance of CEB during inducible ischaemia in patients with stable angina

        4. Performance of CEB during acute ischaemia in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
           intervention (PCI)

        5. Performance of CEB in patients undergoing cardio-toxic treatment
