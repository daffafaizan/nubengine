      patients, effective pain management strategies also facilitate day case surgery. Regional
      anaesthetic techniques, and paravertebral blocks in particular, are valuable in this sphere.
      The conventional method of administering this block is blind and depends on anatomical
      landmarks for placement. Performing the block under US guidance provides real time imaging
      while advancing the needle. This might allow for a more accurate placement and hence a more
      effective block which would enhance pain relief and minimise complications.
