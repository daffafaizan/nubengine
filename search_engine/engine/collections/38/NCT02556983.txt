      original 2-mSv images. Second, the readers will review the 75%-dose images. After the readers
      review the 75%-dose images and before the readers reviewed the 50%-dose images, the
      non-inferiority of 75% dose to the original dose will be tested. If the non-inferiority is
      not accepted, the study will be terminated with the conclusion of 2 mSv as the lowest
      acceptable dose. If the non-inferiority is accepted, the study will be continue to the next
      step. In the same manner, the readers will review the next lower-dose images (50% and then
      25%), and then the noninferiority will be tested against the original dose.
