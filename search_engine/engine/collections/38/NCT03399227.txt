      fragility fractures. Deteriorated bone architecture has been shown by high resolution
      computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in kidney and lung transplantation recipients. In liver
      transplantation (LeTx) recipients, bone microarchitecture has only been evaluated using the
      trabecular bone score in a retrospective cohort study; a degraded or partially degraded
      microarchitecture was detected in most of the patients.

      Aim: The aim of this project is to compare LeTx recipients' bone microarchitecture with
      healthy controls and to evaluate patients' changes within one year after transplantation.

      Methods: HR-pQCT scans of the distal radius and tibia as well as areal bone mineral density
      measurement of the lumbar spine and hip region will be performed before Tx, 1 and 12 months
      after Tx in 50 patients. Anabolic and catabolic markers of bone turnover (sclerostin,
      dickkopf 1, periostin) and traditional bone turnover markers will be evaluated
      preoperatively, on the day of surgery, and 4 times within the first year after LeTx. In
      healthy age- and sex-matched controls HR-pQCT, bone mineral density and laboratory parameters
      will be assessed once.

      Hypotheses: Based on the HR-pQCT data of kidney and lung transplantation recipients and the
      trabecular bone score of LeTx recipients, the investigators hypothesize that LeTX recipients
      have deteriorated bone microarchitecture.

      Expected outcome: Since bone fragility is not only determined by BMD but bone architecture as
      well, HR-pQCT data give important information on the patients' bone fragility. The knowledge
      of the course of bone microarchitecture after liver transplantation may help to develop
      strategies preventing fragility fractures in LeTx recipients.
