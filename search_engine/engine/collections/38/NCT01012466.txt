      24-48 hours of giving birth, and 4-8 weeks postpartum. The questionnaires will measure pain
      catastrophizing, depression, maternal support, support and control in birth, and childbirth
      satisfaction. Chart review following delivery will record data such as length of labor,
      medication used, need for augmentation or surgical delivery, complications.
