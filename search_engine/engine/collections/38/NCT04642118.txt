      surgery don't know the allocation. Women will be randomizes in to 3 group: PRM 30 cmH2O, 40
      cmH2O and control

      After laparoscopic surgery has finished in operator room (before moving off trocar), woman
      all group will be set in Trenderlenberg position (Tilted head low) and then surgeon will
      compress abdomen to release residual gas after operation about 2 minutes.

      The patients in group of using Pulmonary Recruitment Maneuver will be received positive
      pressure from balloon bag from anesthesiologist 5 times of setting pressure [30 cmH2O, 40
      cmH2O], 5 seconds per time to increase indirect abdominal pressure to release residual gas

      After surgery at 12, 24 and 48 hours, patients will be follow up and evaluate shoulder and
      wound pain. Chest X-ray will be done to evaluate residual pneumoperitoneum and lung
      complication. GI discomfort, administered additional analgesics and time to hospital staying
      will be evaluated and recorded.
