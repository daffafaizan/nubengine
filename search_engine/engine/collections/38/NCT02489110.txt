      cope with caregiving, alleviate related distress, and improve their quality of life.

      The investigators are evaluating different materials, which may provide caregiving
      strategies, practical tips and help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding
      tasks of caregiving, alleviate related stress, and improve quality of life.

      Research Program Steps:

        1. Caregivers will be asked some simple questions about themselves and their family members
           to see if they are eligible for the project (fill out Enrollment Form and Informed
           Consent).

        2. A Program survey will be sent, which can be completed online, or returned in a
           pre-mailed envelope.

        3. Participants will receive links to online resources, related materials and instructions.
           The investigators ask participants to access the online resources, read provided
           brochures and guides, and follow the instructions. Materials are expected to help
           participants in their caregiver role.

        4. After completing the program, the second and final survey should be filled out online or
           returned by pre-mailed envelope.
