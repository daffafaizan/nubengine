      invasiveness, and low risk of adverse effects. However, there is insufficient evidence of the
      effectiveness on this treatment technique on decreasing pain and increasing range of motion.
      This project aims to help fill the gaps by using a larger sample size and clear methodology.

      The aims of the study include to determine if both static and dynamic cupping therapy have a
      greater effect on BROM, PPT, ASLR, and NRPS as compared to stretching, and if any changes
      made are maintained to a different degree over a 24 hour period based on treatment.
      Additional aims of the study include to determine if there is a difference between type of
      cupping (static vs dynamic) on these four measures. By performing this study, scientific
      knowledge of cupping therapy will be improved and expanded, thus impacting how it is used in
      clinical practice.
