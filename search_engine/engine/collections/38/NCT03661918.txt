      conducted between study staff and parents of children ages 8 - 12 who are in the 85th
      percentile or higher on the BMI scale. The sessions will focus on healthy habits and positive
      reinforcement for behavior changes within the house that could lead to a reduction in the the
      child's BMI. In addition to the 10 core sessions, some participants will have difference
      components of the intervention added to their treatment: conducting the first session
      in-person, having a second caregiver participate in some of the coaching calls, and/or having
      the child use a wifi-enabled scale for weekly weigh-ins.
