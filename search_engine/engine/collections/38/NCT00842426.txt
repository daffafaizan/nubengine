      diabetes. Obese individuals with pre-diabetes (defined as impaired fasting glucose or
      impaired glucose tolerance) are at high risk for progression to diabetes. A vast majority of
      these individuals also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of
      concomitant risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood
      pressure. Intensive lifestyle interventions that focus on dietary change, physical activity,
      and behavior modification have demonstrated efficacy in achieving and maintaining clinically
      significant (>5%) weight loss in populations of patients with pre-diabetes. However, the
      effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, generalizability, and sustainability of such interventions
      in routine primary care settings remain unknown, and rigorous clinical research is needed.

      The primary hypothesis for the E-LITE Study is that the CM intervention will reduce BMI more
      than the SM intervention, which in turn will reduce BMI more than usual care, over 15 months.
      Secondarily, we hypothesize that, compared with usual care, intervention participants will be
      associated with greater improvements in waist circumference, lipids, blood pressure, blood
      glucose, lifestyle behaviors, and psychosocial well-being. In addition, we will examine the
      durability of weight loss and behavioral change in the months after the initial 3-month
      intensive stage.
