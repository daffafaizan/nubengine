      detailed localization of language functions in the brain. We propose to test the ability of
      rTMS to locate the substrate of visual naming to a limited area of the temporal lobe in
      patients with temporal lobe epilepsy before and after surgical resections. The study is
      expected to yield information on the organization of language in the temporal lobes and how
      unilateral temporal lobe lesions and lobectomy cause relocation of language mechanisms in the
      lesioned and in the other hemisphere. It will also be a preliminary step in the development
      of a clinically useful procedure for locating critical language areas in potential surgical
      candidates.
