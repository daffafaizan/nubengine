      likely to be caused by adhesions from previous abdominal surgery. Chronic abdominal pain was
      defined as continues or intermittent abdominal pain of at least six months' duration. After
      excluding other pathology (see exclusion criteria) included patients underwent a diagnostic
      laparoscopy to confirm the adhesions and to exclude serious morbidity not visible with other
      diagnostics. If during laparoscopy adhesions were the only pathology present, patients were
      randomly assigned either to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment. For the randomization
      and surgical procedures the investigators refer to the original article. Patients were
      unaware of their treatment assignment and the outcome assessment was blinded. Abdominal pain
      and quality of life (QOL) were assessed pre-operatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months of
      follow-using a visual analog scale (VAS), verbal rating pain change score (VRCS) and the
      short form 36 (SF-36). After twelve months randomization was disclosed and placebo group
      patients with persisting abdominal pain could request laparoscopic adhesiolysis. After twelve
      year follow-up pain, QOL, medical history and analgesic intake were analyzed to assess the
      long term effects of laparoscopic adhesiolysis.
