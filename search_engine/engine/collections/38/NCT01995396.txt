      mesorectal excision is the gold standard. Colon is anastomosed to the ano-rectum.The
      potential risks are bad bowel function with fecal incontinence or a lifethreatening
      anastomotic dehiscence, especially in patients with severe co-morbidity or reduced general
      condition.Tumours in the low rectum are usually treated with an abdominoperineal resection
      where the whole anus is radically excised and a permanent colostomy is created.

      For patients with incontinence and/or severe comorbidity, Hartmann´s procedure has often been
      performed. The rectum is resected, the lower part is transected with a stapler and a
      colostomy is created. During recent years there has been reports on high rates of pelvic
      abscesses after Hartmann´s. An alternative has been proposed, namely the abdominoperineal
      excision (APE) with intersphincteric dissection leaving the outer sphincter and levator
      muscles in place, thus creating a much lesser perineal wound that also tend to heal better
      when the ano-pelvic muscles are left in place.

      There have been some small retrospective studies comparing postoperative complications after
      Hartmann´s with anterior resections or the classic abdominoperineal excision. These studies
      are heterogenous and not balanced and no conclusions can be drawn. There are no data on APE
      with intersphincteric dissection in rectal cancer patients.

      There is a need to clarify what procedure is most suited for patients with rectal cancer and
      fecal incontinence and / or severe comorbidity.

      For this patient group we intend to randomize between Hartmann´s procedure and APE with
      intersphincteric dissection.
