      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended dose of trastuzumab when given with cetuximab in patients with
           metastatic pancreatic cancer that progressed after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
           (Phase I)

        -  Evaluate the objective response rate as assessed by RECIST criteria. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety profile as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of trastuzumab followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
