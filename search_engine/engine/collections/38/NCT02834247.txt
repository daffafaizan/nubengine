      and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab.
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1), a potential nivolumab fixed dose
      cohort, and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

        -  Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors

        -  Potential Nivolumab Fixed Dose Cohort

        -  Part 2: Metastatic TNBC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab
      (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will
      be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately
      12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS follow-up
      of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS follow-up
      of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.
