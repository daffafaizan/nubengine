      castration resistant prostate cancer patients. A previous study has shown that the biweekly
      administration of docetaxel in 1st line setting of mCRPC is better tolerated than docetaxel
      administered every three weeks. Also, the efficacy of biweekly docetaxel was better than
      three-weekly docetaxel and biweekly dosing presented a significant overall survival benefit
      (ASCO 2011, Kellokumpu-Lehtinen et al. As the occurrence of neutropenia in the TROPIC trial
      was rather high, the hypothesis is to reduce the incidence of severe adverse events by
      administrating cabazitaxel more frequently, yet maintaining the same dose intensity as in
      every three weeksÂ´ dosing schedule.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of biweekly cabazitaxel for the treatment of 60
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients previously
      treated with docetaxel containing regimen.
