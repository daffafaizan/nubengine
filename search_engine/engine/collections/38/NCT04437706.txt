      active, undiagnosed COVID-19 cases and/or determine the spread or distribution of active
      infection. The objective is to use a network targeted sampling design to direct testing to
      yield a higher proportion of results which indicate active infection and possibly
      differentiating between venues or communities where transmission is active and undiagnosed.

      Study activities: A person who tests positive for COVID-19 will be given a set of "tokens" to
      give to contacts that will entitle these contacts to make an appointment to receive a test
      for COVID-19.

      Population groups: The population group will include people with index cases of COVID-19 and
      their contacts for the past 14 days. As these contacts are tested and receive positive
      results, they will be given tokens to hand out to their contacts over the past 14 days. The
      network of positive cases will "blossom" to reveal community transmission and asymptomatic
      cases, thus giving researchers an indication of disease prevalence.

      Data analysis: At the completion of each epoch and at the end of the study, we will scale the
      social networks up and conduct network analysis using SAS and the igraph package in R. These
      analyses will be applied in an ongoing manner to guide selection of seeds in subsequent
      epochs to ensure representativeness and to guide selection of alters to encourage longer
      referral chain lengths.

      Risk/safety issues: The primary risks include discomfort from the nasal swab and risks from
      the venous blood draw used in testing and the potential loss of confidentiality. All efforts
      will be made to securely manage the data to ensure participant confidentiality.
