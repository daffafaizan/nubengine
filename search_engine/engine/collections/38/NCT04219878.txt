      testing promotion components among African-American or black and Hispanic or Latino gay,
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), the study "Implementation of Rapid HIV
      Self-Testing among MSM Project", known as iSTAMP, is being conducted in 11 US states. This
      study is interested in the most cost-effective ways to recruit men at high risk for HIV
      infection. The researchers want to study a sample of 3600 sexually active adult men who have
      sex with men (MSM) who are not known to be living with HIV; 1800 black/African-American and
      1800 Hispanic/Latino men will be enrolled.

      All participants will be mailed two rapid HIV self-test kits upon randomization. All
      participants, regardless of study arm, will also complete a follow-up survey at the end of a
      4-month follow-up period. At the end of the 4-month follow-up period, participants will be
      mailed a dried blood spot (DBS) collection kit for research purposes, as well as another
      rapid HIV self-test kit for immediate testing. Participants in each of the arms will have
      access to videoconferencing-delivered prevention counseling, and all participants, regardless
      of assigned arm, will be contacted if they report seroconversion and/or a preliminary
      positive test during the study period for active linkage to care.
