      investigators will observe whether cefuroxime can replace tetracycline like amoxicillin, on
      the other hand, the investigators will observe whether it can reduce the rate of adverse
      effects caused by tetracycline and avoid the allergy of penicillin. If the experiment is
      successful, it will provide an effective and safe second-line treatment for the majority of
      patients with failed treatment of Helicobacter pylori.
