      improves morbidity and mortality outcomes. It is estimated that four million valve
      replacement procedures have been performed over the last 50 years and it remains the only
      definitive treatment for most patients with advanced heart valve disease.1 Patients who
      received mechanical heart valves (MHV) had a significantly lower mortality, higher cumulative
      incidence of bleeding and, in some age groups, stroke than did recipients of a biologic
      prosthesis. In addition, MHV demands lifelong anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists
      (VKA), most commonly warfarin, due to the high thrombogenicity of the prosthesis. Even with
      the appropriate use of therapy, there is a high incidence of thromboembolic events: 1% to 4%
      per year. Furthermore, bleeding risk is significant, ranging from 2% to 9% per year.4 Indeed,
      variability in the international normalized ratio (INR) is a major independent predictor of
      reduced survival in patients with MHV.5 Due to the narrow therapeutic index, interactions,
      genetic variants, and need for blood monitoring of patients taking VKAs, alternatives to
      warfarin have now been made available: specifically, inhibitors that directly target Factor
      IIa (dabigatran) or Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).6 RE-ALIGN was a prospective,
      randomized, phase 2, open-label trial that randomized 252 patients within a 2:1 unblinded
      fashion to either dabigatran or warfarin, with patients stratified according to interval
      since replacement (within three to seven days in population A; >three months in population
      B). Unfortunately, the trial was terminated prematurely because of an excess of
      thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. The negative
      results of this study can be explained by the selection of 50 ng/mL as the target dabigatran
      trough level, the possibility of this drug inducing downstream effects on the coagulation
      cascade that impair its ability to blunt the postoperative hypercoagulable state relative to
      warfarin and the inclusion of early postoperative patients (population A) since it is a phase
      of high incidence of thromboembolic events.

      On the other hand, rivaroxaban has already been tested in experimental9 and animal models10
      with encouraging results. According to these findings, the investigators hypothesized that a
      direct Factor Xa inhibitor could be evaluated in patients with MHV for prevention of
      thromboembolic events.
