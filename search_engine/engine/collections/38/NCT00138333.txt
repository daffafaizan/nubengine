      greater than or equal to 32 weeks and less than 37 weeks gestation and birth weight greater
      than or equal to 2000 grams but less than 3000 grams, who receive the routine birth dose of
      Hepatitis B immunization containing ethyl mercury in the form of thimerosal and the birth
      dose of BCG immunization, and to evaluate the excretion of mercury in these newborns by
      examining mercury levels in stool and urine. Secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the
      half-time of mercury in blood following vaccination of premature and low birth weight infants
      with thimerosal-containing vaccines, and 2) to screen premature and low birth weight infants
      for evidence of early effects of thimerosal on the kidney by measurement of urinary gamma
      glutamyl transpeptidase levels. All infants will have stool, urine, and blood samples
      collected prior to receipt of routine birth hepatitis B and BCG immunization. Cord blood will
      serve as the baseline blood specimen. Each infant will be seen once at a predetermined
      follow-up visit time point. There will be 6 follow-up visit time points, with sampling from
      12 infants at each time point. All infants will provide blood, urine, and stool specimens at
      the assigned follow-up visit.
