      adolescents (age 15-17 years) and young adults (age 20-25 years). Twenty subjects will be
      studied in each group. All subjects must meet criteria for ADHD, combined type and be either
      treatment naïve or currently taking and responding well to Concerta. Child and adolescent
      patients taking Concerta will have their current levels of ADHD symptoms assessed with the
      Dupaul ADHD rating scale (11); adults taking Concerta will be assessed with Conners Adult
      ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS). Patients whose symptoms are in remission as evidenced by scores in
      the normal range on these scales may proceed directly to the neuroimaging portion of the
      study. Subjects who are treatment naïve or are treated but are not in remission shall under a
      three week open label trial of Concerta to determine the optimal dose for treatment of their
      symptoms.

      Subjects will have two fMRI sessions on different days. During each fMRI session, they will
      perform both the Stop Signal Task and the Emotional Conflict Resolution Task . On the morning
      of the scan, placebo and Concerta will be administered in a double-blind, crossover design,
      with order of medication and placebo randomized. The scan sessions will take place between 3
      and 7 hours after medication administration. After each scan, the subject and a research
      assistant will go to a quiet room in the imaging center; the subjects will be given
      arithmetic level set at a level of difficulty that the subject has mastered. The subject will
      be given 15 minutes to complete as many problems as possible.
