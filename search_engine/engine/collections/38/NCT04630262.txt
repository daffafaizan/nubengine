    
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate functional responder
      rates with an objective performance criteria (OPC) of 85% as measured by the KOOS
      questionnaire for the first 225 tibia (CR FB and PS FB combined) implanted with the ATTUNE
      Cementless FB tray (primary and revision procedures) and will be analyzed when these patients
      have passed the 1 year preferred post-op window. Study success will be determined using the
      primary TKA (CR FB and PS FB combined) analysis group.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to establish the surgical effectiveness of the
      ATTUNE Cementless Tibial Base and Cementless Patella by evaluating type and frequency of
      Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies, functional responder rates with an objective
      performance criteria (OPC) of 85% as measured by the KOOS questionnaire for all subjects (CR
      FB and PS FB combined) at the 1-year timepoint, the change from preoperative baseline to the
      6-week, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 5-year timepoints in functional outcomes and quality of
      life assessments, as measured using additional patient reported outcomes measures (PROMS),
      implant survivorship of the ATTUNE Cementless FB Tibial base and Cementless Patella using
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 1, 2 and 5-year timepoints, and investigator-conducted
      radiographic analysis of the tibial and patellar components at 6 weeks/6 months 1, 2 and 5
      years after surgery.
