      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Assess time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess overall survival and 1-year survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open-label study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10 and oral imatinib mesylate
      once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
