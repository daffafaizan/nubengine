      sibling oocytes. The primary aim was to analyse possible differneces in embryo development
      (utilization rate) up to day 5/6. In this study, the investigators found a high difference in
      clinical pregnancy rate between both groups (46.4% versus 77.4%). Since this study was not
      powered to find differences in clincial pregnancy rates between both groups, this RCT was
      especially powered as a superiority trial to find differences in clincial pregnancy rates
      between both groups. On the day of oocyte retrieval, patients will be allocated to culture at
      one of both temperatures.
