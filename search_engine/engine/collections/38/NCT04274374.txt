      trial. Patients with axial SpA (n=200) will follow a 16-week GFD and be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to an experimental or control arm. In the experimental arm with receive at least 6
      gluten-free breads per day + 200 g of gluten-free penne pasta per week + 6 rice flavor
      capsules per day. The control arm will receive at least 6 gluten-containing breads per day +
      200 g of gluten-containing penne pasta per week + 6 vital gluten-containing capsules per day.

      At baseline, the dietician will explain to the patients how to properly follow a GFD during a
      face-to-face interview. The patient's compliance to the GFD will be evaluated by the
      dietician at S2, S16, an S24 using an online 3-day alimentary questionnaire.

      The bread and penne pasta were chosen for their visual resemblance and similar taste to
      maximize the blindness of the study. In order to reach the daily amount of gluten in a
      standard diet (estimated in France between 10 and 15 g/d) in the control arm, each day
      patients will have to ingest six capsules of vital gluten wheat made for the study. Vital
      gluten flour is an over-the-counter food supplement used to enrich a protein diet or as a
      base for making products, such as seitan. Capsules will be made using commercially available
      vital gluten and contain 0.35 g of gluten per capsule. The total amount of gluten in the
      control arm will be approximately 10.5 g/day.

      After the 16-week GFD, patients will be offered to follow or not follow the GFD according to
      their own decision for an 8-week open-labelled follow-up period. The study duration for each
      patient is 24 weeks. The patient recruitment is expected to last 2 years
