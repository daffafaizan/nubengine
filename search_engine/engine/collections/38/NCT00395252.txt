      with resected pancreatic cancer. The optimal therapy regimen has yet to be determined.

      Based on the experiences with cetuximab (ErbituxÂ®)and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic
      cancer and with gemcitabine as adjuvant therapy, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
      feasibility of the combined treatment of cetuximab and gemcitabine in patients with R0 or
      R1-resectable pancreatic cancer and to evaluate if the disease free survival can be increased
      by the addition of an EGFR-targeted therapy.
