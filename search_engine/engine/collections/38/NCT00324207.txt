      predicting the development and severity of autoimmune diabetes and monitoring the success of
      islet transplants. Currently there are no reliable indicators readily available.

      Insulin mRNA in the white cell fraction of blood has been detected or elevated under several
      circumstances including:

        1. normal animals

        2. after islet cell transplantation

        3. hyperglycemic induced expression and

        4. during induction of diabetes with streptozotocin

      The investigators propose that quantitative measurement of insulin mRNA may be an accurate,
      innovative and minimally invasive indicator of beta cell destruction.
