    
      Study Objectives Primary: To compare change in Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) episodes at
      2 month follow-up on voiding diaries between hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy groups (to
      determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective and durable in treating UUI as
      pharmacotherapy)

      Secondary Analyses:

        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective in treating UUI as
           pharmacotherapy comparing change in UUI episodes on voiding diary at 6 and 12 month
           follow-up

        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy differs from pharmacotherapy in treating UUI comparing
           change in questionnaire results and urinary frequency

        -  enrolled following administration of the Overactive Bladder (OAB) Awareness tool.
           Participants will keep voiding diaries then be randomized to either pharmacotherapy and
           conventional behavioral therapy or hypnotherapy and conventional behavioral therapy.
           Approximately 150-160 women will be randomized.

      Randomization will occur using a computer-generated randomization scheme in varying permuted
      block sizes. Study personnel performing data entry will be masked to participants' treatment.
      Masking participants to treatment is not feasible. Participants will be followed at 2,6 & 12
      months. Measurements will be performed before treatment, following completion of treatment
      visits (approximately 8 weeks), and at 6 and 12 months. Primary analysis will be intention to
      treat. Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes will also be performed.

      Study Visits: UUI participant screening: Study information given. Screening questionnaire
      given. Visit 1 Enrollment: Formal screening for eligibility, voiding diary reviewed, if
      eligible, written consent obtained with administration of study questionnaires, demographic
      and past medical history administration forms, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q)
      exam & hypnotic susceptibility testing scheduled. Pariticipants undergo hypnotic
      susceptibility testing prior to randomization. Participants randomized to treatment and
      contacted, treatments arranged. Hypnotherapy group: undergo weekly treatments over 8 weeks.
      Pharmacotherapy group: weekly counseling sessions over 8 week: Following hypnotherapy or
      medication counseling completion, f/u voiding diaries collected & study questionnaires
      administered. One of two long acting anti-cholinergic medications offered (Long acting
      Tolterodine or Extended Release Oxybutynin or equivalent generic substitutes).

      6 & 12 month follow-up: Pharmacotherapy subjects receive medications for 1 year and
      Hypnotherapy subjects encouraged to continue self-hypnosis for 1 year with assistance of
      audio-recordings, with 1 optional hypnotherapy session between 6-12 months..

      Participants informed pharmacotherapy & hypnotherapy sessions are audio-recorded and reviewed
      ensuring manual of procedures are followed.
