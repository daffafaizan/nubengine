    
      Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial tumor in childhood but prognosis is still
      poor, even with the advances in its treatment.

      New therapeutic strategies have been examined, and several immunotherapeutic approaches,
      including combined therapy with monoclonal antibodies (anti-GD2), intravenous interleukin-2
      (Il-2) and intravenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and
      anti-idiotype vaccines are currently being assessed.

      Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype antibody capable of inducing anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibodies
      in patients with neuroblastoma.

      The expression of the ganglioside N-glycolyl GM3 was shown in neuroblastoma and this
      expression could be useful as a specific target for immunotherapy.

      Ractoumomab will be administered once standard therapy for neuroblastoma has been completed.
