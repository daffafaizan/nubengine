      patient outcome and morbidity. Currently, there is some controversy surrounding the over and
      under-resuscitation and endpoints of resuscitation using older fluid resuscitation formulas
      in patients with burn injury. The NICOM has been used in the resuscitation of patients with
      sepsis. The NICOM will be used in patients with burn injury to determine the patient's fluid
      responsiveness and the need for additional fluid boluses versus medications to increase the
      patient's blood pressure.
