      venous congestion in the RL graft may result in impaired graft regeneration, immediate liver
      dysfunction, and graft loss even in a liver graft of adequate size [2]. To overcome this
      problem, Lee et al. [3] introduced the concept of modified RL graft in which the branches of
      the middle hepatic vein (MHV) was drained using interposition vascular grafts. Although, the
      issue of when and how the MHV branches should be drained has been controversial since then,
      reconstruction of segment 5 and 8 veins using an interposition graft has become a standard
      procedure during RL LDLT. The vascular graft of choice in this procedure has been
      cryopreserved homologous vein graft, which provides excellent patency with low infection
      risk. However, such grafts are often unavailable, particularly in programs where deceased
      donors are scarce and surgeons must rely on synthetic grafts such as expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polyethylene terephthalate (DacronÂ®). Since we have
      developed an "intent-to-drain" policy in our LDLT program, we have been using Dacron grafts
      exclusively [4]. Although, complications such as early graft thrombosis, graft infection, and
      hollow viscous migration remain as major concerns, the safety and efficacy of both ePTFE and
      Dacron grafts in LDLT has been proven [5, 6]. However, to date, none of the previous studies
      have specifically compared these two different prosthetic materials, addressing graft patency
      and complication rates in patients undergoing LDLT. The aim of our study is to compare AS
      venous outflow reconstruction using ePTFE vs. Dacron grafts for their patency and infection
      rates and outcomes with respect to graft and patient survival in RL LDLT.
