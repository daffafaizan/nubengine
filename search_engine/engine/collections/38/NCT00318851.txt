      new strokes reported annually, of which 150,000 are fatal. Approximately 75% of strokes occur
      in the distribution of the carotid arteries. Among those, a thrombotic etiology (carotid
      occlusive disease) is one of the most common causes. Recently published studies have shown
      that patients who underwent carotid stenting in combination with a cerebral protection device
      had better overall outcomes as related to stroke, death and MI as opposed to carotid
      endarterectomy. What is not known is whether protection devices which allow some particles
      (100 micron particle size or less) to pass through the filter or particles that embolize
      during placement or removal of the protection device, will have any delayed abnormal outcomes
      as determined by neuropsychological testing.
