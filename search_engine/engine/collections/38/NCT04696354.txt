      previously undergone ablation for superficial of and/or perforator venous disease followed by
      at least 3 months of prescribed compression therapy prior to screening.

      There are 6 study visits for each subject that will be completed over a period lasting
      approximately 24 months. Subjects will undergo a baseline/screening assessment (visit 1)
      followed by an interrogation procedure (visit 2) if the subject is enrolled into the
      interrogation arm. If the subject is randomized to the deferred interrogation arm, he/she
      will have a hospital/office visit in lieu of the interrogation procedure, which will be
      considered visit 2. For statistical purposes, the wound assessment performed at the index
      procedure/hospital visit will be considered the baseline measurement. 30±14 days and 90±14
      days after Visit 2, the subject will return to the office for a 1- and 3-month follow-up
      visit, respectively. The subjects will return at 6- and 12-months post-index procedure/Visit
      2 for follow-up assessments. The follow-up period for this study will be approximately 24
      months, with a phone call only at 24-months post-index procedure/visit 2.

      The clinical study has a planned enrollment period of 36 months and a planned study duration
      period of 5.17 years
