    
      OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the impact, as indexed by BOLD response, of the administration of dopaminergic
      agonist (methylphenidate) on the pathophysiology of CD/ODD.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Youth with CD/ODD and typically developing (TD) youth.

      DESIGN:

      The study will involve a 2 session design (methylphenidate [MPH] vs. placebo). Patients with
      CD/ODD will participate in both sessions. TD youth will be tested for 2 sessions (no
      medication) to provide an index of typical task response. Activity within regions of interest
      identified from the TD youth will be used to determine whether MPH reduces differences in
      BOLD response in CD/ODD relative to TD youth. ICU scores and current ADHD symptomatology will
      be used as covariates to determine whether these variables moderate the putative increase in
      BOLD response in target regions in the patients with CD.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Principle dependent measures will be BOLD responses as measured through core tasks.
