      be followed by a specific treatment during three months. This treatment is expected to reduce
      prevalence of internet dependence and associated addictive disorders (alchohol, nicotine) .
      rate of sleep disorders is also expected to decrease under treatment.

      This is an open label randomized controlled trial, comparing two modes of treatment for
      internet addiction (gaming or gambling online) with sleep disorders associated.

      Patients will be randomised in two arms : controls (CBT treatment of Internet dependence) and
      intervention (CBT treatment of addiction plus CBT treatment of sleep disorders).
