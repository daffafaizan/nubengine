      intestinal barrier defects and chronic inflammation disorders. Polyphenols such as
      Proanthocyanidins may modulate the gut microbiota thereby providing beneficial effects on
      metabolic health. Inulin is a well known prebiotic that could stimulate growth of favorable
      bacteria in the gut.

      The overall goal is to determine the efficacy and synergy of a supplement of polyphenols from
      cranberry extract with or without a supplement of inulin from agaves to reduce chronic
      inflammation and endotoxemia and to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by
      modulating microbiota of overweight human subjects with metabolic syndrome symptoms.
