      and businessmen (born 1919-1934, n=3490), who participated in health check-ups between
      1964-1973, but since the beginning of 1970s it has developed into a clinico-epidemiological
      longitudinal study. Primary focus was on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but
      since 2000 focus has been shifting to geriatrics, and with its long follow-up (up to 50
      years) HBS can be seen as a "life-course" study. Traditional CVD risk factors are available
      from the 1960s and in 1974 participants (available n=3310) were divided in groups according
      to their clinical status and CVD risk. Two high-risk groups (n=1222) and low-risk group
      (n=593) participated in a 5-year multifactorial primary prevention study in 1974-1980
      (in-trial and post-trial results have been published in 1985 and 1991). The whole original
      cohort has been followed-up from national registers since 1985 and with regular questionnaire
      surveys since 2000. Random subcohorts have been studied clinically with laboratory and
      genetic examinations in 2003 and 2011. The latest questionnaire survey was performed in
      winter 2015 by which two thirds of the original cohort had died. Follow-up of the cohort is
      ongoing and new research questions formulated..
