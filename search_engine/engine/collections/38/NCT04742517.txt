    
      After a screening period of up to 28 days prior to study drug administration, eligible
      participants will be residential for a single period of 5 days/4 nights in Part 1: single
      ascending dose, and 11 days/10 nights in Part 2 multiple ascending dose.

      Part 1 is composed of 6 parallel cohorts (cohorts 1.1 to 1.6) and up to 2 optional cohorts
      (cohorts 1.7 and 1.8) of 8 healthy adult male and female subjects in each cohort. If the data
      from cohorts 1.1 to 1.6 are not sufficient to characterize safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics, up to 2 optional cohorts (cohorts 1.7 and 1.8) may be added.

      Part 2 is composed of 4 parallel cohorts (cohorts 2.1 to 2.4) and 1 optional cohort (cohort
      2.5) of 12 healthy adult male and female subjects in each cohort and 1 cohort (cohort 2.6) of
      12 healthy elderly male and female subjects. Dosing of the elderly cohort (cohort 2.6) will
      commence after having established the safety and tolerability of the corresponding dose
      tested in cohorts 2.1 to 2.5. If the data from cohorts 2.1 to 2.4 are not sufficient to
      characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, 1 optional cohort (cohort 2.5) may be
      added.
