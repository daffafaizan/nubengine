    
      Prior to screening activities, each subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions and
      to understand the details of study participation. Subjects who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and have signed an informed consent form will be considered enrolled into
      the study. After a subject is consented and enrolled in the study, data will be collected
      prior to any intervention or surgery at the following time points: a) Screening/Baseline b)
      Day 1 of Prehab c) Day 2 of Prehab d) Day 3 of Prehab e) Day 4 of Prehab, f) and any data
      collected immediately prior to an intervention or incision (in the case of a surgical
      patient)

      Subjects meeting eligibility criteria with planned tricuspid intervention will receive
      in-hospital optimization with THHBP's Prehab Protocol.

      Prehabilitation will consist of careful pre-intervention assessment and personalized
      optimization, guided by Investigator judgment, with a specific focus on right ventricular
      function. This will be done by using a detailed echo acquisition protocol (Appendix 1).
      Assessments will be collected according to the schedule of events below (Table 1.). Therapy
      will include intravenous milrinone therapy and aggressive diuresis with evaluation for
      clinical and functional signs of improvement, according to standard of care. If there are
      clinical and functional signs of improvement before Day 4, and the subject is ready for TV
      surgery or any other intervention, they will have Day 4 procedures performed. After the tests
      and evaluations are completed, the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigators will decide if
      the patient is a candidate for TV surgery or another intervention
