      disfiguring and disabling in severe cases. There is dysregulated immune response in psoriatic
      patients to unknown injurious agents with upregulation of Th1/Th17 pathways which is mediated
      via Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB). NFκB is a key player in psoriasis development; its
      activation and nuclear translocation is present in every step of the way of psoriasis
      starting from keratinocyte release of cytokines -in response to stress- to the maturation and
      activation of dendritic cells, to the continuous loop of T cell activation.

      Turmeric extract has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial and anti-carcinogenic
      effects. It has inhibitory effects on NF-κB and various cytokines production.

      In this clinical trial 5 groups of patients with mild to moderate psoriasis are recruited;
      group (A) Receiving the Turmeric extract based ointment only. Group (B) receiving Turmeric
      extract + olive oil based treatment. Group (C) will serve as negative control receiving only
      petrolatum base. Group (D) will receive NB UVB serving as positive control. Group (E) will
      receive established topical treatment serving as positive control.

      Each patient will be assessed on weekly bases clinically for the disease severity using PASI
      score and via dermatoscope. Histopathological evaluation (H& E along with NFkB expression
      analysis) will be done at 4 points of time baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks through the
      study.
