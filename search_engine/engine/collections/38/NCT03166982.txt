      rates between the two techniques. According to the literature of Garbin O.and al in 2012, the
      success rate of transvaginal puncture is generally 93.6%. The largest series of Gjelland al
      in 2005 and covers 302 consecutive patients with ATO who underwent triple antibiotic therapy
      and transvaginal puncture, the success rate was 93.4%. The failures that required surgical
      management have frequently revealed endometriosis or cancer. To support laparoscopic, Raiga
      and al in 1996 studied the support of 36 retrospectively patients who underwent laparoscopic
      incisional and wash the abscess with a success rate of 100%. Moreover Reich and al in 1987
      found 90% success on a review of 25 patients.

      The transvaginal echo guided puncture to replace the first laparoscopy because of its less
      invasive nature, this is a simple act, fast, possible under mild sedation, the cost is still
      lower than laparoscopy. Some uncontrolled retrospective studies suggest that laparoscopy
      remains associated with prolongation of hospitalization time, it is also mentioned that the
      transvaginal puncture is better tolerated by the patient.

      No study has compared these two techniques, which is why we propose this study.
