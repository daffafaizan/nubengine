        -  Determine the complete response rate to VNP40101M in patients with acute myelogenous
           leukemia or high-risk myelodysplasia .

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified to acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplasia (MDS) patients â‰¥ 60 years old with no
      prior treatment vs AML patients any age in first relapse. (AML patients any age in first
      relapse closed to accrual 06/09/05).

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes once on day 1 (course 1).

      Four to five weeks after the first course, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and
      biopsy. If the bone marrow is improved but contains residual leukemia, patients receive a
      second course of VNP40101M (at the same dose as in course 1). If patients achieve complete
      response (CR), or partial CR after the first or second course, a consolidation course may be
      given comprising VNP40101M at a reduced dose.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 12 months, and then every 3
      months for 18 months .

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (100 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or
      high-risk myelodysplasia and 130 with AML in first relapse) will be accrued for this study.
