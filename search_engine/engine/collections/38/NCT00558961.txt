      chlorambucil-mediated cytotoxicity in CLL cells in vitro. Imatinib inhibits c-abl and
      sensitizes cells to chlorambucil. The Phase I component of the study will determine the
      maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of Gleevec when used in combination with
      chlorambucil. Once the maximum tolerated dose has been determined, a total of 16 patients
      will be enrolled in the Phase II component of the study. This study will determine the dose
      limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Gleevec in combination with
      chlorambucil.
