      been shown to be advantageous in disease processes that require frequent office follow-up
      visits such as psoriasis. In 2010, Watkins et al. demonstrated that teledermatology was
      effective in treating patients 16 years and older with moderate acne and demonstrated
      equivocal clinical outcomes as traditional office visits along with equivocal patient and
      provider satisfaction scores. More recently, Fruhauf et al. conducted a small study examining
      patients with severe acne on isotretinoin and found similar results in terms of safety and
      efficacy. Patients with severe acne on isotretinoin therapy currently are scheduled for
      monthly office visits in the dermatology clinic for at least six consecutive months during
      which time the severity of their acne is assessed by a dermatologist and dose adjustments are
      made accordingly. Patients are also required to get monthly laboratory studies immediately
      before, during, or after their visit, and this must be reviewed by the provider prior to
      prescription renewal according to iPledge guidelines. Given the fact that this medication is
      typically prescribed to teenagers or young adults, the high frequency of office visits put a
      significant burden on both patients and their families and results in unnecessary time missed
      from work or school.
