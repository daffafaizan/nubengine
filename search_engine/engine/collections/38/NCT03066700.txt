      treatment in oncology. However, conventional endoscopic hemostatic methods are not reliable
      to control bleeding. Surgery, embolization, and radiotherapy can served as the salvage
      hemostasis; though, a bridging endoscopic therapy is required during resuscitation and
      stabilization of the patients. Hemospray is a recent novel endoscopic hemostatis powder which
      has a trend to be an effective instrument for controlling the active upper GI tumor bleeding
      from a match-pair, case-control study by the author's recent publication. Consequently, the
      authors hypothesized that there are some prognostic factors related to the outcome of
      Hemospray treatment in tumor bleeding.
