      I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of
      patients with recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma when treated with 506U78.

      II. Assess the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
