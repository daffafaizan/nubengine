    
      This is a single arm open label clinical study in Chinese men of 45 to 75 years of age with
      Type 2 Diabetes. Subjects will be recruited from participating family medicine clinics with
      the FMRN and followed for 90-days. All subjects will continue on pre-study treatment regimens
      and medications as clinically indicated throughout the 90-day study period. Missed doses of
      study drug can be made up within the same day. With the exceptions of study drug and diabetic
      medications, changes in other medications will be permitted. The primary aim is to assess the
      effects of oral Testosterone on change in HbA1c levels in the Chinese males with a diagnosis
      of T2DM over a 90-day study period.

      Subjects enrolled in the study will take two 40mg capsules of oral testosterone in the
      morning and two 40mg capsules in the evening with meals on both occasions on each day. This
      daily dosage is consistent with the recommended dosage for subjects being treated for
      hypogonadism.

      Primary objective:

      - The primary aim is to assess the effect of oral Testosterone on percent change in HbA1c in
      T2DM Chinese males in Singapore over a 90-day study period.

      Secondary objectives:

      - The secondary aim is to assess the effects of site, eugonadism and hypogonadism, and the
      prognostic relevance of baseline levels of HbA1c, total testosterone, PSA, IPSS, haemoglobin
      and haematocrit on 90-day change and percent change from baseline in HbA1c under the study
      Testosterone regimen.
