    
      This Phase 3 study seeks to confirm a demonstrated treatment effect of intepirdine (RVT-101)
      on both cognition and activities of daily living when added to stable donepezil treatment in
      subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment.
      This study will also provide further information on the safety and tolerability of the 35-mg
      dose of intepirdine (RVT-101) when used in combination with donepezil compared to donepezil
      alone. This study is being conducted under the agreement of a Special Protocol Assessment by
      FDA. Subjects completing this study will be eligible to enroll in a 12 month open-label study
      of RVT-101 (RVT-101-3002) in which concomitant medications for the treatment of Alzheimer's
      disease including memantine will be allowed.
