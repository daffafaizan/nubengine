      Study type: Prospective clinical trial

      Study design: One sample, non-inferiority study with a 7.5% non-inferiority limit.

      Investigational product: One phase nephrographic CT (experimental arm) vs. Four-phase CT
      (control arm)

      Objective:The primary objective is to evaluate whether one-phase nephrographic CT
      (experimental) is sufficient to detect urinary tract cancer in patients with hematuria
      compared to the traditional four-phase CT (control).

      Primary endpoints: The difference in false negative rates in the experimental- and control
      arm. McNemara is used for statistical analyses.

      there will also be a secondary reading in order to asses interobserver variability for both
      the experimental and the control arm

      Sample size:

      â€¢ 250 patients
