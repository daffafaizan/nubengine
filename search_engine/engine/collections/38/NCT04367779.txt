      2017 supports proton therapy in primary solid neoplasms in children treated with curative
      intent. To date, PBT is also recognised in adults as a valid option providing life expectancy
      > 10 years, for inoperable axial or head and neck sarcomas, low grade brain tumors (i.e. low
      grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma), non-operated meningioma of skull base
      and other rare clinical situations (re-irradiation, locally aggressive tumor malignant or not
      arising in sites which preclude R0 or R1 surgical resection). Recently, Jhaveri et al. have
      reported the retrospective analysis of a National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) and shown an
      improved overall survival in adult Grade I-IV glioma patients treated with PBT versus
      patients treated with radiotherapy (XRT). Positive impact on toxicity free survival and
      general health status of patients were reported in others indications. centers join their
      expertise (pediatric, brain and sarcoma cancers for Centre Léon Bérard (CLB) and protons for
      CAL) and their recruitment to optimize the treatment strategy for these patients.

      The Centre Leon Bérard recently reported on the ProfilER protocol (NCT01774409). It is the
      largest molecular characterization program in France with now over 4000 patients included. It
      enabled to identify genomic biomarkers of radio resistance. In this context, the
      investigator's proposal is to conduct a genomic, epigenetic, and immunological analysis of
      patients treated with proton beam therapy with the aim to identify Biomarkers of response to
      PBT in pediatric and adult patients.
