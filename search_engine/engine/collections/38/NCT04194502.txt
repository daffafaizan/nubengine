      studies in normal children have demonstrated that coronary artery flow velocities decrease
      with age and therefore heart rate. 'Normal' flow velocities in the left coronary artery are
      usually accepted between 0.3-0.6m/sec depending on age of the patient. Less is known about
      coronary flow patterns and velocities in patients with congenital heart disease. In addition
      the effects of coronary artery bypass and altered loading conditions may affect coronary flow
      patterns and velocities and in theory alter short and long term outcomes. This study hopes to
      is to establish normal coronary artery pulse Doppler flow patterns and velocities using
      transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with a variety of congenital heart
      disease.
