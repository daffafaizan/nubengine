      depression. The quality of ECT is evaluated basing on minimal seizure duration (>15sec), the
      sympathic response and the postictal EEG-suppression.

      - Page 1 of 3 - For the treatment general anaesthesia is needed. On the other hand
      anaesthesia strongly influences the quality of the seizure. Standard treatment is to use
      Anaesthesia to intervention time (ASTI) of 1 to 2 minutes for ideal timing of the electric
      stimulation.

      The aim of the study is to assess if timing of electric stimulation aiming for ar an
      anaesthesia depth of Narcotrend values 41-64 may provide better convulsion quality than
      standard approach of using ASTI 1-2 minutes.
