      cross-over study: The effects of L-lysine on corticosteroid secretion will be compared to
      those of a placebo. STUDY OBJECTIVES Main objective: to verify that adrenal corticosteroid
      secretion is actually controlled by L-lysine. Secondary objective: to determine the
      physiological conditions that involve the control of adrenocortical function by t5-HT4
      receptors. NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 20 healthy volunteers ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (see below) DURATION
      OF STUDY Overall duration: 13 months Inclusion period: 12 months Follow up period (for 1
      subject): 5 weeks Exclusion period: 1 month ENDPOINTS PRIMARY ENDPOINT: blood aldosterone
      variation during orthostatic test SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Basal aldosterone alteration
      Aldosterone variation during metoclopramide & salt-free diet tests Basal and stimulated (3
      different tests) alterations of renin, cortisol & ACTH REGULATORY AUTHORIZATIONS Ethics
