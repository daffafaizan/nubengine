      screening of AAAs has been shown to decrease AAA-related mortality, translation into medical
      practice of screening is limited because there is no specific treatment to limit growth of
      AAAs below diameter thresholds for open surgery or stent graft. We have developed different
      approaches aimed at inducing healing and thereby stabilizing formed AAAs in animal models. We
      have identified TGF-beat1 as an inducer of experimental AAA healing. Cyclosporine A is an
      inducer of tumor growth factor - beta1 (TGF-beta1) in experimental AAAs and in human
      atherosclerotic AAAs in vitro, causing overgrowth of inflamed tissues. Since AAAs are caused
      by aortic wall atrophy, we have hypothesised and confirmed in animals, that cyclosporine AAA,
      when administrated during a short period of time, durably stabilizes small AAA diameter in
      animals, while inducing aortic wall reconstruction and healing.

      The clinical trial ACA4 is a multicentric randomized, placebo controlled, double blind trial
      that will enrol 360 patients with small AAAs in France. Two doses of cyclosporine A will be
      tested against a placebo (three arms). Drug administration will be short, and AAA diameter
      evaluation will be performed for 2 years, by CT-scanner (main outcome) with no contrast, and
      duplex-scanner.
