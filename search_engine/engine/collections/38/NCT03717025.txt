      restore melanocytes to the depigmented skin so that the epidermis restores back to normal
      morphology and functions. Although medical treatment is the main stay of treatment, it is not
      effective in all and residual lesions need augmented surgical treatment later for further
      completion of repigmentation.

      Now a day surgical modalities have become treatment of choice for stable vitiligo not
      responding to medical treatment although there are numerous sites which do not respond that
      well to surgical procedure as well. The investigators ought to compare the efficacy of 3 well
      established surgical methods i.e. Mini Punch Grafting vs Suction Blister Epidermal Grafting
      vs Non Cultured Epidermal cell Suspension on stable vitiligo patches localized to acral areas
      and bony prominences like elbows, knees and ankles. Out of all the vitiligo patches in a
      given participant, 3 different patches on acral and bony areas will be chosen and
      participants will be treated with 3 different methods.
