      chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil. Although the main dose-limiting side effect
      of oxaliplatin is neurotoxicity, with the widespread use of this drug, there are more and
      more reports that oxaliplatin is discontinued because of thrombocytopenia, which increases
      the risk of bleeding, rate of blood transfusion needs and length of stay. On the other hand,
      patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy may also experience significant bone marrow
      suppression because flat bones such as the tibia may be exposed to high doses radiation. Low
      platelet counts is an urgent problem to be solved in order to give adequate quantitative
      radiotherapy. This randomized controlled clinical phase II study was designed to compare the
      effect of rhTPO with rhIL-11 in improving thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent
      colorectal cancer who underwent radiotherapy and with thrombocytopenia, thus providing more
      evidence in clinical practice.
