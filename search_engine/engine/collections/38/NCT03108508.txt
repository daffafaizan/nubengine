      parameters of three silicon supplements in human volunteers.

      Participants: 5 healthy men over 18 years old, with normal serum creatinine levels. Treatment
      consists of one product consumption every week, and measuring postprandrial response at 0,
      30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 360 min, in blood, and urine in two periods of three hours
      each.

      The statistical analysis will follow the principles specified in the guidelines of the ICHE
      and CPMP/EWP/908/99 ICHE Points to Consider on Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials.
