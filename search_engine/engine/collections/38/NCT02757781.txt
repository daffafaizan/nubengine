    
      Main Objective: to assess the effectiveness of a Community of Practice (CdP) virtual in
      improving attitudes of health professionals in primary care on the empowerment of patients
      with chronic diseases.

      Methodology:

      Design: cluster randomised controlled.

      Scope: primary care centers (PCC) belonging to the Regions of Catalonia, Madrid and Canary
      Islands.

      Population: primary care health professionals (family doctors and nurses).

      Sample size: 270 healthcare professionals and 1382 patients.

      Randomization: Randomization unit: PCC; unit of analysis: primary care health professionals.
      9 pairs of PCC by region will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to the intervention
      or control group. Randomization will be performed after the selection of professionals and
      patients.

      Intervention: the intervention group will be offered participation for 12 months in a virtual
      CdP based on a web 2.0 platform. The control group will receive usual training.

      Measurements: the primary outcome will be measured by Patient-Provider Orientation Scale
      (PPOS) questionnaire at baseline and 12 months. Secondary outcomes: sociodemographic of
      professionals; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients; Patient Activation
      Measure (PAM) questionnaire for patient activation; outcomes regarding use of the CdP.

      Analysis: A linear mixed-effects regression to estimate the effect of participating in the
      CdP will be estimated. Additionally, an analysis of how the CdP is functioning through
      techniques of social network analysis and control charts will be performed.
