    
      This is a Phase IV multicenter, open-label study and is being implemented in order to assess
      diagnostic image quality of MDCTA in subjects undergoing computed tomography angiography
      (CTA) of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, and the carotid, pulmonary and peripheral arteries with
      IOMERON. The hypothesis is that IOMERON used at a high concentration will provide good
      diagnostic image quality. The Investigators will also function as readers and evaluate the
      images on-site. Efficacy analysis will be based on the on-site evaluations.

      Imaging conditions will be representative of those used in routine clinical practice. The
      study will be conducted at approximately 10-20 sites in China. Each site may enroll
      approximately 40 subjects in this study. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in order
      to obtain 360 evaluable subjects who undergo elective MDCTA of the thoraco-abdominal aorta,
      or carotid, pulmonary or peripheral arteries.
