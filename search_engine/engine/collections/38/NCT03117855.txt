    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of capecitabine, to be used in combination with
      yttrium Y-90 (yttrium 90) (Y-90) radioembolization (RE), in patients with a diagnosis of
      unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with Y-90 + capecitabine in patients with ICC.

      II. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating liver-specific
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall PFS.

      III. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating response rate according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/modified RECIST (mRECIST) and the
      Europeans Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) imaging criteria.

      IV. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating cancer antigen (CA) 19-9
      response and its correlation with imaging markers of tumor response.

      V. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating duration of response in the
      liver, as measured by the time for target liver lesions to progress according to
      RECIST/mRECIST beyond size at study enrollment.

      VI. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating rate of conversion to
      surgical resection for subjects who are surgically unresectable at presentation due to size
      or location of hepatic lesions (excluding subjects with extrahepatic disease or medically
      inoperable at presentation).

      VII. To develop a preliminary assessment of efficacy by evaluating overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres radioembolization over 60-90 minutes on day
      1. Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
