      of POD after intraoperative undeliberate cerebral saturation could be modulated by the choice
      of the anesthetic strategy (Volatile Induction and Maintenance of Anesthesia [VIMA] and Total
      Intravenous Anesthesia [TIVA]). Based on our previous data we hypothesized that incidence of
      POD would be lower with VIMA compared to TIVA.
