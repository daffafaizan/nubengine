      Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will
      be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and
      syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via catheter into the
      Vertebral Artery and intravenously.
