    
      This is a prospective observational study. 150 subjects with the admission diagnosis of
      neurological haemorrhage (e.g. subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage etc),
      admitted to SICU of National University Hospital, Singapore, who are expected to stay for
      more than 48 hours, will be recruited and enrolled. No adverse events are expected as a
      result of this study as patients do not deviate from the current standard of care. Frequency
      of blood sampling will be stipulated at day 1/2/3/4/5 to draw clinical relevance. An
      additional 0.5 tablespoonful (7.7ml) of blood will be taken daily from each subject as well
      as residual blood from routine laboratory test blood samples. In total, an additional volume
      of 2.5 tablespoonful (38.5ml) of blood will be collected from each subject over a period of 5
      days. Residual blood refers to any leftover blood samples collected for routine laboratory
      tests which will be shared and used to carry out additional blood tests. All ICU patients
      will have arterial lines inserted as part of routine care, so there will not be pain from the
      blood sampling. In the current study, measurements will be made on the routine laboratory
      haematology, coagulation and immunoassay analyzers. Research blood parameters that are not
      usually reported as indicated in the background section will be used for the correlation and
      association analysis to sepsis. In addition, the study team will also be collecting clinical
      and demographic data of recruited subjects from medical records for purposes of this study.
