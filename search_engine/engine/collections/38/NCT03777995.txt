      measured. Then they will be taken to the balance measurements. Design will firstly be shown
      to child and one trial will be permitted before starting the test. Timed-up and Go test will
      also be used as a reliable and valid test for dynamic balance in this age group. Single leg
      standing will also be used to investigate the discrimination feature of the dynamic balance
      tested by new design platform.

      All tests will be done without socks and shoes. Timing will be the only results for all
      tests. Calibrated chronometers will be used for this aim. After all measurements complete,
      statistical analysis will be conducted.
