      cirrhosis, cancers, etc.) and social problems (injuries, road accidents, alcohol dependence,
      etc.). With one of the highest consumption rate in Europe, alcohol is the second cause of
      avoidable mortality in France after tobacco (49.000 alcohol attributable deaths in 2009) and
      its social cost is estimated to 120 billion euros. French teenage population is particularly
      associated with heavy drinking patterns: in 2014, 49% of 17-year olds declared heavy episodic
      drinking.

      In that regard, several measures are recommended by health actors to combat this issue:
      minimum unit pricing, sales ban to minor, low blood alcohol concentration for drivers, etc. A
      specific measure concerns alcohol advertising restrictions. Some countries implemented
      alcohol advertising regulation laws (Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, etc.), including
      France with the Evin law passed in 1991. This French law mandates advertising (and packaging)
      content to strictly convey factual information and objective qualities of alcohol products
      and thus bans attractive ads based on image and lifestyle evocations (seduction, power,
      etc.).

      The objective of this research is to investigate whether statutory framework for alcohol
      advertising (e.g., Evin law) can effectively protect people against misleading, suggestive,
      and appealing content. Little research has been conducted on this topic in spite of WHO's
      recommendations (most research has explored the influence of exposure to ads but not the
      impact of content).
