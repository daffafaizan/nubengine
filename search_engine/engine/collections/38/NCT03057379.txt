      sustainability of utilizing statewide Immunization Information Systems (IIS) to conduct
      centralized reminder/recall (R/R) to improve HPV vaccination rates among adolescents ages
      11-17. The investigators will extend previous research on effectiveness of centralized R/R to
      a new population--adolescents due for HPV vaccine-- and test the use of centralized R/R as a
      cancer-prevention strategy. Investigators will assess the effect of centralized R/R in two
      states--one with and one without mandated reporting of vaccinations to IISs, and disseminate
      IIS R/R to other states. Investigators will implement, evaluate (using the RE-AIM framework
      31-36), and disseminate a collaborative, IIS-based centralized HPV vaccine R/R model in which
      partnerships of public health systems and primary care practices in two states (NY, CO)
      collaborate to remind parents about HPV vaccination.

      Specific Aims and hypotheses:

      Aim #1: Adapt IIS messages and delivery systems (e.g., algorithms) previously developed for
      centralized R/R for other vaccines to fit HPV vaccine IIS R/R.

      Aim #2: Assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of centralized IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer
      (phone) R/R in increasing vaccine rates [initial dose (HPV#1) and a complete series (HPV#3)]
      among teens.

      Conduct a pragmatic trial, to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of centralized
      IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer (phone) R/R in increasing initiation and completion rates for
      the HPV vaccine series in adolescents ages 11-17 years. The investigators will use a
      within-practice design, randomizing patients within randomly selected primary care practices
      to IIS-C R/R (1, 2, or 3 reminders per dose) compared to usual care (0 reminders from this
      study). The investigators will apply the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach,
      effectiveness/cost effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of IIS-C R/R.

      Hypothesis 2a: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care.

      Hypothesis 2b: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care in key
      subgroups (males and females, younger and older teens, urban//rural teens).

      Hypothesis 2c: IIS-C R/R will be more cost-effective (cost/vaccine received) than usual care.

      Aim #3: Disseminate IIS-C R/R across NY and CO and pilot in four IISs: (a) Develop an IIS-C
      HPV R/R toolkit, (b) Use a technical advisory group, (c) Initiate IIS-C R/R in four other
      IISs [Yr. 4].

      By the end of the study investigators will have a feasible, sustainable, cost-effective model
      for HPV vaccine reminders that can be used nationally to prevent cervical cancer and other
      HPV-related cancers.
