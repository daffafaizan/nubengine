      demonstrated notable activity and is approved for treatment in other pruritic inflammatory
      skin conditions such as psoriasis. The drug is currently being investigated as therapy for
      atopic dermatitis. Additionally, the investigators have preliminary data to suggest that
      apremilast's anti-inflammatory properties may work via neuromodulation targeting neuronal
      cytokine pathways. The proposed study plans to assess the efficacy of apremilast 30 mg BID in
      the setting of CIP. Durable response to a medication is typically seen within one to two
      months of starting an efficacious medication in subjects who respond. Therefore, the
      investigators have designed this study to end at Week 16 to definitively determine efficacy
      and conclude the study with confidence with regard to both efficacy and failure.
