      will receive non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or
      rTMS) to one of two targets in the brain in conjunction with upper limb training for 3 days a
      week for 5 weeks. The primary outcome will be upper limb motor impairment, and secondary
      outcomes will be tests of functional abilities, proximal reaching performance and
      patient-reported disability. Associated neural mechanisms will also be studied using
      neurophysiological and functional connectivity MRI techniques. Damage to ipsilesional
      corticospinal pathways will be indexed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
