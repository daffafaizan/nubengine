      will be three cohorts :

        -  one prospective cohort constituted of women undergoing breast surgery in Ren√© Huguenin
           Hospital (Saint Cloud) and followed for up to one year after surgery.

        -  another cross sectional cohort constituted of patient association (Seintinelle)
           including women operated up to 2 years previously from breast surgery.

        -  One prospective cohort constituted of women or men undergoing thoracotomy in Foch
           hospital (Suresnes) and followed for up to one year after surgery.

      The main objectives of these cohorts will be to detect potential genetic, neurophysiological,
      psychological and cognitive risk factors for the development of chronic postsurgical
      neuropathic pain.

      These patients will questioned about demographics, age, sex, body mass index. A large
      neuropsychological and psychological battery of tests will be conducted. Sensory function
      will assessed using quantitative sensory testing. Biological samples will analyse potential
      genetic factors in the development of neuropathic pain after surgery. Conditioned pain
      modulation, threshold tracking and quantitative sensory testing will also be assessed in
      subgroup of patients.

      The prospective cohort will be assessed before surgery then 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
      The cross sectional cohort will be assessed during one to two visits in hospital.
