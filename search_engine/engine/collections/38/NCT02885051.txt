      nursing procedures or painful or stressful medical. Repeated pain in the neonatal period may
      have negative consequences in the short and / or long term. The diagnosis of pain remains
      difficult because based on the hetero-assessment involving the use of validated scales. The
      PIPP-R scale (Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised) appears to be the most complete and best
      validated scale as composite (behavior items, vegetative and contextual). However, it is
      rarely used in routine care in France.

      Alternatives to clinical scoring the pain level were described, in particular the analysis of
      the variability of the heart rate [VHR] by HFVI index (High Frequency Variability Index) or
      skin conductance. The analysis of the spectral components of high frequencies or HFVI would
      be an indicator of parasympathetic activity. The HFVI was compared to the EDIN scale, purely
      behavioral level, proposed as chronic pain marker. Skin conductance would be a stress marker
      reflecting variations of the sympathetic system.

      These techniques are currently marketed for routine use. However, these methods have been
      compared and the NIPE (Newborn Infant parasympathetic Evaluation), which assesses the HFVI
      index, was not compared to a validated scale procedural acute pain (such as PIPP-R).

      It seems important, before disseminating these methods, explore the consistency of these
      techniques with each other and validated scales, and their acceptability by nurses.
