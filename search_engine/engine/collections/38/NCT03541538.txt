    
      Cervical Joint Manipulation (CJM) are often used for pain treatment.

      Joint manipulation generates a series of stimuli within the central nervous system through
      the activation of proprioceptors located in the joint capsule or muscles, stimulates the PAG,
      causing pain inhibition by activation of non-opioid descending inhibitory pathways.
