      investigate the effects of oxytocin treatment on resting-state functional connectivity.

      Subject will receive either intranasal oxytocin or placebo administration and go through a
      seven-minute resting-state scan in MRI scanner to test whether oxytocin changes functional
      connectivity in the brain. Trait anxiety and mood questionnaires will be administered as
      control variables.
