      cirrhosis with gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage is common in clinical practice; recent
      studies [14] found that implantation of 8 mm diameter is compared with the use of 10 mm
      diameter stents. The membrane stent significantly reduced the incidence of HE after TIPS
      without affecting the shunt effect. To further evaluate the effect of "left/right branch of
      shunt portal" on hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS, we intend to conduct the following
      studies: for individual etiology (post-hepatitis B cirrhosis), the only indication (to
      prevent recurrent rupture of gastroesophageal varices) ), implanted 8mm diameter Viatorr
      stent, unified HE evaluation criteria, and stratified multi-center randomized clinical trial
      study with Child classification, hope to guide TIPS in line with China's national conditions
      through the high-level evidence-based medical evidence obtained.
