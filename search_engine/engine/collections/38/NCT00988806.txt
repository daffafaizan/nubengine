    
      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term, intermittent intravenous
      administration for 24 hours of Levosimendan for the treatment of advanced heart failure. Main
      end-point: incidence of admission due to decompensation, defined as first admission to
      emergency services or hospitalization more than 12 hours due to heart failure worsening.

      Secondary end-points: major cardiac events, serious adverse events, change in NYHA scale at
      baseline, 30 days, 6 and 12 months; effects on inflammatory and neurohormonal activation in
      heart failure, identify factors associated with better survival of patients, quality of life,
      cost-effectiveness of treatment.

      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial.

      Scope of the study: patients with advanced heart failure.

      Study Subjects: Patients over 18 years old with advanced HF of any etiology, with at least
      one admission for acute decompensation treated or treatable with Levosimendan within 6 months
      prior to randomization.

      Interventions: a 24-hour infusion every 30 days of Levosimendan or placebo in addition to
      optimal pharmacological treatment for HF during 12 months.

      Determinations: clinical monitoring, protocol-specified analytical determinations,
      echocardiographic assessment, invasive hemodynamic assessment, functional assessment by 6 min
      walk test in corridor, quality of life assessment at baseline, after 30 days, 6 months and 12
      months.
