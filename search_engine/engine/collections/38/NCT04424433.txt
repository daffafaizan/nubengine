      graft (CABG) surgery will be recruited to undergo this single visit study. In the timeframe
      shortly after the induction of anaesthesia and prior to the start of surgery, myocardial
      strain as a marker of cardiac function will be measured by transesophageal echocardiography
      (TEE). Echocardiography measurements will be acquired at two different oxygen states for each
      patient. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be adjusted to reach a normoxaemic state
      (FiO2=0.3) and a hyperoxic state (FiO2=0.8). Patients will be randomized to which oxygen
      level is investigated first. Thereafter, the study intervention is completed and anaesthesia
      and surgery will be performed as planned by the treating team. Echocardiography images will
      be analyzed in a blinded manner for cardiac function and systolic and diastolic strain
      parameters. The results will help anaesthesiologists to better weigh risks and benefits when
      selecting an inspired oxygen fraction in such patients, and will help to evaluate hyperoxia
      as a risk factor for myocardial injury.
