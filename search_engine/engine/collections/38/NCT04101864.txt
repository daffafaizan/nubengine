      randomized in two groups. Patents allocated to study group will get their acetabular
      components implanted with the help of electromagnetic navigation system. Patients allocated
      to the control group will get their acetabular components implanted with freehand technique.
      Accuracy and precision of implanted acetabular components will be assessed on images obtained
      by postoperative computed tomography. Postoperative inclination and anteversion angles of
      acetabular components will be measured by the independent technician. Results will be
      statistically analyzed and compared.
