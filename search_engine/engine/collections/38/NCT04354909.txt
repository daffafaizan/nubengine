      blindness. Actually, the knowledge of the physiopathology of uveitis stay poorly. CD95 Ligand
      (CD95-L) belongs to a TNF (tumor necrosis factors) receptor family. It knows to play a
      preponderant role to maintain the eye immune privilege. In particular conditions depending on
      immunologic environment, CD95-L has pro-inflammatory properties and can interact with Th17
      lymphocytes and neutrophils, two cells implicated in non-infectious uveitis. The hypothesis
      is that s-CD95-L levels might be a prognostic factor in non-infectious uveitis and the study
      of the molecular mechanisms involved could provide new therapeutic targets.

      This study will recruit 100 patients with non-infectious uveitis followed in Bordeaux
      University Hospital. Among classical disease activity information, blood samples will be
      collected during to assess s-CD95-L. Fundamental research will be realized on patients'
      sample to evaluate underlying molecular mechanisms.

      Clinical and biological disease activity, treatment and outcomes will be studied in
      correlation with s-CD95-L to describe their potential prognostic role. Patients will be
      followed at regular intervals, accordingly to usual care.
