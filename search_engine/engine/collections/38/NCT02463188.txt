      promotion intervention to reduce insufficient sleep among adolescents aged 14 to 16, while
      engaging teens in the adaptation process to maximize the relevance, appeal, and effectiveness
      of the program for diverse school settings.

      The investigators aim to conduct a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) among
      adolescents (n = 300) who will be randomized to Sleep Fitness (SF) or Sleep Education (SE) to
      obtain effect size estimates in preparation for a larger scale intervention study. This pilot
      trial is designed to obtain preliminary data for the following hypotheses:

      SF, compared to SE, will produce greater pre-post improvement in sleep after treatment and at
      6 month follow-up (with the possibility of a 12 month follow-up for a subset of participants,
      depending on resources).

      SF, compared to SE, will produce greater pre-post reductions in substance use after treatment
      and at 6 month follow-up (with the possibility of a 12 month follow-up for a subset of
      participants, depending on resources).

      SF, compared to SE, will produce greater pre-post improvement on selected mental health
      outcomes (anxiety, depression) after treatment and at 6 month follow-up (with the possibility
      of a 12 month follow-up for a subset of participants, depending on resources).
