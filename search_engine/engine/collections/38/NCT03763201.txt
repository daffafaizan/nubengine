           Study design: a longitudinal observational cohort study.

           This study will be carried out on two groups:

             -  Group (I): fifty early onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients fulfilled the 2010
                American college of rheumatology (ACR) - European league against rheumatism (EULAR)
                classification criteria for RA [11].

             -  Group (II): Twenty healthy individuals of matching age and sex as control group.

           Both groups will be recruited from the in-patients and out-patients' clinic of the
           Rheumatology, Rehabilitation& Physical Medicine Department, Benha University Hospital.

           All patients will be evaluated at baseline at 6 months follow up using:

           (A) Clinical evaluation 1. Complete history taking. 2. Thorough clinical examination. 3.
           Disease activity using DAS28 [12]

           (B) Laboratory assessment:

           All patients will be subjected to the following measurements:

             1. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

             2. C reactive protein (CRP).

             3. Rheumatoid factor (RF)

             4. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti- CCP).

             5. glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor related protein (GITR)

           (D) Musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment: Ultrasound examinations will be performed for
           patients and control groups using a Logiq e equipped with a broadband 8- to 13-MHz
           linear transducer

        2. Statistical analysis The collected data will be tabulated and analyzed using suitable
           statistical computer version.
