      China. Eligible patients need to be aged 16 years or older with a diagnosis of an advanced
      unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma, of intermediate or high grade, for which no
      standard curative therapy will be available, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status of 0-1, and measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors version 1.1.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (60
      mg/m² via continuous intravenous infusion for 4-6 h on day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to
      six cycles) or pirarubicin (30 mg/m2/d continuous intravenous infusion for 3h on day 1 and 2
      of every 21-day cycle for up to six cycles) plus ifosfamide ( 2 g/m²/d intravenously for 2h
      on day 2,3 and 4 of every 21-day cycle for up to six cycles), dacarbazine (300 mg/m²/d
      intravenously for 2h on day 2,3 and 4 of every 21-day cycle for up to six cycles ).After six
      cycles of treatment, patients will be followed up expectantly whereas patients with stable or
      responsive disease are allowed to continue with ifosfamide and dacarbzine until documented
      disease progression. A web-based central randomisation with block sizes of two and four was
      stratified by extent of disease, drug administration method, and previous systemic therapy.
      Patients and investigators will not be masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint
      is progression survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses will
      be done in all patients who receive any amount of study drug.
