    
      Purpose: In recent years, multiparametric Magnet Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) has been
      established as a diagnostic imaging technique of the prostate and its assessment standardized
      with the "prostate imaging - data and reporting system" (PI-RADS v2). The previously
      established Likert scale from 1 to 5 has been shown to reflect the increasing probability of
      a carcinoma. Suspicious MRI lesions can be biopsied in a targeted fashion using ultrasound
      navigation termed fusion biopsy. The investigators examined whether a high PI-RADS v2 score
      correlates with the presence of prostate cancer. In addition, the investigators inspected
      whether the lesion size as determined by mpMRI correlates with the presence of prostate
      cancer. Furthermore, the investigators study aimed to determine the sensitivity and
      specificity of mpMRI with respect to prostate carcinoma detection.

      Materials and Methods: This prospective study includes 228 consecutive patients, which
      underwent a perineal MRI-TRUS-fused prostate biopsy (BiopSeeÂ®, MedCom Company) during the
      period of September 2015 to March 2017 at the cantonal hospital Winterthur due to a
      suspicious PSA value, a suspicious digital rectal examination or a known prostate cancer
      under active surveillance. 71 patients were excluded due to lack of PI-RADS v2 diagnosis and
      / or MRI performed at a different center. Targeted biopsies were performed specifically in
      the indicated MRI lesions and standardized over the rest of the prostate (system biopsy).
