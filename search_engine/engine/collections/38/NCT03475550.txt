    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients' reported experiences with regularly
      prescribed medications. No medications are prescribed as part of this study. Rather, if a
      patient are prescribed a new medication during their regularly scheduled clinic visit, he/she
      may be eligible to participate.

      Patients who agree to participate and who are prescribed a medication in clinic will be
      contacted by telephone or email 3 weeks after their appointment to evaluate positive and
      negative experiences with the medication.
