      Three patients in Arm 1 (HBO on Monday and Friday) will be observed throughout their course
      of concomitant radiation, chemo and hyperbaric therapy. If these patients appear to tolerate
      this protocol well, and no adverse effects that can be directly attributed to HBO are
      observed, then three more patients will be recruited for Arm 2 (HBO on Monday, Wednesday, and
      Friday). If again these patients appear to tolerate this protocol well, and no adverse
      effects that can be directly attributed to HBO are observed, then a third group of three
      patients will be recruited for Arm 3 (HBO Monday through Friday).

      If Grade IV acute toxicity is reported for a single patient in any of the arms, 3 more
      patients will be recruited in the same arm. If no further adverse events occur, the protocol
      progresses to the next arm. If Grade IV acute toxicity is observed even a single patient, the
      study will be stopped.

      Tumor and/or lymphatic tissue specimens will be obtained prior to starting treatment. Tumor
      tissue specimens will be analyzed to determine whether there is a predictive susceptibility
      of tumors to HBO sensitization using currently defined biomarkers known to correlate with
      survival.
