      cost-effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine during Paramedic Intervention Team
      transportation of patients with suspicion of acute stroke.

      The implementation of expert stroke support in the pre-hospital arena using in-ambulance
      telemedicine is an innovative approach that opens up new perspectives and allows continuous
      guidance by a stroke specialist throughout the acute stroke care continuum.
