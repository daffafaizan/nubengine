      nurse-drive ultrasound and echocardiographic examinations, after informed consent. Nurses
      underwent a training programme and their skills are approved by cardiologist. Our department
      does not always have a cardiologist on duty and indication for nurse-driven ultrasound
      examination is decided by the doctor responsible for the treatment, who not always are
      trained in echocardiography/ultrasound. We aim to study the described hypothesis.
