        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with a brain stem
           glioma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial
           response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with a brain
           stem glioma.

      OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which patients receive gradually
      escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the
      maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with a complete or
      partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment.

      To determine objective response, tumor size in measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
      performed every 8 weeks for the first 2 years, every 3 months for the 3rd and 4th years,
      every 6 months for the 5th and 6th years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
