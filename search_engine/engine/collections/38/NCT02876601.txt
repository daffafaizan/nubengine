    
      Defibrotide (DF) is a highly complex polydisperse mixture of single-stranded phosphodiester
      oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the controlled depolymerization of porcine intestinal
      mucosal DNA. The entire mode of action remains unknown. Its actions may be summarized to
      pro-fibrinolytic, anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulatory actions. To better define the
      mechanisms of Defibrotide the effects of the substance will be investigated in the
      well-established endotoxemia model. Sixteen healthy volunteers will be randomized to receive
      LPS±defibrotide/placebo and four subjects will be randomized to receive Placebo±
      defibrotide/placebo in a single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, two-way
      crossover trial. Immediately after a 2h infusion of 6,25mg/kg bodyweight defibrotide or
      placebo a LPS bolus of 2ng/kg bodyweight will be infused. Analyses will be performed by blood
      sampling at pre-defined time-points.
