      21-29ng/ml indicate insufficiency and those above 30ng/ml are regarded as sufficient.

      The rational behind the observations associating vitamin D deficiency with CVD is that on the
      one hand, hypovitaminosis D was found to be associated with traditional risk factors such as
      hypertension (HTN),diabetes mellitus (dm),obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome , on
      the other hand, experimental data demonstrated that vitamin D could affect cardiac muscle
      cells directly, control parathyroid (PTH) hormone secretion, regulate the rennin-
      angiotensin- aldosterone system and the immune system, all of which could influence
      cardiovascular risk.

      Epidemiological studies further support this association, demonstrating high prevalence of
      hypovitaminosis D among U.S. adults with cardiovascular disease (74%). An association between
      low vitamin D levels and increased myocardial infarction risk as well as total mortality has
      been also observed.

      Low 25hydroxyvitamin D[ 25(OH)D] levels were also independently associated with all cause and
      CVD mortality among patients scheduled for coronary catheterization.
