      despite experiencing frequent asthma symptoms. When linked to timely and appropriate asthma
      medication use, good physician-parent-child communication is associated with a decrease in
      asthma morbidity and mortality. Removing obstacles to preventive asthma care and improving
      communication between the parent-children and PCP are two necessary prerequisites to
      improving asthma outcomes in low-income minority children.

      We, the researchers at Johns Hopkins University, hypothesize that a culturally-tailored
      parent and child asthma communication intervention (ACI) designed to teach parent and child
      communication skills for use with their health care provider regarding asthma symptom
      severity, medication use, personal goal of treatment and quality of life issues will
      significantly reduce emergency room utilization for asthma care. We propose to compare this
      parent/child asthma communication intervention (ACI) to a developed standard asthma education
      intervention (SAE) designed to increase basic asthma self-management.

      This study will advance nursing science by improving asthma self-management for school age
      children, who may be self-administering their asthma medications, yet not participate in
      receiving information or making their own medical decisions regarding their asthma. The
      proposed study is targeted at low-income minority school-aged children with evidence of
      poorly controlled, high-risk asthma. If successful, this intervention could have significant
      practical applications as a component of asthma nurse-case management, to practice currently
      being employed by many managed care groups across the country as an intervention for their
      high-risk/high ED use asthma patients. Because of the high prevalence and enormous health
      impact of asthma and the disproportionate asthma burden experienced by minority children, the
      outcome of the proposed study will have significant pediatric nursing applicability.
