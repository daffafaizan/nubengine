      receiving OMT compared to those receiving usual care.

      Methods For this study, we selected patients utilizing the following inclusion criteria: 1)
      ages 7-18 years, 2) a diagnosis of asthma, 3) patients receiving care at a primary care-based
      asthma clinic, and 4) those patients who had baseline spirometry. Selected patients were then
      randomized to either an OMT or a control group. We excluded patients who were experiencing an
      acute asthma exacerbation. Patients in the OMT group were treated with rib raising and
      suboccipital release, in addition to standard asthma care, while control group patients
      received standard care only. A second PFT was performed on both groups at the end of the
      visit. OMT was performed by multiple osteopathic pediatric residents who were specifically
      trained for the purposes of this study. Change in spirometry results (FVC, FEV1, FVC/FEV1,
      and FEF 25-75%) were then compared.

      NOTE: The OMTs were done either by our OMM attending at that time (Dr. Wolf) or by residents
      trained by her for this study (Drs. Jones, Pe, Bryant and Regan,)
