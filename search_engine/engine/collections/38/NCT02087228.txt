      uterus six months following an endometrial ablation procedure. Half of the participants will
      have their ablation performed with a hydrothermal ablation device and the other half will
      have their ablation performed with a device that uses radiofrequency energy. Participants are
      randomly assigned to one or the other device.

      A vaginal ultrasound will be performed before the procedure and again at six months
      post-procedure.

      The inside of the uterus will be visualized via hysteroscopy before the procedure and again
      at six months post-procedure. Measurements will be taken and the investigator will compare
      photos taken pre-procedure and six months post-procedure.
