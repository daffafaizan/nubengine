      cancer types including thoracic malignancies. In the PACIFIC study, patients with locally
      advanced NSCLC were randomized to the anti-PDL1 antibody durvalumab or placebo for up to 12
      months after completion of concurrent chemoradiation. While NSCLC is typically considered
      relatively non-immunogenic, RT is thought to augment tumor immunogenicity(Iyengar & Gerber,
      2013). The abscopal effect refers to the observation that the benefit seen in PACIFIC, along
      with the growing role of immunotherapy for the treatment advanced (stage IV) NSCLC, suggests
      that earlier exposure to durvalumab may improve outcomes and be well tolerated, thereby
      permitting de-escalation of therapy through removal of conventional chemotherapy from these
      regimens to a local area results in an antitumor effect distant to the radiation site.

      Durvalumab (Imfimzi; MEDI4736; AstraZeneca) is a human monoclonal antibody of the
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) to PD-1
      (CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical
      light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains a
      triple mutation in the constant domain of the Ig G1 heavy chain that reduces binding to
      complement protein C1q and the FcÎ³ receptors involved in triggering effector function.
      Durvlumab binds with high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 and blocks its interaction
      with PD-1 and CD80
