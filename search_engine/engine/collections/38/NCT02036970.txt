      induction of Nrf2 and suppression of NF-ÎºB. Bardoxolone methyl may therefore address multiple
      facets of the pathophysiology of PH because it suppresses activation of proinflammatory
      mediators, enhances endothelial NO bioavailability, improves metabolic dysfunction,
      suppresses vascular proliferation, and prevents maladaptive remodeling. Furthermore, while
      existing therapies primarily target only smooth muscle cells, bardoxolone methyl targets
      multiple cell types relevant to PH, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and
      macrophages.

      This is a two-part study.

      Part 1: Part 1 of the study will include a dose-ranging phase and a dose-titration phase.

      Part 2 (extension period): All patients from Part 1 who complete the 16-week treatment period
      as planned will be eligible to continue directly into the extension period to evaluate the
      intermediate and long-term safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl.
