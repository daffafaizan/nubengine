    
      This study will last for 2 years, and will include only new cases of microcephaly.

      Surveillance will take place in large maternities in urban areas (standard procedure)

        -  In each city, ~3000 live births per month will be monitored, so that on average one
           microcephaly will be diagnosed per month per city (i.e., 24 per city in 2 years)

        -  Microcephaly is defined as less than -3 standard deviation (SD), according to the
           INTERGROWTH standards by age and sex with abnormal ultrasound and/or clinical
           examination.

      Data collection (study activity)

        -  A questionnaire with demographic, exposure and pregnancy details for all mothers
           Clinical exam and laboratory testing (standard procedure and study activity)

        -  Various biological samples (e.g. blood, placenta) will be collected from mothers and
           newborns/fetuses and tested for presence of ZIKV, and for other infectious (e.g.
           rubella, cytomegalovirus) causes of microcephaly

        -  Physical, neurological, hearing and visual examinations for all live births will be
           performed where possible.

      Analysis and reporting (study activity)

      o All results will be shared publically through conferences and peer-reviewed publications.
