      trial design is adopted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the real-time endoscopic
      near infrared fluorescence image provided by the LED light source system for endoscope by
      evaluating at least one main extrahepatic bile duct (common bile duct and ductuli hepaticus
      communis). The trial will be carried out in 5 centers, with the competitive grouping mode
      adopted. Totally 220 patients to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be involved (110
      patients for each of the control group and the test group). The subjects, after signing the
      informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee, will be screened by the
      investigators. Qualified subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly divided into the control group or the test group. For
      the subjects in the control group, the Pinpoint Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System
      commercially available will be used for operation. For subjects of the test group, the LED
      light source system for endoscope will be used for operation. On the operation date,
      investigators will evaluate the display performance of the device by judging whether at least
      one main extrahepatic bile duct (common bile duct and ductuli hepaticus communis) is
      displayed. During the follow-up period, the investigators will evaluate the safety of the
      device based on the results of vital signs, physical examination, blood routine examination,
      routine urine examination, blood biochemistry and 12-lead ECG.
