      study to carry out a regular ocular health screening and epidemiological analysis for
      diabetic eye disease in the approximately 8,000 middle-aged and elderly people with diabetes
      in Shanghai. Through this study, we hope to understand the prevalence, epidemic trend and the
      features of risk factors distribution on diabetic eye disease, especially on DR.

      Meanwhile, our aims also included estimating the ocular fundus changes and visual impairment
      associated with different grade of DR. Furthermore, the aim of the present study was to
      investigate the association between serum and urine biochemical parameters and DR.
