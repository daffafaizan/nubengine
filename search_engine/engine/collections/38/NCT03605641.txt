      product users and smokers when they are using e-vapor products or smoking conventional
      cigarettes. These constituents and particle counts (PC), will be measured in the room air
      samples (RAS) collected in the environmental exposure chamber (EEC) where adult e-cigarette
      users and smokers are using electronic cigarettes or smoking conventional cigarettes.

      All subjects will undergo a Screening Visit to assess if they meet study eligibility
      criteria. If all eligibility criteria are met and the subject signs informed consent, the
      subject will be assigned to one of three groups: Group I (JUUL), Group II (VUSE Solo), or
      Group III (Conventional Cigarettes).

      All three Groups will be sequentially observed in environmental settings 1 (residential), 2
      (office), and 3 (hospitality). The observation period allocated for each environmental
      setting will be 2-days and 2-overnights for Groups I and II, and 1-day and 1-overnight for
      Group III. Each observation period will be referred to as a "Clinic Visit".

      Subjects will move on to subsequent Environment Settings (Clinic Visits 2 or 3) after
      completion of the previous Clinic Visit (1 or 2).

      Subjects must return to the clinic for Clinic Visit 1 within 60 days of the Screening Visit.
      Clinic Visit 2 must occur 7 ± 2 days after the Clinic Visit 1, and Clinic Visit 3 must occur
      7 ± 2 days after Clinic Visit 2.
