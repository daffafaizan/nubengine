      Stroke is the third cause of death and the leading cause of handicap among industrialized
      countries. Spasticity and co-contraction of the rectus femoris muscle following stroke is
      responsible for a lack of knee flexion in the swing phase of gait named stiff knee gait.

      The rectus femoris spasticity is usually treated by oral medications, physical therapy and
      botulinum toxin A injections (1,2). As botulinum toxin A has a transient effect, injections
      must be repeated supporting to promote a permanent surgical treatment such as the rectus
      femoris tenotomy (3). However, no study has evaluate neither compare the effect of the rectus
      femoris tenotomy on gait and on the 3 domains of the International Classification of
      Functioning Disability and Health .

      OBJECTIVE

      To compare the effect of the rectus femoris tenotomy and of the botulinum toxin A injections
      for stiff knee gait after stroke according to the 3 domains of the International
      Classification of Functioning Disability and Health

      METHODS

      The investigators will recruited 20 chronic stroke patients presenting with stiff knee gait.
      The patients will be randomly assigned to a surgical group treated by rectus femoris tenotomy
      (10 patients) and to a medical group treated by rectus femoris botulinum toxin A injections.

      Patients will be assessed before treatment, 2 months and 6 months after treatment by an
      assessor blinded therapist among the 3 domains of the International Classification of
      Functioning Disability and Health

      PERSPECTIVE

      The investigator hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rectus femoris tenotomy as a
      treatment of stiff knee gait after stroke
