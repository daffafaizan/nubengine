      each cycle, because during the procedure the patient is administered fluids, and therefore
      cell counts/ml in the second day might be lower than in the first day; this it is intrinsic
      to the clinical procedure and can not be modified, but will be taken into account in
      statistical analyses. Carry over effect between first and second cycle is not expected, since
      they are performed at least 7 days apart; this allow the patient's cell blood count to be
      restored to baseline values; however, this will also be considered in statistical analyses.
