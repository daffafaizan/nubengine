        -  Assess the feasibility and toxicity of oral combination chemotherapy with granulocyte
           colony-stimulating factor in elderly patients with intermediate and high grade
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive one cycle of oral chemotherapy, 6 weeks in duration. Etoposide
      is given on days 1-3 and cyclophosphamide and procarbazine are given on days 22-31 of each
      cycle. Lomustine is given on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3 only. Filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42 of each
      cycle.

      Patients who have disease progression after one cycle of therapy or at any time thereafter
      are taken off the study. Patients with a complete response after 1 cycle of therapy receive 2
      additional cycles of chemotherapy and are observed off treatment. Patients with a partial
      response (PR) also receive 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy. Following the third cycle of
      chemotherapy, if residual disease is confined to 1 or 2 nodal sites, patients receive
      radiation therapy. All other patients with a PR are treated at investigator's discretion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
