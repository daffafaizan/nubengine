      increase in pain sensitivity with the amplification of neuron-derived signals in the central
      nervous system. With the development of CS, a decrease in the pain threshold and an increase
      in generalized sensitivity occur. There is no method for the diagnosis of CS is accepted as a
      gold standard. Clinical scales and quantitative sensory testing (QST) is used for this
      purpose widely. In addition, the well-known scale used for the evaluation of CS is the
      Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), developed for detect CS in chronic pain patients. The
      use of CSI, which is more practical to use, is becoming widespread because QST takes time, is
      costly and requires experienced practitioners. Considering the place of sensory
      hypersensitivity in the diagnosis of CS and the application difficulties of QST, the Sensory
      Hypersensitivity Scale was developed in 2016. This scale includes 25 questions in the form of
      a Likert scale and questions the increase in modality-specific (touch, taste, hearing, etc.)
      sensitivity as well as the general sensitivity increase. Especially in chronic pain
      conditions, there is an increase in the evidence regarding the development of CS day by day,
      and the need for auxiliary tools in diagnosis is increasing in parallel. In this study, it
      was planned to show the Turkish reliability and validity the Sensory Hypersensitivity Scale.
