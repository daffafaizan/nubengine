      experiment in southern Ohio. In aim 1, we will examine the collaborative strategies
      associated with implementation and service outcomes, given the context with 17 counties
      engaged in the Ohio START pilot project. We will use a convergent mixed methods design, and
      integrate our qualitative and quantitative data using qualitative comparative analysis. For
      aim 2, we will specify the collaborative strategies and develop a decision support guide
      using the VA's model of implementation strategy development (diagnose barriers, and convene
      an expert panel to design strategies). For aim 3, we assess the feasibility, acceptability,
      and appropriateness of the decision support guide using a sequential mixed methods design. In
      the first quantitative phase, we will conduct a randomized vignette experiment with agency
      directors in the 71 Ohio counties that are not involved in the Ohio START pilot project to
      compare the decision support guide with general implementation support. Our second
      qualitative phase (which is dominant), will examine feasibility more in-depth by piloting the
      guide and conducting descriptive case studies with up to three new counties.
