    
      LMB (localized mild breakthrough)is one of two psoriasis adverse events commonly seen in
      efalizumab treated patients. It is generally papular in nature and does not involve existing
      lesions. Clinical experience suggests that LMB may not have a clinical impact in patients
      responding to efalizumab and therefore may be treated without interrupting efalizumab
      therapy. To relieve discomfort topical therapy may be indicated until the symptoms are
      resolved.

      This is a single arm, open label study. Fifteen patients who are receiving efalizumab before
      entrance into this study and who develop LMB wil be enrolled. Topical
      calcipotriene/betamethasone (Taclonex) will be applied to the areas (except face, axillae or
      groin) once a day for two weeks. The PI may choose to continue two more weeks if needed for a
      total of four weeks of therapy. All patients will continue with efalizumab without dose
      modification for the duration of the study. Patients will return for follow up visits at
      weeks 2, 4 and 6. Topical desonide may be used for LMB involvement of the face, groin or
      axillae.
