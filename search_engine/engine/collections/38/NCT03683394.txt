    
      We propose to randomize 200 higher-risk older adults (age 70-89 with low-normal performance
      on cognitive testing and 2+ modifiable risk factors that will be targeted by our
      intervention) to a two-year Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Trial (SMARRT)
      intervention or a Health Education (HE) control.

      The SMARRT team will work with participants randomized to the intervention arm to develop a
      tailored action plan to address risk reduction. Targeted areas will include: increasing
      physical, mental and social activities; controlling cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes,
      hypertension); quitting smoking; reducing depressive symptoms; improving sleep;
      neuroprotective diet; and decreasing use of potentially harmful medications. HE participants
      will receive periodic handouts on these topics by mail.
