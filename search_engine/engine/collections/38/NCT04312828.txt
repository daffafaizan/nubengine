      obtain prospective clinical data at the longest follow-up after treatment, with a minimum
      follow-up of 9 months. This collection will be done during a visit to the office or a phone
      call, depending on the preference of patients and their parents.

      Early data (before the intervention, immediately after, and at 3 months of follow-up) will be
      collected retrospectively in medical records.
