      free of organ support to day 28.

      Hypothesis 1B: APAP or Vitamin C will have a favorable effect on other secondary outcomes
      including pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ dysfunction and biomarkers of inflammation and
      endothelial injury

      The investigators plan to carry out two multi-center phase 2b randomized double-blinded
      placebo-controlled trials of two different pharmacologic therapies within a single platform
      trial.

        1. One trial will assess the efficacy of Acetaminophen (1 gram intravenously every 6 hours)
           for 120 hours in patients with sepsis who have evidence of either hemodynamic or
           respiratory organ failure.

        2. A second trial will assess the efficacy of Vitamin C (50 mg/kg every 6 hours) infused
           intravenously for 120 hours in patients with sepsis who have evidence of either
           hemodynamic or respiratory organ failure.

      For efficiency, both the Acetaminophen and the Vitamin C groups will use a shared placebo
      control group. All arms will have the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. All efficacy
      comparisons will use a pooled placebo group. All safety comparisons will use matching placebo
      group.
