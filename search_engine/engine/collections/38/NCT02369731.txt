      inclusion of their data in a registry. This study is intended to enroll 270 participants
      across ~50 care centers in Europe and other regions over a period of ~ 2 years. The study
      population will include participants who are receiving usual care treatment with commercial
      supply of Translarna (or receiving care within a named participant early access program) and
      who provide consent. Participants will be followed for at least 5 years from their date of
      enrollment. Safety and efficacy data will be collected in conjunction with routine visits
      conducted as per usual care. Although there are no protocol-mandated procedures, it is
      expected that physicians and other caregivers will follow published treatment guidelines and
      standards of care.
