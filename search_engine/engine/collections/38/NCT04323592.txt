    
      Comparison of two groups of patients SARS-CoV-2 positive with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome:

        1. Exposed to low prolonged doses of Methylprednisolone

        2. Not exposed to corticosteroids (standard of care alone)

      The two group will be weighted by means of a propensity score according to:

        1. Sex

        2. Age

        3. C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline

        4. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at baseline

        5. PaO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional
           inspired oxygen)

      Anti-viral agents, chloroquine, respiratory support (any), and antibiotics (any) are allowed
      in each study group. Corticosteroids use, other than per-protocol Methylprednisolone in the
      exposed group is a reason for dropout.

        1. The exposed group is treated with Methylprednisolone at study entry (baseline) according
           to a protocol based on the Italian national recommendations for COVID-19 management: a
           loading dose of 80 mg IV, followed by an infusion of 80 mg/day in 240 mL normal saline
           at 10 mL/h. The infusion is continued for at least eight days and until achieving either
           a PaO2:FiO2 > 350 mmHg or a CRP < 20 mg/L. Treatment is then switched to oral
           administration of Methylprednisolone 16 mg or 20 mg IV twice daily until CRP returns to
           < 20% of normal range and/or PaO2:FiO2 > 400 or SatHbO2 â‰¥ 95%. The decision to apply the
           protocol to Covid-19 is left to the discretion of the treating team for each individual
           patient.

        2. Unexposed patients will be selected from concurrent consecutive COVID-19 patients with
           the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and blinded to outcome data.
