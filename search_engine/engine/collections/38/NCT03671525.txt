      attenuation of prefrontal and parietal cortical activity after nimodipine administration in
      healthy subjects. Investigators hypothesize that acute nimodipine administration will improve
      cortical activation, which will lead to improved cognitive performance. The current study
      will provide insight whether nimodipine or another calcium channel blocker could be used as a
      treatment approach to alleviate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.
