      susceptibility to white matter injury (WMI), a neuropathology typically seen in preterm
      infants. The mechanism of this brain injury is unclear. Newborns with CHD may experience a
      dramatic peri-operative inflammatory response during critical periods of neurodevelopment.
      Experimental models suggest certain pro-inflammatory cytokines can be toxic to developing
      oligodendrocytes, resulting in white matter pathology. The consequence of exposure to the
      systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in this group of patients is unknown; however,
      neuroimaging abnormalities (seen in approximately 40%) and neurodevelopmental impairment
      (noted in approximately 50%) are both well established in children with CHD. We hypothesize
      that term newborns with complex CHD requiring neonatal surgery have WMI due to neurotoxicity
      from the profound peri-operative inflammatory response. These hypotheses will be tested in a
      prospective longitudinal study that will characterize the SIR (Aim 1) in a heterogeneous
      group of congenital lesions/surgeries, assess brain injury in the post-operative period (Aim
      2), asses neurodevelopment outcomes at 1 and 2 years (Aim 3), and determine whether
      inflammation plays a mechanistic role (Aim 2a, 3a).
