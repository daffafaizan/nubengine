      for delivery using a standardized remote therapy package (S-RTI; 1 ED + 5 remote sessions)
      based on a piloted RTI and an adaptive RTI that optimizes bi-weekly dose and intervention
      intensity between four levels of therapy (remote therapy+, remote therapy; automated
      electronic tailored therapy; none) based on a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm [AI-RTI].
      A total of 750 youth (age=14-20) seeking ED care for a violent injury will be enrolled and
      randomly assigned (stratified by age/gender) to the S-RTI (n=250), AI-RTI (n=300), and a
      control (EUC; n=200) condition. In addition to the randomized assignment, all youth will take
      a daily assessment over the course of the intervention timeline. Outcomes will be assessed at
      6 and 12 months.
