      mitochondrial and nuclear genome can explain the lower abundance of ETC and OXPHOS mRNA and
      protein observed in insulin resistant skeletal muscle of overweight/obese and type 2 diabetic
      participants. To determine whether patterns of human skeletal muscle DNA methylation in the
      mitochondrial and nuclear genome are predictive of ETC function. We will isolate skeletal
      muscle mitochondria from metabolically well-characterized lean insulin sensitive,
      overweight/obese insulin resistant nondiabetic and obese insulin resistant type 2 diabetic
      volunteers, and functionally evaluate each ETC complex (I - IV) and complex V (ATP synthase).
