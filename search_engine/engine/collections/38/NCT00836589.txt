    
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, 5-year data collection registry.
      Eligible patients must have been successfully implanted with a Linox Lead System connected to
      a BIOTRONIK ICD and consented and enrolled between 1-45 days following implant. This study is
      designed to be a post-implant (office-based) registry, and patients are meant to be seen
      according to each institution's standard of care, but not to exceed a follow-up time frame of
      every 6 months. At least 2000 patients will be enrolled in this registry, and each patient
      will be followed for five years post-implant.

      Safety will be evaluated based on the analysis of the overall incidence of lead-related
      adverse events that require additional invasive intervention to resolve. In addition, each
      individual adverse event will be separately investigated. Lead parameters for sensing, pacing
      thresholds, and impedance will also be evaluated. An independent Clinical Events Committee
      will review and adjudicate all adverse events that occur during the study according to the
      protocol definitions.
