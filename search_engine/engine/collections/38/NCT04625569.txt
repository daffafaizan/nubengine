      constant-rate i.v. infusion of 2 L of 0.9% NaCl was carried out in 2 hours. BP (mean of 3
      measurements taken 3 minutes apart) was measured every 30 minutes during the 2 hours of
      loading and 3 times at 3-min intervals at the end of the infusion. These last 3 BP values
      were averaged and used in the analysis.

      The results of these tests will be added to an already collected database of salt load test
      collected in the previous studies (already published)
