      ability to lyse flexor tendon adhesions in zone II of the hand.

      Results indicate that two of three subjects had improved range of finger motion at the PIP
      and DIP joints. This may obviate the need for patients to have tenolysis hand surgery to
      correct the finger flexion contracture of the PIP and DIP joints. Detailed controlled studies
      remain to be done.
