      vascular calcification. The vascular damage, in turn, contributes to significant
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of end-stage renal disease patients. Calcimimetics has
      been suggested to lower the risk of vascular calcification. Role of cinacalcet was
      demonstrated in animal model but human data are lacking. We design an open label pilot study
      to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately
      controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is
      the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.
