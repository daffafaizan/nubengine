      the investigators will use Single voxel short, echo time(TE) proton spectroscopy. This MR
      Spectroscopy (MRS) will be conducted in the vertebral body of L5 and in the neck of the
      femur.

      To assess the qualitative scores and compare it to the quantitative MR Spectroscopy (MRS)
      results the investigators will use a series of Fluid sensitive and Fat sensitive conventional
      MR sequences that will allows us to determine indirectly the degree of glucocerebrosidase
      infiltration.
