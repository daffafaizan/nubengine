      present in the ICU on the day in April 2020 with the highest number of COVID-19 patients in
      the unit. Data can be entered in the database until July 2020. Retrospective data collection
      and entry is allowed.

      Subjects believed to fulfill all eligibility criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria,
      detailed in the relevant section of this protocol, will be included in the study.

      Data will be entered in the database anonymously.

      Data will consist of two core elements:

        1. Center data (to be completed once)

        2. Patient data

      For different domains with specific, highly relevant and un(der)explored ICU research
      questions, an focused data set is to be completed. These domains include:

        1. Respiratory

        2. Coagulation and thrombo-embolic events

        3. Infectious complications

        4. Rehabilitation
