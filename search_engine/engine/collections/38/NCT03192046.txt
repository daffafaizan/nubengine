    
      This is a randomized, repeated measures, matched group study. There will be two groups of
      participants, 8 participants per group, 35 participants total from time of initial enrollment
      in this study. Group one (G1) will receive bilateral custom braces and a standardized home
      walking/exercise program. Group two will receive the standardized walking/exercise program
      without any brace or AFO. Subjects will be randomized upon enrollment in the study. At the
      time of consent, random drawing from concealed envelopes with red, blue or green chips will
      be done to determine group assignment. Subjects will be recruited through the Clinical Center
      for Movement Disorders at UT Southwestern Medical Center where patients with PD receive
      routine evaluation and follow-up. Subjects will be followed for 6 months during this study
      and outcome measures will be collected 3 times over the course of the study. Subjects will be
      seen every 3 months for the duration of the study for testing as well as for other visits as
      noted in the table below. Participants will not need to have insurance benefits for initial
      physical therapy evaluation and for ankle braces. All subsequent visits to the Crowley gait
      lab for assessments and brace adjustment will be provided at no cost to the participants.
