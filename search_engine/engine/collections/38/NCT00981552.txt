      cervix cancer, however with traditional techniques large volumes of bowel and bladder are
      irradiated causing short-term and long-term genito-urinary and gastro-intestinal side
      effects. IMRT has the potential to conform precisely to the target and spare normal tissues
      and reduce side effects. However because there are large dose gradients there is the
      potential to miss the target due to organ motion. Recent studies have documented organ motion
      and will be used to define the target. Approximately 60 planning scans, previously used to
      treat patients with cervix cancer, will be used to replan using an IMRT technique and
      differences in doses to tumour and normal tissues compared.
