      monopolar radiofrequency probe (1.2 mm Habib EUS-RFA catheter) placed through a 19 or 22
      gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle once FNA was performed in patients with a tumor in
      the head of the pancreas. The device had been certificated by the European Union (EU) and
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2015. The endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
      - radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a 1 Fr wire with a working length of 190 cm, which can be
      inserted through the biopsy channel of a EUS. RF power is applied to the electrode at the end
      of the wire to coagulate tissue in the liver and pancreas. In this study, the investigators
      will enroll 20 patients to receiving EUS-RFA of pancreatic neoplasms with the monopolar RF
      probe. The follow-up period will be one year with regular monitoring. Our primary endpoint
      will be to evaluate pancreatic tumor ablation effect, Secondary objectives will be to
      evaluate the mortality and morbidity.
