      caregivers for HF self-management. Recommendations of the American College of
      Cardiology/American Heart Association emphasize shared decision-making. In the previous
      preliminary study, coding of actual recordings of Veterans speaking with HT nurse care
      coordinators provided evidence of best practices and areas for improvement for intervention
      development. The effect of the HT technology as a mediator of Veteran-nurse communication
      requires particular re-framing in communication skills training to promote shared
      decision-making and self-management as recommended. This quasi-experimental study proposes
      the development of an evidence-based intervention to enhance HT training tailored for more
      effective communication for HF self-management and related outcomes.

      Goals:

      Phase 1 To conduct a pilot study as a quasi-experimental trial at two VAMC HT sites to
      determine acceptability, actual use, implementation, practicality, integration, potential for
      expansion, effect sizes and limited efficacy for an HT-specific communication skills
      intervention for HF Specific Aim 1.1a Development: Adapt components from the Rochester
      Participatory Decision-Making Scale (RPAD) and recent advances in communication skills
      training for chronic disease to develop a valid and reliable intervention specific to HT
      shared decision-making and telehealth communication using established best-practices and
      Veteran input; Specific Aim 1.1b Training/Implementation: Implement the developed
      intervention at two VAMCs; Specific Aim 1.2Booster: Introduce an audit and feedback loop of
      HF self-management outcomes for telehealth nurse practice as a booster to reinforce
      communication skills training.

      Phase 2 To compare changes in Veteran outcomes after a telehealth communication skills
      intervention with documented previous practice for differences in: a) shared decision-making;
      b) Veteran perception of communication, education and self-management for HF, c) quality of
      life, and d) health service utilization and related costs before and after intervention
      Specific Aim 2.1: Formative Evaluation: Nurses: Conduct anonymous surveys of knowledge of HF
      and self-management strategies before and after training, qualitative interviews of reactions
      to the training course, and nurse care coordinator focus groups about the value of audit and
      feedback sessions after training.

      Specific Aim 2.2: Formative Evaluation: Veterans - Phone record 25 Veterans with HF at two HT
      sites, for a total of 50 Veterans, speaking with nurse care coordinators before and after
      communication skills training followed by communication coding and discourse analysis.

      Specific Aim 2.3: Summative Evaluation: Compare shared decision-making scores (SDM) measured
      by the RPAD, communication scores measured by the Four Habits Coding Scheme (FHCS), quality
      of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire), communication, education and
      self-management in HF as measured by the Improving Chronic Illness Care Evaluation (ICICE)
      scale, and patient HF hospitalization use (admissions and emergency) and with pre-training
      averages and with the post training averages at 1 and 3 months Rationale The technology of HT
      monitoring of Veterans with HF can inadvertently decrease participative communication
      consistent with shared decision-making and HF self-management. Application of communication
      skills training using evidence-based coach role competencies promises to improve Veteran
      engagement and participation in the VA Home Telehealth service with increased self-management
      and potential improvement in HF health service utilization. Improving engagement and
      participation in self-management should result in a quantifiably better Veteran quality of
      life, a reduction in hospital and ED admissions, and thus, a decrease in health care
      utilization costs for the VA.
