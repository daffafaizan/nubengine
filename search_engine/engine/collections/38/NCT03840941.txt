      symptoms and airflow limitation. Frailty defines a clinical syndrome characterized by
      multiple system effects, leading to decreased functional reserve and increased sensitivity to
      dependence or mortality following minor stress events. Inflammation, lack of physical
      activity, reduced exercise efficiency and maximum oxygen uptake may contribute to the
      development of frailty in patients with COPD. Balance, cognition and activities of daily
      living are associated with COPD.

      This study will evaluate the effect of frailty on balance, cognition and activities of daily
      living in patients with COPD.
