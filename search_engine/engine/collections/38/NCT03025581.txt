      (patients desire an active approach will be excluded).

      All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control group.
      They will be followed from the time of presentation with rupture of membranes at the ER and
      until the time of delivery. Prophylactic antibiotics will be administered after 18 hours from
      rupture of membranes as per departmental policy.

      On admission, and after validating inclusion criteria, women will be offered to join the
      study. For the intervention group women will be instructed to gently massage alternate
      breasts, especially around the nipples for 15 minutes every 6 hours until the appearance of
      regular contractions but not more than 24 hours. Moist cloth or lubricating or moisturizing
      cream will be offered to facilitate the procedure according to individual preferences. In the
      control group all participants will be asked to avoid any breast stimulation during the study
      period.

      For both groups maternal surveillance will include obstetrician assessment every 6 hours or
      per maternal request if painful contractions. Every assessment will include documenting
      maternal vital signs, sense of contraction, fetal cardiotocographic assessment and vaginal
      examination if painful contractions. After delivery,all participants will be requested to
      fill a satisfaction questionnaire.
