      associated with the risk of peri-operative complications such as death, stroke, myocardial
      infarction, neurocognitive decline, and extended hospitalization. Bypass surgery on the
      beating heart without the use of the heart lung machine (off-pump surgery) has been
      reintroduced in clinical practice in order to reduce these complications. The Octopus cardiac
      wall stabilizer, developed at the UMC Utrecht, facilitates the safe construction of the
      grafts during the off-pump procedure. The expected advantages of off-pump surgery e.g.
      less-invasiveness, complete arterial revascularization, faster recovery and lower costs were
      the basis for the Octostent trial. We hypothesized that the off-pump surgical technique might
      offer an alternative for angioplasty with bare-metal stent-implantation.

      The current study was designed as a randomized controlled multicenter trial comparing two
      strategies.
