    
      Up to 5000 PillCam SB3 videos (including PillCam reports) and raw data files will be
      collected in up to 25 medical centers in the US. Study duration is up to 3 years from IRB
      approval.

      Medical center study sites will provide relevant videos (including PillCam reports) and raw
      data from patients who underwent SB3 procedures. Study subjects will not undergo any
      additional procedures, nor will their diagnosis and subsequent treatment pathway be changed
      for the purpose of the registry.

      The data will be used by MDT GIs research and development team for the development and
      validation of improved and new detectors in the PillCam software.

      The videos (including PillCam reports) and raw data files will be de-identified at the
      medical center by representatives who are authorized and delegated to review medical records,
      prior to providing them to the sponsor. Videos, reports and raw data files will be
      de-identified in a manner that is untraceable by the sponsor clinical study team members.
