        -  Validate an interview-based electric and magnetic field exposure (EMF) assessment
           algorithm against measurements of the time-weighted average magnetic field magnitude
           used in previous epidemiologic studies.

        -  Calibrate the parameters in the algorithm in order to improve the exposure estimates.

        -  Correlate EMF exposure estimates from the algorithm with biologically based metrics
           measured by new instrumentation.

      OUTLINE: Participants respond to questions during a 5- to 15-minute telephone interview
      concerning workplace exposure to electric and magnetic (EMF) fields. Data is collected during
      the interview using an exposure assessment algorithm designed to estimate EMF workplace
      exposure based on participants' responses. The interview-based estimates are then validated
      against actual field measurements of magnetic field exposure captured by Emdex multiwave
      monitors located at participating sites.
