      manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to
      dose, population and indication, and following the local prescription and/or reimbursement
      guidance.

      Follow-up visits are not strictly scheduled, but rather left to the judgment of each
      investigator within the 12-month study period for each participant. Five visits are indicated
      within the 12-month observational period: Baseline and follow-up at 3 months, 6 months, 9
      months and at 12 months (Study End).

      As nails are not included in the general measures of disease severity (such as Psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index [PASI]), the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) will be used to assign
      a score of nail psoriasis. The scalp, though being involved in the general measures of
      disease severity (e.g. PASI), represents only 4-5% of the body surface and is therefore
      poorly represented. Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) will be used to quantify the
      intensity of scalp psoriasis and its changes during the study. The association between
      general skin and localized nail and scalp, and changes in quality of life in response to
      adalimumab therapy will also be examined.
