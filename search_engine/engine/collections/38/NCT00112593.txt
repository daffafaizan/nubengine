      I. To determine the safety of treating high-risk HIV1-infected patients with 200 centigray
      (cGy) TBI plus post-transplant MMF/CSP.

      II. To determine whether 200 cGy TBI plus post-transplant MMF/CSP results in stable mixed
      donor lymphocyte chimerism (5-95% donor cluster of differentiation [CD]3) in high-risk human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the kinetics of immune reconstitution following a non-lethal conditioning
      regimen in HIV1-infected patients.

      II. To determine the effect of a non-lethal conditioning regimen on viral load.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      -4, -3, and -2. Patients undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: After completion of TBI, patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (PO) 2 to 3 times daily on days
      -3 to 99 with taper beginning on day 100 and continuing until day 177 in the absence of
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Beginning within 6 hours after transplantation, patients also
      receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO 3 times daily on days 0 to 40 followed by a taper in
      the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 1 year.
