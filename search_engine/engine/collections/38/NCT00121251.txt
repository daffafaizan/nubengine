      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of sorafenib
      administered in combination with gemictabine and capecitabine in patients with advanced renal
      cell carcinoma.

      II. Determine the objective response rate for sorafenib in combination with gemictabine and
      capecitabine in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

      III. Determine the duration of overall survival and progression free survival in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, non-randomized, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a
      phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive sorafenib* orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, gemcitabine
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib, gemcitabine, and capecitabine
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      Note: *Patients who complete at least 3 courses of treatment with objective response or
      stable disease but are deemed poor candidates for continued chemotherapy may continue
      treatment with sorafenib

      PHASE II: Patients receive sorafenib 200mg orally twice a day on days 1-21, gemcitabine 750
      mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 & 8, and capecitabine 415 mg/m2 orally twice a day on days 1-14
      of each 21 day cycle, as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed periodically.
