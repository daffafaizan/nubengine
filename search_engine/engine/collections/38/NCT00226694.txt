      alcoholism. However, no published studies in alcohol dependent patients have examined sex
      differences in stress responsiveness that most likely mediate these effects and influence the
      clinical course and treatment of the disorder.

      The long-range goal of this research program is to define aspects of the neural, genetic and
      environmental mechanisms differentially regulating the stress response in alcohol dependent
      women and men. The proposed study extends prior work revealing sex-dependent alterations in
      basal and serotonin-induced stress hormone concentrations in abstinent alcoholics. Our
      central hypothesis is that sex differences in serotonin function or HPA sensitivity conspire
      with genetically influenced alterations in serotonin signaling to produce maladaptive stress
      responses in some alcoholic women. These altered stress responses may serve as the target of
      novel, sex-specific pharmacotherapies.
