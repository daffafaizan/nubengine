      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of AMG 386
      (trebananib) in combination with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of both drugs when administered in combination,
      with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further
      exploration and validation in future trials.

      II. To explore preliminary anti-tumor activity of both drugs when administered at the RP2D to
      patients with advanced endometrial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or carcinoid tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trebananib.

      Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and temsirolimus IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
