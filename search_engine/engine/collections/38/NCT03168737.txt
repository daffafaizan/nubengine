    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of PET-CT using 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) and
      to determine the optimal imaging time to detect hypoxia in solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the variability of imaging findings from repeated [18F]FAZA PET-CT studies
      over >= 24 hours up to 10 days.

      II. To confirm the safety of [18F]FAZA administered during PET-CT imaging of hypoxia of solid
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside intravenously (IV) and after 60
      minutes undergo 5 PET-CT scans at 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes on days 1 and 2.

      GROUP B: Patients receive 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside IV and after 60 minutes undergo 5 or
      less PET-CT scans on day 1 and 5 or less PET-CT scans >= 24 hours later up to 10 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours and at 30 days.
