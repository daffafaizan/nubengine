    
      This is randomized-controlled trial of Absorb速 Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) vs.
      Sequent Please速 drug coated balloon in an all-comers population with in-stent-restenosis
      (ISR). The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and the investigators intend to
      include 150 patients.

      All patients presenting with ISR and requiring percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      eligible to be included in this study. This will include patients with stable angina and
      those presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of the Absorb速
      bioresorbable scaffold compared to the Sequent Please速 Drug Coated Balloon when treating
      patients with In-Stent-Restenosis regards to primary endpoint - angiographic late lumen loss
      at 9 month follow-up.
