      I. To provide a risk classification scheme for all patients with newly diagnosed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which will be used to assign treatment on Children?s Oncology
      Group (COG) frontline ALL treatment studies.

      II. To capture classification data for correlative studies accompanying current COG ALL
      treatment protocols.

      III. To provide a central reference guide for all required and research studies that will be
      conducted in local and reference laboratories for all newly diagnosed ALL patients.

      IV. To provide a mechanism for optional banking of leukemia and germline specimens for
      current and future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood sample collection and bone marrow biopsies at baseline and during and
      after induction therapy for immunophenotyping for ALL confirmation and classification,
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy, genomic variation, and cytogenetic (BCR-ABL, trisomies
      4+10, and molecular testing for translocations) analysis by flow cytometry and fluorescent in
      situ hybridization (FISH). Immunophenotype results obtained on this study are used to
      determine patient's assignment to specific clinical-trial treatments. Some samples (leukemic
      and germline) may be banked for current and/or future analyses.
