    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in
      adult hospitalized patients with ABSSSIs. Randomization was stratified by study site and type
      of ABSSSI (with major cutaneous abscess comprising â‰¤ 30% of the Intent-to-Treat [ITT]
      population).

      Primary endpoint for FDA: Early clinical response based on the percent reduction in lesion
      size at 48-72 hours compared to baseline in patients who did not receive rescue therapy and
      were alive, in the ITT population.

      Primary endpoint for EMA: Investigator-assessed clinical success at the test-of-cure (TOC)
      visit 15-22 days after randomization, in the co-primary ITT and Clinically Evaluable (CE)
      populations.
