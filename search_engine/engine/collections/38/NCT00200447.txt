    
      This is a pilot evaluation of dopaminergic function in PD using a bolus plus constant
      infusion protocol with [123I]-IBZM and SPECT to evaluate the potential for carbidopa/l-dopa
      alone or carbidopa/l-dopa/entacapone to produce displacement of striatal radioactivity for
      assessment of intrasynaptic dopamine. We will assess the feasibility of this paradigm for
      detecting l-dopa effects on the SPECT signal in subjects with PD with disease duration of
      greater than 4yrs and with a stable response to L-dopa. Each subject will undergo three
      [123I]-IBZM studies separated by 1-2 weeks. Subjects will be off medication for at least 12 h
      prior to study For each of the three scan days patients will receive a constant intravenous
      infusion of [123I]-IBZM over 4-5 hours to establish an equilibrium binding condition of the
      radiotracer at striatal D2/D3 receptors. Three baseline SPECT acquisitions will be obtained
      prior to medication dosing to establish a stable baseline. At approximately 5 h after the
      initiation of the infusion subjects will receive a single oral dose of either
      carbidopa/levodopa (37.5mg/150mg or 50mg/250mg), or carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone (either
      37.5mg/150mg/200mg- STALEVO or 50/250mg/200mg).
