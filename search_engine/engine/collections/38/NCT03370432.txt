      thoroughly investigated in both observational and experimental studies, but the results are
      conflicting. Genetic epidemiology is an advantageous alternative to randomized, clinical
      trials for ethical and economic reasons.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether polymorphisms in GC and CYP2R1 that predicts
      25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) concentrations after both ultraviolet B radiation and
      consumption of vitamin D3-fortified bread and milk in Danes are associated with risk of CRC;
      and further, to examine whether intake of vitamin D through diet and supplementation alter
      the risk of CRC.

      Data are retrieved from the Danish prospective "Diet, Cancer and Health" study encompassing
      57,053 persons which were recruited between 1993 to 1997. Between 1994 and 31th December
      2009, 1038 CRC cases has been diagnosed. A sub-cohort of 1857 persons has been randomly
      selected within the full cohort at time of entry into the cohort. The study design is a
      nested case-cohort study.
