    
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD), predominantly due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, is a leading
      cause of mortality in the United States and around the world. Catheter ablation of
      ventricular arrhythmias has proven efficacious in reducing the burden of arrhythmias and
      reducing implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) shocks.

      The aim of this study is to create a prospective international database registry that will
      allow for better assessment of the outcomes of catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias.
      The registry, with approximately 30 participating centers, will help to identify the overall
      success rates and associated benefits of the procedure and provide more comprehensive data on
      understudied populations and treatment.
