        1. The collaborative care concept is feasable in the context of the german health care
           system and leads to greater patient satisfaction

        2. The team-based intervention leads to a decrease of cardiovascular risk factors of
           patients in the intervention group compared to participants in the waitlist condition

        3. The collaborative care intervention leads to an improvement of quality of life as well
           as mental well being of participants in the intervention group compared to participants
           of the waitlist condition
