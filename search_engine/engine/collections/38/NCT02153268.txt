      safe under the following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no
      significant changes in complete blood count (CBC) and in general health.

      Secondary endpoint: The implantation of BonoFill to the maxillary or mandible void is
      efficient under the following conditions: Following BonoFill implantation, the bone
      regeneration in the operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids
      were filled with a significant amount of bone tissue.
