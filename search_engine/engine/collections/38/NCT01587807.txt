    
      This study will be a randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of inhaled GSK1995057 in
      healthy subjects. The study consists of 2 parts with a total of 6 cohorts. Part 1 will be
      conducted singleblind and Part 2 will be conducted single-blind with restrictions (i.e.
      subject and investigator only). The GSK Study Team and site pharmacist will remain unblinded
      to treatment allocation. Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 (in Part 1) will receive a single inhaled dose
      of GSK1995057 or placebo. Cohort 5 will receive a single inhaled dose of GSK1995057 and in
      addition will have a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling procedure conducted approximately
      30 minutes post GSK1995057 dose. Subjects in Cohort 6 (Part 2) will be randomised to receive
      a high dose of GSK1995057 or placebo followed by an inhaled LPS challenge and BAL sampling
      procedure. Subjects will be required to visit the clinic over the course of 28 days after
      their dosing period for a follow up. Further visits for immunogenicity sampling may be
      conducted at 56 and 84 days post-first dose for subjects who show changes indicating a
      positive ADA response after dosing. Doses levels stipulated within the protocol are target
      doses based on predictions using the PK/PD model described in Section 1.2.2 of the clinical
      protocol. Part 1 will commence first and following acceptable safety and tolerability data
      will allow initiation of Part 2. All cohorts will participate in a single study session only.
