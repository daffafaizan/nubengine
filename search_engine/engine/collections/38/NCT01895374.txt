      treatments. Comparing with hydrocolloid dressing material, which is the most widely used
      after laser treatment now, amniotic membrane will show better efficacy. Thus, with amniotic
      membrane, epithelization time will shorten and redness which is usually left after laser will
      disappear quickly.
