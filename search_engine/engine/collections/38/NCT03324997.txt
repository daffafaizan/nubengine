      wrinkles in the face. This study seeks to investigate the safety and efficacy of the
      injectable device in the chest for similar effects. Participants will undergo three
      treatments with Restylane Silk and results will be measured clinically and with Optical
      Coherence Tomography (an FDA-cleared non-invasive imaging device). Participants will receive
      randomized injections with the Restylane Silk product on half of the chest and will receive
      placebo injections on the other half. At the six-month period, participants will have the
      option to receive treatment with the product on the placebo side. At the 12-month period,
      participants may also elect for three additional touch-up treatments, which will not be
      counted as part of the study. If the chest is asymmetric in regards to wrinkles, the
      investigators will still proceed with the protocol because they are also comparing each side
      to itself prior to treatment, instead of simply comparing one side to the other.
