      been evaluated as the standard surgical procedure for lung surgery. The advantages of VATS
      prodecures compared with open thoracotomy are rapid recovery, short hospital stay and low
      complication risk. Although VATS is less painful than thoracotomy, patients may feel severe
      pain during the first hours at postoperative period. Analgesia management is very important
      for these patients in postoperative period since insufficient analgesia can cause pulmonary
      complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia and increased oxygen consumption.

      Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a novel block and was first described by Elsharkawy et
      al. Local anesthetic solution is administrated between the rhomboid muscle and intercostal
      muscles over the T5-6 ribs 2-3 cm medially of the medial border of the scapula. RIB targets
      both the posterior rami and lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic nerves and provides
      analgesia for the hemithorax from T2 to T9. It has been reported that RIB may provide
      effective analgesia management for several surgeries like thoracotomy.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy US-guided Rhomboid intercostal block
      compared to no intervention control group for postoperative analgesia management after VATS.
      The primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic
      reaction, nausea, vomiting) and complications due to block (pneumothorax, hematoma etc).
