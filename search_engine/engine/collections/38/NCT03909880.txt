      force output and joint position sense due to sensorimotor control. In addition, people with
      better sensorimotor control have lower risk of injury.

      According to some researches, the investigators can improve wrist sensorimotor control with
      kinesio taping. However, there is no study comparing whether kinesio taping with additional
      tension improve sensorimotor control more than kinesio taping with neutral tension. In
      addition, many wrist movements in life are related to grip and the dominant muscle of
      grasping is wrist flexor. No research explores whether improving wrist sensorimotor control
      with kinesio taping on wrist flexor. Therefore, the investigators want to explore the effect
      of kinesio taping on wrist flexor sensorimotor control in healthy people.
