    
      This is the second phase of another study - 'Zero-time Exercise on Inactive Adults With
      Insomnia Disorder'.

      In the first phase (baseline to week 8), 136 subjects will be randomly allocated to the ZTEx
      intervention or the sleep hygiene education (SHE) comparison group. They will receive two
      2-hour ZTEx training or SHE lessons and practice ZTEx or follow the sleep hygiene instruction
      for 24 weeks.

      The second phase of the study (weeks 9-24)will commence after completion of the assessment of
      the RCT at week 8. Subjects in the Zero-time Exercise (ZTEx) group will be randomly divided
      into either an ZTEx with WhatsApp reminder (ZTEx+R) group or an ZTEx without WhatsApp
      reminder (ZTEx alone) group to evaluate the effects of WhatsApp reminders on exercise
      adherence and sleep and related outcomes.
