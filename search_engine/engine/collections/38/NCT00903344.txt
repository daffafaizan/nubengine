      pronounced in women of child bearing age as well as pregnant women in the United States. This
      study will provide important information about whether vitamin D supplementation may
      positively impact the normal physiologic loss of bone mass that is observed during lactation.

      Recruitment will begin while subjects are pregnant in order to expedite entry into the study
      in the immediate post-partum period. If subjects are deemed eligible during pregnancy,
      contact information to include name, address, expected delivery date and two contact phone
      numbers will be obtained. Subjects will be contacted two weeks prior to expected delivery
      date and then again at expected delivery date. Subjects will be followed for a total of 18
      months.
