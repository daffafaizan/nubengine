    
      This is a bioequivalence study designed to compare three solid states of ARQ 197 in normal
      healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover design.

      The primary objective is to obtain pharmacokinetic data to assess bioequivalence among three
      solid states of ARQ 197: amorphous, crystalline polymorph A and crystalline polymorph B.
