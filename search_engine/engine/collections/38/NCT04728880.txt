      significant morbidity and mortality. To date there is no approved medication for the
      treatment of patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide
      analogue that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity among a diverse group of RNA
      viruses. Non-clinical and clinical data suggest that Remdesivir may be useful for the
      treatment of COVID-19. WHO has identified Remdesivir as a candidate drug of interest to be
      studied in clinical trials. This retrospective study is designed to analyze the data
      collected during the routine care of patients who have benefited from this therapy.
