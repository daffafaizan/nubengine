      present with intermediate or advanced disease. Percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency
      ablation, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) are not considered as a
      curative treatment and have achieved very limited success in eradicating large HCC.

      Two phase III trials were shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with
      advanced HCC. Median overall survival was significantly 2 to 3 months longer in the sorafenib
      group than that in the placebo. It is interesting to recognize the combined therapeutic
      effect of TACE with sorafenib. The proposed study will make an important contribution to
      understanding not only the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in addition to TACE in patients
      diagnosed with unresectable HCC, but this will also be the first clinical trial prospectively
      to compare the effectiveness of sorafenib combined with TACE with that of TACE alone in the
      treatment of unresectable HCC
