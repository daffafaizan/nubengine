      respiratory physiological benefits, including gains in RM strength and endurance (Larson, et
      al., 1999; Sheel, 2002; Watsford, et al., 2005; Lacasse et al., 2006). This benefit appears
      to be greater when general exercise conditioning is combined with specific RM training
      (Weiner, et al., 1992; Wanke, et al., 1994; Larson, et al., 1999; Hill y Eastwood, 2005;
      O'Brien, et al., 2008). However, many frail elderly are not able to perform general aerobic
      exercise, related or not to ADL, as it is mentioned above (e.g., institutionalized elderly
      with comorbidities, functional impairment and RM weakness). In this case, specific RM
      training may be used as a beneficial alternative to maintain or improve RM function (Watsford
      and Murphy, 2008), and thus prevent deterioration in this functionally impaired elderly.

      The most commonly used techniques of specific RM training are: a) isocapnic hyperpnoea (Leith
      and Bradley, 1976; Belman and Mittman, 1980), b) respiratory resistive loading (Pardy, et
      al., 1981; Sonne and Davis, 1982; Belman, et al., 1986), and c) respiratory threshold loading
      (Clanton, et al., 1985; Chen, et al., 1985; Martyn, et al., 1987; Larson, et al., 1988).
      Apart from these three well-known techniques, other less studied types of exercise such as
      the controlled breathing exercises of Yoga, Pranayama, may also be added to this list
      (Kulpati, et al., 1982; Manocha, et al., 2002; Donesky-Cueco, et al., 2009).
