    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RPh201
      after single and multiple ascending doses. This study is designed with sufficient time in
      between dose escalations to allow for an interim analysis of safety and tolerability data as
      this is considered the safest approach to assess the effects of a compound with an undefined
      mechanism and therapeutic target.

      This protocol is written with some flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of
      Phase I clinical studies. Modifications to the dose, dosing regimen, and/or clinical or
      laboratory procedures currently outlined below may be required to achieve the scientific
      goals of the study objectives and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of the study
      subjects. Interim safety analyses will guide dose escalation/reduction in the trial.
