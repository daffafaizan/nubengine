      in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer through clinical registration along with real
      world study.

      The patients who suffer from advanced gastric cancer often have a very short time survival .
      Their total survival time is only 4.3 months after the best supportive care. At present
      palliative chemotherapy is still the main method for advanced gastric cancer .

      In recent years, the results of international multi center phase III clinical trial show that
      the patients with combination chemotherapy have 8.6 months to 13.0 months survival time.

      In China, the clinical curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of
      advanced gastric cancer has been part of affirmation. Some reports with large samples of
      clinical research show that the Traditional Chinese Medicine may prolong the survival and
      improve the quality of life in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

      Real World Study emphasizes in epidemiological theories, clinical observational study,
      cross-sectional study and cohort study. The observational study of registry (registry study
      in clinical practice) is particularly widely used.

      Clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer
      often relies on the accumulation of years of medical experiences and sometimes new treatment
      measures. There must be some objective evidences that with reasonable design, rigorous
      process, scientific statistics to evaluate the value of traditional Chinese medicine
      intervention in the comprehensive treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients in order to
      meet the needs of clinical practice and medical development in China.
