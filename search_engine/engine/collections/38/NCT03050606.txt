      hyperalgesia and allodynia. Physical exercises are recommended as the first choice of
      non-pharmacological therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness
      and cost-effectiveness of modified Pilates method exercises compared to aerobic exercise in
      the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. For this, the following outcomes of 98 patients
      will be evaluated by a blinded evaluator at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after
      randomization: fibromyalgia impact assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, pain
      intensity assessed by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale, kinesiophobia assessed by the Tampa
      Scale for Kinesiophobia, specific disability assessed by the Patient-Specific Functional
      Scale, functional capacity assessed by the 6-minute Walk Test, quality of sleep assessed by
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life assessed by the
      EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D questionnaires. Participants will be randomly divided into Aerobic Group,
      who will perform aerobic exercises on treadmills and/or stationary bikes, and Pilates Group,
      which will perform exercises of the modified Pilates method. Both groups will be treated for
      eight weeks, twice a week. The hypothesis is that Pilates exercises will be as effective as
      aerobic exercise in the improvement of clinical outcomes, and that this improvement will be
      maintained over the medium to long term. It is also expected that aerobic exercises will be
      more cost-effective.
