      glaucoma refractory to medical therapy. All surgeries were performed by two groups of
      surgeons at Johns Hopkins University and the sub-investigator group at New York University.
      Group 1: Xen with open conjunctiva for positioning and application of mitomycin. The Xen was
      placed through the sclera either ab-interno or ab-externa. Group 2 had Xen placed ab-interno
      or ab-externa (trans conjunctival), but the conjunctiva was not opened for positioning or
      application of mitomycin-C.

      Success rates will be determined based on need for re-intervention and intraocular pressure
      control.
