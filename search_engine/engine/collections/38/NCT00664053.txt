      frailty on bone, muscle and balance loss. The mechanism of the effects may be direct -
      working through androgen or estrogen receptors in bone, muscle or brain. Or the effects may
      be indirect, countering effects of the stress response.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) supplementation
           and/or Hatha yoga on muscle strength, balance, body composition and physical performance
           measures over 6 months in women with osteopenia and some degree of frailty

        2. To determine the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) supplementation and/or
           Hatha yoga on function (physical and cognitive), bone metabolism, and cardiovascular
           risk factors.
