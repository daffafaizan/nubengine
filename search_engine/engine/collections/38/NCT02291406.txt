      place in the gynecological ward of Orebro University hospital according to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. 20 patients will be enrolled. All participants are randomized between
      robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.

      The main purpose of this study are to determine if robotic assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy
      induces less insulin resistance compare to abdominal hysterectomy. Both patients with benign
      and malignant disease are included. In addition inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and CRP are
      measured and clinical recovery is measured.

      Each patient will be studied twice using the hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp, a method
      that now is the gold standard for determining insulin sensitivity. During the clamp insulin
      is infused intravenously to attain an elevation at levels seen after an abnormal meal. At the
      same time glucose is infused to balance the effect of insulin and to maintain normal blood
      glucose level. The amount of the glucose infusion needed is the level of insulin sensitivity.
      The clamp procedure is performed before surgery as a control measure and the morning after
      surgery to yield the relative change in insulin sensitivity caused by the operation
      (postoperative insulin resistance). Before the onset of the infusion, and after 60 minutes of
      steady state during insulin stimulation, blood is collected for the analysis of immune
      function. This is also collected 3 hours after surgery.

      A 6 minutes walk test is performed before surgery and the day after surgery, in order to
      determine a more clinical measure on recovery.

      In addition demographic and clinical data are systematically collected during the hospital
      stay and 30 days after.
