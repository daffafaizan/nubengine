      metastasis will be enrolled onto the study after providing informed consent. Primary tumor
      histology types are restricted to those known to extracranially respond to immunotherapy, and
      will include, but not be limited to, squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      non-squamous NSCLC that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+), epidermal growth
      factor receptor positive (EGFR+), and ROS negative, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, and
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is programmed death-ligand 1 positive (PD-L1 +).
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 (20 participants per arm) to either the neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy (arm 1) or standard of care (no neoadjuvant immunotherapy; arm 2). Patients in
      arm 1 will receive a single infusion of nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at a
      dose of 1 mg/kg 7 days (Â±3 days) prior to surgical resection of their metastases.
      Approximately three weeks after resection, patients in both arms will then receive SRS per
      standard of care guidelines. After SRS, patients will continue on a maintenance treatment
      with an immunotherapy regimen at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will be
      followed for up to 18 months after initiating study treatment.
