      randomized to receive normal saline (n=30), remifentanil 0.35 Î¼g/kg (n=30), esmolol 0.5 mg/kg
      (n=30), or Esmolol 1mg/kg (n=30) as pretreatment. Thirty seconds after pretreatment, 25% of
      the total calculated dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administrated into a dorsal hand vein.
      Ten seconds after propofol had been given at the rate of 0.5 ml/sec pain was assessed on a
      four-point scale (0=none, 1 = mild, 2= moderate, 3= severe).
