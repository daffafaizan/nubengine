      more than 14 days) washout in between: 1) uninterrupted sitting (SIT); 2) uninterrupted
      sitting with a cognitive task (COGN); 3) sitting interrupted by light physical activity
      (INTERRUPT). For the SIT and INTERRUPT conditions, subjects watch a series of documentaries
      while sitting. In the COGN condition, while sitting, participants undergo the online GED test
      as cognitive load. Four cognitive tests (D2 test, stroop test, trail making test and 2-BACK
      test) and mood states will be performed before and after each intervention. On a separate
      day, using surface electromyography, activations of major leg and trunk muscles of sitting on
      chair, active and passive sitting on a yoga ball and walking were assessed.
