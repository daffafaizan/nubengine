      Paul area. This research will be conducted at the Tobacco Research Center at the University
      of Minnesota. Regular smokeless tobacco users will be screened over the phone. If eligible
      after the phone screen, participants will be invited to attend an orientation visit in the
      clinic where consent will be obtained and subjects will fill out forms about their tobacco
      use and medical history. Subjects who are determined to be eligible after the orientation
      visit will return to the clinic for a baseline visit where they will receive the smokeless
      tobacco product and be instructed to use only the study product until they return for their
      first lab session seven days later.

      Prior to each of the three lab sessions, subjects will collect all of their urine for the 24
      hours leading up to their scheduled appointment. At each lab session, participants will use
      the study product and collect their saliva and tobacco juices at regular intervals.
      Participants will also swab the inside of their cheek for cells and have their blood drawn.

      Collected samples will be used to characterize the metabolic activation and DNA binding of
      NNN.
