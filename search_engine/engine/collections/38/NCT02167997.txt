    
      This is a prospective cohort study whereby patients who undergo endovascular treatment with
      coils for intracranial aneurysms will be studied for initial procedural and 12-18 month
      post-treatment outcome. The procedural failure rate (defined above) of treating small
      aneurysms with specially designed coils will be compared to pre-specified historical
      occurrences. This evaluation will occur within the framework of "non-inferiority" (i.e.
      comparable success to coiling of large aneurysms).
