      shoulder level prevents use of the traditional proximal humerus insertion site due to the
      rotation of the humeral head under the acromion process. An alternate proximal humerus IO
      insertion technique has been developed to meet the needs of anesthesia patient positioning
      that uses a slightly more distal insertion site and a superior angle of insertion. However
      infusion flow rate in the proximal humerus using the anesthesia technique has not been
      measured. This study is needed to evaluate the anesthesia proximal humerus IO insertion
      technique to determine if the IO infusion flow rates remain unchanged by the alternate
      method.
