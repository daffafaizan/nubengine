    
      This is a prospective cohort study with the goal of obtaining fresh tumor biopsies and one
      blood sample from patients with a confirmed histological or cytological diagnosis of cancer,
      who are potential candidates for a phase I or II clinical trial at their local institution.
      DNA from fresh tumor biopsies and from mononuclear blood cells will be subjected to targeted
      and genome-wide sequencing to enable molecular characterization of tumors. Application of
      genomic information by investigators will be captured. Archived tumor samples will be
      requested from all patients. For patients with malignant ascites or pleural effusions, fluid
      and tumor samples will be evaluated.
