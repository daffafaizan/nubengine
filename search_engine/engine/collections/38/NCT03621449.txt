      the lower extremities to the central compartment through a passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver
      and then measure the resulting change in cardiac output. It was recently suggested that an
      increase in cardiac output following PLR had a high accuracy compared other methods to test
      fluid responsiveness. Different methods to estimate change in cardiac output have been used
      in studies investigating accuracy of PLR. Most commonly calibrated pulse contour analysis has
      been used in mechanically ventilated patients whereas transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)has
      been used in spontaneously breathing patients. While TTE offers the advantage of being less
      invasive than calibrated pulse contour analysis it is technically challenging and user
      dependent and the accuracy of the two methods has not been compared.
