      of type 2 diabetes and obesity. This may be due to dairy's ability to increase satiety and
      decrease post-prandial glycemia. However, most clinical studies have only investigated
      isolated dairy proteins (whey and casein) and the effects of whole dairy products, consumed
      as part of a meal, remain unclear. Additionally, the effect of dairy type and form remain to
      be further investigated. Therefore, this study will test the effects of dairy products when
      consumed with a high glycemic index breakfast on satiety and post-prandial glycemia.

      Thirty healthy older males and females (60-70 years, BMI 18.5-30.0 kg/m2) will be recruited
      for the randomized, unblinded, crossover study. Participants will fast overnight, and at
      baseline will consume 1) 2% milk (250 mL), 2) soy beverage (250 mL), 3) plain 2% Greek yogurt
      (175 g), 4) cheddar cheese (30 g), or 5) water (250 mL - control). Treatments will be
      consumed along with 2 pieces of white toast with strawberry jam, except for the water control
      which will be consumed alone. All breakfast meals will be isocaloric and water will be given
      with the yogurt (75 mL) and cheese (220 mL) to compensate for fluid content. At 0 (baseline),
      15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, (pre-meal period) and 210 minutes (post-meal period) blood
      will be collected for glucose analysis and subjective appetite ratings completed. Insulin
      will be analyzed every 30 minutes. Between 180-200 minutes, an ad libitum lunch will be
      provided to assess food intake.
