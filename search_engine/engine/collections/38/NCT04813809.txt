    
      This investigation is a prospective, open, non-comparative, single-center investigation with
      the aim to investigate the effect of BARRIER EasyWarm active self-warming blanket on skin-
      and body core temperatures.

      The investigation will enroll approximately 20 healthy volunteers in one investigation site.
      Each subject will be evaluated for up to 10 hours in one visit on site. Body core- and skin
      reference temperatures will be established before applying the blanket. After reference
      temperature assessments, the BARRIER EasyWarm is positioned on the subject with the neckline
      at the collarbone. Skin temperatures will be assessed with an IR camera and body core
      temperatures will be assessed with an ear thermometer at 30 min, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, and 10 hours post blanket application. Subject perception of heat from the blanket will be
      assessed at 30 minutes, 5 hours and 10 hours post blanket application by means of a five
      graded question.
