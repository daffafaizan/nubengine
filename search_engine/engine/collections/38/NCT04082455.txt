      The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE grade 3 or higher of non-hematological
      toxicity (G3). The acute and late toxicities, overall survival (OS), progression-free
      survival (PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastasis-free survival
      (DMFS) were the endpoints.
