        -  An anatomical brain MRI (30 minutes).

        -  Two 20 minute sessions of rTMS (placebo and active) of the left DLPFC, at the frequency
           of 10 Hz.

        -  Visual Analogue Scale measuring their desire to gamble before and after a gambling video
           and test measuring their gambling behavior during the last 7 days (PG-YBOCS).

        -  Cognitive tests, to be carried out on a computer before and immediately after rTMS
           sessions.

        -  Recording heart rate variability (HRV) to measure the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
           activity

      As it is a pilot study, the investigators don't have sufficient data to calculate statistical
      power and number of participants. The investigators based on previous studies evaluating one
      rTMS session on craving in SUD and used a crossover design to generate greater power.
