    
      This is a randomized clinical trial with masked assessment, comparing recovery indices for
      patients receiving intermediate acting versus short acting opioid analgesia using
      hydromorphone or fentanyl as intraoperative analgesics. An otherwise standardized anesthetic
      and analgesic regimen will be utilized, consistent with routine care at SLCH. Patients will
      be randomized 1:1 in block sizes of 5 per group. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either hydromorphone or fentanyl throughout the perioperative period by opening a sealed
      protocol envelope.
