           cases in Agder and Telemark over a period of two years (WP1).

        2. Identify risk factors for COVID-19 by comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and

        -  Occupational risk factors assessed by occupational codes (ISCO88) and job exposure
           matrix categorisation.

        -  Environmental risk factors (road traffic outside bedroom window, travel by foot or
           bicycle alongside busy roads, and the use of a fireplaces in residential homes. Further,
           estimated measurements of air pollution may be linked to participants' home address.
