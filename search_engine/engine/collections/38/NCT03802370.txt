      takes the shape of an inverted dome. The advantage of the dome CT technique is that it allows
      for both buccal and coronal augmentation of local soft tissue, while maximizing blood supply
      to the area by using tunneling-technique principles. It enhances and augments the
      peri-implant tissue foundation for a favorable facial and interproximal restorative emergence
      profile. As this technique does not involve raising an independent buccal flap, the gingival
      tissue of the adjacent teeth is not compromised, and thus the risk of recession and formation
      of black triangles on the adjacent teeth is minimized.
