      years to 35 years, inclusive who are unable to take oral medications or require parenteral
      administration of IV Lacosamide Occasionally, patients over the age of 20 are seen at
      LeBonheur Children's Hospital due to the complexity of their condition, or due to a long
      relationship with their physician. These are exceptions which are reviewed on a case by case
      basis and are approved by the hospital administrator for admissions and outpatient testing.
