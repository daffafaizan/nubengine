    
      Recruitment:

      Participants were recruited from the local university sports clubs. Club chairpersons were
      asked to send an email to club players. Players interested in participating in the study
      expressed an interest by replying to the email. Potential participants were asked to attend a
      meeting where they had the study explained to them. Those who were interested were then
      assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Group allocation:

      A four block randomisation method was used to allocate participants to the Nordic hamstring
      exercise protocol or the hip extension exercise protocol.

      Interventions:

      The Nordic hamstring exercise protocol or the hip extension exercise protocol

      Testing procedure:

      The isokinetic strength of the participants' hamstrings and quadriceps were recorded before
      and after the exercise intervention.

      A 10 point visual analogue scale was used to record the level of muscle soreness experienced
      after each training session.
