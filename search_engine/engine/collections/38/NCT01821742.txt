    
      A study to determine if echocardiographically derived parameters, plethysmographic
      variability index and pulse pressure variation predict fluid responsiveness in children on
      PICU. These parameters will be measured pre and post fluid bolus in children prescribed fluid
      bolus therapy for clinical indications on the PICU. Children will be classified as responders
      (>10% increase in cardiac output) and non responders (<10% increase). Appropriate statistical
      tests will be performed to determine the most useful predictor of an increase in cardiac
      output following a fluid bolus.
