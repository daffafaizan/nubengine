    
      In our protocol, we will study vascular function using pulse wave velocity (PWV) augmentation
      index (AI), flow mediated dilation (FMD) and contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) as well as
      insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) in 50 adults with metabolic syndrome, age 18-60 years.
      They will each be studied 4 times,before and after two 12-wk interventions (randomly
      assigned) as follows: 1) Placebos and 2) Metformin . This is a cross-over design.
