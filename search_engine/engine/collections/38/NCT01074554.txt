      mycobacterial antigens and sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Molecular analysis of sarcoidosis
      granulomas reveals the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) DNA and proteins
      that are significantly absent from granulomatous controls. Mycobacterial DNA has been
      detected in cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions, in addition to systemic immune responses against
      mycobacterial antigens. Due to the association between sarcoidosis and mycobacterial
      antigens, we postulated that broad spectrum antimycobacterial therapy could lead to
      restoration of T cell function and clinical improvement of chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis
      lesions. We investigated the safety and efficacy of Concomitant Levofloxacin, Ethambutol,
      Azithromycin, and Rifampin (CLEAR) therapy among chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis subjects, with
      change in lesion diameter from baseline to completion of 8 weeks of therapy as the primary
      endpoint; we assessed for decreases in granuloma burden, if granulomas were evident upon
      histologic examination. Change in modified Sarcoidosis Activity Severity Index (SASI) was the
      secondary endpoint.
