      intravenous drip of standard dose paclitaxel + cisplantin + Sindilimab every 3 weeks for 3
      cycles. CT/MR of chest, upper and lower abdomen and pelvic MR will be performed before
      treatment and 2 weeks after the 3rd cycle chemotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) (CR
      + PR) is evaluated by comparing with baseline based on RECISTv1.1. Radical surgery will be
      performed after NACT. According to the postoperative pathological results, the pathological
      complete remission rate (pCR) will be evaluated. The adverse events will be continuously
      monitored during treatment until 30 days after chemotherapy. Toxic adverse events is
      evaluated according to NCI-CTCAEv5.0 criteria.
