      between. Products will be applied twice as per manufacturer's instructions for a Healthcare
      Personnel Handwash followed by immediate hand print. Persistent hand prints will be collected
      after exposure to environmental contaminants in the common areas. Hand prints will also be
      collected from one hand of 60 patients cared for by a participating Health Care Worker and
      gloved hand of Health Care Worker. All media contain neutralizers to inactivate active
      ingredients in each product and on surfaces. Each hand print plate's area of growth will be
      measured for Colony Forming Units using computerized software.
