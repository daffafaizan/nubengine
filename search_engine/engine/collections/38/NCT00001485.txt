      in the length of the night trigger many of the dramatic seasonal changes in behavior that
      occur in animals. It has been hypothesized that melatonin plays a similar role as chemical
      mediator of the effects of season on mood in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
      For such a hypothesis to be tenable, it would be necessary to show that duration of nocturnal
      melatonin secretion changes on a seasonal basis in patients with SAD. We have preliminary
      evidence that the duration (and amplitude) of nocturnal melatonin secretion increases in
      winter and decreases in summer in healthy women, but not in healthy men. This gender
      difference, if confirmed, might explain why SAD is more prevalent in women than men.
      Interestingly, all of five men with SAD that we have studied to date exhibited lengthening of
      melatonin secretion in winter, as occurs in healthy women. However, the response of women
      with SAD is less consistent. The purpose of the present protocol is to extend and confirm our
      finding of gender differences in the response of melatonin secretion to change of season in
      healthy individuals, and to determine whether and to what extent this response occurs in
      patients with SAD.
