      This study will involve a single study session (lasting two hours) in the controlled setting
      of a research laboratory. This study will evaluate whether older adults who have had
      unintentional falls are willing to enroll in this kind of study, use the device briefly, and
      undergo research assessments. The study will also test whether using the virtual reality
      device leads to detectable changes in gait, balance, and mobility confidence. This study will
      lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in the future that will assess the clinical
      impact of using the device.

      Twenty-four subjects will be recruited. They will include equal numbers of older adults who:
      (1) have fallen without a significant injury (e.g. only minor contusion, lacerations) or (2)
      have fallen with a significant injury (e.g. dislocation, strain/sprain, or fracture) which
      has healed prior to enrollment.

      Each subject will complete baseline measures of gait, balance, and confidence. Then she or he
      will be introduced to the virtual reality device and will use it for a brief period. Gait and
      balance will be tested again, first with the virtual reality device and then, finally,
      without the virtual reality device.

      The device (GaitAidÂ®), developed by co-investigator Yoram Baram, Ph.D., has already been used
      for the rehabilitation of neurological patients (e.g. Parkinson's Disease). The device is a
      training tool and NOT a continuous walking aid.
