      The following endpoints are defined and will be assessed with descriptive analysis:

        1. AV Opt feature:

           The feature's AV delay recommendation was

             1. used as basis for the device programming or is at least considered to be clinically
                acceptable or

             2. other AV delay values were chosen by the investigator and the recommendation was
                rated as not clinically acceptable.

        2. LV VectorOpt usability using an overall score (categories: excellent, good, average,
           fair, poor).

        3. (S)ADEs and calculation of the SADE free rate until the 6-month follow-up
