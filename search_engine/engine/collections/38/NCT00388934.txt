    
      Design:

        -  Randomized open multicentre trial.

      Patients:

        -  1800 patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for percutaneous coronary
           intervention with stent implantation.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention
           with stent implantation.

        -  Signed informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Participation in other stent studies.

      Randomization:

        -  Implantation of Taxus Express og Cypher Select stents.

      Primary end-point:

        -  Combined end-point of cardiac death, new revascularization (PCI or CABG) or myocardial
           infarction after nine months.

      Secondary end-points:

        -  Total death after nine months

        -  Cardiac death after nine months

        -  Myocardial infarction after nine months

        -  Index vessel myocardial infarction after nine months

        -  Target lesion revascularization

        -  Target vessel revascularization

        -  Stent thrombosis after nine months

      End-point evaluation:

        -  End-points will be adjudicated by an independent end-point committee
