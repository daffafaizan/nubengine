      uncertain that IBD patients can achieve a truly protective response after vaccination. The
      efficacy and safety of hepatitis A vaccination have not been evaluated in this population of
      patients. We would like to estimate the efficacy and safety of vaccination against hepatitis
      A in patients with IBD.
