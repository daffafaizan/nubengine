      Statistical Analyses Microbial populations have been controlled in the saliva at initial time
      and adherence at 30 to 180 days after the overdentures in the mouth. The saliva sample was
      obtained from the patient in a sterile sputum collection bottle through a sterile solution.
      The overdenture samples were extracted and processed for analysis. Each sample was submerged
      in ¼ sterile Ringer and subjected to vigorous ultrasound shaking. From each of the microbial
      suspensions, successive dilutions were made to determine the total number of viable
      microorganisms present. Total count of mold and yeast and total count of mesophyll aerobe
      were performed.

      The surface roughness of BOD and BJOD was determined with the rugosimeter the Mitutoyo
      Surfest SJ-301® (Mitutoyo Corporation Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), through a displacement force of
      4mN and of the tray to 0.5 mm/s and back to 1 mm/s (Murtra and Arcís,1999). The roughness
      profile Ra was evaluated and determined in microns (ųm) through five readings for each of the
      samples in the study respectively.

      The results of BOD and BJOD were compared for the determination of Ra and the adherence of
      mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe. For this, we used the statistics Shapiro-Wilk, T and the
      Pearson Correlation Coefficient to determinate the relationship between the study variables.
