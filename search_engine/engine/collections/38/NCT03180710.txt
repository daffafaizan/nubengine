    
      This is a bicentric, double-blinded, randomised, four-period crossover phase 1 trial, using
      automated 30-hour euglycemic clamp in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Each subject will be randomly allocated to a sequence of four treatments, three single doses
      of BioChaperone® Combo 75/25 (0.6 U/kg, 0.8 U/kg or 1.0 U/kg) and one single dose of Humalog®
      Mix25 at 0.8 U/kg on four separate dosing visits.

      Subjects will come in a fasted state to the clinical trial centre in the morning of each
      dosing day and stay at the clinical trial centre until the 30-hour clamp procedures have been
      terminated.
