    
      With IRB approval, patients will be enrolled in a prospective clinical trial to assess
      outcomes in 2 cohorts of patients undergoing unicompartmental versus more extensive biologic
      OCA transplantation of the knee using MOPSTM-preserved allografts (including menisci),
      anatomically-shaped allografts, autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC)-treated
      donor bone, and treatment-specific postoperative rehabilitation. Demographic and operative
      data will be collected. Outcome assessments will include VAS pain, IKDC, SANE, Tegner and
      PROMIS Mobility for knee at 6 months and yearly after surgery. In addition, serial limb
      alignment measurements, ultrasonographic assessments of meniscal location and integrity,
      quantitative MRIs for cartilage composition, and serum and urine biomarkers for treatment
      monitoring will be performed. All complications and re-operations will be recorded. OCA
      survival will be determined based on maintenance of acceptable levels of pain and function
      and/or need for revision surgery or total knee arthroplasty.
