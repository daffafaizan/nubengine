      focal cartilage defects of the femoral condyles treated with the BioPoly RS Partial
      Resurfacing Knee Implant, a permanent orthopaedic implant. The overall aim of the study is to
      increase the knowledge of patient outcomes such as pain, knee function, level of activity,
      and overall quality of life after treatment with the device. Patients will be followed for 5
      years after surgery.
