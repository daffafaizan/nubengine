    
      Single center, two-parts pilot, prospective study to assess the role of molecular tumor
      profiling in supporting patient enrollment in early phase clinical trials.

      Part A: patients with solid tumors or lymphomas (n=40) who are potential candidates for early
      phase clinical trials will be offered to have their more recent archival tumor tissue
      analyzed for the presence of somatic genomic alterations with the pan-cancer NGS Ion
      TorrentTM OncomineTM Comprehensive Assay v3 platform.

      Part B: patients who have been enrolled in early phase clinical trials (estimated number:
      16-18) will have their archival tumor tissue assessed with HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker
      Panel Assay for RNA-Seq to explore gene expression signatures and blood collected and stored
      to create a repository of samples (¨liquid biopsy¨) for future research with the aim to
      investigate the mutational profile of ctDNA at baseline and the acquisition of new mutations
      at the time of disease progression as a consequence of treatment exposure.
