      or relative shortage of the blood supply to an organ. Relative shortage means the mismatch of
      blood supply (oxygen delivery) and blood request for adequate oxygenation of tissue.

      It is hereby postulated that far infrared radiation of the body will promote blood and oxygen
      supply to the affected tissues. In addition, the analgesic properties of far infrared will
      alleviate pain due to the crisis.
