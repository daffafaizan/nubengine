        1. compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel

        2. lumbar flexion by using a supporting belt

        3. transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket lining by using the
           principle of the 3-point pressure system

        4. axial rotation or coupled motion by using a system with uneven straps, and

        5. an active mechanism that aims to shift the trunk away from areas of pressure.
