      predefined reference. It plays a role in the pathogenesis of adverse events following stent
      deployment. Stent under-expansion has been a consistent finding in IVUS reports of acute or
      subacute BMS or DES thrombosis.

      Post intervention imaging can determine whether there is adequate stent expansion. Currently
      the only available tool for evaluation of properness of stent deployment is intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS procedure is invasive, labor intensified, associated with radiation
      and contrast media use, and is not free of complications. In many medical centers, IVUS is
      not used routinely because of lack of knowledge and expertise in reading it, and it's
      relatively high price.

      The StentOptimizer is an angiography based software tool aimed to enhance visualization of
      deployed stents and to provide the physician with quantitative data regarding stent
      dimensions. The StentOptimizer is part of an image acquisition and processing software system
      (IC-Pro), designed as an add-on to conventional X-ray angiography systems.

      An enhanced stent image is produced using the radiopaque markers of the delivery balloon from
      several frames (minimum 20). The result is a still image of the stent with enhanced edges and
      the region of interest around it
