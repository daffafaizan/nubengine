      loss. Recent experiments using human umbilical cord blood treatment of a mouse and guinea pig
      models have demonstrated hair cell re-growth following acquired sensorineural loss as well as
      partial restoration of ABR. Autologous human umbilical cord blood therapy, which has been
      used for over twenty years, has an excellent safety record. This study will determine if
      autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and
      feasible, improves inner ear function, audition, and language development. The patients
      umbilical cord stem cells collected at birth and stored at Cord Blood Registry will be used
      for infusion.
