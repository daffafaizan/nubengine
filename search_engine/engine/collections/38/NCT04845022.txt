    
      All snakebite patients brought to emergency department with history of bite and prolonged
      whole blood clotting time (WBCT) will be included in the study . their samples for hemogram,
      RFT and LDH would be collected in corresponding tubes . from sample for hemogram a peripheral
      blood smear (PBS) would be prepared , also the sample would be checked for direct coomb's
      test (DCT) positivity. DCT positive patients would be excluded from study . Also patients who
      received blood or blood components from outside hospital or patients with known history of
      hemolytic disease or patients on anti platelets or anticoagulants would also be excluded from
      this study .

      thus patients who meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria would be followed up after 48
      hours and their hemogram , RFT and LDH would be re assessed to check for presence of
      hemolysis , thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury(AKI) .From the hemogram sample PBS would
      be prepared to check for presence of schistocytes.

      Here we aim to study for incidence of TMA - defined as presence of MAHA( microangiopathic
      hemolytic anemia ) , thrombocytopenia and presence of AKI . MAHA is detected as drop of hb,
      presence of schistocytes in PBS , increase in LDH and increase in retic count. India is a
      tropical country and the southern state of Kerala , this study is done with the purpose of
      finding the prevalence of TMA among patients of snakebite brought to a tertiary care centre.
      Most often the victims are farmers or people from middle class. A cost effective test such as
      peripheral smear can help in predicting the prognosis and thereby aid in deciding whether the
      patient should require a multi disciplinary treatment early on and thereby play a pivotal
      role in saving patient life as well as provide an economical solution.
