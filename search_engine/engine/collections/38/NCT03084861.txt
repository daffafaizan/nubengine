    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arms phase I/II, clinical trial, in which
      42 patients will be enrolled with the principal objective to evaluate the efficacy through
      changes in lesion size and, secondary, to evaluate the safety and efficacy through corneal
      sensibility, corneal opacity, visual acuity and complications of NK. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive experimental treatment (cord blood eye drops) or conventional
      treatment (artificial tears and therapeutic contact lens).

      All patients, with conventional or experimental treatment, will be treated for 19 days. A
      topical antibiotic will be added too as a concomitant treatment to all treatment groups,
      until the injury closes or according to medical criteria.

      After signing informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed, and if the
      patient meets all the requirements, the patient will be randomized.

      After initiation of the treatment, patients will be follow-up at 2-3 days and once a week for
      3 weeks. A final follow-up is planned at 6 weeks.
