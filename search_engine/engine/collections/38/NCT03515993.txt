    
      The objective of this study is to identify physical and psychosocial problems and needs after
      treatment for gynecological cancer.

      1100 patients stratified by cancer sites and treatment - a minimum of 120 patients within
      each stratum - will be recruited.

      Institutional data on follow-up policy, demographic and clinical data (related to treatment
      history and tumor characteristics) will be collected. Patients will complete a set of 76
      Quality of Life questions, at one single time point.

      Descriptive analyses will be conducted to characterize the collected data. Multivariate model
      building will be used to identify patterns of physical, psychological and social problems
      based on factors specific to the patient and to the disease. Logistic multinomial or
      continuous regression analysis will be used to investigate which socio-demographic, clinical
      variables, or institutional are associated significantly with compromised quality of life and
      sexual health outcomes. Exploratory factor analysis will be used to explore the factor
      structure of the various PROMs to identify issue clustering.
