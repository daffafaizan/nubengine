      INO-4212 and its components INO-4201 and INO-4202 in healthy volunteers. INO-4201 contains
      the DNA sequence that codes for past Ebola Zaire virus outbreak strains, and INO-4202
      contains the DNA sequence that codes for the current Ebola virus outbreak strain. When given
      together, the DNA vaccine is called INO-4212 and contains the DNA sequence of both the
      previous and the current outbreak strain. Another ingredient called INO-9012 which contains
      the DNA sequence for interleukin-12, will be given in a subset of subjects to help boost the
      body's immune response when given with the vaccine.

      Following administration of vaccine, a specialized medical device, CELLECTRAÂ®, will deliver
      brief electrical pulses in a process known as electroporation (EP), to help move more DNA
      into cells more efficiently. The study will evaluate whether INO-4212 and its components may
      be able to generate protective immunity against Ebola Zaire, evaluate the relative ability of
      IM versus ID administration to elicit immune responses and evaluate whether vaccine
      administered with INO-9012 can generate greater immune responses.

      The Ebola vaccine under study will be tested in approximately 240 healthy adult volunteers.
