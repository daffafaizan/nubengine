      efficacy of the mini-dystrophin gene transferred to the biceps muscle for Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy patients, ages 5 to 12 years of age, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus.
      Eligible participants must have a known dystrophin gene mutation and may be concurrently
      treated with corticoid steroids. The mini-dystrophin gene or a placebo agent (normal saline
      or empty viral capsids) are injected directly into both biceps muscles while under conscious
      sedation. Following the gene transfer, patients are admitted to the hospital for 48 hours of
      observation followed by weekly outpatient visits at the Columbus Children's Hospital
      Neuromuscular Clinic. A bilateral muscle biopsy is preformed following 6 weeks with long term
      follow up will consisting of bi-annual visits for the next 2 years.
