      of underlying tissues, the treating and repairing is always a great challenge in clinical
      practice. The complex healing process make the wound easy to get a tendency of nonhealing and
      result in a heavy burden of life quality. Nowadays surgical repairing is still the main
      method, such as traditional split-thickness skin graft, flap transplantation or
      tissue-engineered substitute transplantation. However, none of these methods could have
      effective and satisfy outcomes. Because none of these treatments could repair skin on both
      structure and function. Therefore, as a new treating technology the tissue-engineered skin
      has been widely used recently and shows good response. As a consequence, the investigators
      provide a quick and effective method to rebuilt complete structure and function of the skin
      based on tissue-engineered skin technology. This method is composite of skin grafting over
      human acellular dermal matrix scaffold the investigators used before with skin basal cell as
      seed cells, moreover it was finished in the surgery without culturing the cells and could
      greatly reduce the time. To further test the efficacy and safety of this new method, the
      investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled multicenter trial to compare this
      method with traditional skin graft. If this method could actually increase wound take rate,
      improve the skin quality and restore skin function in some extent, it should resolve the
      problem of wound repair to a large extent.
