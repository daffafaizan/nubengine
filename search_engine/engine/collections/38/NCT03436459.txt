      blood flow and vascular permeability and improves cell metabolism. All these lead to muscle
      recovery. It also activates somatosensory receptors of the skin and reduces local pain and
      muscle spasm.

      The specific mechanisms of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating
      musculoskeletal pain remain unclear. It reduces pain and inflammation by modulating
      nitrogen-monoxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It can destroy sensory
      unmyelinated nerve fibers, and stimulate neovascularization and collagen synthesis in
      degenerative tissues.
