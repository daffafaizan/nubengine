      cancer patients, it is estimated that in 2050 one cancer out of two will be discovered in a
      person over 75 years of age. Digestive cancers account for the majority of these patients,
      the goals of these palliative chemotherapies are to improve survival and maintain or improve
      quality of life. Since the 2009 cancer plan, a specific geriatric onco-geriatrics
      organization has been set up with the creation of geriatric onco-coordination units. One of
      the objectives of this plan is to achieve a 5% inclusion rate of patients over 75 years of
      age in clinical trials. However, there are relatively few studies in patients over 75 years
      of age concerning quality of life, as they are often excluded from trials and survival is
      preferred as the primary outcome. This observational study evaluates the quality of life of
      patients at the time of the first chemotherapy treatment and then at the end of the first
      cycle of chemotherapy at 3 months by a standardized questionnaire, an evaluation of autonomy
      and the number of days of hospitalization.
