      syndrome (CTS) in the short term.

      Aim: To determine whether hydrodissection would provide an additional clinical effect when
      used along with a corticosteroid in the short term.

      Methods: A prospective cohort of patients with CTS were retrospectively evaluated. 28
      patients were selected randomly who received ultrasound (US)-guided triamcinolone
      hydrodissection (3 mL) as intervention group and received US-guided triamcinolone injection
      (1 mL) as control group, from the data (case-control ratio 1:1). Outcome measures were the
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), hand grip strength (HGS), fhe cross-sectional area
      (CSA) of the median nerve and Short Form 12 (SF-12). Assessments were recorded at baseline, 1
      and 4 weeks after injection.
