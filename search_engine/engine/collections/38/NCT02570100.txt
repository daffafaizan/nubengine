      Before the initiation of chemotherapy, a tumor specimen (under echographic control) and four
      blood samples will be collected. The chemotherapy consists of 3 cycles of (F)EC100 spaced 21
      days apart :

        -  Epirubicin, 100 mg/m² in intravenous (IV)

        -  Cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m² in IV

        -  +/- 5-fluorouracile (5FU), 500 mg/m² in IV

      Followed by 3 cycles of Taxotere (Docetaxel, IV, 100 mg/m²) spaced 21 days apart +/-
      Herceptin (Trastuzumab, IV, 8 mg/kg during C1 and then 6 mg/kg) for 1 year in the case of
      overexpression of the HER-2 oncoprotein.

      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the (F)EC100 treatment, at the
      time of the usual ultrasound examination), a tumor specimen and four blood samples will be
      taken. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the Docetaxel +/-
      Trastuzumab treatment), four blood samples will be collected. A partial or total mastectomy
      could be performed during the 6 cycles of chemotherapy. During surgery, a tumor specimen will
      be taken. The indication of breast surgery will remain at the discretion of the
      pluridisciplinary committee of the participating center.

      Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination
      and will undergo laboratory examinations. On day 1 of the fourth cycle and after the sixth
      cycle of chemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination and will undergo laboratory
      examinations. After three cycles of chemotherapy, at the time of the intermediate breast
      ultrasound, patients will have paraclinical examinations. Finally, at the end of the study
      (after partial or total mastectomy), anatomopathological examinations will be performed on
      the operative specimen.
