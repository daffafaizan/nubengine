      with ischemic stroke who needs mechanic ventilation is admitted to ICU,a sealed envelop will
      be opened which decide whether the patient is assigned to the placebo arm or the atorvastatin
      arm. During they stay in ICU, one tablet of atorvastatin (40mg) or one tablet of placebo will
      be administered. Atorvastatin or placebo will be administered through an enteral feeding tube
      or administered orally when patients are able to safely take oral medications.

      VAP diagnosis accords with the comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for
      ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment which was published in 2008.
