      pharmacological and regional techniques for postoperative analgesia.TAP block is performed on
      the principle of hydrodissection of the fascia between the internal oblique and transversus
      abdominis muscles of the abdominal wall muscles with local anesthetic drugs. Local anesthetic
      drugs provide analgesic effect up to 24 hours in the postoperative period by blocking the
      T6-L1 nerves in the facial plane. Local anesthetic infiltration which is one of the regional
      anesthetic techniques, is another method of postoperative analgesia. intravenous analgesic
