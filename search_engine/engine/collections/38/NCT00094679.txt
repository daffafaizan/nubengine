      and middle-aged adults. Patching has been the mainstay of amblyopia therapy. It is generally
      held that the response to treatment is best when it is instituted at an early age,
      particularly by age two or three, and is poor when attempted after eight years of age.

      For moderate amblyopia, patching is the most commonly prescribed treatment although other
      modalities such as atropine penalization are also prescribed. There is no specific patching
      regimen that is widely accepted for treatment of moderate amblyopia and limited or no data
      available to favor the use of one specific regimen; both minimal occlusion (e.g., 2 hours per
      day) and six or more hours per day of patching are prescribed in clinical practice.

      The study is a randomized trial comparing daily patching regimes for children with moderate
      amblyopia. It will consist of about 160 children. Patients in the moderate (20/40-20/80)
      group will patch part-time (6 hours) or minimal time (2 hours) of each day for the 4-month
      study period. There are at least two follow up visits during the 4-month period. Visual
      acuity is the major study outcome. It is assessed at the 4-month exam.
