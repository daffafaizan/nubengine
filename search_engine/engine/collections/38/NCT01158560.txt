      regular gargling to prevent URTI/ILI. Vitamin D may be an important factor in respiratory
      health. Observational studies have associated low serum 25(OH)D levels with more frequent and
      more severe respiratory infections. However, evidence is lacking that replacement of vitamin
      D decreases respiratory infections. Four interventional studies of vitamin D supplementation
      have noted a reduction in respiratory infections, with an estimated 5-25% reduction, but
      results were not statistically significant.

      In Japanese populations, gargling has been found to significantly reduce the incidence of
      upper respiratory tract infections by approximately 35% (Satomura et al., 2005). This
      intervention has not been studied in different populations but may be a useful personal
      practice to reduce URTI.

      We propose a 2X2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D/placebo and
      gargling/no gargling to study the effects of vitamin D supplementation and gargling on upper
      respiratory tract infections in McMaster students. This study will be conducted over two
      years, during September and October of each study year, to capture the natural peak in
      rhinovirus activity.
