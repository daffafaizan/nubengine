      neurosurgical procedures performed. Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent
      complication of such surgeries and impacts a large proportion of this population resulting in
      multiple intermittent bladder catheterizations for bladder decompression, increased incidence
      of bacteremia, increased incidence of UTIs, and prolonged hospital stays. Use of a
      uroselective alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, such as tamsulosin, in the perioperative
      period (medication started five days prior to surgery and taken until hospital discharge)
      could reduce both the incidence and duration of postoperative urinary retention, resulting in
      shorter hospital stays and decreased healthcare costs.
