      restenosis and the subsequent need for target vessel revascularisation compared with bare
      metal stents. Although this applies to the vast majority of patients, intimal hyperplasia and
      in-stent restenosis have not been completely eliminated and remain to occur in certain high
      risk subgroups. While there is a plenty of data about the efficacy of DES in complex lesions
      or diabetics, no randomized data exist about the efficacy of DES in coronary artery bypass
      graft lesions.
