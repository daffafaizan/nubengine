      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of peposertib (M3814) in combination with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) and determine the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of the combination in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of M3814
      when given in combination with PLD.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To correlate response to treatment (as defined by response rate and progression free
      survival) with PLD exposure (in area under the curve [AUC]) and PLD associated toxicities in
      women with recurrent high grade serous and low grade serous ovarian cancer treated in the
      expansion cohorts.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib.

      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
