      At Visit 2 [7 days ( ± 3 days) after Visit 1] and subsequent optional titration visits up to
      (Visit 1 + 42 days) , patients will be titrated up to an effective and tolerated dose of
      Norspan® or Sovenor® transdermal patch and continue rescue analgesic, if necessary.

      Titration period is dependent on time to achieving optimal pain control as determined by the
      investigator. The up-titration regime is planned on a weekly basis. Earlier dose titration
      (i.e. minimum 3 days after the patch application) is permitted at the investigator's
      discretion if the pain is uncontrolled. Effective and tolerated dose is assessed by data
      recorded in the case report form and patient diary.

      According to country label, all patients will begin treatment with Norspan® or Sovenor®
      transdermal patch 5mg and will then be up-titrated, if necessary, to a maximum of Norspan® or
      Sovenor® transdermal patch 40mg or according to country label to achieve stable pain control.
      Patients that require oral opioid at any time during the study should be discontinued from
      the trial.
