    
      Primary objective: To determine the utility of pre-treatment (16 alpha[18-F]-fluoroestradiol)
      FES-PET and routine ([18-F]-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose) FDG-PET in the prediction of response to
      hormone therapy using standard response criteria (RECIST) as gold standard in 100 primary
      tumor hormone positive (ER+) women with metastatic carcinoma of the breast.

      We will measure standardized uptake ratio (SUV) for FDG and FES at baseline and correlate
      same to FDG/FES SUV ratio at disease relapse. We predict increased FDG/FES ratio at relapse
      and using the Pearson correlation coefficient will examine the regression equation slope as a
      measure of the changing ratio.

      Twenty - forty patients will have core biopsy of accessible FDG positive and FES negative
      metastasis. Metastatic lesion immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ER will be compared to
      pretherapy FES result for concordance. With 80% agreement level for negative FES and negative
      core biopsy ER IHC 95% confidence limits (DI) are 56-94% for 20 and 64-90% for 40 patients
      respectively.

      Proliferative index and tumor aggressiveness using IHC for Ki-67 and HER-2 respectively will
      be measured on primary tumor and biopsied metastatic lesion and correlated with metastatic
      disease response (RECIST).

      Secondary objectives regarding HER-2 and Ki-67 IHC and response will be evaluated using
      Fisher's exact test for 2 X 2 tables for the 100 women and the 20-40 having core biopsy.

      From the sensitivity and specificity determinations, calculated observed agreement between
      pretherapy FDG FES-PET ratio and RECIST will be 86% (95% CI 78-92%).

      Assuming 40% response rate for 100 women receiving first, second or third line hormonal
      therapy and RECIST response as gold standard, we chose 80% sensitivity (95% CI 64-91%) and
      90% specificity (95% CI 80-96%) as giving sufficiently robust data to warrant further
      studies.
