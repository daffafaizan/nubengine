      distress and failure, especially when patients have acute worsening (also called
      exacerbations) of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will
      randomize patients who use Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to a control
      (non-functioning) and intervention (functioning) device to determine how well speech can be
      understood while wearing the device.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a non-invasive communication
      aid for BPAP/CPAP masks. This study also looks to determine the potential impact of the
      device on patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the individuals that interact with
      the device.
