    
      This is a single center, open-label, phase 2 study in elderly (age â‰¥ 70) subjects with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible. The main study consists of the
      following phases: a 28-day screening phase; followed by initial therapy with 12 cycles of
      daratumumab in combination with dose-attenuated VRd; and a maintenance phase that starts
      after Cycle 12 of therapy. Cycles are 28 days in length. Treatment can continue until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 cycles of initial therapy, maintenance therapy
      will begin with 28 day cycles of daratumumab with either lenalidomide or ixazomib and the
      choice of maintenance therapy will be based on cytogenetic risk status at diagnosis. All
      subjects will continue maintenance treatment until disease progression, except maintenance
      daratumumab will be discontinued after 2 years if subjects remain on maintenance treatment at
      that time. All subjects will be followed in the longterm follow-up for at least 1 year after
      last dose of study treatment and will continue until death, withdrawal of consent for study
      participation, or the end of study definition is met. The end of study is defined as when all
      subjects have completed at least 1 year of long-term follow up and until death, withdrawal of
      consent for study participation, or 5 years after first patient begins daratumumab therapy,
      whichever occurs first.
