      and contains no luteinizing hormone (LH) activity.

      FSH stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure.
      FSH, the active component of Gonapure® is the primary hormone responsible for follicular
      recruitment and development. In order to affect final maturation of the follicle and
      ovulation in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) must
      be given following the administration of FSH, when monitoring of the patient indicates that
      sufficient follicular development has occurred. There is inter-patient variability in
      response to FSH administration.

      The dosage and schedule of treatment for female infertility must be determined according to
      the needs of each patient; it is usual to monitor response by studying the patient's serum
      oestrogen level and/or by ultrasonic visualization of follicles.

      Treatment should be started within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. Treatment is
      usually begun with 75 to 450 International units daily by intramuscular injection for 7 to 10
      days; followed by individual adjustments according to the patient's follicular response i.e.
      until an adequate, but not excessive, response is achieved.

      The investigator will decide the starting dose according to the standard clinical practice
      (and within the approved label).

      Treatment is then stopped and followed after 1 or 2 days by a single dose of human chorionic
      Gonadotropin 10000 International units to induce oocyte maturation.
