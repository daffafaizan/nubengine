      carfilzomib in leukemia cell lines as well as in primary human acute myeloid and acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The anti-leukemic activity of carfilzomib was consistently more
      potent than that of bortezomib, particularly at doses â‰¥27mg/m2. Importantly, patients treated
      on the phase I and phase II carfilzomib trials have had low rates of treatment-associated
      neuropathy. Several large collaborative groups have current phase II clinical trials that
      incorporate bortezomib into the treatment regimens for acute myeloid or acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. Thus, there is a strong rationale for a study of carfilzomib, a potentially more
      potent proteasome inhibitor with less toxicity, in patients with relapsed acute leukemias.
