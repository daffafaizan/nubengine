      congenital heart disease, because most common long-term morbidities of newborn heart surgery
      are related not to the heart, but instead to the cognitive challenges experienced by this
      population. Disruption of cerebral autoregulation in the postoperative period may contribute
      to brain injury in these patients. Blood pressure management, respirator management and red
      blood cell transfusion management after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery using endpoints such
      cerebral autoregulation monitoring might provide a method to optimize organ perfusion and
      improve neurologic outcome from cardiac surgery in the vulnerable postoperative period.

      Primary Objectives: Feasibility of non-invasive cerebral autoregulation measurement at the
      PICU: Identification of the range of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with optimal
      vasoreactivity (MAPOPT), indicating intact cerebral autoregulation.

      Secondary Objectives: Impact of decreased oxygen delivery, increased cerebral oxygen
      extraction, decreased cardiac output, arterial hypotension, severe hypoxemia and/or severe
      anemia on cerebral autoregulation.
