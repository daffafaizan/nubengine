      I. Evaluate the penetration of AXL inhibitor BGB324 (BGB324) across the blood brain barrier
      measured by pharmacokinetics/drug concentration of 1.0 uM in tissue resected from a contrast
      enhancing region of the tumor in 60% of recurrent glioblastoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine AXL expression, phosphorylation state (AXL phosphospecific antibody if AXL is
      inhibited), and circulating soluble AXL levels.

      II. Determine the BGB324 concentration in tissue resected from a contrast non-enhancing
      region of the tumor.

      III. Characterize the steady state pharmacokinetics of BGB324 in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma.

      IV. Estimate safety and tolerability of BGB324 for recurrent glioblastoma. V. Assess the
      progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Participants receive AXL inhibitor BGB324 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5,
      then undergo surgery 3-6 hours after last dose. Within 45 days, participants receive AXL
      inhibitor BGB324 PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Participants undergo surgery, then within 45 days receive AXL inhibitor BGB324 PO QD
      on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days.
