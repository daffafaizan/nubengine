    
      Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an
      inherited multisystemic disorder with recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and
      visceral arteriovenous malformations. Literature and the investigators' observation suggest
      that HHT is often associated with higher frequency of infectious diseases. This might be a
      hint for a immunocompromised situation.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a variety of immunologic parameters in the blood
      serum of HHT patients in comparison to probands.
