      of consciousness in DOC (disorder of consciousness) patients. The P3 wave, elicited by
      listening standard and deviant stimuli, corresponds to the activation of a frontoparietal
      network and is considered to reflect a cognitive attention task. Using the own name of the
      patient as deviant stimuli improve the ability to detect the P3 wave because of the
      particularly relevance of this stimulus for the patient. However the correlation of this P3
      wave and neurologic prognosis is still imperfect and depends on the etiology of the DOC.

      In human cognition, to identify the expressivity valence of a voice is essential. Neural
      processing of expressive voices involves more widespread brain areas than neutral voices
      processing.

      Here the investigators assume that using own name stimuli uttered by more expressive voices
      (positive : smiling voice or negative : rough voice) should recruit more widespread brain
      areas and modulate the cerebral responses recorded. The investigators then evaluate if these
      cerebral responses are relevant markers of consciousness and correlate them to neurologic
      prognosis at three months.
