      general population). Cockroach or spider phobia is a type of specific phobia, animal type.
      The gold standard for the treatment of specific phobia (included small animal phobia) is in
      vivo exposure. Most phobia sufferers (60-80%) never seek treatment. Besides, not all patients
      benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of them do not accept the
      intervention or drop out (around 25%) when they are informed about the intervention
      procedure.

      Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented
      Reality (AR) are pioneer applications that can improve treatment adherence and acceptance.
      There exist some studies offering preliminary evidence of the efficacy of AR for the
      treatment of small animal phobia. However, there are not any controlled study exploring the
      differential efficacy of ICT-based exposure interventions versus in vivo exposure. In the
      present study the differential efficacy of AR exposure versus in vivo exposure for the
      treatment of small animal phobia is explored with a between subject randomized controlled
      trial. A pre-treatment assessment will be conducted in order to establish the diagnosis and
      evaluate the main outcome measures. All participants will receive an intensive exposure
      session following Ã–st guidelines, (in vivo exposure in one experimental condition and AR
      exposure in the other experimental condition). After the treatment a post-treatment
      assessment will be carried out as well as follow-up assessments at 3- and 12-month after
      treatment completion.
