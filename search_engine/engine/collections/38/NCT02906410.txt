      assigned to participants. Participants will first be randomly assigned to either the numeric
      label survey or the light label survey, and then within that survey, participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a control (no label), an item-level label, or an item-level and
      meal-level label condition.

      Participants will select a hypothetical lunch from a menu that features entrees, sides, and
      drinks. Participants will be able to select a maximum of 1 item from each category. Following
      this meal selection, participants will complete a short survey about their demographics,
      their estimates of information about the meal and about recommended eating habits.
