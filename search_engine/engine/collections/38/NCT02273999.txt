      delivering pulsed radiofrequency energy to tissues to treat postoperative pain and edema.
      This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of PEMF delivered
      with a wearable device in terms of postoperative pain and quality of healing after mandibular
      third molar extraction.

      Materials and methods: The sample included 120 patients undergoing unilateral mandibular
      third molar extraction. At the end of the surgical procedure, patients were randomly assigned
      to a test (T) or placebo (P) group and fitted with enabled or disabled PEMF devices,
      respectively, or to a control (C) group not fitted with a PEMF device. The devices were
      positioned over the area corresponding to the extraction site and wearers were asked to keep
      them in place for 7 days. All patients were asked to record pain (on a visual analog scale
      [VAS]), hours of wearing the device (groups T and P), and any use of analgesics. At 7 days,
      healing complications (dehiscence, tumefaction, pus, local lymphadenopathy, pain on
      palpation, postoperative bleeding, alveolitis) were recorded blindly.
