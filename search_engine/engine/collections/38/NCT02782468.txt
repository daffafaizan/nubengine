      treat people with myelodysplastic syndromes MDS (including nonproliferative chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]) and AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) as a single-agent and in
      combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look at the safety and tolerability,
      the recommended phase 2/phase 3 dose of pevonedistat administered in combination with
      azacitidine, pharmacokinetics and response to treatment in participants who take single agent
      pevonedistat compared to participants who take pevonedistat and azacitidine.

      The study will enroll approximately 37 participants. Participants will be assigned into one
      of the four treatment groups which will remain disclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study. Participants will be first enrolled at single-agent low dose level (25
      mg/m^2). If this dose is tolerable, participants will be enrolled in parallel at single-agent
      higher dose level (44 mg/m^2) and in combination treatment cohorts.

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2

        -  Pevonedistat 44 mg/m^2

        -  Pevonedistat 10 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination Participants will receive
           pevonedistat infusion intravenously and azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous
           route.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 24 months. Participants will attend the End of
      Study (EOS) visit for safety, 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before
      the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (other than hydroxyurea).
