    
      Eligible patients with non metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma will be randomized into 2 different
      arms: standard treatment arm A (based on the ISG/SSG III protocol) or into the experimental
      arm B(chemotherapy with dose intensification and shorter length of treatment).

      Both arm will receive an induction treatment with higher dose intensity of doxorubicin and
      ifosfamide in Arm B.

      After the induction treatment all the patient will undergo to local treatment (surgery and/or
      radiotherapy)that will be followed by a maintenance therapy.

      The maintenance therapy will be different for both arms and, within each arm, on the basis of
      the response (histologically evaluated) of the pre-local treatment therapy.

      Maintenance for Arm A: Poor responders will undergo to stem cells apheresis and their
      reinfusion after treatment with high doses of Busulfan and Melphalan 25 weeks.

      Good responders will receive a 6 drugs maintenance treatment for 37 weeks (as per standard
      ISG/SSG III protocol)

      Maintenance for Arm B: Poor responders will undergo to stem cells apheresis and their
      reinfusion after an intensified treatment with high doses of Busulfan and Melphalan (25
      weeks).

      Good responders will receive a maintenance treatment for 25 weeks

      The primary aim of the study is to assess the Event Free Survival (EFS) that is expected to
      be similar in both arms

      The secondary objectives are:

      To assess if the induction treatment in Arm B is able to increase the percentage of good
      responders compared to those who receive standard treatment.

      To assess the toxicity and the Quality of Life related to the chemotherapy treatment
