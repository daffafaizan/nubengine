      the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection,
      excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the
      cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.

      Liver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once
      liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice,
      ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival
      drops to about 50%.

      The definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver
      transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related
      mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a
      limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus
      the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated
      as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and peripheral CD34
      positive cells. Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had
      autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these
      patients with cirrhotic livers.

      The sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver
      cirrhosis in Singapore. This will be a Phase I/II study with the main emphasis on the safety
      profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local
      regulatory requirement(s).
