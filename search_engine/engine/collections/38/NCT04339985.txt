    
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical ATx201 OINTMENT in adolescents and adults with
      mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis.

      Approximately 210 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ATx201 OINTMENT 4%, ATx201
      OINTMENT 7%, or OINTMENT vehicle for 6 weeks. Treatments will be balanced into consecutive
      blocks in 1:1:1 ratio for the active groups and vehicle.

      Sixteen additional subjects (adults and adolescents) will be enrolled in a 2-week open label
      substudy of twice-daily ATx201 OINTMENT 7% to evaluate the PK profile of ATx201.
