      obtained, the care team for each person, consisting of both medical and caregiver staff, will
      define up to three specific care area goals and related tasks for treatment. A comprehensive
      spasticity management program will then be developed for the individual. Clinical and outcome
      assessments at baseline and at follow-up will include measures of range of motion, global
      spasticity according to a modified Ashworth scale, and the time and number of staff required
      for the task. In addition, video will be obtained of caregivers performing each participant's
      care area tasks at baseline and follow-up to allow an independent external reviewer to judge
      task difficulty. Treatment will be provided as outlined by the spasticity management plan.
      Follow-up evaluations will be conducted when the participant is at least one year from their
      initial Botulinum injection, or are one year post-implant for ITB participants. When the
      participant is exited from the study, Survey Physician will be asked to rate the overall
      impact of the Program on each of the individual's care area tasks.
