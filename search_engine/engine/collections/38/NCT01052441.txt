      coronary atherosclerosis. The diagnostic performance of CCTA for detecting coronary artery
      plaque burden has been validated in numerous studies, reaching a negative predictive value of
      99%.

      The current gold standard for anatomic coronary imaging is Invasive Coronary Angiography
      (ICA) which portends a small but significant procedural-related complication of 1.7%.
      Non-invasive coronary imaging has the potential to replace ICA but the variability in
      diagnostic performance of CCTA remains under study. Among the potential variables causing
      differences in diagnostic performance is perhaps the degree of opacification of coronary
      artery by iodinated contrast. While numerous contrast agents exist, those that provide
      improved low and high contrast resolution (for delineating plaque from arterial wall and
      lumen from plaque, respectively) are hypothetically, the most optimal agents. To date,
      however, this has not been well evaluated. Further, use of a contrast agent which maximizes
      patient comfort is desired, as this may reduce heart rate increases and heart rate
      variability, which may in turn improve diagnostic image quality of CCTA.

      We hypothesize that the use of lower iodine content iso-osmolar agent - iodixanol - will
      improve diagnostic performance and patient comfort, as compared to higher iodine content low
      osmolar iodinated contrast - iopamidol.
