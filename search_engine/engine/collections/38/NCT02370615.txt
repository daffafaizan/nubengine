      pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving TAK-272
      alone and those receiving TAK-272 in combination with itraconazole. In Cohort 2, the effect
      of repeated-dose administration of TAK-272 on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or midazolam
      was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving digoxin or midazolam alone and
      those receiving either of the drugs in combination with TAK-272.
