      of platelet leukocyte aggregates through the blood count test. The parameters which are
      obtained routinely for white blood cell counts include: capacity - electrical conductivity
      (conductivity) - dispersion (scatter), and volume. Though these values are not reported
      routinely, they can be accessed for each blood count.

      The premise is that through blood counts (no need for specialized flow cytometry) and through
      the parameters mentioned a conclusion can be reached about platelet leukocyte aggregates.
      This will then aid in prognosis about the risk of an acute event for every patient with
      ischemic heart disease who comes to the emergency room.
