      8*1 or conventional PFAT 8*1 plus COE 2*1 was determined randomly. Student's paired samples
      t-test, independent samples Student's t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U
      test were used to compare data. All patients responded well to both treatments after the
      first 1-month treatment period, based on comparison of before and after treatment OSDI
      scores, Schirmer's test results, TBUT values, and OXFORD scale scores.
