      Measure in the before phase of a before-and-after study in adult cystic fibrosis care
      settings. The coopeRATE Measure is a generic, patient-reported experience measure of
      collaborative goal setting that was recently developed in consultation with patients and
      other key stakeholders. Aim 2 will assess the impact of the coopeRATE Prompt intervention on
      collaborative goal setting and other outcomes in a before-and-after study in adult cystic
      fibrosis care settings. The coopeRATE Prompt intervention is a set of questions delivered to
      patients immediately before the clinical encounter that elicit their concerns and goals. Aim
      3 will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the coopeRATE Prompt and
      Measure in routine adult cystic fibrosis care.
