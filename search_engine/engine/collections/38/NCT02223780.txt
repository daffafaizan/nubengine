      Intervention Early specialized palliative care intervention Significance Given the trends
      toward aggressive and costly care near end-of-life among patients with COPD, a timely
      introduction of palliative care may limit unnecessary and burdensome personal and societal
      costs, and invasive approaches. The results of this study may provide some direction for
      future palliative care interventions in this particular population
