    
      Status asthmaticus is defined as severe asthma that fails to respond to inhaled short acting
      Î² agonists (SABA), oral or intravenous steroids, and oxygen, leading to hospital admission
      for further management (1). In 2004, asthma exacerbations led to 3% (198,000) of all
      hospitalizations and 2.5 deaths per 1 million populations in the 0-17 year age group (2).

      This prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled, pilot clinical trial will compare NPPV
      plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in children admitted for status
      asthmaticus. NPPV refers to the delivery of pressurized gas through an external interface
      such as a nasal or oronasal mask, connected to a pressure targeted ventilator. In other
      words, it provides ventilator support without the use of an endotracheal tube.

      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of early initiation of
      non-invasive NPPV in pediatric patients admitted with status asthmaticus.
