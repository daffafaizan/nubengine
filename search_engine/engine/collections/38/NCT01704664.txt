      complications. Morbidity of cancer patients increases in concert with the clinical stage of
      the malignancy. It is postulated that a reduction in perioperative morbidity and improved
      quality of life of patients with advanced gastric cancer can be achieved by proper
      preparation to surgery, among others. One of such methods is the implementation of
      immunostimulating nutritional therapy during the perioperative period.The stage of cancer
      will be graded according to TNM classification. The patients will be randomly assigned to
      four clinical groups based on the type of nutritional therapy implemented.
