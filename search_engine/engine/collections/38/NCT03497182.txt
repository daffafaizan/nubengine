      the hospital's Sepsis Patient Management Protocol for blood lactate point of care testing.
      The breath samples will be collected from the patient by the Respiratory Therapist (RT) at
      the time of blood sample collection for the blood lactate test.

      The breath samples will be analyzed via gas chromatography-surface acoustic wave spectroscopy
      for detection of a pattern of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Multivariate analysis will
      be performed on breath sample data to determine feasibility of associating a unique VOC
      pattern with septic/severe septic/septic shock patients.
