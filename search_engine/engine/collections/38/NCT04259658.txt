      mechanisms in 12 patients with breast cancer metastases and 12 patients with other cutaneous
      or subcutaneous malignancy. The primary endpoint of the biopsy study is to evaluate
      differences in tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) population in tissue samples from treated
      cancer tumours two days after calcium electroporation treatment compared to samples taken on
      the day of treatment before the calcium electroporation procedure. TIL content in biopsies
      will be evaluated by pathological examination and specified in percent of cells. Patients
      will be followed up to 3 months and depending on number of treated tumors, biopsies will be
      taken at different timepoints after one or two treatments with calcium electroporation. Other
      analyses will include differences regarding tumour type, immune marker expression levels over
      time, vascular effects and regressive changes as well as examining changes in systemic
      immunological markers.
