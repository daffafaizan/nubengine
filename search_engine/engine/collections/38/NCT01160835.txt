      randomly assigned to either quadriceps-sparing (QS, 40 knees) or medial parapatellar (MP, 40
      knees) group. All surgeries were designed to set the prosthesis with thefemoral component
      alignment of 7ยบ valgus and the tibial component alignment perpendicular to tibial shaft.
      Outcome variables included knee function defined by Hospital for Special Surgery knee score,
      quadriceps muscle strength measured by isokinetic dynamometer, pain indicated on visual
      analogue scale, range of motion, and post-operative alignment measured on plain radiograph.
