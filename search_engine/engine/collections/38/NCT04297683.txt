    
      The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a perpetual multi-center, multi-regimen clinical trial
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational products for the treatment of ALS. This
      trial is designed as a perpetual platform trial. This means that there is a single Master
      Protocol dictating the conduct of the trial.

      In this trial, multiple investigational products for ALS will be tested simultaneously or
      sequentially. Each investigational product will be tested in a regimen. Each regimen consists
      of a placebo-controlled trial, meaning that the active investigational product and matching
      placebo will be tested in each regimen.

      The additional details that govern the testing of each investigational product will be
      summarized in separate regimen-specific appendices (RSAs). Each regimen will have a separate
      ClinicalTrials.gov posting, which will include specific information about the regimen. All
      regimen-specific outcome measures will be detailed in each regimen posting.

      Participants will have an equal chance to be randomized to all regimens that are active at
      the time of screening. Once randomized to a regimen, participants will be randomized in a 3:1
      ratio to either study drug or placebo.

      The following regimens are active in the trial:

      Regimen A - Zilucoplan Regimen B - Verdiperstat Regimen C - CNM-Au8 Regimen D - Priodopidine

      New regimens will be continuously added as new investigational products become available. The
      HEALEY ALS Platform Trial will enroll additional participants as each new regimen is
      available.
