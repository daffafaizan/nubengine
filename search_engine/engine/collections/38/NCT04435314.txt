    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the drug nitazoxanide 600
      mg, administered three times a day, in relation to placebo in preventing the development of
      COVID-19 in subjects from vulnerable communities that had direct contact with patients
      diagnosed with the disease.

      Subjects that PCR is negative after having direct contact with symptomatic subjects and
      diagnosed with COVID-19 (PCR positive) will be randomized to receive Nitazoxanide TID or
      placebo TID for 7 days.
