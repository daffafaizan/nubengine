      different combinations.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-level relationship of sirolimus through
      pharmacokinetic study. The dose-level relationship of cyclosporine and tacrolimus was also
      assessed. From clinical outcome and blood level of sirolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus,
      we can design the most appropriate cyclosporine/sirolimus/steroid or
      tacrolimus/sirolimus/steroid dose regimen for Taiwanese.
