      type II DM (diabetes mellitus) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A subclinical
      inflammatory state is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome,
      insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease (CAD). TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine
      that is increased in a spectrum of inflammatory diseases as well as in insulin resistance.
      TNF-alpha antagonists are clinically effective in the inflammation of arthritides, but have
      not been examined in the metabolic syndrome population. Moreover, data suggests that
      adiponectin, a recently discovered adipocytokine that may protect against the development of
      insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, may be downregulated by TNF-alpha. We propose a study
      in which we administer etanercept, a TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, to subjects with
      metabolic syndrome to examine its effect on inflammatory markers,CRP, adiponectin and insulin
      resistance. This would be the first study to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties and
      insulin sensitizing potential of TNF-alpha blockade on the growing population with metabolic
      syndrome.
