      provide 24h efficacy; they improve adherence to therapy and minimize BP variability with
      smoother and more consistent BP control.

      Valsartan has been approved to be used once-daily, without any specification of
      treatment-time in package insert. Several trials have investigated the differential effects
      of morning versus evening administration of valsartan in hypertensive patients, however, the
      results of these studies were contradicting. Furthermore, the specific administration time
      dependent dose response curve have not been previously investigated. So, this study designed
      to investigate the potential influence of the time of drug administration on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the valsartan in healthy subjects.
