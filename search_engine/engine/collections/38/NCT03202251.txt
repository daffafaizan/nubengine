      specific neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Essential Tremor.
      DBS is implanted when symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled with medications or
      conventional therapies. After insertion of deep electrodes, electrical stimulation will be
      delivered to modulate specific neurons in certain areas of the brain. Despite, the known
      motor effects for DBS, its nonmotor effects on other organs such as the urinary tract and
      bladder function remains unclear. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency,
      urinary incontinence, or incomplete bladder emptying are common in patients who have
      underlying neurological or movement disorders. In addition, central neural control over lower
      urinary tract function is still poorly understand. In this trial investigators plan to
      evaluate the effects of Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) on lower urinary tract function. This
      trial is designed to test the hypothesis that DBS improves objective and subjective symptoms
      of lower urinary tract function in specific patient populations. The investigators plan to
      test this hypothesis by using validated patient reported outcome questionnaires and
      urodynamic testing (both are part of routine care for neurogenic bladder) before and after
      DBS implantation. In addition, this trial will shed some light in understanding higher neural
      control of bladder and potentially identify target areas for future intervention.
