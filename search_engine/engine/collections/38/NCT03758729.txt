    
      This is a phase II, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the response rate, efficacy
      and safety of nivolumab in combination with radiation therapy in subjects with of locally
      advanced, unresectable head and neck mucosal melanoma.

      A cycle is defined as 14 days. The nivolumab dose will be fixed at the recommended phase II
      dose of 3mg/kg as a 60-minute IV infusion every two weeks. Patients will continue on
      nivolumab up to 8 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's
      decision to remove patient from the study, patient refusal to continue, or alternative
      treatment.

      Concurrent radiotherapy of 70Gy for 6-7 weeks will be initiated on the same day of first
      nivolumab dose of cycle 1.

      The combination of 70 Gy radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks begins on the day of initial
      administration of nivolumab, radiation therapy dose and treatment schedule 2.0, based on NCFC
      practice.

      Nivolumab is administered every two weeks in in combination with radiation therapy and has
      elapsed since 8 weeks (after 4 cycles) The administration of clinical trials in is terminated
      but nivolumabs is sustainable at the discretion of investigator. (This is carried out
      independently of the clinical trial) The response rate of radiation therapy is assessed by
      performing a tumor assessment every two months up to the end of radiation therapy.
