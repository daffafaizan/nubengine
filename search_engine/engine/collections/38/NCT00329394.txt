      on the control of the pain (average consumption of morphine at 48 hours) at the
      alcool-dependent patient, in carcinological surgery ORL. The effect coanalgesic is found for
      low dose of ketamine and action anti NMDA seems to have a stabilizing effect on this
      particular type of patient. This imbalance of the receivers, with a greater number of r-NMDA
      among these patients would involve it a better analgesic effectiveness and less effects
      dysphoric, to see an improvement on the syndrome of weaning. The secondary objectives
      evaluate the pain, the ground (dependence with alcohol), the first request analgesic, the
      tolerance and the signs psychic (syndrome of weaning...) and the satisfaction of the patient.
