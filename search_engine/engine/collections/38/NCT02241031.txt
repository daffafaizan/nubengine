      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Owing to the short storage time and increased demand
      of platelets from unrelated donors, a constant shortage in the supply of platelets has become
      an important medical and society challenge. Therefore, investigation of alternative sources
      of platelets would be beneficial.

      Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be used to generate functional megakaryocytic progenitors
      (MPs), megakaryocytes, and platelets on a large scale. Functional MPs and platelets have
      successfully been produced in vitro from CD34+ hematopoietic cells from bone marrow, cord
      blood, and peripheral blood. Several studies have reported that transplantation of in vitro
      auto-producing MPs can promote platelet recovery after high-dose therapy and HSC
      transplantation.

      Umbilical cord blood is an abundant source of HSCs. In vitro large scale production of MPs
      from cord blood could represent an effective platelet substitute. Theoretically, the
      additional transplantation of ex vivo generated progenitor and post-progenitor cells might
      lead to the production of sufficient numbers of mature functional cells within a few days
      after transplantation.
