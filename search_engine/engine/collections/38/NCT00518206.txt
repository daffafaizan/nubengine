      of 100 µg of the NY-ESO-1 protein + 120 µg of the ISCOM adjuvant. These 6 subjects were
      monitored for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for 7 days after the first vaccination. Upon
      observation of tolerability (ie, < 2/6 subjects with DLT), enrollment proceeded to a total
      accrual of approximately 25 subjects. Subjects received 3 vaccinations administered every 4
      weeks (ie, weeks 1, 5, and 9) followed by immunological and clinical response evaluations,
      with clinical responses categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST). In the absence of disease progression, subjects may have received 3
      additional vaccinations administered every 4 weeks, followed by additional vaccinations
      administered every 12 weeks thereafter until development of disease progression or other
      criteria for discontinuation.

      In Cohort 2, subjects received the NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccine on the same schedule as described
      for Cohort 1, but Cohort 2 subjects also received a single intravenous infusion of low-dose
      cyclophosphamide 1 day prior to each NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccination. If responses were observed
      in 2 of 16 subjects initially treated in Cohort 2, then 9 additional subjects were to be
      accrued to Cohort 2, for a total potential accrual of 25 subjects.
