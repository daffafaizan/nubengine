      adolescents. Obese children and adolescents have significant reductions in growth hormone
      secretion, and we hypothesize that augmenting growth hormone in this population will decrease
      liver fat. Growth hormone inhibits hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which is an important source
      of hepatic lipid. Patients with pituitary GH deficiency have a higher prevalence of NAFLD and
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) than the general population, and replacement of GH in
      these individuals reduces signs of liver damage. The purpose of this study is to test the
      hypothesis that growth hormone treatment will decrease liver fat quantity in young adults who
      begin the trial with more than 5% liver fat measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
