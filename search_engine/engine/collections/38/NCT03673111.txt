      Primary Objective

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of single doses of Y14 in overweight/obese
           but otherwise healthy male subjects.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Y14 in overweight/obese
           male subjects with normal glucose tolerance, Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single doses of Y14 in overweight/obese
           but otherwise healthy male subjects.

        -  To assess the PK profile of multiple ascending doses of Y14 in overweight/obese male
           subjects with normal glucose tolerance, Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

      Exploratory Objective

        -  To investigate the effects of multiple doses of Y14 on food consumption, body weight,
           enteropancreatic hormone changes and glucose tolerance in overweight/obese male subjects
           with normal glucose tolerance, Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.
