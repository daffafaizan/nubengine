    
      Rolipram is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4 inhibitor that has originally been developed by
      Schering AG, Berlin, Germany, as an antidepressant, before others and our laboratory
      documented the immunomodulatory properties of the drug. In the current trial, Rolipram will
      for the first time be tested as a novel immunomodulatory therapy in multiple sclerosis
      patients. The protocol involves a stage I for finding the highest individually well-tolerated
      drug dose, before stage II, and 8 months treatment period with this individually
      well-tolerated dose, will be conducted. The trial shall document the safety, tolerability an
      efficacy with respect to inhibition of central nervous inflammation in multiple sclerosis
      patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examinations will be used to study the
      above parameters, and immunological studies that will be conducted in parallel to the trial,
      will address the mechanism of action of Rolipram in MS.
