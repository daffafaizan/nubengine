      control the pelvic pain caused by malignancy or other chronic condition. Classic posterior
      approach for this procedure is inserting the block needle at L4 -5 level and proceed the
      needle 45 degrees medially and 30 degrees caudally to reach the target of anterolateral space
      of L5 - S1 intervertebral space. Waldman et al. introduced a different angle of 30 degrees
      medial and caudal with the same approach, while Stevens et al. recommended 15 degrees medial
      and 20 degrees caudal. As such, the recommended angle for this procedure is different among
      references, and there is a need for suggesting a more accurate entry angle for this
      procedure. Therefore, we are trying to evaluate the entry angle for superior hypogastric
      plexus block by measuring these angle on the computed tomography image and apply these angle
      to the real patients.
