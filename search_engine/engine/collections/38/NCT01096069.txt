      severe immune diseases and resistance to conventional treatment. One of the mechanisms of
      action of this drug is the complement-mediated lysis. Most RA patients respond well to
      rituximab treatment, however, some are refractory and mechanism of this non-response is still
      unclear. The role of CD55 and CD59 protein and its overexpression as a mechanism of
      resistance to rituximab treatment in lymphoma patients have been investigated. However, there
      has not been studied a correlation between the intensity of expression of these regulatory
      molecules on B cells of RA patients and resistance to treatment with Rituximab.
