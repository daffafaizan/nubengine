      develops due to progressive loss of nephrons. This state is characterized by a gradual
      deterioration of the functional abilities of not only the kidneys, but also the whole body.
      Currently, ESRD is among the first ten causes of mortality .

      terminal, for patients with a fatal prognosis.

      morphological, clinical, biochemical and instrumental methods to assess functional reserve of
      organs that remain relevant and meaningful.
