    
      After one hour from the patient's ICU admission and after stabilization of the patient's
      haemodynamics, alveolar recruitment will be done for hypoxic patients with hypoxic index less
      than 250.

      The recruitment will be started in the adaptive ventilation mode (AVM mode) using modified
      stepwise staircase recruitment maneuver in which every 2 minutes positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) is increased in increments of 2 cmH2O and the driving pressure will be
      regulated by AVM mode.

      The increase in PEEP will be guided by improvement of dynamic compliance, oxygen saturation
      and transalveolar pressure (PTA) till near overdistention.

      Overdistension will be detected if there are decrease in the mean arterial pressure 25% from
      the base line value reported after stabilization of the patient's haemodynamics, or decreased
      oxygen saturation or sudden decrease in dynamic compliance, or inspiratory PTA more than15 cm
      H2O.

      Then PEEP is decreased 2 cm H2O every 3 minutes till a decrease expiratory PTA less than 1 cm
      H2O, or a decrease in dynamic compliance or a decrease in oxygen saturation â‰¥ 1% from maximum
      oxygen saturation is observed (the derecruitment point) then return to a PEEP level 2 cm H2O
      above the derecruitment point (the optimal PEEP).

      Alveolar recruitment will be done once.
