      been accompanied by the associated finding that antigen-escape variants of the disease are
      responsible for relapse. Despite anti-CD19 CAR-T exhibited the ability to re-induce
      remissions for many patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies, a part of
      those patients will relapse with CD19-negative malignancies. CD22 is a type I transmembrane
      protein expressed on most mature B lymphocyte in the B cell malignanciesï¼Œand plays a
      significant role in signal transduction pathway. The investigators design and conduct this
      trial to test the safety and effectiveness of CD22-targeted CAR-T.
