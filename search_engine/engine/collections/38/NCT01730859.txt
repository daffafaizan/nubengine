      and neural systems. This set is called postural control system. Postural control involves the
      control of body position in space for the dual purposes of postural stability and postural
      orientation. Balance process is divided into four-stage by Sullivan and Markos: mobility,
      stability, controlled mobility, and skill. Several types of exercise have been proposed to
      improve proprioception. Bout and Gahery stated that balance exercises improve neuromuscular
      relations and reduces the proprioception errors. They believe that those who have more
      proprioception difficulty may benefit more from exercise therapy.Taping is another technique
      to enhance proprioception. Improvement in proprioception leads to better function and
      reduction of disability. Kinesiotaping is being used to prevent injuries and to help curing
      the injury. It can also improve efficiency in sport, improve lymph and venous circulation,
      decrease edema, stimulate the mechanoreceptors and increase awareness of subject about the
      ankle position, reduces the pain and improves muscle performance
