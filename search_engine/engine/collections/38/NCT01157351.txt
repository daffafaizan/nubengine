    
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate with
      oral antipsychotic treatment in delaying time to a protocol-defined treatment failure over 15
      months, in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who have been incarcerated. Protocol-defined
      treatment failure is defined as arrest, psychiatric hospitalization, increase in psychiatric
      services to prevent imminent hospitalization, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due
      to inadequate efficacy, treatment supplementation with another antipsychotic due to
      inadequate efficacy, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to safety or tolerability
      or completed suicide. Protocol was amended on March 15, 2011 to reflect changes in the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as the study objectives. Patients will receive either
      paliperidone palmitate 78, 117, 156, or 234 mg monthly by injection for fifteen months OR
      oral aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, and
      risperidone at doses selected by the study doctor.
