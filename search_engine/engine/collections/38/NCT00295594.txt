      in immunosuppressive maintenance could demonstrate alternatives to current immunosuppressive
      regimens. There is evidence that reduced steroid usage could further decrease the onset of
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension and viral infections combined with high efficacy for patients
      and graft survival. Since the use of MMF in liver transplantation is becoming an alternative
      in the rescue setting this could contribute to a steroid-free immunosuppressive approach.
