    
      This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of oral
      administration of HPN-07 in single doses to healthy male and female subjects between 18 and
      55 years of age.

      Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in a panel of 4 cohorts with approximately 8
      subjects per cohort. There will be approximately 3 sequential ascending dosing levels of
      HPN-07, with each cohort administered 1 dose of HPN-07 ranging from 500 mg to 1,500 mg and
      the fourth cohort administered the highest tolerated dose of HPN-07 plus 1,200 mg NAC.

      The primary endpoint of this trial is to establish the safety and tolerability of HPN-07 and
      HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of HPN-07 will enable a
      preliminary determination of the relationship between dose and the time course of the drug
      concentration in the body. Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals over the
      predicted time of HPN-07 systemic exposure.
