    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the safety of a progressive, home-based, tele-exercise resistance training
      (tele-RT) intervention in patients undergoing first line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy for advanced
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Study 1) and in survivors who have undergone
      pancreatic cancer resection (Study 2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the tele-RT intervention.

      II. Evaluate changes in the following exploratory outcome measures over the course of
      first-line FOLFIRINOX for advanced PDAC and associations between resistance training (RT)
      volumes and their changes:

      IIa. Muscular strength IIb. Muscular endurance IIc. Body composition (skeletal muscle mass)
      IId. Aerobic fitness IIe. Self-reported physical activity IIf. Self-reported physical
      functioning IIg. Fatigue IIh. Peripheral neuropathy IIi. Health-related quality of life (QOL)
      IIj. Completion of intended chemotherapy dose (Among patients who are undergoing
      chemotherapy; all participants in Study 1 and some in Study 2) IIk. Exercise motivation IIl.
      Exercise self-efficacy IIm. Social support for exercise IIn. Reduction or change in
      FOLFIRINOX treatment plan III. Evaluate cancer care providers' (treating physicians and other
      clinical personnel) perspectives regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the tele-RT
      intervention for their patients.

      OUTLINE:

      STUDY 1: During the first 2-3 months of first line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, patients complete
      at least 4 tele-RT sessions over 30-45 minutes each, every 2 weeks. Patients receive handouts
      created by MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) clinical dietitians including individualized
      recommendations for daily protein intake and information about healthy protein
      supplementation during chemotherapy. Patient may also attend a visit with a registered
      dietician (or delegate dietician) per standard of care, if they have renal insufficiency,
      special dietary needs, or difficulty adhering to protein recommendations.

      STUDY 2: After standard of care surgical resection, patients complete at least 4 tele-RT
      sessions over 30-45 minutes each, every 2 weeks for 2-3 months. Patients receive handouts
      created by MDACC clinical dietitians including individualized recommendations for daily
      protein intake and information about healthy protein supplementation during chemotherapy.
      Patient may also attend a visit with a registered dietician (or delegate dietician) per
      standard of care, if they have renal insufficiency, special dietary needs, or difficulty
      adhering to protein recommendations.
