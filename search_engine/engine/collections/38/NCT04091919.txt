      patients with ASD and only a few cases had a reduced LV ejection fraction with severe right
      ventricle (RV) volume overload. The device closure of ASD increases immediately the blood
      flow to the left ventricle and may unmask subtle abnormalities in systolic and diastolic
      function. Currently, clinical research in cardiac mechanics is moving from short- and
      long-axis LV and RV function and ejection fraction to two and three- dimensional (2D, 3D)
      ventricular deformation studies (Strain and Strain Rate quantiﬁcation). These methods are
      independent of ventricular geometry and allow quantiﬁcation of myocardial motion and
      deformation in different directions (longitudinal, radial, and circumferential), while
      conventional methods mainly rely on the assessment of radial function. Strain imaging has
      also been used to demonstrate that patients who underwent device closure of an ASD had better
      LV and RV longitudinal deformation than patients who underwent surgical closure of an ASD.
      However, the effect of device size on the LV systolic and diastolic function is still under
      investigations. For all these reasons the researchers intend to measure RV and LV
      haemodynamic changes by 2-D Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) derived Tissue Doppler and
      Strain quantification in ASD before and after transcatheter closure with special emphasis on
      the assessment of the relationship between device size and biventricular systolic and LV
      diastolic function.
