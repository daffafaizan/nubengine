      transplant patients. Patients are identified by the site investigator as a patient who has
      experienced favorable outcomes while in an Envarsus XR (LCP-Tacro) clinical study and/or the
      site investigator has identified a renal transplant patient with a medical need for an
      alternative tacrolimus treatment versus the patient's current tacrolimus treatment.
