      result in improved hand strength and mobility when compared with sham stimulation.

      Aim 1: To determine whether 1 Hz rTMS applied to the hemisphere opposite the infarct
      (contralesional or healthy hemisphere) is tolerated by children ages 6-18 years who have
      chronic motor sequelae from a stroke.

      Aim 2: To determine whether 8 sessions of inhibitory 1 Hz rTMS to the contralesional healthy
      hemisphere improves grip strength and hand mobility when compared with sham stimulation in
      controls.
