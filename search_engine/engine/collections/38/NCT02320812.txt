      administration of a single dose of jCell to adults with retinitis pigmentosa.

      The goal of jCell therapy is to preserve vision by intervening in the disease at a time when
      host photoreceptors can be protected and potentially reactivated.

      Human allogeneic retinal progenitor cells will be injected into adults with advanced RP to
      see if the procedure is safe, if the cells survive, and whether they have any impact on the
      visual status of the patients.
