      carcinoma of the esophagus treated with carboplatin and docetaxel. II. Assess the toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the time to progression and overall survival of
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, followed by carboplatin IV over
      15-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until year
      2, every 6 months during years 2-5, and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 30
      patients per year.
