        -  Assess the efficacy of epratuzumab and rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), as measured by 12-month,
           event-free survival, in patients with previously untreated stage II, III, or IV diffuse
           large B-cell lymphoma.>

        -  Assess the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan routinely early in treatment
           and after completion of treatment.>

        -  Assess the functional response rate (complete response, partial response, or stable
           disease by CT scan and PET negative) in patients treated with this regimen.>

        -  Assess the safety of this treatment regimen.> Secondary>

        -  Correlate laboratory prognostic factors for large cell lymphoma with clinical response
           to this regimen.> OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.> Patients receive epratuzumab IV
           over 1 hour on day 1, rituximab IV over 4-8 hours on day 1 or days 1 and 2,
           cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 or 2, and
           oral prednisone on days 1-5 or 2-6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.> After completion of
           study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.> PROJECTED
           ACCRUAL: A total of 86 patients will be accrued for this study.>
