      choice of the spermatozoon to be injected is done at a 400x magnification. Recently, a new
      microscopic technic (Intracytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm Injection-IMSI) allows
      to make this choice at a 6000x magnification, which permits to identify sperm abnormalities
      such as nuclear vacuoles not seen in conventional ICSI. This selection may improve ICSI
      outcome. However only few data from randomised trials, have been published and the
      indications of IMSI remain to be identified. The present study aims to evaluate the
      efficiency and the indications of IMSI through a multicentric randomised trial. The patients
      enrolled in the study must present a male infertility and will have complete sperm
      examination, including morphology, DNA fragmentation and nuclear immaturity. The main
      endpoint will be the percentage of delivery.
