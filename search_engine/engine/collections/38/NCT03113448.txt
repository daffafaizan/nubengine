      mellitus. The most common symptom is a symmetrical, chronic, axonal, length-dependent
      sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

      Topical capsaicin formulations are widely used to manage pain. Low-concentration creams,
      lotions, and patches intended for daily skin application have been available in most
      countries since the early 1980s.

      We study 0.075% capsaicin lotion is safe, well tolerated and provide significant pain relief
      in patients with PDN compared with placebo lotion as a randomized, double- Blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled trial for 20 weeks throughout the study in 42 participants. All
      participants are provided both 0.075% capsaicin lotion and placebo lotion. Each agent will be
      applied for 8 weeks then stop for 4 weeks, after that another agent will be used for 8 weeks.
      We keep following up all of them by calling and appointment to get information in
      effectiveness and adverse effect at 0,2,4,8,12,14,16,20 week, respectively.
