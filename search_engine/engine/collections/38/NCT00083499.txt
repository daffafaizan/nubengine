    
      The purpose of this multisite protocol is to collect protein, DNA, and RNA from blood,
      sputum, urine and/or tissue samples from patients with the diagnosis of Pentalogy of Cantrell
      (POC) or other related syndromes in order to identify possible causative genes. We will use
      whole exome/genome sequencing of probands, their parents, and, if available, the affected
      relatives of probands to look for any exomic/genomic mutations that could be associated with
      this syndrome. We have produced a mouse model with the mutant mice exhibiting problems with
      ventral wall closure including extrathoracic location of the heart (ectopia cordis), and
      defects in the abdominal wall with protrusion of the guts and liver. The mice, which have a
      single amino acid substitution in nonmuslce myosin II-B, have severe defects in both the
      heart and brain, and resemble humans born with POC, who manifest these same abnormalities.
