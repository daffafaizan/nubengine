      women, and women with PCOS are at increased risk for pregnancy complications such as
      gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Both hyperandrogenism (HA) and obesity exacerbated
      insulin resistance (IR) are characteristics of the syndrome, and are targets for treatment,
      but which should be the predominant focus is still unknown. Phase 1 of this study will be a
      randomized trial of three preconception interventions in infertile women with PCOS. The first
      arm will be a combined intervention of medication, meal replacements, and lifestyle
      modification to improve IR. Orlistat is a gastric lipase inhibitor that reduces the
      absorption of fat contained in a meal by about 30%. The second arm will be the use of a
      continuous OCP for 4 months to improve HA. Lo-Estrin 1/20 will be used in a continuous method
      for 4 months to suppress the ovary. The third arm is the combination of both to improve HA an
      IR. Phase II of this study will involve ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate with
      hopeful outcome of pregnancy. Finally, Phase III involve following the pregnancies for
      outcomes and complications.
