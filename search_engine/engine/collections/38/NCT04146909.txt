      In Aim 1, the research question is "Does lactation improve insulin sensitivity and increase
      lipolysis in women?" In this Aim, researchers will assess whether lactation amongst women
      with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will improve whole body insulin
      sensitivity as well as increase whole body lipid turnover by using
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps combined with [6,6-2H]-glucose and [2H5]-glycerol
      infusions. These stable, non-radiating isotopes have been used extensively and safely to
      study the mechanisms of insulin resistance amongst non-pregnant as well as pregnant humans;
      however, these techniques have not previously been applied to the study of insulin
      sensitivity during lactation. Therefore, the goals will be two-fold: 1) to determine whether
      lactation induces similar changes in insulin sensitivity in humans as in mice and 2) to pilot
      the feasibility of performing larger, more detailed metabolic studies in this population of
      women post-partum.

      The second aim (Aim 2) will use a retrospective chart review of women with a history of GDM
      who had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 6-8 weeks post-partum as part of standard of
      care.

      The focus of this protocol registration will be Aim 1.
