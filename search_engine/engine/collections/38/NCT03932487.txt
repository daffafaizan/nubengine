      reproduction women were selected as normal group. Women age, BMI, thyroid disease history,
      family history, marital and reproductive history, whether the application of iodized salt,
      thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies detection were recorded. Meanwhile urine iodine,
      urinary iodine/urinary creatinine, urine BPA and urinary BPA/creatinine were tested. The
      urine iodine and BPA levels of the two groups were compared. Taking AITD as the dependent
      variable, logistic regression was conducted to analyze whether urinary iodine and BPA were
      risk factors of AITD.
