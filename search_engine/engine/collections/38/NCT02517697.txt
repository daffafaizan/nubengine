      Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets significantly reduced
      blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease in general,
      the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical and clinical research over the
      last decade has revealed the important vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with
      regards to reduction in blood pressure, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
      More recent findings suggest that inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in
      the regulation of glucose-insulin homeostasis.

      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrite salt represents a rational
      avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby nitrite would
      ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption. Nitrite could then be oxidized to nitrate via
      the enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is
      concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate
      reductase enzymes. The proposal will investigate the inorganic nitrite effects (in any form)
      on insulin sensitivity in a targeted population of overweight/obese adults with metabolic
      syndrome and hypertension, at risk for insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. This
      will be the third human trial using orally delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous
      solution).
