        -  Determine the response rate, duration of response, and overall survival of patients with
           refractory or relapsed ovarian epithelial cancer treated with high-dose
           cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and mitoxantrone followed by autologous bone marrow
           transplantation.

        -  Determine the nonhematopoietic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous bone marrow is harvested before study entry. Patients receive high-dose
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days -8, -6, and -4
      and carboplatin IV continuously on days -8 to -3 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0 beginning at least 60 hours after completion of carboplatin
      infusion.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-3
      years.
