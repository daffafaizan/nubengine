    
      A randomized Multicentric open-label controlled trial. The primary objective of the study is
      to assess the improvement of endothelial function under sulodexide + conventional treatment
      (antiplatelet therapy; plus ACE inhibitor; plus Statin in patients with cholesterol total
      level > 1,35 g/l) or conventional treatment alone in patients with Leriche-Fontaine stage II
      peripheral arterial obstructive disease (systolic ankle brachial index ABI < 0. 9).

      Criteria for efficacy evaluation are the assessement of the improvement of the Digital
      Thermal monitoring between base line (day 1) and day 180 measured by VendysÂ® and the
      measurement of the correlation between the Digital Thermal monitoring and the following
      parameters at base line, day 90 and day 180:

        -  Von Willebrand factor blood level.

        -  Clinical assessment as per pain free walking distance and maximum walking distance, as
           measured by walking machine.

        -  Fibrinogen blood level. Also an assessment of the study medication observance (patient's
           compliance) will be done.

      Safety assessment will be done through the collection of the adverse events occurred during
      the study.
