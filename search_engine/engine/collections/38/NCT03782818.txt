      PAH-therapies, as per guidelines will be recruited. The initial Health Canada approval will
      be obtained. Olaparib will be provided by AstraZeneca Canada, but AZ had no input into the
      trial design and will not be involved in the conduct of the trial, analysis, interpretation
      of the results or the final manuscript.

      A 4-week pre-treatment phase will allow ensuring that patients are on stable doses of PAH
      medication.

      Given that PAH is a chronic disease and that patients may be at higher risk for drug-related
      adverse events (e.g. anemia), olaparib will be started at low-dose (100mg BID), then
      up-titrated weekly by 100mg BID up to 200mg BID (n=5, group 1) or 300mg BID (n=15, group 2)
      for a total treatment duration (including the up-titration phase) of 24 weeks. Using 100mg
      and 150mg tablets will allow minimizing the number of tablets taken (e.g. 2 x 150mg tablets
      BID) or adjusting the dose in case of drug-related adverse events (e.g. 250mg BID using 100mg
      and 150mg tablets).

      Patients will be regularly followed to assess whether side effects are observed and whether
      olaparib can be up-titrated.

      At baseline and week 24, a cardiac catheterization will assess changes in pulmonary
      hemodynamics and RV function.

      An end-of-study visit is planned at week 28 week.
