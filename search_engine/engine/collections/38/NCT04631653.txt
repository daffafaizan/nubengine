    
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness among working-age patients with
      type 2 diabetes. According to previous studies, early screening and timely treatment can
      reduce the risk of worsening DR and blindness. International guidelines recommend that
      screening for DR be performed at least once every year for patients with type 2 diabetes. The
      investigators will implement a validated deep learning-based software, VeriSeeÂ®, in clinics,
      and evaluate the benefits on diagnostic accuracy and the clinical referral rate for diabetic
      retinopathy after implementation of this software.
