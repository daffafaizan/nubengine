    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioavailability of 0.5mg dutasteride in a novel
      formulation compared to the currently marketed 0.5mg dutasteride soft gel capsule in fasted
      healthy male subjects. This will be an open-label, single dose, randomized, two-period
      crossover study in healthy male subjects. Subjects will receive a single oral dose 0.5mg
      novel dutasteride formulation and a single oral dose 0.5mg dutasteride soft gel capsule in a
      fasted state. Each dose of the study medication will be separated by a 28-day washout period.
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing.
      Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, laboratory data, and
      review of adverse events. The study will enrol approximately 35 healthy male subjects to
      ensure that 30 subjects complete the study. The study will be conducted in the USA.
