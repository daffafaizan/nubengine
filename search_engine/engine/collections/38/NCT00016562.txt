      unknown etiology, as well patients with known diseases that are atypical or present difficult
      management problems. Patients with a known or a suspected leukodystrophy will be excluded
      from this study. Lack of specific diagnosis amplifies the distress felt by patients and
      families and decreases the chance of effective therapy. Clinical and laboratory evaluation
      will include blood, urine, spinal fluid, peripheral tissue pathology and radiological
      studies.
