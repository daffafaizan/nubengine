      the numbers of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, during the second year of
      administration of AZT an acceleration in mortality has been observed. The reasons for this
      are not known at this time. The study of what may be an AZT-resistant strain of HIV may
      benefit patients who have been and are still receiving AZT or another drug used in treating
      HIV ddC. It is hoped that the comparison of the effectiveness of AZT and ddC will benefit in
      the treatment of these patients.

      Following tests to evaluate their health, patients are chosen at random to receive either AZT
      or ddC. AZT is given by mouth at the patients' current dose. ddC is given by mouth every 8
      hours. Treatment continues for up to 12 months. Patients are required to visit the clinic
      every 2 weeks up to week 12 and then once a month. Blood samples are taken to monitor the
      safety and effectiveness of treatment.
