      over approximately 60 minutes at Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 9 mg/kg administered every 21 days
      as a maintenance dose starting at Cycle 2 Day 1. This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a
      main study and an extension phase. The PK profile of Process 2 patritumab will be compared to
      historical data for Process 1 patritumab. Specifically, the PK parameters (AUC0-21d and Cmax
      as primary endpoints) for Process 2 patritumab 18 mg/kg (loading dose) will be compared to
      the PK parameters of Process 1 patritumab 18 mg/kg. Process 2 patritumab serum concentrations
      will be compared to Process 1 patritumab serum concentrations collected in the Phase 1 and
      Phase 2 studies by population PK methods and will be reported separately.
