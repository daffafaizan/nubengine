      function can be an early marker for detection of dysfunctional metabolism. It is unclear if
      tissue mitochondrial dysfunction can be detected using less invasive methodology. In this
      project, the investigators plan to study mitochondrial bioenergetics in circulating cells and
      paired muscle biopsies in two metabolic disparate groups of women; healthy lean vs. obese
      insulin resistant women of similar age. Women of similar age that are either healthy lean or
      insulin resistant and obese will be recruited to participate in one study that includes a
      blood draw and a muscle biopsy. Mitochondrial function in circulating blood cells and muscle
      tissue will be determined.
