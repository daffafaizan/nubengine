      Coronary in-stent restenosis is commonly treated by using a drug eluting stent (DES). There
      are, however, some concerns about the safety of drug eluting stents, in particular with
      respect to delayed healing, chronic inflammatory reaction, and late or very late stent
      thrombosis. It is unknown whether the current treatment with another layer of stents may add
      to the risk of stent thrombosis or reoccurrence of restenosis. Therefore, the relatively new
      drug-eluting balloons may provide an alternative for treatment of in-stent restenosis,
      avoiding a double stent layer. The expected advantages of such drug-eluting balloons over
      stents are the ease of access of the lesion, the absence of a multiple stent layer, and the
      shorter necessity of the use of dual antiplatelet therapy. Several studies have demonstrated
      safety and efficacy of the Sequent Please drug-eluting balloon (DEB). Whether the drug
      eluting balloon is as effective as a drug eluting stent in preventing re-restenosis is not
      known.

      Study design:

      The study is designed as an multi-center, randomized, prospective two-arm trial with either
      PCI with a drug eluting balloon or a drug eluting stent for in-stent restenosis. Blinded
      evaluation of endpoints by independent core laboratory.

      Study population:

      The study population consists of 270 patients ( â‰¥ 18 years of age) with indication for PCI
      for in-stent restenosis of whom 135 are randomised to a drug eluting balloon and 135 are
      randomised to a drug eluting stent. Individuals have signed an informed consent for study
      measurements.

      Intervention:

      PCI with a drug-eluting stent, or PCI with a drug-eluting balloon.
