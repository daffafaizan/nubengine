      study for patients with 3-vessel disease (with or without left-main involvement) referred to
      CABG treatment. Surgical revascularization strategy and treatment planning will be solely
      based on MSCT (with FFRCT) without knowledge of the anatomy defined by conventional
      cine-angiography.

      One clinical follow-up visit including MSCT acquisition will be performed at 30 days after
      bypass surgery in order to assess graft patency and adequacy of the revascularization with
      respect to the surgical planning based on non-invasive imaging.
