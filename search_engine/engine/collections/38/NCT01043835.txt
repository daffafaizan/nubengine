      (AGC) has not yet met with widespread acceptance and remains limited to only a few centers.

      Intervention: According to tumor pathological stage (JGCA, 2nd English ed), location of
      tumor, and patient clinical condition, a laparoscopy-assisted radical gastrectomy and open
      gastrectomy were performed. Laparoscopy-assisted radical gastrectomy consisted of the
      following procedures: 1) laparoscopic dissection of the lesser and greater omentum, ligation
      and division of the main vessels to mobilize the stomach under pneumoperitoneum, 2)
      laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection, based on the Guidelines of the Japan Gastric Cancer
      Association and 3) resection of the distal two thirds (LADG), proximal third (LAPG), or total
      stomach (LATG), depending on the location of the tumor, followed by reconstruction by the
      Billroth I, Billroth Ⅱ, esophagogastrostomy, or Roux-en-Y method through a 3 to 5-cm-long
      minilaparotomy incision.

      Follow-up schedule: All patients were monitored postoperatively by physical examination, and
      blood tests including a test for serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at least every three
      months for the ﬁrst year, every six months for the next two years, and every year for the
      fourth and fifth year, and thereafter by abdominal ultrasonography, CT, chest radiography,
      and gastroscopy at least once each year.
