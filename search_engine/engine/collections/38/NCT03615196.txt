    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. Thirty-two male and female volunteer subjects,
      between the ages of 18 and 64 years of age, will be enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled in
      four dose-escalating cohorts of eight subjects and randomized to USB005 or placebo in a ratio
      of 3:1. Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. The four
      cohorts will be identified as: Cohort 1(0.03% USB005 or placebo), Cohort 2 (0.1% USB005 or
      placebo), Cohort 3 (0.3% USB005 or placebo), and Cohort 4 (0.45% USB005 or placebo).
      Volunteers in the four cohorts will self-administer a single drop of USB005 or placebo into
      the study eye, three times a day for 28 days. The study eye in which the drug is applied to
      will be determined based on screening assessments. Subjects will be followed for 8 days after
      the last USB005 or placebo administration.

      The safety and tolerability of USB005 will be demonstrated by local toxicity, adverse events,
      laboratory assessments, vital signs, and a comprehensive eye exam. Plasma samples will be
      taken at various time points throughout the study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      USB005. Dropouts will be replaced after consultation with the Sponsor.
