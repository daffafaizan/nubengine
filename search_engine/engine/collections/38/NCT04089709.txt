      healing requires immobilization of the injury, which inevitably leads to muscle atrophy and
      joint stiffness. This strength lost during immobilization can be problematic in patients who
      are already de-conditioned at baseline. Previous research using healthy participants found
      that exercising a non-immobilized, "well", arm helped attenuate muscle atrophy in the
      contralateral immobilized arm. The study aims to answer the following questions: Does
      exercise of the contralateral arm prevent muscle atrophy and weakness of the injured arm?
      Does exercise of the contralateral arm improve pain scores in the injured arm
