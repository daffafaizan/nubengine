      Cells (ADSC) usage during a last-chance surgery (neurolysis, nerve release) on a previously
      reconstructed nerve. Patients who experienced failure of nerve reconstruction will be
      included in the study. During the revisional surgery, nerve fascicles will be released, and
      ADSCs will be isolated from harvested fat with enzymatic method in a standarized conditions.
      Cells will be administered through microinjections along the fascicles and around the
      adjacent tissues after external neurolysis. The follow-up will be continued at least 36
      months.
