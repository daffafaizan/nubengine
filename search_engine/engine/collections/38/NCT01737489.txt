      benefit and participant satisfaction to a cochlear implant recipient's overall treatment.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a commercially available
      aural rehabilitation program (LACE) and an electronic program which takes advantage of a
      traditional form of auditory training (NOOK) for cochlear implant users.
