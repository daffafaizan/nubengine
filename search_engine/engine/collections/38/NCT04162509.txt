      consists of two visits and a home training for one group. 60 participants between 18 and 40
      years with clinical or subclinical fear of spiders will take part in the study.

      All assessments of outcome will be conducted on one visit for each participant, including an
      in vivo BAT. The experimental group will participate in a home training with the app,
      spanning over two weeks (6x30-minutes sessions), whereas the control group will not receive
      any treatment (untreated comparison group).

      Six weeks after the first visit all participants undergo the assessments of outcome,
      including a second in vivo BAT. The BAT will take place 4 weeks after completion of the home
      training. This design allows a direct comparison and therefore an estimation of the efficacy
      of the gamified AR exposure therapy.
