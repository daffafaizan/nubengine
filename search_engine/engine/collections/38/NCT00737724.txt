      best time for starting antiretroviral therapy in patients with AIDS and active tuberculosis
      is not clear, despite of the guidelines regarding CD4+ count. The debate surrounding this
      issue is mainly due to the difficulty among adherence of anti-MTb and anti-HIV treatment, the
      pharmacological interaction, the adverse events related to drugs and the risk of inflammatory
      reconstitution syndrome, especially in patients with advanced HIV infection. Moreover, there
      is great debate upon the lack of knowledge of the degree of immune reconstitution throughout
      time against Mtb induced by the anti-HIV therapy.
