    
      Outline:

      Twenty participants with OPMD, with dysphagia, will be recruited from Neuromuscular clinics
      within Calgary. The investigators will enrol patients in a parallel group, sham-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial, with 10 participants in each group (active EMST and sham EMST).

      Participants will have baseline measurements of: (i) global swallowing function via modified
      barium swallow study, (ii) maximum expiratory pressure, (iii) voluntary cough spirometry,
      (iv) forced vital capacity, (v) functional oral intake, (vi) patient report of self-perceived
      swallowing impairment (EAT-10 Questionnaire), and (vii) biomarker analyses.

      Participants will undergo 5-weeks of EMST (active or sham). All baseline measurements will be
      repeated after 5-weeks of EMST and 10-weeks post-EMST to measure durability of effect.

      Outcomes:

      The end-goal of the current research is to obtain preliminary data for the benefit of EMST in
      a new study population, and direct future studies that may provide evidence for a new
      standard of care in treating neuromuscular diagnoses.
