    
      All patients admitted to three intensive care units will be monitored for healthcare
      associated infections. In parallel the units will be cluster randomised to implement the
      electronic compliance monitoring in three different ways:

        -  Unit level feed back every week of current compliance for each of three staff groupings
           (doctors, nurses, allied health professionals)

        -  Personalised feedback in the form of an email at the end of a shift stating an
           individuals performance relative to the average for their professional grouping.

        -  Real time feedback in the form of a badge worn by the healthcare worker that vibrates
           when the system thinks they have missed or are about to miss an opportunity for hand
           hygiene.

      All healthcare workers will receive the level of feedback defined in the randomisation for
      the duration of the three intervention periods. The units will cross-over with an
      interventing two week wash out period.

      All personal feedback will be confidential and private to the individual.
