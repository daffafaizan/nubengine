      risk of hospitalization, lower limb amputation, and death, as well as a significant decrease
      in quality of life. During lifetime the risk for developing DF is assumed to be 25%; with 30%
      of DF resulting in lower limb amputation. If compared to general population people with
      diabetes have a 20-fold higher risk for amputation. Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of
      lower limb amputation. Ulceration and impaired wound healing are commonly associated with
      common co-morbidities; the increased risk of infection amongst patients with diabetes is
      driving chronification and accounts for lack of wound healing.

      Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has been proposed as a tool for various biological
      and medical applications relying on its capacity to reduce bacterial load in the wound and to
      initiate wound healing. Biological plasma effects are largely dependent on plasma-generated
      reactive species in the gas phase, which subsequently diffuse or react with proteins and
      lipids in cells or tissues.

      Thus, the objective of this placebo-controlled patient-blinded study was to show that
      application of cold plasma in addition to standard care treatment compared to placebo could
      accelerate wound healing in terms of more rapid and clinical meaningful wound surface
      regression. Wound closure progression and microbiological analysis were monitored time
      dependently to prove the effects. Patient's well-being and subjective perceptions were
      evaluated during treatment.
