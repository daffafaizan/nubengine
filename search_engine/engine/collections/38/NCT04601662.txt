      defined as a microscopic loss of root tissue as a result of the inflammatory reaction that
      occurs in the area of application of orthodontic force. It can be diagnosed and measured
      using conventional radiography or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).

      Dehiscence is a loss of alveolar bone on the facial (rarely lingual) aspect of a tooth that
      leaves a characteristic v-shaped, root-exposed defect from the cementoenamel junction
      apically. Bone dehiscence cannot be detected through conventional radiography or clinical
      examination. Actually, CBCT can be considered the best accessible technique providing 3D
      data.

      Corticision is one of the minimally invasive surgical procedures that is not associated with
      flap lifting. It was used to accelerate tooth movement in animals and case report studies.
      Its application on humans may aggravate their fear and anxiety towards the pain that may
      accompany this technique.

      No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has compared flapless corticision in the
      non-extraction-based orthodontic decrowding of lower anterior teeth (LAT) with the
      conventional treatment in terms of external apical root resorption (EARR) and dehiscence
      formation (DF).
