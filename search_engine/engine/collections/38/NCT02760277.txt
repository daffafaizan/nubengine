      than two weeks in children with DMD, if boys with DMD who take the study medication have
      improved muscle function compared to boys with DMD in other studies who did not take any type
      of steroid, and to see if boys with DMD who take the study medication gain less weight
      compared to boys with DMD in a prior study who took another type of steroid called
      prednisone. Enrolled participants will take the study medication for 24 weeks.
