      evaluate how it is processed by the body (pharmacokinetics). This study looked at lab results
      in pediatric participants who took azilsartan.

      The study enrolled 6 patients. Participants were assigned to study medication dose by body
      weight as follows:

        -  Body Weight <50 kg: azilsartan 5 mg

        -  Body Weight â‰¥50 kg: azilsartan 10 mg

      All participants took a single oral dose of azilsartan on Day 1 of the study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 17 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone
      on Day 6 and Day 15 after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
