      planned to include 70 adult patients undergoing upper extremity surgery at Gulhane Training
      and Research Hospital between 10 December 2019 and February 2020. Continue infraclavicular
      nerve catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the patients included in the
      study. These patients will be randomized to the catheter tip configuration as
      CEMP(closed-ended multiport catheter) group and OESP(open-ended single port catheter) group.
      Patient controlled analgesia device will be attached to the peripheral nerve catheter of
      these patients. Demographic data of the patients who have placed an infraclavicular catheter
      and used the catheter successfully for three days postoperatively, the number of pushing the
      button, the amount of bolus dose given and the total dose given in the patient controlled
      anesthesia device,the amounts of need for additional analgesia and pain scores(Numeric rating
      Scale), complications will be recorded. Records will be compared statistically.
