      seal to the breast, the movement of the nipple, the sensations of warmth and moisture, the
      variability in frequency, and the strength of the applied vacuum. During breastfeeding the
      mother's nipple and the infant's mouth form a chamber that is a fluid-filled, no dead volume
      system, which is needed to create a working vacuum to remove milk from the breast. There is
      no air visible in the natural system according to ultrasound measurements. This is unlike
      breast pumps which use an air-filled, large dead volume system, to create a working vacuum.
      Therefore, a functional model of a fluid-filled, smaller dead volume breast pump has been
      developed in order to more closely mimic the breastfeeding infant. The technology of
      fluid-filled pumping has been tested in one prior clinical study and has now progressed to a
      complete prototype with which the user can assemble, pump, disassemble, clean and reuse.
