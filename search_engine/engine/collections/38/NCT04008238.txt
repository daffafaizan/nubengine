      crucial issue to identify potential responders particularly for non-L sarcomas. Considering
      that the molecular profile of STS can change over time, an analysis of archival tumor
      material may not be a reliable method to identify predictive biomarkers of response, and thus
      high-throughput technologies may be promising to identify STS markers for prediction of
      response to trabectedin. For study purpose, blood and tumor samples will be obtained for
      genetic and immunological profiling at baseline, during treatment by trabectedin and at
      disease progression.
