      dose of GLYX-13 vs. placebo increases cognitive performance on tasks of learning, declarative
      memory, and working memory, and associated task-related increases in BOLD activation in
      hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Positive findings will provide
      biomarker evidence for GLYX-13 effects on neural systems underlying these cognitive
      processes.
