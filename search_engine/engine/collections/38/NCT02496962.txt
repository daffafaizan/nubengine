      their work without sleep. Sleep deprivation (SD), which is a strong stressor, can exert a
      large effect on the cardiovascular system of rescue workers. It has been reported that SD is
      associated with arrhythmia, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. Heart rate variability (HRV) is
      acknowledged as a reliable marker of cardiac autonomic control, and the frequency of
      premature ventricular complexes can be an indicator of arrhythmogeneity. The investigators
      found that HRV was significantly decreased after 24-h sleep deprivation. Metoprolol could
      improve HRV and reduce the frequency of premature atrial and ventricular complexes. But
      sleepiness and hypotension occurred frequently in subjects treated with metoprolol. Statins
      have significant cardiovascular protective effects in patients with cardiovascular disease.
      Statin not only could regulate serum lipid level, but also have antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate (1) the changes in heart rate
      variability and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia by continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram
      (ECG) in young, healthy subjects undergoing 48h SD and (2) the effects of statin on HRV and
      arrhythmia after this agent was administered prophylactically before SD.
