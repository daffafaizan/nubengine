    
      IPX203 contains two different drugs called levodopa and carbidopa in one capsule.

        -  levodopa turns into a material called 'dopamine' in your brain. The dopamine helps to
           improve the symptoms of your Parkinson's disease.

        -  carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called 'aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
           inhibitors'. It helps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which
           levodopa is broken down in your body.
