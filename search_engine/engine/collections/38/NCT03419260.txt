      use of resource-intense continuous EEG monitoring for seizure identification and management.
      When identified, electrographic seizures are generally treated with anti-seizure medications,
      but there are very limited data available regarding optimal treatment in terms of specific
      medication selections or overall management strategies. The Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia (CHOP) has a formal ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway aiming to standardize EEG
      monitoring and seizure management. This is a single-center prospective observational study of
      patients undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring to identify risk factors for
      electrographic seizures and create prediction models guiding limited EEG monitoring resources
      to the patients at highest risk for seizures, and also to evaluate the current seizure
      management strategy in terms of safety.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to identify risk factors for electrographic seizures in
      critically ill patients and use these risk factors to create and validate a seizure
      prediction model. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of a targeted and timely
      electrographic seizure identification and management strategy among critically ill patients
      guided by a CHOP ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway.

      Study Design: Single center observational study of consecutive patients undergoing clinically
      indicated EEG monitoring.

      Setting/Participants: Single-center study of critically ill children in the Pediatric ICU at
      CHOP undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring and seizure management.
