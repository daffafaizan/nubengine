      prednisone), two patients will receive treatment number 2 (irofulven + capecitabine (XelodaÂ®)
      + prednisone), and one patient will receive treatment number 3 (mitoxantrone + prednisone).
      This is not a blinded study, so both the patient and doctor will know which treatment has
      been assigned.
