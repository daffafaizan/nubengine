      dosing schedule with a ratio of 1:1 by using a computer-based system. Imatinib will be
      administered at a dose of 400 mg/day, once a day with food, in the form of 100-mg tablets.
      Patients assigned to the continuous dosing arm will receive imatinib without off-schedule,
      and those assigned to the intermittent dosing arm will received imatinib with one-week
      on/one-week off dosing schedule. Four weeks of study treatment is considered as one cycle for
      both continuous and intermittent dosing schedules.

      In both arms, the imatinib treatment beyond multiple progressions defined by RECIST version
      1.1 is permitted, unless treating physician decided that there is no clinical benefit with
      imatinib. Imatinib will be discontinued when unacceptable toxicity or patient's withdrawal of
      consent.
