      cardiac deaths are sudden, arrhythmic. Myocardial infarction (MI) survivors have a four to
      five-fold higher risk of SCD compared to persons without a history of MI. Current risk
      assessment approaches fail to identify the majority of patients at risk of sudden, arrhythmic
      death. Given these facts, this patient population represents a relevant proportion of the
      total population at risk of developing sudden death and is currently not indicated for
      preventive therapy. The post-MI population with moderate LV function, specifically with a
      Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) between 35% and 50%, is therefore an appropriate
      group in which to assess SCD prevention strategies. It has been shown that an increased QRS
      fragmentation assessed by Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) correlates with a higher incidence of
      arrhythmic deaths. MAGNITUDE is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational
      cohort study, which will provide detailed information about event rates and MFI threshold for
      the prediction of SCD/life threatening cardiac arrhythmic events. Target enrollment is 1000
      patients, but enrollment may be extended until minimally 24 events are accrued (with a
      maximum of 1500 patients). All patients will be followed until at least 12 months after
      enrollment closure, but follow-up duration may be extended until minimally 40 events are
      accrued. Interim analysis will be performed after 10, 20 and 30 events, and also after 40
      events if this milestone is reached 6 months or more before end of follow-up. Final analysis
      will be done at end of follow-up.
