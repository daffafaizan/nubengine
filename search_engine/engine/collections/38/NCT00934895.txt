      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of everolimus when
           administered in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
           in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, as measured by clinical tumor
           response according to RECIST criteria, in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus when administered at the
           recommended phase II dose in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
           formulation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily or once every other day
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
