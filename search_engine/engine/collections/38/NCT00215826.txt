    
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, outpatient study in subjects potentially
      infected with the SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus) or normal volunteers using two dose
      levels of LDO interferon.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive AlferonÂ® LDO (natural interferon alfa-n3) in a buffer
      solution once each day for 10 consecutive days at doses equal to 650 IU or 1300 IU/day.

      Pretherapy baseline evaluations will be performed prior to randomization.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to each dose level, and both dosage levels will be started
      concurrently. Drug will be dispensed for a ten day treatment period, during which time any
      clinical symptoms and adverse events will be evaluated. Laboratory samples (2.5 ml blood) for
      microarray analysis evaluations will be made twice during baseline and 12-14 hours following
      doses 1, 5, and 10 on study days 2, 6, and 11, respectively.

      The conduct of this study will comply with International Conference on Harmonisation - Good
      Clinical Practice (ICH - GCP) and the 1996 or later version of the Declaration of Helsinki.
