    
      This extended access study will assess the long-term safety and tolerability of bardoxolone
      methyl in qualified patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) who previously participated in
      controlled clinical studies with bardoxolone methyl.

      Qualified patients will receive 10 mg of bardoxolone methyl once daily until the drug is
      available through commercial channels or until patient withdrawal, whichever is sooner. Dose
      de-escalation (down to 5 mg) is permitted during the study, if indicated clinically.
