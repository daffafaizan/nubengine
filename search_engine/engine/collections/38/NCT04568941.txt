      Compare the identification rate of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients with
      different tumor biopsy methods.

      Evaluate the false-negative rates of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with different tumor
      biopsy methods.

      OUTLINE:

      The patients were randomly divided into three group, vacuum-assisted biopsy, core needle
      biopsy, and intraoperative excisional biopsy. Preoperative vacuum-assisted biopsy and core
      needle biopsy were performed in 10 days before the final surgery. All patients received dual
      tracer (radiolabeled colloid and blue dye) guided SLNB.
