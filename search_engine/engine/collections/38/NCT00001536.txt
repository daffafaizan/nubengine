      to test for achondroplasia prenatally. Moreover, prenatal genetic testing for achondroplasia
      is relatively simple and is highly likely to be informative for any couple seeking testing.
      Four diagnostic laboratories in the U.S. are currently performing prenatal genetic testing
      for achondroplasia. Before prenatal genetic testing for achondroplasia becomes more widely
      available, however, it is essential that we learn more about the lives of affected
      individuals and their families, the implications of offering testing for achondroplasia, and
      the education and the counseling needs of this community. Personal interviews and stories
      have been published and discussed at national meetings (Ablon 1984). We conducted a pilot
      telephone interview survey of 15 individuals with achondroplasia. What is needed now is a
      large scale quantitative study of the community of little people and their families. To meet
      this need, we have developed a survey tool to analyze family relationships, quality of life,
      tendencies toward optimism or pessimism, information-avoiding or information-seeking
      behaviors, social support, involvement in Little People of America Inc. (LPA), self-esteem,
      sociodemographics and views on achondroplasia, religiousness, reproductive and family plans,
      genetic testing, and abortion. The self-administered survey will be completed nationally by a
      sample of persons with achondroplasia and their family members.
