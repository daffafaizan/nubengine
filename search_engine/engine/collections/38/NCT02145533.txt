      aneurysmal lesions identified several patterns of protease activity. Levels of both MMP-9 and
      NGAL were increased in aneurismal vessels, while the patterns of MMP-9 and NGAL expression
      was very high in all patients with ruptured aneurysm, both central and peripheral. These
      results show: 1) the chronic and degenerative nature of the aneurysmal lesion which is
      associated with increased levels of inflammatory proteinases, like MMP-9; 2) the apparent
      pivotal role of MMP-9 and NGAL in the pathophysiologic processes which lead to the final
      stage of natural history of aneurysms; and 3) the ubiquitous distribution of MMP-9 and NGAL.
      The pattern increased expression of MMP-9 and NGAL appears to be specific for aneurysmal
      arteries and it is not dependent on the anatomic site of the lesion.
