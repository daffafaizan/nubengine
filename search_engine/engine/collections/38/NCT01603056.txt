    
      Extensive clinical experience has been gained due to the widespread use of PangraminÂ® SLIT
      and other SLIT products as named patient products, both with respect to the types and the
      frequencies of the adverse events(AEs) observed. No safety concerns have been found.

      The optimal therapeutic dose range regarding SLIT is not fully elucidated. The fate of the
      allergen after sublingual administration is not known in detail, i.e. to what extent is the
      allergen absorbed over the mucosa or swallowed and how this is related to volume, excipients
      etc. The relationship between dose and effect is thus not fully elucidated. The general
      recommendation is to use a dose inducing a clinical relevant effect in most patients without
      causing unacceptable adverse events. As Pangramin SLIT HDM-mix has a safety profile that
      allows a single daily intake by the patient at home, the dosage at this trial will be the
      same as marketed product.
