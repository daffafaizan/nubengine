    
      This was a prospective randomized study conducted at 2 tertiary level institutions in
      Jamaica, the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) and the Kingston Public Hospital
      (KPH). All cases of penile fracture were recruited from the emergency room (ER) of both
      hospitals between the period January 2015 to January 2017 and all patients were over 18 years
      of age.

      Information on demographics, length of time since the injury, mechanism of injury and risk
      factors for erectile dysfunction (Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Smoking) was
      collected. Erectile function was objectively assessed utilizing the abbreviated International
      Index for Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), and scores at initial presentation were taken to
      represent the premorbid erectile function.

      A block randomization sequence was created and cases were allocated 1:1 to either immediate
      repair (group 1) or delayed repair (group 2). Allocation sequence numbers were kept concealed
      in sequentially numbered folders and access was only granted to the principal investigator.

      For Group 1 (Immediate repair)

      Patients were admitted to hospital and underwent emergency repair via a subcoronal
      circumferential degloving approach.

      For Group 2 (Delayed repair)

      Patients were not admitted. Instead, they were discharged from hospital and given an elective
      surgery date 7 - 10 days after the injury. Oral Diclofenac Sodium 50mg was prescribed to be
      taken as needed and instructions to abstain from any sexual activity.

      All patients were then re-examined at 6 weeks for quality assurance. They were then
      instructed that resumption of sexual activity would be safe.

      Routine clinic visits were scheduled at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. IIEF-5 scores were
      obtained from all patients at 12months.
