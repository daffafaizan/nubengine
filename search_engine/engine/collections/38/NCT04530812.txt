      I. Determine the effect of a 3-month randomized dietary intervention with a probiotic kefir
      beverage in multiple myeloma (MM) patients on biomarkers of bone metabolism, and
      patient-reported pain and fatigue, gut health, and quality of life (QoL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the effect of kefir supplementation on gut microbial phylotype and predicted
      bacterial metabolic function, and assess associations with biomarkers of bone metabolism, and
      patient-reported pain and fatigue, gut health, and QoL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Feasibility of a probiotic lifestyle intervention in MM patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients consume commercial kefir beverage daily for 3 months.

      ARM II: Patients maintain usual diet for 3 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days or until resolution of any
      study related toxicity.
