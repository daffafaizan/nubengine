      I. Median progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Time to radiographic progression (TTRP). III. To evaluate the
      safety of the combination of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and Yttrium-90; adverse events
      (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0
      [NCI-CTAE v 4.0]).

      OTHER OBJECTIVES:

      I. Predictive biomarkers of response to therapy and survival: will assess pre-treatment
      plasma level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as above, and assess its predictive
      ability of time to progression (TTP) and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). After 4 weeks, patients
      receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA). Courses of sorafenib tosylate
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
