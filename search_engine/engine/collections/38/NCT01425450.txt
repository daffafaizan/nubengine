    
      This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study.

      Male subjects will be randomised to give a total of 32 evaluable subjects.

      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled into 4 cohorts of ascending dose.

      Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomised to receive 0.5 milligrams (mg) HF1020 or placebo
      (ratio 3:1). When at least 8 subjects within the cohort have completed Day 2 procedures (i.e.
      Day 1 + 24 hours) and all ongoing subjects have completed the final Day 15 visit, a Safety
      Review Committee (SRC) will meet, review all safety data prior to dose escalation to the next
      cohort.

      Subjects in Cohort 2 will be randomised to receive 2.5 mg HF1020 or placebo.

      Subjects in Cohort 3 will be randomised to receive 10mg HF1020 or placebo.

      Subjects in Cohort 4 will be randomised to receive 25mg HF1020 or placebo.
