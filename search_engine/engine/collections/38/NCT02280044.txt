      enrolled to participate in a study to determine the efficacy of prophylactic rifaximin in
      preventing diarrheal illness following challenge with C. jejuni, strain CG8421. Volunteers
      were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and were admitted to the inpatient unit of
      the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University. Volunteers were treated
      with rifaximin or placebo in a double blind manner for four days, beginning the day prior to
      challenge. On the day of challenge, the volunteers were given 5x10(5) C. jejuni with
      bicarbonate buffer and were then monitored and treated for any symptoms. Stools were cultured
      daily for the excretion of C. jejuni and all subjects were treated with antibiotics to insure
      that the challenge strain has cleared prior to to discharge. Subjects were followed for six
      months following the inpatient phase to detect adverse events following the study.
