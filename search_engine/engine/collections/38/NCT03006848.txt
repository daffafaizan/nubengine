      greater with recurrent/refractory osteosarcoma will be administered avelumab at a dose of 10
      mg/kg intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, with a cycle lasting
      28 days.

      Patients will receive avelumab every 2 weeks in cycles of 28 days for up to 24 months, or 26
      cycles. Progression free survival and response to therapy after 4 cycles of treatment will be
      assessed. In addition, the toxicity profile of avelumab in this population will be closely
      monitored.
