    
      Soft Tissue Sarcoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston
      therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment
      continues up to12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Soft Tissue
           Sarcoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial
           response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Soft
           Tissue Sarcoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
