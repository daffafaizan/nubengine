      treatment with comorbid pain. Participants will be screened for pain and other conditions by
      completing a self-report survey questionnaire. Eligible participants will be asked to
      complete a baseline assessment. A trained research therapist will conduct individual therapy
      with participants twice a week for 2-4 weeks. Participants will be re-assessed at 1- and
      3-month post-intervention follow-ups to track changes in their pain, functioning, and
      substance use.
