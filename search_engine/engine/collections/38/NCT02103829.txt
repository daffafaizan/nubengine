      association list serves, community websites designed to reach individuals interested in
      participating in research studies, and social media sites related to smoking cessation
      efforts.

      The entire study will be administered online. Participants may complete it at a time and
      place of their convenience.

      The website will automatically obtain consent, ask 16 brief questions as a pre-test,
      randomize to 4 very brief interventions, ask 4 post-test questions, and at 1-month follow-up,
      send an email with a link to a 6-question survey. The initial online session is expected to
      take between 3 and 8 minutes and the 1-month follow-up survey less than 2 minutes.
