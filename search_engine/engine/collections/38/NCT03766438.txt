      settings at two healthcare institutions among 450 Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D
      (hemoglobin A1câ‰¥8%). The intervention group will view the 12-minute digital storytelling
      video. Both the intervention and comparison groups will receive diabetes education and
      resource cards, as well as usual clinical care. The primary outcome will be glycemic control
      as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will
      include diabetes self-management behaviors, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and body mass
      index. The impact of concomitant covariates, including sex, age, and socio-economic status,
      on the sensitivity of the intervention effect will also be explored.
