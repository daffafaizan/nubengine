      identification and diagnosis create clinical difficulties. In previous studies, the features
      of the lesions and the effects of COD on anatomical structures were analysed via CBCT images
      by measuring the lesion's dimensions linearly for the first time in the Brazilian population.
      However, 3D measurements of the volume need to be taken to assess the actual spread over
      adjacent anatomical structures. The purpose of this retrospective study is to measure the
      volume of the lesions that have been diagnosed as COD in the Turkish population by using 3D
      images. This will contribute to an advanced study conducted on the global population to
      observe a change in these morphologies with respect to different geographical and ethnic
      origins.
