      is an area of complex anatomic morphology difficult to debride by routine periodontal
      instrumentation. Multiple approaches have been used in an effort to treat the furcation
      Choukroun's platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a second generation platelet concentrate has
      biochemical components which have well known synergetic effects on healing processes. The
      present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous platelet-rich fibrin
      (PRF) in the treatment of mandibular molar Grade 2 furcation defects in comparison to
      allograft and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was
      designed as a randomized, prospective, parallel-arm, interventional clinical trial wherein 30
      patients with periodontitis and grade II Mandibular furcation defects attending the Out
      Patient wing of the Department of Periodontics of a tertiary referral care hospital were
      equally divided into group A and group B. Patients in.Group A, were treated by the placement
      of PRF as a Graft and as a membrane at the surgical site , while in Group B, the defects were
      treated by the placement of Allograft and Healiguide collagen membrane. Plaque Index, Probing
      depth, Vertical clinical attachment level, Horizontal clinical attachment level, Gingival
      marginal level, and amount of bonefill using Radiovisiography were recorded at baseline and 9
      months. Intra-group comparison of Mean scores between Group A and Group B was done using
      Paired t test and Inter-group comparison using independent sample t test. CONCLUSION Further
      studies evaluating the efficacy of PRF using a larger sample size should be performed to
      evaluate its true beneficial effects on long term basis in patients with mandibular molar
      Grade 2 furcation defects.
