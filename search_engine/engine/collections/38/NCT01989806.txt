      Department of Kowloon Hospital. Subjects will be allocated into intervention group or control
      group by using sealed envelope and they will be blinded for their group allocation. All
      participants will undergo standard physiotherapy program, including mobilization and
      strengthening exercise of limbs, trunk stabilization training, wheelchair maneuver training
      and overground walking training. Based on this standard training program twice per week, 60
      minutes per session, participants will receive an additional 30 minutes (exclude set-up time)
      of robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) or control training
      based on their group allocation 3 times for 8 week. EMG biofeedback system will be applied to
      bilateral vastus lateralis muscles during training with audio feedback to promote active
      participation.

      Outcome measures will be collected before the intervention and the subjects will be
      reassessed after finishing their 8 weeks of intervention. Outcome measures include Walking
      Index for Spinal Cord Injury version II, Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III, lower
      extremity motor score, Modified Ashworth Scale, L-stiff and L-force measured by Lokomat
      system, VO2 maximum, spirometry, and gait analysis (walking speed, heel-heel base
      support,bilateral stance duration, bilateral symmetry) The result of this study will provide
      useful information to enhance the clinical effectiveness of the management for spinal cord
      injury with the use of robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training.
