      diagnosis and treatment of obesity and diabetes. The investigators are trying to find out why
      insulin, a blood sugar lowering hormone that is released by the pancreas following a meal,
      does not work effectively in individuals with obesity or type 2 diabetes. The investigators
      have recently discovered a protein in fat cells of obese mice that helps fat cells to take up
      and break down sugar from the blood. This protein (called FOXA2) also prevents the generation
      of more fat cells. FOXA2 is only present in obese mice, but absent from fat stores of lean
      animals. Insulin can stimulate the production of FOXA2 in fat cells. Furthermore, the levels
      of FOXA2 protein correlate with the degree of blood insulin levels. In this study, we are
      would like to determine whether FOXA2 is also produced in fat cells of humans, and if its
      level correlates with the degree of obesity and insulin resistance.
