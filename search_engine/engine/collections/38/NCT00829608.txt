      to participate in the study. These patients have been followed by the faculty investigator
      for several years. Their disease state requires frequent interventions aimed at decreasing
      the severity and symptomatology of their vocal fold papillomas. Patients will be given the
      human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine and their clinical course will be followed over the
      next 6 months. Patients will have a laryngoscopic examination prior to treatment to establish
      their baseline disease state. They will have repeat laryngoscopic examinations at the time of
      the first, second and third vaccine injections, which will be given 1 month intervals for a
      total of 3 doses. They will have physical exam and laryngoscopic examinations at 1 month
      intervals for the first 6 months after administration of the vaccine. The severity of their
      clinical disease will be objectively measured using a validated scale for RRP assessment, the
      Laryngoscopic and Clinical Assessment Scale (LCAS).
