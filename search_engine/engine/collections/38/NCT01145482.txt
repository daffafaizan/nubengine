    
      The specific aims of this project will be accomplished through a cross sectional repeated
      measures design in which 15 participants with mild AD or amnestic MCI will undergo
      assessments of brain structure and function 15 minutes after a single dose of insulin (20 IU)
      or placebo. Insulin and placebo conditions will be counterbalanced across participants.

      Intranasal insulin or placebo administration: Saline and insulin (NovoLog) will be ordered
      though the UT Student Health Services Pharmacy (Sharon Roberson, Chief Pharmacist) and stored
      at 4°C, according to standard pharmacy protocols. Three ml doses of saline or insulin will be
      packaged in nasal spray bottles (e.g., Spectrum Pharmacy Products bottles 969-17404P and
      actuators 551-24362P) designed to deliver 100μL dose with each spray. A total volume of 200μL
      will be delivered during each administration (one 100μL dose in each nostril).
