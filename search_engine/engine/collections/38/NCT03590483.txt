      an increase in the incidence of neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to singleton
      pregnancy.

      The heterogeneous results reported so far can also depend on differences in the studied
      populations and/or in the management approach to twin pregnancy, variability in data
      regarding neonatal and maternal outcomes.

      Evidence on pregnancy outcomes of twins conceived by artificial reproductive technology (ART)
      compared with those naturally conceived (NC) is conflicting, A 2004 systematic review and a
      large 2008 study both were praised that in cases of twin pregnancy after assisted conception
      the perinatal mortality is significantly lower, when compared with those spontaneously
      conceived .
