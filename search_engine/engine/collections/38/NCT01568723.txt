      tissue at risk for neoplastic progression as well as of response to ablation therapy. These
      results will result in improved risk stratification in BE and better targeting of resources
      for patients who are candidates for ablative therapy, while simultaneously providing key
      information regarding the origins of Barrett's esophagus.
