      because of spatiotemporal resolution of measurements and immunity of the technique to
      vascular biases that contaminate functional MRI imaging of MS patients.4 MEG will help to
      illuminate the brain bases of motor deficits that exist relative to healthy controls and show
      how the improvements observed behaviorally are reflected in the brain activity that underlies
      those improvements. Since DTI has demonstrated the ability to find changes (plasticity) that
      occur in the brain in patients, it is very promising that DTI will be able to detect evidence
      of neuroplasticity in our research population.5 Using the MEG findings to sharpen the DTI
      analysis, a very powerful combination, will optimize the ability to detect and understand
      changes.

      Objectives Specific Aim 1 - Determine if there are activation differences (see below) in the
      neural regions serving motor function during basic movements using MEG in a group of MS
      patients, comparing MS affected portions of the brain versus non-affected.

      Specific Aim 2 - Determine the effect of a specific 6 month resistance and balance exercise
      program on activation in sensorimotor brain areas using MEG, and correlate changes in these
      neural indices with those of specific movement and balance.

      Specific Aim 3 - Determine the effect of a specific 6 month resistance and balance exercise
      program on brain diffusivity and fractional anisotropy using DTI and correlate changes in
      these metrics with improvement in strength and balance measures in subjects with MS,
      comparing MS affected portions of the brain versus non-affected areas..

      Specific Aim 4 - Determine whether increased fiber integrity (fractional anisotropy) along
      the corticospinal tract is reflected in MEG activation metrics of the primary motor cortex
      from baseline to 6 months in subjects with MS enrolled in the three-month resistance and
      balance exercise program.
