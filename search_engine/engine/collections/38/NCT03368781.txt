      designed to provide clinical data regarding the use of the AcQMap High Resolution Imaging and
      Mapping System during an atrial fibrillation retreatment ablation procedure. The patient
      population includes men and women, eighteen (18) years of age or older. The treatment plan
      must include evaluation and ablation (as indicated) of pulmonary vein reconnections plus
      AcQMap guided non-PV substrate ablation. Subject assessments will occur at screening,
      procedure, hospital discharge, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. (CLP-AF-004 [EU])
