      heavy chain variable region (IGHV) gene status being an unfavorable prognostic marker. These
      patients have shorter time to first treatment which consist of toxic chemotherapy.

      Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are immune
      checkpoints hampering immune responses in many tumors including CLL. These proteins are
      expressed by suppressive bystander cells as well as CLL cells. Vaccinating subcutaneously
      with PD-L1 and PD-L2 peptides mobilises cytoxic T-cells specific towards PD-L1 and PD-L2
      expressing cells. In this study we investigate if the PD-L1 and PD-L2 specific responses can
      overcome leukemic cells in CLL.
