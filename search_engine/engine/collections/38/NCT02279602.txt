      for up to 3 cycles or approximately 9 weeks. Subjects achieving a clinical response with a
      biomarker reduction or symptom response based on investigator assessment are eligible to
      enroll in this rollover study (protocol OX4219s). Subjects will receive fosbretabulin every
      three weeks for a maximum of approximately one year or until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, protocol-noncompliance, or the investigator feels
      that it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue therapy.
