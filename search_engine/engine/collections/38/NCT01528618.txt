      southern and southeastern China ,where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and
      150 cases per 100,000 population per year. NPC is a radiosensitive tumor, and radiotherapy is
      considered to be the treatment of choice for most cases. The 5-year survival rate (all
      stages) is around 50% .In other words, more than half of the NPC cases will eventually fail
      radiotherapy and reasons of the failure are both local relapse and remote metastasis.

      For these advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy is the most important therapeutics,and
      they are relatively responsive to chemotherapy compared to other head and neck cancers. The
      backbone of the treatment for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) NPC is cisplatin containing regimen,
      which is also regarded as the standard regimen for other squamous cell carcinoma of head and
      neck (SCCHN). The FP regimen is widely used in R/M NPC patients now and its response rate is
      around 40%-65%,but the response period is usually short and the adverse reaction is frequent
      and badly tolerant, which influent the treatment compliance seriously. What's more, the
      catheters and pumps are necessary for continuous infusion of 5-Fluorouracil, which add to the
      cost, immobility and inconvenience of the treatment.

      Preclinical and clinical data show synergistic activity between gemcitabine and cisplatin
      without overlapping toxicity. Several clinical trials enrolling a minority of advanced NPC
      patients suggest GP regimen has promising effectiveness and well tolerated side effects, and
      they indicated a potential possibility that the GP regimen comes to the standard first line
      choice instead of the FP regimen
