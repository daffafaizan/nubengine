    
      The purpose of this three-group repeated-measures randomized controlled trial is to evaluate
      the use of mobile health (mHealth) self-management technology as a model of care for
      individuals with multimorbidity. Specifically, this 8-week self-management intervention uses
      tailored self-management strategies (action planning, goal setting, and individually
      identified support needs) and mHealth technology for real-time virtual visits, daily
      messages, and self-monitoring activities. The investigators are testing the additive impact
      of having the nurse practitioner/community health worker (NP/CHW) team with the mHealth
      platform (mHealth Plus). The NP evaluates physiological status by evaluating symptoms and
      tailoring the intervention specific to the individual's multimorbidity while the CHW will
      assist in recognizing possible solutions to challenging social determinants of health by
      identifying community resources and guidance in overcoming barriers.

      The following specific aims will be addressed:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing comparative SM interventions (mHealth and
      mHealth plus virtual visits with a nurse practitioner and community health worker team) in
      multimorbid individuals by assessing: a) acceptability of each intervention; b) enrollment
      (recruitment efficiency, attrition, problems and solutions); c) intervention fidelity
      (delivery, receipt, enactment of the intervention [benefits and barriers]); and d) data
      collection (technological transfer of data, instrument reliability, the time required,
      missing data).

      Aim 2: To examine the impact of delivering the m-Health and m-Health plus interventions
      compared to standard care (SC) in multimorbid individuals on: a) primary outcome: adherence
      to disease-specific lifestyle behaviors (e.g. diet and medication, and self-monitoring of
      physiological measures as needed (e.g. weight blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen
      saturation); b) secondary outcomes: health related quality of life; c) patient-reported
      health status; d) symptom status; and e) healthcare utilization.
