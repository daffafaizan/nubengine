      inevitable question of measuring quality in health. Several surgical audits have been carried
      out internationally, showing the importance of collecting reliable and valid information on
      the quality of care. This approach allows an evaluation and improvement of the quality of
      care provided, significantly correlated to a direct impact on morbidity and mortality. In
      addition, it provides valuable information for evidence-based medicine research as it
      provides data on patients often excluded from therapeutic trials.

      Colorectal cancer is the first digestive cancer and the third cancer worldwide. Surgical
      resection is the main curative treatment. Surgical quality is associated with better short
      and long term results. Quality improvement measures, with the goal to improve surgical care
      of colorectal cancer, are becoming a standard worldwide.

      The aim of this project is to audit the surgical care in patients treated for colorectal
      adenocarcinoma. This study focused on collecting data from all consecutive cases of colon and
      rectal adenocarcinoma operated at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat. Using
      standardized forms, the investigators collected data relating to each stage of treatment:
      pre-therapeutic, surgical and post-operative in order to measure the quality of the surgical
      care delivered. These results were compared to established benchmarks and to similar audit
      studies carried out in other countries around the world.
