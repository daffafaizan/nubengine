    
      The proposed (investigational) NeoPlex4 assay measures levels of thyroxine (T4), thyrotropin
      (hTSH), 17-alpha-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) from dried
      blood specimens (DBS) collected from neonates to screen for congenital hypothyroidism (CH),
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and cystic fibrosis (CF). The Clinical Evaluation of the
      xMAP® NeoPlex4™ Assay (NeoPlex4) for Detection of T4, TSH, 17-OHP and IRT using the NeoPlex
      System is a multi-center method concordance study on a combination of prospectively collected
      neonatal dried blood spots and pre-selected archived frozen dried blood spots that have been
      demonstrated to be positive for 17-OHP (CAH), IRT (CF), and T4 or TSH (CH). The study will be
      conducted at selected sites that routinely perform newborn screening testing in the United
      States.
