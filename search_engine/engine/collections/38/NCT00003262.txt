        -  Investigate the effects on survival, life expectancy and quality, toxicity, and
           immunological status in low risk patients with Hodgkin's Disease and HIV infection
           treated with the Stanford V regimen and in high risk patients treated with epirubicin,
           bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into 2 groups designated as low and high risk on the basis
      of ECOG performance status (0-2 vs 3-4), presence or absence of AIDS before the diagnosis of
      Hodgkin's Disease, and immune status (CD4+ cell count greater vs no greater than 100/mm^3).

        -  Low risk patients (those with no risk factors) receive the EBVP regimen, as follows:

             -  Epirubicin intravenously on day 1

             -  Bleomycin intramuscularly or intravenously on day 1

             -  Vinblastine intravenously on day 1

             -  Prednisone orally on days 1-5

             -  Patients also receive daily injections of filgrastim (granulocyte
                colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) on days 6-15. This schedule is repeated every 3
                weeks for 6 courses.

        -  High risk patients (those with one or more risk factors) receive the Stanford V regimen,
           as follows:

             -  Doxorubicin and vinblastine intravenously on days 1 and 15

             -  Mechlorethamine intravenously on day 1

             -  Vincristine and bleomycin intravenously on days 8 and 22

             -  Etoposide intravenously on days 15 and 16

             -  Prednisone orally daily

             -  Patients also receive daily injections of G-CSF on days 3-7, 9-13, 17-21, and
                23-26. This schedule is repeated every 28 days for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 2 months the first year and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-30 patients will initially be accrued in this study.
