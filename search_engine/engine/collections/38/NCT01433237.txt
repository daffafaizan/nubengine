        -  Determine whether circulating muscle-specific microRNAs, especially serum miR-206, are
           potential biomarkers for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).

      OUTLINE: Archived serum samples are analyzed for miR-206 expression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 samples from patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS),
      15 from patients with embryonal RMS, and 10 from patients without RMS will be accrued for
      this study.
