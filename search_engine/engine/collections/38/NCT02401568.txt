      inclusion. Patients will benefit from dynamic CT acquisitions before and after arthrography
      with three maneuvers: radio-ulnar deviation, clenching fist and dart throwing motion.
      Patients will also benefit from a wrist MR study on a 3 tesla scanner.

      The morphology of the carpal ligaments will be evaluated on static imaging (MR and CT
      arthrograph) and on dynamic CT arthrography.

      Distance and angular measurements will be obtained from dynamic CT studies using an
      appropriate post processing tool (4D-Ortho).

      Data obtained with dynamic wrist evaluation will be correlated to ligament morphology,
      classical wrist instability criteria on conventional radiographs and with surgery (if
      available).
