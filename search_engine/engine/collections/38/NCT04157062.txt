      adjunctive treatment for OUD by evaluating the impact of rTMS on substance use, craving and
      inhibitory control, factors which contribute to relapse. The primary outcome will be the
      assessment of whether rTMS reduces substance use. Additional exploratory outcomes include the
      assessment of whether rTMS applied to the DLPFC provides neuromodulatory effects through the
      assessment of craving, inhibitory control, and functional connectivity via MRI. The targeted
      sample size for this open-label study, where all enrolled subjects will receive 9 sessions of
      active rTMS over 3 weeks.
