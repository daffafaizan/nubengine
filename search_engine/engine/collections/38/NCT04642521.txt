      Maximal physical efforts and aerobic exercise depend highly on adequate oxygen supply
      provided by haemoglobin and level of iron bound to haemoglobin.

      Handgrip strength has been shown to have a strong validity and high reliability in testing
      the upper body and lower body muscle strength, however its use as a potential tool to
      identify early anaemic patients planned for surgery is not fully explored. To our knowledge,
      this study is the first to investigate the diagnostic power of functional performance test
      within preoperative anaemic population and the change of handgrip strength after
      administration of intravenous iron.

      METHODS:

      At recruitment of ProPBM study, all eligible patients for this sub-study will be invited to
      this sub-study and have their full blood count, ferritin and transferrin saturation recorded
      and handgrip strength assessed.

      After randomization, those within the ProPBM protocol will receive IV iron therapy as
      indicated. Participants who are randomized to standard care will follow usual medical
      management.

      Participants will be admitted 1 day prior to surgery. On admission, preoperative bloods and
      handgrip strength will be repeated for patients who were randomized into the ProPBM arm.
