      exercise had faster remissions and better improvement in their treatments that those who did
      not. There are also some scientific studies that included physical exercise in the treatment
      for panic disorder and compared them to other single pharmacological treatments.

      So our objective will be to compare the efficacy of a pharmacological monotherapy
      (alprazolam), that is one of the options for the pharmacological treatment of panic disorder,
      with other treatment such as the combination of aerobic physical exercise and alprazolam, and
      to determine if this combination results in a better therapeutic response.
