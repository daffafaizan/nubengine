      cardiac sequelae in a subset of patients. KD patients that are resistant to therapy are more
      likely to develop coronary artery abnormalities. This phase III placebo-controlled,
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial of infliximab plus standard therapy vs. placebo plus
      standard therapy in acute KD will determine if the addition of infliximab to primary therapy
      can reduce the percentage of children resistant to therapy.
