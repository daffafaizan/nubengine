    
      A total of 50 subjects booked for Bariatric Surgery with BMI up 45 will be recruited.
      Patients with pre-existing liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption and significant
      central obesity will be excluded.

      Ultrasound examination of the liver with liver volume measurement, and blood tests, including
      Liver Function Tests (LFT) and platelet counts,is performed as part of the pre surgery work
      up.

      The subjects are then given 4 weeks of Omega-3 supplements (2 capsules of Blackmores Omega
      Daily Concentrated Fish Oil per day: Concentrated omega-3 triglycerides- fish 1000mg (600mg
      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 1400mg Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)).

      Just before Surgery, a repeat of ultrasound examination and measurement of liver volume is
      carried out, as well as a repeat liver panel and platelet count.The subjects will have their
      weight and body composition recorded as well at this time.

      At the time of the surgery, the surgeon makes a subjective assessment of the left lobe liver
      volume on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the largest. Additionally,ease of access to area under
      the left lobe of the liver is also subjectively assessed, on a scale of 1 to5, 5 being the
      most difficult.
