      that drugs that boost levels of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) improve glycemic control and
      have long-term beneficial effect on the function of pancreatic beta cells. Objective: To
      compare the short and long term effects of sitagliptin (which inhibits the DPP-IV enzyme,
      increasing the levels of GLP-1) with bedtime NPH insulin in patients with T2D inadequately
      controlled with sulphonylurea plus biguanide. Effects on beta cell function and on metabolic
      profile were analyzed. Methods: 40 patients with DM2, HbA1c between 6.6 to 10%, in use of
      metformin and glibenclamide will be randomized to the addition of sitagliptin (Sitagliptin
      Group) or of bedtime NPH insulin (NPH Group). Measurements of HbA1c, metabolic and hormonal
      profile at fasting and post-meal (every 30 minutes for 4 hours) will be evaluated before and
      after 6 months (short term) and 12 months (long term) of adding sitagliptin or NPH insulin.
