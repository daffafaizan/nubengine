      cover possible data loss, 10% of a group were added to each group. Medical and dental
      examination will be performed both of control and experimental groups. Age and body mass
      index (BMI) will be recorded.

      In dental examination decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index will be used according
      to World Health Organization (WHO 1997) criteria. All teeth were visually using the
      International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). To analyze the correlation
      between oral health status and polycystic ovary syndrome linear regression test and for
      comparison of both the groups (case and control), two sample t test and chi square test were
      used.
