      considered an adverse prognostic factor. Glycated hemoglobin (or HbA1c) can be measured to
      estimate the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time, thus
      determination of glycated hemoglobin at admission after aSAH serves as an approximation of
      blood glucose levels in the weeks preceding aneurysm rupture.

      In this patient registry admission HbA1c within 72 hours after confirmed aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients aged over 18 years is determined and correlated with
      clinical course and neurological outcome after 6 month as determined by modified Rankin
      score. Additionally, patients are monitored for incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI)
      and the incidence of new infarction on the discharge ct scan attributable to DCI. General
      treatment of cerebral aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage in all patients follows
      international guidelines.
