      cardiac vagal tone (cardiac vagal index â‰¤ 1,30), it is expected that from a sample of almost
      150 subjects (all over 18 years-old, ranging mostly from 40 to 50), we will compare 50
      subjects that adhered to the supervised exercise program ( more than 65% of expected
      presence). Patients with pacemaker on unable to exercise in the bicycle will be excluded from
      the study, as well as those who does not adhere to at least more than 65% of the expected
      presence in the supervised exercise program.

      All the sample will be randomized to performed 8 weeks of a specific sudden rest-exercise
      training and after 8 weeks will discontinue the protocol, or will do the opposite ( 8 weeks
      of no specific protocol, followed by 8 weeks of specific sudden rest-exercise training). The
      cardiac vagal will be evaluated at every 8 weeks to measure the cardiac vagal index between
      both phases. During all the time, all clients will perform aerobic, strength and flexibility
      exercises as part of the supervised exercise program.
