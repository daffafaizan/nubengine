    
      This single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase 1 dose-finding study
      will have two randomization schemes. Volunteers who could later be exposed to Ebolavirus
      while working in epidemic areas ("deployable subjects") will be randomized to receive one of
      two vaccine doses. Non-deployable volunteers, with no identified risk of Ebola exposure in
      the near term, will be allocated to one of three groups and receive the lower or higher
      vaccine dose, or a placebo. A single immunization will be performed. All subjects will be
      observed in the clinical trials unit (CTU) for 1.5 hours after vaccine/placebo injection.
      Subjects will complete post-injection diaries for 7 days after injection, as well as
      post-injection follow-up visits (see below). On-site visits at the CTU will occur on days -90
      to -1, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 84, 168. Some subjects with a positive serologic response at 24
      weeks may be requested to return for immune durability testing at 12 months.

      One or more interim analyses will be undertaken to guide decisions on 1) the potential use of
      the vaccine in Ph2/3 trials in affected countries and 2) potential modification of the
      trial(s) through an amendment to evaluate a higher dose, if immunogenicity is poor, or a
      lower dose if the dosage levels selected are not safe and reasonably well tolerated.
