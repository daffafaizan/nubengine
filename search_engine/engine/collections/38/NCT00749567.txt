      that therapy with this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prolongs survival after first or
      second line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Moreover, the addition of bevacizumab, a
      monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor bevacizumab (VEGF), to
      systemic chemotherapy, improved both the response rates and the time to tumor progression in
      two trials. Early data from phase I/II trials examining the combination of these two
      biological agents in pre-treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC, showed no major
      pharmacokinetic interactions and promising clinical activity.
