    
      The SPIRIT V Clinical Evaluation consists of two concurrent studies,the Diabetic sub-study
      and the Registry.

      The SPIRIT V Diabetic sub-study is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single
      blind, parallel two-arm multi-center study comparing the XIENCE V® EECSS to the TAXUS®
      Liberté™ in the treatment of diabetic patients with coronary artery lesions who will fulfill
      the eligibility criteria. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized (2:1) against the
      TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system. These patients will be recruited in up to 40 selected
      sites.

      The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT
      FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have
      shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were
      observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than
      the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is
      also independent of the first year results.

      The post approval SPIRIT V study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex
      lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target
      Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned
      pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion
      criteria.

      Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to
      discontinue further follow up in the SPIRIT V Diabetic study after 1 year.
