      pilot study. Thirty-five non-smoking Ethnic Chinese patients (male and female, age: 25-65
      years) with chronic periodontitis will be recruited. The teeth in experimental group will
      receive LLLT during orthodontic retention period for 12 months, while the teeth in the
      control (placebo) group will not receive laser therapy. Orthodontic occlusal indices will be
      measured to explore LLLT's role in maintaining tooth stability. The effects of LLLT on
      periodontal inflammation status will be evaluated by assessing clinical periodontal
      parameters and the levels of supra-gingival and sub-gingival bacteria. The effects of LLLT on
      bone remodelling will be explored by testing the biochemical biomarkers in gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF). Cone-beam computed tomography will also be used to provide clinical
      evidence of periodontal status and bone remodelling. Possible effects of LLLT on patient's
      quality of life will be investigated via validated questionnaires, subjective assessment of
      tooth sensitivity, and objective measurement of bite force.
