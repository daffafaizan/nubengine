      randomization the patients will be risk stratified with an existing algorithm according to
      risk of medication error. The patients in the intervention group will receive a medication
      review performed by a clinical pharmacist if they are in high medication error risk. Patients
      in highest medication error risk will recieve a medication review performed by a clinical
      pharmacologist.
