      influence of polymorphisms in drug metabolism and disposition genes on predisposition and
      prognosis of these types of leukemia. The genes we are studying include: MDR1, CYP3A4, NQO1,
      NAT1/2, GST, hOCT. We plan to study other genes that may be contributory.

      Study includes comparing the frequency of polymorphisms in these genes with the frequency in
      the general population and the study of DNA biding proteins which bind at the sites of these
      polymorphisms.
