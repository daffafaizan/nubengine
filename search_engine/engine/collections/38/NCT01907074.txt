      choice. Clearance of the oral cholate provides an assessment of portal blood flow. Clearance
      of the intravenous (IV) cholate provides an assessment of the systemic blood flow. The ratio
      of these clearances indicates the fraction of cholate that is shunted to the systemic
      circulation, and is called the cholate shunt fraction.2

      This study will measure cholate elimination rate constant (cholate Kelim), clearance of
      orally administered cholate, clearance of intravenously administered cholate and cholate
      shunt. This study will compare the presence and extent of the cholate clearances and shunt
      fraction with the presence and extent of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension (as
      measured by a hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] procedure.)

      The patients who will be enrolled in this study may or may not be those who are undergoing
      clinically indicated hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements at Baylor
      University Medical Center, with or without a liver biopsy. Patients having the HVPG
      measurements will be admitted to Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC) and prepared in the
      routine clinical fashion for their clinically-indicated HVPG measurement. The cholate test,
      including blood draws, will be performed after the HVPG procedure. The cholate test may also
      be performed in the Hepatology clinic
