      Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic
      chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC) or BCG. This treatment approach is limited due to
      rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.

      TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low
      viscosity at 5Â°C gel appearance at body temperature)for drug retention in the urinary
      bladder.

      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed
      with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,
      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine the
      gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.

      Intravesical MMC instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment
      efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder
      exposure to MMC.

      Treatment Protocol - Immediately following baseline cystoscopy and tumor diagnosis and
      patient undergoes 6 weekly instillations followed by 2-4 weeks healing period.

      1st Follow-Up Visit (Pre-Scheduled TURBT Visit): The patient will undergo a second Cystoscopy
      to compare to the Baseline status and after that a follow-up period: 3,6,9,12 months.
