      Arabia despite the availability of free dental services. School-based dental screening could
      be a potential intervention that might impact uptake of service and subsequently dental
      caries.

      Aim: To examine the effectiveness of school dental screening in promoting dental attendance
      and reducing untreated caries among primary schoolchildren in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

      Methods: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial comparing referral of
      screened-positive children to a specific treatment facility (King Saud University Dental
      College Hospital) against the current practice (information letter advising parents to take
      their child to a dentist). A total of 1000 children in 12 schools will be recruited. Schools
      (clusters) will be randomly selected and allocated to either group using computer software.
      Clinical assessment for dental caries will be conducted at baseline and after 12 months by
      dentists using the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Different clinical teams will be
      used for each trial group to ensure blinded outcome assessment. Data on socio-demographic,
      behavioural and dental visits will be collected at baseline and follow-up. Outcome measures
      will be the change in number of decayed teeth and the number of dental visits over 12 months.

      Discussion: This project will use a robust design to provide high level of evidence on the
      clinical benefits of school dental screening. The findings will potentially inform policies
      related to the continuation/ implementation of school-based dental screening in Saudi Arabia.
