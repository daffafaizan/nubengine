      subsequent process cost analyses (PCA) and also considers quality of life, drug misuse,
      dependence, adverse events and therapy satisfaction. Data were collected in collaboration
      with 22 physicians in Germany.

      The study was designed as a one armed non-interventional study. Patients had to suffer from
      nervous restlessness in order to be eligible for study documentation. Participants agreed to
      a medical treatment with PASCOFLAIR® of 12 weeks. In this context, documented patients could
      take PASCOFLAIR® at the first time or could have started within the past three months before
      the initial visit. Furthermore, documented patients had to be older than 18 years and must be
      able to read and understand the patient declaration of data protection and the declaration of
      consent. The patient must not be an alcoholic, must not be drug dependent and have no other
      types of addiction. Patients who were pregnant or breast-feeding were not eligible for study
      participation. Furthermore, patients showing hypersensitivity against passionflower extract
      or against other components of the medication were excluded. The signed declaration of
      consent of participating patients is available.

      The treatment of affected patients may not be documented, if a redemption (written or spoken)
      of the declaration of consent is existing or the patient takes Benzodiazepines.
