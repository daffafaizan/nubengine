      acyclovir for suppression of HSV-2 reactivation.

      All patients will be treated with the usual antibiotic treatment for any sexually transmitted
      infections that are diagnosed during the study. In addition, half will receive acyclovir for
      8 weeks , whilst the other half will receive a placebo for 8 weeks. The study medication will
      reverse in the second 8 weeks of the study. The patients will attend the clinic 3 times per
      week during the first and the last 8 weeks of the study and once every week during the
      washout period in the middle of the study - for a total of 18 weeks per participant. At each
      visit genital and oral samples will be collected. A blood sample will also be collected. For
      women participants, pregnancy test will be performed. The clinic will provide both pre- and
      post-HIV test counseling.
