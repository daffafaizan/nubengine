      cardio-pulmonary diseases. It can increase inspiratory muscle strength and endurance,
      improves exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL), and decreases the perception of dyspnea
      (POD) for adults with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Though the
      pathophysiology in COPD and bronchiectasis are different, there are some similarities in
      clinical presentation. In COPD patients, lung hyperinflation induces functional weakness of
      the inspiratory muscle and increases elastic load to breathing and intrinsic positive end
      expiratory pressure. Patients with bronchiectasis shows reduced ratio of FEV1/FVC, reduced
      FEV1, and normal or slightly reduced FVC, which indicate that airways are blocked by mucus.
      However, there has been no study that used IMT as a training modality to determine its effect
      in bronchiectasis. The clinical relevance of increased respiratory muscle strength per se by
      IMT alone is unknown. This study tried to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of
      home-based threshold training and examined if the effects of IMT extends to clinical outcomes
      such as activities of daily living and QOL in bronchiectasis patients.
