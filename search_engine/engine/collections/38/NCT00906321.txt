        -  Breast cancer chemoprevention has been notably underutilized.

        -  Barriers to integrating breast cancer risk reducing measures include: lack of time, low
           priority of risk reduction in comparison to treatment, the need to personalize risks and
           benefits of chemoprevention, and the need for resources/information necessary for women
           to make informed decisions.

        -  Access to quality decision support resources to facilitate making informed,
           preference-sensitive decisions about chemoprevention may provide a mechanism to overcome
           some of the current barriers to chemoprevention utilization.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Develop and refine a web-based patient decision support module for high-risk women
           making a decision about breast cancer chemoprevention.

        -  Conduct a randomized study of TACHD decision support versus standard care online
           information support to evaluate the impact of the chemoprevention module of the TACHD
           decision support intervention.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Women with no history of cancer other than cervical carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma
           skin cancer

        -  High risk for breast cancer based on at least one of the following:

             -  Gail score > 1.67

             -  History of atypical hyperplasia (either ductal or lobular)

             -  History of lobular carcinoma in situ

             -  Documentation of a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation

        -  Considering a decision about chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene

        -  Access to an IBM-compatible or MacIntosh personal computer with broadband Internet
           access

        -  Access to an email account

        -  Access to a telephone

        -  Aged 35 or older

        -  Able to communicate in English verbally and in writing

      DESIGN:

        -  The project will be guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (CSHIP)
           model overall, and incorporate the Ottawa Decision Support. Framework (ODSF) in one
           consistent decision support process.

        -  Testing of the chemoprevention decision support module will be conducted in a two-group
           pre- post-test experimental design with 64 at-risk women identified through Fox Chase
           Risk Assessment Programs and the NCI Clinical Cancer Genetics Program (CCGP) at the
           National Naval Medical Center (NNMC).

        -  A process evaluation analysis will assess participants' experiences using TACHD.
