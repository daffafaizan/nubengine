      and healthy subjects of different age and sex will be assessed by measurement of the
      incorporation of 13C from orally taken sodium [1,2-13C]-acetate into urea by 13C stable
      isotope ratio detection. The aim of the study is to determine the 13C urea production and to
      quantify the total urea production in healthy subject, gene defect carrier or patient as
      marker for the functioning of the urea cycle. Since there are still only few data available
      using this specific method for measurement of urea cycle performance, the aim of this study
      CCD09 is to gain additional results on the 13C assay. To this end, comparison will be made
      between 13C urea production observed in healthy subjects, UCD patients, and asymptomatic
      mutation carriers.

      An evaluation of this study may also enable the treating physician to better judge the
      severity of disease and the future risk of metabolic decompensations in patients as well as
      the potential risk for so far asymptomatic carriers.
