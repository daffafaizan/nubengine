      the EBV-specific T cells will be made. These cells will be grown and frozen. To get the HER2
      antibody (and the CD28) and the DNR to attach to the surface of the EBV-T cells, the antibody
      gene and the DNR gene will be inserted into the EBV-T cell. This is done with two viruses
      called retroviruses that have been made for this study. One will carry the antibody gene into
      the T cell and the other the DNR gene.

      When the patient is enrolled on the study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-DNR EBV-T
      cells. The subject will be given one dose of cells into the vein through an IV line. The
      injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic
      after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and
      Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.
