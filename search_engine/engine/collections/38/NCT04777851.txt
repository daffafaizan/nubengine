    
      RENOTACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of regorafenib and nivolumab (rego-nivo) versus transarterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) for the first-line treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with
      beyond up-to-7 criteria. Approximately 496 patients (about 248 in each arm) in around 80
      sites will be randomized in order to power the study efficiently to measure a clinically
      meaningful improvement for the primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) according to
      Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) based on the InvestigatorÂ´s
      assessment. To provide a balanced representation from the different regions involved in the
      trial, the number of patients enrolled in Asian countries will be capped at approximately 50
      precent.

      The trial will include patients who had been diagnosed with intermediate-stage HCC by biopsy,
      cytology or diagnostic imaging, such as dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), according to the criteria of the American Association for the Study
      of Liver Diseases (AASLD). Patients should have at least one measurable lesion as per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, disease not amenable to
      curative treatment but amenable to TACE (conventional TACE or drug-eluting bead TACE), and
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, Child-Pugh class A, and
      beyond up-to-seven criteria.

      The trial will include the following phases:

        -  Screening

        -  Treatment

        -  Follow-up

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the following stratification factors:

        -  Geographic region (Asia versus non-Asia)

        -  ECOG PS (0 versus 1)

        -  Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade (1 versus 2)

        -  HCC etiology (viral hepatitis versus non-viral)

      Randomized patients will receive either:

        -  Investigational arm: Regorafenib in combination with nivolumab

        -  Control arm: TACE

      In both arms, patients will receive trial treatment (Rego-Nivo or TACE) until progressive
      disease per mRECIST, unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that
      warrants permanent trial treatment discontinuation or other treatment discontinuation
      criteria is met. After trial treatment discontinuation, subsequent HCC treatment will be
      administered according to the Investigator's clinical judgment.
