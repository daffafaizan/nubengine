      stones < 20 mm. RIRS is a endoscopic surgery which allows to rich the kidney from the ureter.
      A flexible ureteroscope is used for these kind of procedure. Through this device a laser
      fiber (Holmium laser) is used to treat the stones. After that, small fragments can be removed
      with a basket. In some cases, according to intraoperative findings, a ureteral stent can be
      push in the kidney to help the drainage of the kidney. ESWL is a procedure which allows to
      treat the stones by shock waves generated by a specific machine which work in direct contact
      with the skin of the patients (extracorporeal). Shockwaves pass all the tissues and finally
      reach the stones. Such energy allows to break the stones in small fragments, that wll be
      spontaneously passed by the patients. Specific parameters of these treatments are discussed
      in "Arms and Interventions". Many studies demonstrated high success rate of RIRS and this
      technique is becoming more and more adopt. One study demonstrated better outcomes of RIRS
      versus ESWL, but only for renal stones located in the inferior calices and smaller then 10
      mm. There are not other studies comparing the two procedures and there are not proofs that
      RIRS ensures better outcomes for other renal stones (neither for size nor for location).
