      for a participatory randomized controlled trial. An online Delphi will be combined with an
      embedded trial testing the effectiveness of a decision support tool. This method provides for
      consensus building and collaborative problem-solving which is informed, and participatory.
      The online Delphi offers involvement and confidentiality thus sidestepping the complications
      of power imbalances and undue influence as respondents contribute anonymously.

      The embedded trial was considered after the building of a database of existing online trials
      and conducting a descriptive analysis" Creating a database of Internet-based clinical trials
      to support a public-led research programme: A descriptive analysis, followed by the
      completion of a systematic overview of systematic overviews, "Patient and Public Involvement
      in Clinical Trials Design: An Overview of Systematic Reviews" and followed this with an
      analysis of "Self-Management Open Online Trials in Health"(In review). The results included a
      lack of standardization, insufficient guidance for implementation and significant research
      reporting weaknesses. Decision-making support tools may improve decision quality.

      This embedded trial will be implemented in an online Delphi to come to the consensus about
      what declarations and methods to include when building a participatory online trials
      protocol.
