    
      250 subjects with a prior admission for pediatric sepsis will be contacted 2-15 years
      following the incident admission in order to complete a survey to assess their overall
      quality of life. Children will be administered the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) survey
      with a parental section to allow for parental response. Adult subjects will take the adult
      version of the PedsQL.
