    
      The data about effect of vitamin D3 (VD3) and omega-3 fatty acids(omega-3FA) on plasma levels
      of osteocalcin (OCN) are scarce and conflicting and nothing is published in the literature
      about the effect of the combination of VD3 and omega-3FA on the OCN levels.

      This study was conducted to investigate effect of VD3 and omega-3FA alone and with each other
      on PLASMA OCN levels in females and males with vitamin D deficiency (VDD).

      This randomized, controlled clinical trial was designed to test effects of 50,000 IU VD3
      weekly and 300 mg omega-3FA daily for eight weeks,separately and with each other, on the
      plasma levels of OCN and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD).

      This study was conducted during winter in 86 healthy Jordanian females and males with VDD
      with a mean age of (40Â± 10) years.

      Fasting serum levels for 25OHD,OCN, PTH (parathyroid hormone),calcium, phosphate, ALT
      (alanine aminotransferase), and urea were assessed at baseline and the end of the trial .
