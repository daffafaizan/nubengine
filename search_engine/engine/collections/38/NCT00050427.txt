      informed consent is obtained. Patients will be required to attend regular clinic visits to
      receive study medication and have their status monitored. Patients will also be required to
      have radiologic tumor assessments performed at multiple times throughout the study. A
      detailed explanation can be provided by the study physician (Investigator) conducting this
      study. Trabectedin 580 mcg/m2 once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (Treatment A) or 1,300
      mcg/m2 once every 21 days (Treatment B) will be given to patients as a 3-hour intravenous
      (i.v). infusion via a central venous catheter which is a tube placed into a large vein that
      is used to administer medications. All patients will be given dexamethasone 10 mg i.v. 30
      minutes before each trabectedin infusion. Patients may receive multiple cycles of trabectedin
      in the absence of disease progression.
