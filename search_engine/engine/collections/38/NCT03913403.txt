      Echocardiographic Mechanisms (CLOVERS-STEM) study is an ancillary study to CLOVERS, a parent
      multi-center, prospective, phase 3 randomized non-blinded interventional trial of fluid
      treatment strategies in the first 24 hours for patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. The
      CLOVERS trial attempts to determine the impact of a restrictive fluids strategy (vasopressors
      first followed by rescue fluids) as compared to a liberal fluid strategy (fluids first
      followed by rescue vasopressors) on 90-day in-hospital mortality in patients with
      sepsis-induced hypotension. This ancillary study obtains echocardiograms among
      CLOVERS-enrolled patients who consent to CLOVERS-STEM at baseline and 24 hours later
      (secondarily, this study also measures serum troponin levels at baseline and 24 hours) to
      pursue three aims: 1. Evaluate for differences in left ventricular global longitudinal strain
      at 24 hours after randomization between treatment arms; 2. Evaluate for differences in right
      ventricular end diastolic area to left ventricular end diastolic area ratio at 24 hours after
      randomization between treatment arms; 3. Explore possible heterogeneity of treatment effect
      based on baseline echocardiogram.
