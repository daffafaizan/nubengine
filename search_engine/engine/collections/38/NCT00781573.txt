    
      SCORE is a multicenter, prospective randomized study of post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) patients with an uneventful 1 year post-PCI course on dual anti-platelet
      therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin. Patient will be randomized to an additional 1
      year of DAPT (treatment arm) vs. aspirin alone (control arm)to assess the following endpoints
      during the 1 year follow-up period:

        1. Death / Myocardial infarction (MI) (Primary end-point)

        2. Combined endpoints of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stroke,
           and major/minor bleeding (Secondary end-point)

      During the year of follow up, subjects will be contacted once every three months. This will
      enable us to track study endpoints in the study population. In addition the patients' medical
      records will be screened to investigate if any of the aforementioned endpoints have been
      reached.
