      repetitive upper airway obstructions. OSA has been independently associated with insulin
      resistance, suggesting that OSA may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes and the
      metabolic syndrome. Recently, postprandial glucose and lipid have been reported as excellent
      predictors for mortality and cardiovascular risk. However, the association between
      postprandial glucose, lipid metabolism and OSA are not clear. In addition, humoral factors
      such as ghrelin and leptin are associated with obesity and OSA, but postprandial changes of
      which in patients with OSA are not well known. The aim of present study is to examine
      postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism, humoral factors in OSA before and after 3 months
      of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.
