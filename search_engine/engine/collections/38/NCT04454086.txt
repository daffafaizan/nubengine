      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering a community-based, comprehensive lifestyle
      weight management (LWM) intervention to 20 overweight or obese breast cancer (BC) survivors.

      II. Explore preliminary efficacy of the community-based, comprehensive LWM intervention for
      producing meaningful improvements in select clinically-relevant anthropometric, fitness,
      functional, and patient-reported outcomes in BC survivors.

      III. Provide the effect size estimates necessary to inform the design of a subsequent R01
      application addressing a large scale, optimally powered, randomized controlled,
      community-based LWM comparative efficacy intervention trial targeting weight loss in BC
      survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo aerobic exercise over 10-30 minutes and resistance exercise comprising 1-3
      sets of 8-12 repetitions of 10 different exercises over 1 hour for 24 weeks. Patients also
      receive behavioral activity counseling once a week and nutritional counseling over 30 minutes
      for 10 sessions after center-based exercise sessions during months 1-2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
