      the market, however durability is variable. In a prospective randomized study, five
      commercial devices available in the market will be tested in 20 consecutive patients each,in
      patients submitted to long-term outpatient nutritional support. Tube performance will be
      observed during 6 months and durability will be assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves as well as
      Cox regression analysis.It is hypothesized that tube design and material will influence
      outcome.This study is important because tube dysfunction and unscheduled changes are
      expensive troubles that disrupt the nutritional protocol and are responsible for multiple
      inconveniences to the patient and the caretaker.
