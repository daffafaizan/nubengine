      treatment paradigm for newly diagnosed PAH patients includes evaluation for Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea (OSA). The investigators propose that untreated or sub-optimally managed PAH patients
      have significant fluid retention which redistributes to the upper body during sleep and
      exacerbates or even mimics OSA. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of PAH patients
      with vasodilators and diuretics to optimize fluid balance will attenuate or even resolve OSA
      prior to the initiation of specific therapy for OSA (CPAP).
