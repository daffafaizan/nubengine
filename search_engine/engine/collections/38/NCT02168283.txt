      defined as overhydration (OH) â‰¥ 2 liters as measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. Patients
      with clinical symptoms of fluid overload (including, but not restricted to, dyspnea on
      exertion, peripheral edema, pulmonary congestion) will be excluded. The investigators will
      also exclude patients who are in overt pulmonary edema and required urgent medical care, who
      have cognitive impairment or problem of communication, unlikely to survive for more than
      three months, have mechanical problems of the dialysis catheter, or have active peritonitis
      or peritoneal failure.
