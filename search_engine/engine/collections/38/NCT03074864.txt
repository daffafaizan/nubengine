      but its efficacy reaches a platform, and treatment-related life threatening toxicity limits
      its use. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) produce a dramatic response in patients
      carrying EGFR activating mutations in the metastatic setting. Multiple prospective trials
      show that EGFR-TKIs have a better tolerability when compared with chemotherapy.
