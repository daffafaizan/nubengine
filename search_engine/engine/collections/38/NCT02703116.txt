    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and test the initial
      efficacy of eSBI, (electronic screening and brief intervention for alcohol use) coupled with
      STTR (Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain) in comparison to STTR only among YMSM (young men who
      have sex with men) and YTW (young transgender women) on frequency of substance use and
      engagement within the HIV and PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) care continuum. We will do this
      with the following aims:

      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of electronic Screening &
      Brief Intervention + Seek, Test, Treat and Retain (eSBI+ STTR) compared to STTR-only to
      reduce alcohol and other substance use among 450 YMSM and YTW in Chicago, ages 16-25, at 1,
      3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention.

      Aim 2: To explore the initial efficacy of eSBI+STTR in comparison to STTR-only on secondary
      exploratory outcomes within the HIV and PrEP care continuum among YMSM and YTW.

      Aim 3: Determine the degree to which sub-groups of youth are differentially impacted by
      eSBI+STTR based on socio-demographic characteristics and co-morbid mental health problems to
      inform future targeting and/or tailoring of the intervention.
