      X-CGD patients; it is well known that this procedure is challenging for these patients,
      potentially due to functional defects induced by their chronic inflammatory state.

      The combination of G-CSF and Plerixafor is considered state of the art for HSPC harvest in
      gene therapy trials; we considered to add a non-steroidal inflammatory drug to increase HSPC
      mobilization and reduce inflammation that could have a role in altering HSPC content.

      If this trial confirms the synergistic effect of the three drugs under investigation, such a
      regimen will be considered for a HSPC mobilization in future gene therapy trial for X-CGD
      patients.
