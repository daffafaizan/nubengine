      doxazosin exhibit antithrombotic effects in patients with essential hypertension? 2) Are the
      potential antithrombotic effects of doxazosin different to the effects of an ACE inhibitor?
      3) Is there a relation between the antihypertensive effect and the antithrombotic effect of
      these antihypertensive agents?

      The co-primary outcomes are changes in endothelial function assessed by flow mediated
      vasodilatation, and in haemostatic function measured by the generation of
      thrombin-antithrombin complex.
