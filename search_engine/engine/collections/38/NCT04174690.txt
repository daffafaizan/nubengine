      postural balance and motor control. Platforms composed of two force plates allow the analysis
      of the load relationship between the feet and the study of the coordination of the lower body
      segments in postural control. Center of pressure displacement data during perturbations
      generated by platform rotation allow the study of dynamic postural balance. However, devices
      that meet these characteristics are not common and have limitations on amplitude or speed of
      rotation. Thus, a force platform composed of two plates was developed, capable of collecting
      data for the calculation of the parameters of the center of pressure, differentiating each
      foot, with a computerized system to control amplitude and speed of rotation in the
      mid-lateral and anteroposterior axes. A new version of embedded and supervisory systems that
      control the device, collect and process the created data has also been developed. For
      platform functionality tests, volunteers were divided into three groups of 15 individuals:
      Group 1 (G1): women aged 18 to 40 years; Group 2 (G2): women aged 40 to 60 years; Group 3
      (G3): women over 60 years old.
