      investigate B-cell responses. Investigators will collect blood samples from the volunteers at
      a higher frequency than in the two previous flu seasons to better define the dynamic response
      to vaccination. The objective is to compare the Ig gene repertoire before and after
      vaccination by deep sequencing PBMC and proteomic analysis of antibody CDR3 regions at 10
      different time points before and after immunization.

      This is a Phase IV study of healthy adults who are given standard TIV off-season. There are
      no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race. Following confirmation of written informed
      consent, baseline blood samples will be drawn from all study participants at Day -5, Day -3
      and Day 0 prior to immunization, and at Days 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 28 and 180 post-immunization.
      Volunteers will be vaccine-na√Øve for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccines.
      All participants will receive a single dose of the current seasonal influenza vaccine by
      intramuscular (IM) injection at Day 0.
