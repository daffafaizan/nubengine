      to the failure of spontaneous breathing test and spontaneous breathing test.In the index of
      predicting mechanical ventilation, the investigators will take the index of inflammatory
      response, the function index of diaphragm and the amount of exhaled CO2 into account to
      reduce the failure rate of mechanical ventilation.
