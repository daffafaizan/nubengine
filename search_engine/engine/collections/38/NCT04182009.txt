      induction procedure. 54 participants with stable asthma or COPD will be recruited and will
      attend 2 visits, at least 48 hours apart. Differences in the quality and quantity of samples
      and the time taken to produce a sample will be described. The main purpose is to explore the
      optimum device to perform the procedure, whilst protecting the safety of participants and
      maximising their comfort.

      If participants are unable to produce a sputum sample after completion of the induction
      procedure, physiotherapy techniques may be performed. This is an exploratory objective to
      establish whether these techniques may help in the event of unsuccessful procedures.
