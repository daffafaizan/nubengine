    
      The primary objective is to compare functional outcome at 3 years after trapezio-metarcarpal
      arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon
      interposition. Literature values obtained by a recently published meta analysis1 will be
      used.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare functional outcome at 1 and at 5 years after trapezio-metarcarpal
           arthroplasty with trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and
           tendon interposition

        -  to determine pre- and postop HR QOL

        -  Incidence of RLL at each follow up time point. Literature values from the same meta
           analysis1 will be used.
