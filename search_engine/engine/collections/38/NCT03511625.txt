      biopsy, blood draws, synovial fluid aspiration, and physician assessments will be performed
      before and after initiating treatment. At screening visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will be assessed. If assessments have not been completed to verify these criteria, they will
      be performed at this visit. After patients are confirmed to meet criteria, patient disease
      activity will be assessed and blood draw, synovial aspiration, and biopsy will be performed
      before first treatment injection. About 5 days after this first treatment injection, these
      assessment and samples will be performed again. About 5-6 weeks after first treatment
      injection, a final physician assessment will be performed. Patients will have the option of
      consenting to allow storage of samples for future research.
