      epidemic in the African Meningitis Belt. Reactive vaccination campaigns are the preferred
      strategy for prevention during an epidemic.

      A novel strain of meningococcus, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC), began circulating
      in Nigeria in 2013 and caused a major epidemic with over 10 000 cases in Nigeria and Niger in
      2015.

      There is currently a global shortage of vaccine against NmC, and a recent WHO expert panel
      called for the formal evaluation of antibiotic prophylaxis as another epidemic response
      strategy.

      When taken as a single dose, oral ciprofloxacin effectively eliminates nasopharyngeal
      carriage of meningococcus.

      This trial aims to investigate two different antibiotic prophylaxis strategies during an
      epidemic of meningococcal meningitis: ciprofloxacin prophylaxis to household members of cases
      and village-wide prophylaxis after the notification of a case in a village. These two
      strategies will be compared to villages receiving standard care.
