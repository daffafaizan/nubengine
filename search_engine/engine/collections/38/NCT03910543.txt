    
      An open-label clinical trial of tofacitinib in cutaneous sarcoidosis and GA. The hypothesis
      is that Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/3 inhibition with tofacitinib will be effective for the
      treatment these two diseases. Tofacitinib will be administered at a dose of 5 mg twice daily
      and response to therapy will be assessed at months 1, 3, and 6 of therapy. The primary
      outcomes will be improvement in the Cutaneous Sarcoidosis Activity and Morphology Instrument
      (CSAMI) and Granuloma Activity Scoring Index (GASI) after 6 months of tofacitinib therapy.
      Secondary outcomes will include improvement in internal organ sarcoidosis (i.e. lung,
      cardiac) and skin related quality of life. Pre- and on treatment PET-CT scans will be
      performed in patients with sarcoidosis with internal organ involvement. Pre- and on treatment
      blood collection and skin biopsies will be performed for correlative scientific studies using
      RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and cytokine profiling.
