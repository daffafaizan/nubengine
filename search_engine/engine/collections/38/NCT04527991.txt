    
      This is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial in which
      approximately 600 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable UC who have
      progressed after prior therapy with platinum-based regimen and anti-programmed cell death
      protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy will be randomized to either
      sacituzumab govitecan arm or Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) arm.

      Subjects in TPC arm will have 1 of 3 standard of care (SOC) chemotherapeutic options
      including paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinflunine. Subjects randomized to the sacituzumab
      govitecan arm will receive 10 mg/kg of sacituzumab govitecan intravenously on Day 1 and Day 8
      of 21-day cycles. Those randomized to the TPC arm will have the choice of receiving
      paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinflunine administered intravenously at SOC doses of 175, 75 and
      320 mg/m2 respectively, on Day 1 of 21-day cycles.
