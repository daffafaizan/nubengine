      thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), lower alveolar concentration will be required to reach
      the same anesthesia depth. The main aim of the study is observing and comparing the alveolar
      concentrations of anesthetic agents with entropy monitoring which is an anesthesia depth
      monitor in major abdominal surgeries where general anesthesia is combined or not with TEA.

      In cases where TEA is combined with general anesthesia or not, anesthesia depth will be
      effectively monitored by entropy monitoring, in this way the adequate depth of anesthesia
      will be provided with the use of minimal volatile anesthetics and we will be able to prevent
      the use of large amounts of volatile anesthetics., It will be determined how much reduction
      in alveolar concentration is required in cases combined with TEA.

      Nowadays, with the development of reliable anesthesia machines, "low-flow anesthesia" (LFA)
      is becoming more widespread, and its benefits on patient health, economy and ecology have
      been demonstrated. In LFA, the depth of anesthesia should not be too superficial or too deep
      during the time the alveolar concentration of volatile agent reaches equilibrium. Therefore,
      alveolar concentrations of volatile anesthetics are monitored in modern anesthesia machines.
      Some machines may also adjust the depth of anesthesia according to the alveolar concentration
      of the agent.
