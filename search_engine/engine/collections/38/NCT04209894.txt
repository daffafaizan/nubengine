      musculoskeletal diseases, will be recruited. They will undergo dermatological assessment and
      a blinded ultrasound (US) evaluation. Clinical assessment included demographics, severity of
      psoriasis and musculoskeletal clinical examination. Evaluation consisted of the detection of
      grey scale (GS) enthesitis and Power Doppler signal in enthesis areas. The Madrid Sonography
      Enthesitis Index (MASEI) scoring system was used to quantify the extent of sonographic
      entheseal abnormalities.
