    
      This trial is an open-label, multi-centre, dose-escalation Phase I/II study to evaluate
      safety, explore efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of PXD101
      with idarubicin administered in two different schedules in patients with AML. The PXD101 plus
      idarubicin treatment will be repeated at suitable intervals (target is every 3 weeks for
      schedule A and every 2 weeks for schedule B) depending upon toxicities or disease
      progression. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at every cycle.

      Schedule A uses PXD101 by 30 min infusion daily for 5 days every 3 weeks with escalating
      doses of idarubicin.

      Schedule B uses escalating doses of continuous infusion (48h) of PXD101 alone or in
      combination with idarubicin.

      In both regimens the trial may be expanded at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
