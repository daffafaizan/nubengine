      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 3 patients with no concomitant diabetes, over 6 months.
      Following baseline assessment, patients were instructed to ingest 100g of oral trehalose
      diluted in 500ml of water or other beverages daily. Assessments were performed at baseline,
      2, 4 and 6 months using ataxia rating scales (SARA, SCAFI and INAS) and EQ-5D-3L scale for
      quality of life assessment.
