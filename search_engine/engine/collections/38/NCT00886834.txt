      the U.S. IUD use is expanding in the U.S. and is now routinely recommended for nulliparous
      women. The cervix of a nulliparous woman has a smaller diameter and can lead to more
      difficult and uncomfortable IUD insertions. Because of misoprostol's known ability to cause
      cervical dilation, some family planning providers use this drug to facilitate insertion.
      While there is a wealth of data on the use of misoprostol prior to many procedures requiring
      cervical dilation there is minimal objective evidence assessing its effect on provider ease
      of insertion or patient comfort during IUD insertion in nulliparas. The goal of this project
      is to evaluate whether misoprostol relative to placebo prior to IUD insertion in nulliparous
      women eases insertion and decreases pain. The results of this trial will be contributed to a
      prospective meta-analysis on the subject.
