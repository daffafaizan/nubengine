      with a form of coaching called motivational interviewing (MI) conducted by a trained
      registered nurse. Three similar counties that do not border any of the intervention counties
      are serving as controls (these counties receive the same nutrition education/skills
      intervention without motivational interviewing). All participants will receive cookbooks,
      cooking classes, food preparation tools, and prepared food dishes to take home to their
      families. The investigators will measure the impact of motivational interviewing on fresh
      fruit and vegetable consumption, saturated fat consumption and number of meals cooked at
      home.
