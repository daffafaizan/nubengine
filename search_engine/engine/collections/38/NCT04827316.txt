    
      In this study the investigators retrospectively and prospectively collect information from
      enrolled subjects through a period of a total of 10 years to evaluate multidimensional
      associations between phenotypic manifestations of cardiovascular disease via CCTA and cardiac
      and non-cardiac imaging, serum biomarkers, demographic and clinical information, clinical
      presentation (cross-sectional), therapy changes (time-varying) and their ability to predict
      mortality and MACE (major adverse cardiac event ) (longitudinal) in patients clinically
      indicated for CCTA.

      The aim is to establish a comprehensive cross-sectional, time-varying and longitudinal data
      collection for individuals undergoing clinically-indicated CCTA to date in order to apply
      novel multiparametric approaches to determine cardiovascular significance to
      clinically-important patient-centered events. For data collection this registry will follow a
      standard CRF (case report form) structure, so to enable the merging of this data-set with
      other international registries, which might contribute in overcoming some gaps of knowledge
      from previous CCTA studies.
