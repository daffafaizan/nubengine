      pulmonary vascular remodeling, consisting of plexiform arteriopathy, smooth muscle cell
      proliferation, and vascular fibrosis, in IPF and COPD that could be used to identify
      potential responders vs non-responders to PAH-specific therapies. The central hypothesis is
      that similar mechanisms and pathways underlie pulmonary vascular remodeling in IPF-PH,
      COPD-PH, and PAH. However, only a subset of Group 3 PH patients display remodeling consistent
      with PAH, resulting in responder vs. non-responder phenotypes when treated with PAH-specific
      therapies. In preliminary studies of subjects treated with Tyvaso, The study team has
      observed distinct 129Xe MRI signatures at baseline and with therapy depending on patients'
      underlying lung function. Consistent with this, recent studies using single-cell RNA
      sequencing (scRNAseq) of the pulmonary vasculature in IPF have demonstrated changes
      consistent with vascular remodeling.
