        -  Determine the confirmed response (complete and partial) in patients with previously
           treated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
           FR901228 (depsipeptide).

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months until 1
      year after study entry and then every 6 months until 3 years after study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-10
      months.
