      carried in the aqueous environment of the blood. The lipoprotein particles that comprise this
      system are polydisperse and contain triglycerides, free and esterified cholesterol,
      phospholipids and proteins. Inborn errors in the lipoprotein transport system lead to
      alterations in both the steady state concentrations of the various lipoproteins and in the
      metabolism of these particles. These inborn errors lead to both hyperlipoproteinemia and
      hypolipoproteinemia. Profound changes in the ambient lipoprotein concentrations have a
      variety of clinical manifestations. The present study protocol is designed to permit a full
      evaluation of the lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, in patients with potential
      genetic defects in these processes. The protocol will also permit training of students, staff
      clinicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dieticians and post-doctoral fellows
      in the evaluation and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias. The study population will
      include patients which are referred to the Lipid Service from private care providers,
      academic institutions, or the NHLBI Lipid website, with any of the following potential lipid
      abnormalities or clinical stigmata associated with dyslipoproteinemias: a) increased plasma
      levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol b) decreased plasma
      concentrations of cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol c) postprandial hyperlipidemia or d)
      eruptive xanthomas, xanthelasma, tuberous or tendinous xanthomas, or corneal opacities.
