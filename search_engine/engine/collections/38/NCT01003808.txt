      and radiation therapy. However, there are no standard therapies established for recurrent
      esophageal cancer. NY-ESO-1 antigen is expressed in 33% of patients. NY-ESO-1 protein is
      applicable without limitation by HLA types, and injected as a complex with cholesteryl
      pullulan (CHP), forming nano-particles (IMF-001), it can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
      In this phase 1 study, the safety and the biological recommended dose will be determined.
