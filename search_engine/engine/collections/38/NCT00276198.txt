    
      The high level of anemia persists in Negev children despite the existence of a policy of the
      Ministry of Health that calls for Iron, Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplementation up to 12
      months of age. In addition, other micronutrient deficiencies in this population have been
      described in several studies. These may be related to; low adherence with existing
      recommendations; need for additional micronutrients other than Iron, Vitamin A and Vitamin D;
      the need for a different delivery system more acceptable to mothers and infants.

      We will compare in Bedouin and Jewish children separately the efficacy of daily use of
      Sprinkles(home Micronutrient fortification) from age 6 to 12 months in infants recruited in
      Maternal and Child Health clinics.

      The comparison will be children recruited in clinics of comparable socioeconomic status,
      where current Ministry of Health recommendations (drops of iron and vitamins A plus D) are
      the treatment regimen.
