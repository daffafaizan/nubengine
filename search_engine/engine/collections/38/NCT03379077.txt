      cluster randomized study in a rural area of Pakistan. The results of this recently completed
      cluster RCT funded by the Grand Challenges Canada (GCC) showed that LTP Plus works and
      benefits both the mother and the child. More specifically, the results indicate a significant
      reduction in maternal depression.

      Purpose of this cluster RCT is to determine if supported implementation of the LTP plus
      programme improves infant development compared to standard implementation of the LTP plus
      programme. This is an implementation trial comparing two ways of introducing LTP plus. A
      Cluster RCT of culturally adapted intervention LTP Plus will be conducted in the villages of
      Gadap town, Karachi, Pakistan. Total 60 villages will be randomized in two groups LTP plus
      and LTP plus supported implementation. Each cluster will be made of up to 15 mothers.
      Participants will be screened using eligibility checklist. Assessments will be done at
      baseline and after completion of intervention (3-month). All follow ups will be done by
      independent RAs, not involved in delivering intervention sessions.
