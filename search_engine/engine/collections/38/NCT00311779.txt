      States. It has become a major nuisance in school children resulting in many lost school days
      and frustrated parents. Lice and nit (ova) resistance to current OTC products has been
      reported. Compliance with product instructions is thought to be low. Therefore a safe and
      effective alternative to these products is desirable.

      Spinosad and its formulations have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as
      crop protection products in the US, Canada and Australia, and has received provisional
      approval in the UK, Spain and several other European Union countries.

      Spinosad is being formulated as a creme rinse using excipients that are widely used and are
      "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS).

      This study is intended to show the safety and efficacy of Spinosad 0.5% and 1.0%, as compared
      to the vehicle control in subjects 2 years of age and older with at least a mild infestation
      of pediculosis capitis.
