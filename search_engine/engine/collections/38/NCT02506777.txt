      treatment is often needed to downstage locally advanced BC tumors prior to surgery, however
      many patients do not achieved objective response during treatment. The ability of melatonin
      and metformin to decrease side effects of chemotherapy had been investigated, moreover
      several studies confirm, that this drugs in combination with conventional treatment may
      increase objective response. But, this data is still controversial. We hypothesized that
      combinations of melatonin and conventional chemotherapy regimen such as FDC could be more
      effective than FDC alone in terms of response rate.
