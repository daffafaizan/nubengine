      subcutaneous incisional analgesia to epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in
      children undergoing open abdominal, thoracic, or pelvic operations for oncologic purposes.
      The patient and treating team will be blinded to the pain control device. The primary outcome
      is additional narcotic usage for 3 post-operative days, and secondary outcomes are pain
      scores for 3 post-operative days, post-surgical day of ambulation, time to regular diet,
      infectious complications (UTI, wound infection or pneumonia), and hospital length of stay.
      Outcomes from both groups will be directly compared in order to determine whether one
      strategy provides more effective pain control with less complications than the other, or
      whether they are equivalent.
