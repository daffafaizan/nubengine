      thoracic sympathectomy (VATS) . This minimally invasive technique has been well standardized
      and provides adequate results with low morbidity.

      The main side effect of VATS is compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH). This is present in most
      cases and is considered the greatest cause of dissatisfaction. To reduce the risk of CH,
      various studies have been conducted to compare different levels of ganglion resection. These
      studies have been based on subjective quantification of sweating (assessment of sweating
      reported by patients) and on the application of quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Recently, tests for the objective evaluation of sweating have been developed to quantify
      sweating among patients with various diseases, including PH. So far, there have not been any
      studies comparing the long-term results of thoracic sympathectomy on the third ganglion (G3)
      versus the fourth ganglion (G4)with objective evaluation to quantify sweating.

      The present study was prospective, randomized and blinded, with the objective of comparing
      the results from VATS at two different resection levels: G3 versus G4. All the patients were
      followed over a one-year period, and their palmar sweating was quantified using a portable
      device (VapoMeter) to measure transepidermal water loss (TEWL). In addition, CH was evaluated
      by applying a specific quality-of-life questionnaire.
