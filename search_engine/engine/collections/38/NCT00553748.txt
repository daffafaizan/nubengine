      in a group with high grade brain tumors and to evaluate cell proliferation with F-18 FLT. FLT
      is known to clear out of normal brain and detect brain tumor. This population represents a
      potential clinical population that may benefit from this PET imaging tracer. This information
      will help improve the design and conduct of future F-18 FLT clinical trials.
