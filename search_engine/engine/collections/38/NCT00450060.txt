      headache or backache. Several though not all studies in adults showed that the frequency of
      complaints can be reduced by using non-traumatic Sprotte-design needles instead of cutting
      Quincke-design needles. In children and adolescents there are no comparable data published.
      In most pediatric hospitals in Germany Quincke needles are used.

      Comparison: Children and adolescents from 4 to 18 years of age who have to undergo a lumbar
      puncture are randomly attributed to puncture with Quincke needle or with Sprotte needle.
      During the following days headache (main criterium), position-dependent headache, backache,
      vomitus, and malaise are noted. Pain is measured with a visual analogue scale/faces scale.
