      in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Affected
      patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers. At present,
      there is little to offer for the treatment of this condition. Prevention of PTS is the key to
      reducing its burden on patients and society. Elastic compression stockings (ECS) could be
      helpful in preventing PTS, however data on their effectiveness are scarce and conflicting.

      Comparison(s): Knee-length, 30-40 mm Hg (Class II), graduated ECS worn on the DVT-affected
      leg daily for 2 years compared to knee-length, inactive (i.e. no compression) stocking,
      identical in appearance to active ECS, worn on the DVT-affected leg daily for 2 years.
