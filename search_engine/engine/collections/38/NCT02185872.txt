      clearance from a doctor, that is expected to improve glucose control, fitness (Eurofit and
      peak aerobic capacity), and body composition (body fat percentage, fat mass, and lean body
      mass). After stratification by age and body mass index, participants will be randomized to
      either a standard aerobic and resistance training exercise program or a relatively higher
      intensity, shorter duration CrossFit exercise program.
