      the most common problems of the knee. It is characterized by anterior knee pain that is
      aggravated by deep knee flexion, prolonged sitting, and repetitive flexion/extension. The
      most widely accepted theory in regards to the source of this pain is that a force imbalance
      around the knee leads to static patellofemoral malalignment and dynamic patellofemoral
      maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and maltracking leads to elevated joint contact
      stresses, which ultimately leads to patellofemoral pain. Current understanding of
      patellofemoral maltracking is typically focused on static 2D alignment (lateral tilt and
      displacement). Yet, patellofemoral pain is most often exacerbated during dynamic events and
      the patella has complete six degrees of freedom in its movement. More recent studies have
      been able to quantify patellofemoral kinematics during volitional dynamic tasks and
      demonstrate that patellofemoral pain, altered kinematics are not limited to excessive
      patellar lateral translation and tilt, but include excessive patellar superior translation
      along with excessive flexion and valgus rotations. Flexion and valgus are sagittal and
      coronal plane rotations that cause the superior pole of the patella to shift anteriorly and
      medially, respectively. Recent work has shown that altered force balance around the knee can
      indeed lead to maltracking. However, the question remains whether correcting an existing
      force imbalance around the knee can normalize patellar kinematics and/or reduce pain. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how temporary iatrogenic loss of force in the vastus
      lateralis muscle alters the aberrant patellar kinematics in subjects with chronic idiopathic
      patellofemoral pain.
