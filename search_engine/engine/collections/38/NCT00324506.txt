      and exclusion criteria will be treated with CellCept速 or Avonex速 for the first 6 months of
      the study. Those patients will have a fifty-fifty chance of receiving either Avonex or
      Cellcept. Baseline data will be collected before treatment begins including MRIs, chest
      x-ray, EKG, and standard labwork, along with a blood test for HIV and Hepatitis B. Once
      enrolled, study visits include periodic MRI scans, a neurological exam by the examining
      neurologist every three months, frequent bloodwork, questionnaires, and eye-testing at month
      zero, six, and twelve months. Eye testing takes about one hour and requires dilation of
      pupils. All assessments are standard of care for ophthalmology with the exception of optical
      coherence tomography (OCT)-- a non-invasive procedural device that records graphical and
      numerical measurements of the optic nerve and macula.

      All patients will begin active combination therapy on both CellCept速 and Avonex速 during the
      second 6 months of the study. During this second phase, MRI and clinical examinations will be
      performed.
