    
      Schematic Design of the Study: Single blood draw, one random urine and 24-hr urine collection
      from hospitalized patients with chronic/acute heart failure and/or STEMI-NSTEMI. If there
      should be a subsequent hospitalization,another collection of a 45 ml blood sample, random
      urine and one 24-hour urine collection may be completed if indicated at initial
      hospitalization.

      Aims:

      The purpose of this study is to attempt to establish the various ranges of proteins that can
      be assayed from the plasma and urine of patients with all classes of heart failure and MI
      (myocardial infarction). Follow-up hospitalizations may result in another 45 ml blood draw,
      random urine and 24-hr. urine collection to evaluate the outcome of the heart failure
      treatment used with the previous hospitalization, if indicated in consent. A history review
      will be necessary as well.
