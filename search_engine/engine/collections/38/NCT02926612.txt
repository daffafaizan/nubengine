      respiratory tract secretions collected from children with a history of HCT who are undergoing
      evaluation for pulmonary complications. Patients will be screened and enrolled by study
      coordinators at each site, who will collect and submit biospecimens as well as patient
      characteristics and clinical outcomes. Metagenomic NGS will be performed on these
      biospecimens in an attempt to identify microbial pathogens and markers of host response to
      infection, including immune activation, inflammation, and cell damage. This study will then
      correlate these results with patient characteristics, clinical microbiology test results, and
      clinical outcomes in order to evaluate the utility of metagenomics NGS in improving the
      diagnosis of LRTI in our pediatric HCT population.
