        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of interleukin-12 gene in patients with spontaneous
           skin metastases.

        -  Determine the antitumor immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the toxicity of this regimen administered for 1 week vs 2 weeks in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the local and systemic antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen
           administered for 1 week vs 2 weeks.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to number of tumor sites (1 vs 2 vs 3 or more).
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Group A: Patients receive interleukin-12 gene intratumorally over 5 minutes on days 1,
           3, and 5.

        -  Group B: Patients receive IL-12 gene intratumorally over 5 minutes on days 1, 3, 5, 8,
           10, and 12.

      Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 1 subsequent course beginning on day
      29.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (6 per treatment group) will be accrued for this
      study.
