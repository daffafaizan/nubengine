      occasions spread over a period of 12 days.

      Participants will report to the laboratory on the first visit for a blood sample and muscle
      biopsy. In order to measure muscle metabolism participants will also consume 'heavy water',
      which will also require participants to provide daily saliva swabs.

      After 96 hours participants will be asked to arrive at the laboratory to perform a bout of
      heavy exercise on one leg to induce sensations of muscle soreness in the days following
      exercise. Investigators will then collect a blood sample and muscle biopsy from the exercised
      leg and do exercise tests. After this, participants will perform another bout of exercise on
      the other leg that will also be followed immediately by a blood sample, muscle biopsy and
      exercise tests. This second exercise bout is not designed to induce sensations of muscle
      soreness. After 5 hours , exercise tests will be performed and a further blood sample and
      biopsies from both legs will be collected.

      Approximately, 21 hours after exercise (visit 3) participants will be asked to return to the
      lab for a short infusion (2.5 hour duration) of 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG), which allows
      investigators to measure glucose uptake. After the infusion, a blood and a muscle biopsy will
      be taken from each leg followed by exercising testing. Participants will then report back to
      the laboratory for exercise testing, a blood sample and a single muscle biopsy from both legs
      at 72 (visit 4) and 168 hours (visit 5) after the initial exercise session.
