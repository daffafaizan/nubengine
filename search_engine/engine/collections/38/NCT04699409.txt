      years. In the modern medical system, treatment for hyperacute stroke including intravenous
      thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy. The faster patient received treatment, the
      better outcome he has.

      Prehospital delay of acute stroke treatment has been an important issue in modern medical
      system. Awareness of stroke symptoms and calling for medical help immediately is the most
      important part of stroke health education. The most used educational campaign is FAST.

      In recent years, there is another stroke educational campaign called STROKE 112. Previous
      study had showed it has greater acceptance, since the number is easier to remember then
      letter, especially in non-English speaking countries.

      The investigators had conducted a hospital-based randomized study in 2019, which revealed
      that STROKE 112 had similar, but not superior effectiveness with FAST. However, more study is
      needed for community-based population.

      This study will compare and explore the effectiveness of two stroke educational campaigns,
      FAST and STROKE 112, on community-based population by using the questionnaire, in Yunlin,
      Taiwan. The result will been compared and analyzed with previous study, help us modify and
      enhance our current stroke educational program, shorten the prehospital delay, and improve
      outcomes of patients with acute stroke.

      The subjects will be randomized into either group: FAST or STROKE 112. Then the investigator
      will give a 15min eduacation. The evaluation will be arranged 5 days and 30 days after the
      first education, and the outcome is the recalling capacity of the stroke symptoms in the
      educational campaign.
