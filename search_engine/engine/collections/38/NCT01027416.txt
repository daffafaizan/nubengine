      which will be analyzed for ER/PR and HER2Neu expression. For patients that are ER positive,
      p53 staining will be done.

      Women presenting tumors with an Allred score of 3 or greater status will be approached to
      participate.

      Women will be randomized to either standard of care surgical therapy or a 4 week intervention
      of Tamoxifen 20mg daily for 4 weeks prior to surgery. During the intervention, blood draws
      will be done to measure levels of tamoxifen metabolites in the blood and test for
      polymorphisms that may decrease levels of active metabolites.

      Women will undergo two blood draws for PK/PD and one for pharmacogenomics. Tissue microarray
      (TMA) will be generated from resected tumors for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and proximity
      ligation assay (PLA) for measuring ER alpha-p53 interaction.

      Tumor tissue will be used for analyzing tamoxifen metabolites and estradiol levels. RNA and
      proteins from the tumors will be used for analyzing gene expression.
