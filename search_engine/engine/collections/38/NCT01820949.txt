    
      A PBM program will be implemented stepwise in four University Hospitals, with the intention
      to optimize preoperative hemoglobin concentration of patients and to standardize transfusion
      practice within hemotherapy. The PBM program includes 1) an algorithm with the aim to correct
      preoperative anemia in elective surgery, 2) a strict indication for the transfusion of red
      blood cells defined by the "Cross-sectional Guidelines for Therapy with Blood Components and
      Plasma Derivatives" for all surgical patients, and 3) a perioperative checklist for different
      blood-sparing techniques (e.g. cell-saver, normothermia, reduced blood samples, point-of-care
      diagnostics for bedside coagulation management).

      Primary endpoint: Safety of the use of PBM program will be determined by comparability of the
      composite outcome (in-hospital myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure, death of
      any cause, pneumonia and sepsis until discharge from hospital) between patients treated after
      implementation and patients treated before implementation (control cohort) of the PBM
      program.

      The primary composite endpoint defined as described above will be registered electronically
      by analysis of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) codes. The frequency of these events will be
      compared between PBM and control cohort stratified by center with a one-sided Mantel-Haenszel
      test in a non-inferiority setting with significance level of Î±=2.5% and a non-inferiority
      margin of 1% for the incidence of the composite endpoint.
