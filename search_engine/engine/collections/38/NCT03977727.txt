      post-prandial 1-hour plasma glucose level and system-based outcomes to NovoLog® insulin when
      used in the Medtronic mini Med 670G HCL system (operating in auto-mode) in patients with type
      1 diabetes. The investigator's hypothesis is that post prandial glucoses will be lower and
      time in range will be greater during the Fiasp® treatment period.

      Subjects will have a 2 week screening period, 14 week treatment period and 30 Day follow up
      period. After at least 7 weeks on treatment period one they will crossover to treatment
      period two on the opposite treatment for 7 additional weeks.
