      days. Subjects will wear the Sensor while going about their normal daily activities during
      the home use period. Subjects will not be able to see any glucose data. The devices will be
      removed at the completion of the final study visit.

      Data obtained from the Reader and reports generated by the system will not be used by the
      subject or the research team members to determine treatment. Subjects must adhere to their
      diabetes clinical management plan established prior to the study.

      No additional medical care will be provided to study subjects following study completion
      other than care related to the follow up and treatment of adverse events.
