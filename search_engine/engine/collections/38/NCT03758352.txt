      golden standard for many end-stage solid organ diseases. Ischemia and reperfusion injury is
      unavoidable during a liver transplantation. Remote ischemic preconditioning, a safe and
      feasible method, has previously been shown to reduce ischemia and reperfusion injury. This
      may have a similar effect in a liver transplantation setting. In the transplantation setting,
      focus of remote ischemic preconditioning has been on the donor. However, preconditioning of
      the recipient may be a better approach due to the mechanisms by which ischemic
      preconditioning protects against ischemia and reperfusion injury.

      The aim of this randomised, double-blinded clinical trial is to biochemically assess the
      liver function after application of remote ischemic preconditioning on the recipient.

      Methods 52 patients undergoing a liver transplantation, included in accordance to the
      inclusion criteria, will be allocated to an intervention group (rIC-group) and compared to a
      retrospective non-intervention control group (non-rIC group) consisting of 52 patients.
      Patients in the non-intervention group will also be included in accordance to the inclusion
      criteria. Within two hours before surgery, patients in the intervention group will be
      subjected to four rounds of five-minute inflations and five-minute deflations of a pneumatic
      tourniquet applied on the right leg.

      Follow-up time will be 30 days.

      Measurements The aim of this trial is to assess the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning
      on the extent of liver injury and inflammation as a result of ischemia and reperfusion
      injury. Assessment will be done by measurement of biomarkers relevant to liver function and
      liver injury.
