    
      All women with history of RIF (as defined by ESHRE) and who wish to undertake another
      assisted conception treatment cycle are invited to participate in the trial. Women will be
      randomised to two arms; one undergoing endometrial sampling and control. Women in the
      experimental arm will be subjected to endometrial scrapping with Pipelle biopsy catheter two
      times; on days 21 and 26 of the cycle prior to the IVF index cycle and after initiation of
      the GnRHa in the long agonist protocol. Women in the control group will undergo a placebo
      procedure using the uterine sound on the same days of the cycle like women in the
      intervention group.
