      that cytokines strongly stimulate adrenomedullin production and release.

      Adrenomedullin has been measured in a wide range of clinical researches. Of all conditions
      investigated, the greatest increment in plasma adrenomedullin has been observed in septic
      shock. It appears that AM is directly responsible for the hypotension characteristic of
      septic shock. Studies have shown that administration of AM and AMBP-1 before the onset of
      sepsis (i.e., pretreatment) prevents transition from the hyperdynamic phase to the
      hypodynamic phase in the progression of sepsis, attenuates tissue and organ damage, and
      reduces sepsis-induced mortality.

      Two groups described the effects of AM on the pituitary. Taken together, these studies
      suggest that AM has a role in inhibiting ACTH release.

      Mulder et al. first reported the stimulatory effects of adrenomedullin on insulin secretion
      from isolated rat islets. In direct contrast to this, Mart√≠nez et al. clearly demonstrated
      the inhibitory role of adrenomedullin on insulin secretion in vitro.
