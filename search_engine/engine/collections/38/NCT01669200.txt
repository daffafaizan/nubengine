      followed by six post-baseline visits. The control and placebo groups will each be comprised
      of ten subjects randomly assigned to the groups. The assessments at baseline will include
      concomitant medications, vital signs, height, and weight. In addition, subjects will complete
      a medical history questionnaire, and receive group instruction on incorporation of the study
      products into the diet from a registered dietitian. Study products will be dispensed at each
      visit in excess of requirements, and re-issued at every visit after measurement of the
      remaining product that subjects will be instructed to bring to every visit. The post-baseline
      study visits will include body weight and vital sign measurements, concomitant medications,
      dispensation of study products, group instruction by a registered dietitian, and an
      assessment for adverse events.

      Between study visits the subjects will receive a telephone call from the study coordinator to
      encourage compliance with the diet, and to ask about any adverse events. The study visits
      will conclude at week 24. The psychological tests conducted by clinicians at screening will
      be repeated during the cognitive testing visit.
