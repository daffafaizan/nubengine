      patients' insulin levels improves patient care. Patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital
      (BWH), staying on the General Medicine Service, who have Type 2 diabetes and who are not on
      IV insulin can participate in this study. Physicians and nurses will be taught new rules to
      care for diabetic patients, while in the hospital. Also, the BWH computer system will be
      updated to include these new rules for administering insulin. Patients who participate in the
      study will be randomly placed into one of two groups: one group that will be cared for by
      physicians and nurses who have learned these new rules for administering insulin; or the
      second group, who will receive diabetes care at BWH before the new rules were adopted. The
      study will last approximately 1 year.
