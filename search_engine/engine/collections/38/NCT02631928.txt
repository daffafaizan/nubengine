      to treat hyperglycaemia. Julphar Insulin 30/70 and Humininsulin® Profil III are both biphasic
      insulins, i.e. consist of a mixture of short-acting soluble insulin and intermediate-acting
      isophane insulin. The new insulin, Julphar Insulin 30/70, is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Profil
      III. Demonstration of similar absorption (PK) and effects (PD) are necessary to achieve
      market approval of Julphar Insulin 30/70.
