    
      A Phase II, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study on the effect of
      Aramchol on liver triglycerides concentration in patients with steatosis due to NAFLD or NASH

      The purpose of the study is to test whether Aramchol will reduce safely and effectively liver
      fat concentration in patients with NAFLD and NASH.

      Aramchol inhibits the liver enzyme Stearoyl Coenzyme A Desaturase (SCD). It reduces fatty
      acid synthesis while increasing fatty acid oxidation. It was shown to reduce liver fat in
      animal models with diet induced Fatty Liver. It has also marked hypocholesterolemic effects,
      mainly via upregulation of theABCA1 cholesterol transporter. It thus causes(incomplete) SCD
      inhibition while being antiatherogenic

      Primary purpose: Compare the changes in liver triglycerides concentration in the Aramchol
      versus the placebo arm following three month treatment.

      Secondary purpose: Comparing liver enzymes, markers of endothelial dysfunction, insulin
      resistance, SCD1 activity and cholesterol synthesis and lipid levels, between the Aramchol
      and the placebo arms.
