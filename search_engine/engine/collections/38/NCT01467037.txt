      routine administration at 2 and 4 months of age. From February 1, 2012 - May 31, 2014, we
      conducted prospective, active surveillance for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis at The
      Montreal Children's Hospital and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, located in
      Montreal, and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, located in Sherbrooke. Active
      surveillance was approved by Research Ethics Boards at each hospital.
