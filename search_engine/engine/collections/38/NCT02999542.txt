      factor, will have headphones placed on their ears after induction of anaesthesia. They will
      be randomised to two groups, one will receive music and the other just silence. The
      headphones will be removed just before waking the patient up. In the recovery room the
      child's behaviour will be observed and will be scored according to a validated score. The two
      groups will then be compared to see whether music makes a difference to the behaviour after
      anaesthesia.
