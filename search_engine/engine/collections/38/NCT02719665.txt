      aims to investigate the effect of a novel formulation of a nutritional supplement containing
      highly concentrated n-3 PUFA metabolites (SPM Emulsion) on the metabolo-lipidomic profile of
      healthy volunteers and patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease(PAD). Ten healthy volunteers
      and ten patients with PAD will participate in Part 1a, the "OMEGA-SPM-DOSE Study". A
      follow-up, placebo controlled, prospective study on the best dosing modality determined in
      Phase 1a will then take place in a PAD and OA population (n=12), Phase 1b - the
      "OMEGA-SPM-PAD Study". Specific measurements will include targeted metabolo-lipidomic
      profiling, established markers of inflammation, and functional monocyte and macrophage
      assays. The proposed studies have the potential to provide important new insights on the role
      of nutritional interventions in PAD.
