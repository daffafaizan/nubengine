    
      Principal objective

      To determine if leptospiral bacterial load is associated with severe evolution of the disease
      (organ failure, internal bleeding, death) in French West Indies.

      Secondary objective

        1. To identify demographic, clinical, biological, bacteriological, and genetic factors
           (HLA) associated with severe complications of leptospirosis (organ failure, internal
           bleeding, death).

        2. To identify demographic, clinical, biological, bacteriological, and genetic factors
           (HLA) associated with an altered quality of life after the acute phase of leptospirosis.

        3. To collect human biological samples to allow studies of the individual susceptibility to
           the infection (genetic polymorphisms, HLA).
