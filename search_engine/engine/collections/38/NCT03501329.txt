      In the Community Psychiatry of the town Holbaek part of Region West of The Region Sjaelland
      in eastern Denmark the WHO-5 Well-Being Index has for 5 years been used in order to obtain
      the patients personal evaluation of their actual quality of life. That has given the
      possibility of following changes during the treatment. The questionnaire is easy to
      understand and to use as part of a consultation. The patients will answer the 5 questions in
      a few minutes. The WHO-5 questionnaire is thoroughly evaluated internationally and described
      and used in many clinical situations also outside of psychiatry and fulfill measures of
      psychometric quality. With this work the intention was to try to answer often critical
      questions from our administration and from the press and in the society. There was no funding
      for the work.
