      them to become narrowed. This occurs because fat is first deposited on the inside walls of
      the arteries, then becomes hardened by fibrous tissue and calcium deposition forming a
      semi-hardened accumulation of material known as plaque. As this plaque grows, it narrows the
      channel within the artery and causes a reduction in blood and oxygen supply to the affected
      organ - such as the heart and brain. The investigators now understand that this process is
      caused by inflammation and activation of the immune cells over a period of time. It has been
      proposed that targeting these immune cells and reducing the levels of immune activation can
      protect against cardiovascular diseases.

      Previously it has been observed that consumption of fruit and vegetables rich in
      anti-oxidants can confer a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. The use of
      anti-oxidants experimentally has shown protective benefits against activation.
