      Department (ED) triage on patient perception of information delivery, overall patient
      satisfaction and ED efficiency. ED efficiency will be assessed by ED length of patient stay,
      ED left-without-being-seen and ED left during treatment rates.

      Participants who decide to take part in this study, will be asked questions by research
      staff, who will document responses on a secure iPAD device. The survey will ask participants
      how they feel about their health condition, the emergency department wait, the care they
      received in the emergency department and how satisfied the participant was with the care
      received.
