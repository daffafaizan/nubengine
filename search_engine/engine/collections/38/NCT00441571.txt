      177Lu-CYT-500 and determine the optimal antibody mass and dose of 177Lu to be used for
      further study. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics will also be assessed. Patients with
      histologically documented prostate cancer that is progressing following castration will be
      eligible. Two antibody masses will be explored in cohort 1 before dose escalation of the
      177Lu begins. If the two antibody masses show no difference in pharmacokinetics or
      biodistribution, then the lower of the doses will be used. The radiation dose will be
      escalated in subsequent cohorts. Dose escalation will be permitted when the last patient
      accrued to the previous cohort has demonstrated count recovery in cycle 1 such that DLT has
      not been defined.
