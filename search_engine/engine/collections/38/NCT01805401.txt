      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; a safe and non-invasive method for modulating
      the activity of specific brain regions) when applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is
      able to modulate decision-making and impulse control in healthy volunteers. We hypothesize
      that tDCS applied to the OFC, in comparison to sham tDCS, will significantly enhance
      decision-making and impulse control. For this study we will enroll 45 healthy individuals
      aged 18-60 years. These individuals will be assessed with a battery of computerized tasks as
      well as clinician-administered and self-reported questionnaires on depression and anxiety.
      Assessments will be carried out before and after a single 30-minute tDCS session.
