      symptomatic purposes, the goal is to decrease the volume overload. In these patients, loop
      diuretics are used in high doses, sometimes in combination with other classes of diuretics
      such as thiazides to achieve synergistic, faster and more effective action, and to combat
      diuretic's resistance. This use, well known to cardiologists and based on a rich
      pharmacology, more than 40 years old, lacks robust scientific data in real life. Current
      studies are mainly based on patients with renal insufficiency or limited to cardio-renal
      syndrome. The CARRESS-H study in 2012 is one of them. The protocol for the use of diuretics
      from this study was included in 2017 as a benchmark in a publication of the NEJM. It
      therefore seems necessary to consider the exercise of this protocol in the management of the
      decompensation of chronic cardiac heart failure. There is, to the investigator's knowledge,
      no similar study to test this protocol as a "real life" exercise.
