    
      Primary endpoint:

      The performance (efficacy) of each allergen will be evaluated in adult patients with
      suspected contact dermatitis, and in adult patients with a known or suspected sensitization
      to at least one of the seven allergens. Performance will be based on:

        -  Calculated concordance/discordance between T.R.U.E. Test Panel 3.2 allergens and their
           corresponding petrolatum or aqueous-based allergens.

        -  Calculated sensitivity and specificity for T.R.U.E. Test Panel 3.2 allergens.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To evaluate the safety of seven T.R.U.E. Test Panels 3.2 allergens (Gold sodium thiosulfate,
      Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate, Methyldibromoglutaronitrile, Bacitracin, Parthenolide, Disperse
      blue 106 and Bronopol) in adult subjects with suspected contact dermatitis ("consecutives"),
      and/or in adult subjects with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a current or
      previous positive patch test to one (or more) of these 7 allergens ("sensitives").
      Evaluations will be based on:

        -  The frequency and characterization of late and/or persistent reactions, tape-induced
           irritation at the test site, incomplete panel adhesion, and subject-reported sensations
           of itching or burning during the test period.

        -  The frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events.
