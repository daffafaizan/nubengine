    
      This study is designed as a two-group, randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness
      of the addition of exercise and health education to treatment as usual in improving drug
      treatment outcomes in 330 eligible and interested participants who provide informed consent
      at 8-10 sites across the nation. These participants will be randomized to one of two
      treatment arms: (1) Vigorous Intensity High Dose Exercise Augmentation (VIHD): Usual Care
      Augmented with Vigorous Intensity High Dose Exercise or (2) Health Education Intervention
      Augmentation (HEI): Usual Care Augmented with Health Education. This study will include
      individuals diagnosed with stimulant abuse or dependence (cocaine, methamphetamine,
      amphetamine or other stimulant, except caffeine or nicotine) who begin treatment while in a
      residential setting.
