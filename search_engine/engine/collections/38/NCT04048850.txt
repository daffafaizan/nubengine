      excluded from receiving direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment due to Illinois Medicaid
      restrictions. These sobriety and staging restrictions were recently lifted. However, due to
      these previous stringent requirements for sobriety, many patients were not able to be treated
      for HCV. This created a data gap for real-world outcomes of HCV treatment in people who use
      substances. This study presents a unique opportunity to provide patients with hepatitis C
      treatment and obtain much needed data on the use of elbasvir/grazoprevir in patients with
      substance use and other underrepresented comorbidities. Additionally, this study will
      determine if our current standard of care for the treatment of HCV is effective for patients
      with substance use.
