      care that will limit the impact of adverse effects related to hormone therapy treatment and
      improve their quality of life. The achievement of this objective is based on therapeutic
      education and nursing follow-up throughout the first year of treatment, which, thanks to
      active listening and coordination of the various players, will enable global and personalized
      patient care.
