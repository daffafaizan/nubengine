      of severely ill burn patients. Because a randomization would not be feasible in this setting,
      we will use a propensity analysis in matching patients receiving early surgery and those
      receiving late surgery. Secondary aims are to evaluate the impact of the timing of surgery on
      morbidity (organs failure, infections, sepsis) but also to assess the diagnostic and
      prognostic value of plasma and urine biomarkers in severely ill burn patients
