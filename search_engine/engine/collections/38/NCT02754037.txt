      steatohepatitis and in combination with MRI for detection, differentiation and quantitation
      of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis in correlation to liver biopsy. Patient
      enrolled in this will already have had their liver biopsy or will be undergoing liver biopsy
      as a part of their clinical care as determined by their provider and will not be getting
      biopsies solely to be enrolled in the study. Current treatment options for patients that
      liver biopsy is being performed are limited to lifestyle changes and vitamin E for patients
      without diabetes.
