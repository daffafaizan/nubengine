      effective. This procedure can generate pain and anxiety which are prevented by systematic
      prescription of analgesics and anxiolytics. To assess the benefit of hypnosis intervention,
      the investigators designed a monocentric prospective controlled randomised, single-blind
      study. Patients with acute and painful knee osteoarthritis, having an indication of lavage
      according to the rheumatologist, will be randomized to standard care, versus standard care
      and hypnosis. The hypothesis is that hypnosis intervention will decrease the level of pain
      during lavage, and the analgesics consumption during the week following the lavage. The
      sample size will be 100, 50 patients per group. Inclusion is scheduled for 18 months, and
      duration of the study will be 2 years. The main efficacy criterion is the pain score
      (assessed using VAS) difference between the 2groups; no interim analysis will be performed.
