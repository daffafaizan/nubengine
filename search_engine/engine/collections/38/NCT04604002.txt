    
      The objectives of this study are:

      1.) Compare the image quality between the predicate scan types and the corresponding
      investigational scan types.

      2. Compare the visibility of key anatomical vascular structures between the predicate scan
      types and the corresponding investigational scan types.

      3. Assess the agreement in identification of vascular abnormalities between the predicate
      scan types and the corresponding investigational scan types, where agreement is assessed by
      the vascular abnormalities identified from the predicate scan types.
