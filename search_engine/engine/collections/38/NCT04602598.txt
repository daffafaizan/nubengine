      disease affecting the submandibular and/or lacrimal glands. All patients will receive
      zanubrutinib orally at a dose of 80mg BID for 24 weeks.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that zanubrutinib treatment reduces
      reduces the volume of the submandibular and/or lacrimal glands on PET/MRI at week 24 compared
      to baseline.
