      intensive plasma PK sampling up to Day 7 (hour 144). In Part II, patients may continue to
      receive continuous oral rucaparib in 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all Group 1
      patients will be 600 mg BID. The first 2 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2)
      that enter Part II will receive a starting dose of 400 mg BID rucaparib; a lower dose of
      rucaparib may also be set based on PK results observed in Part I. If this initial starting
      dose is determined to be safe and tolerable as determined by real-time PK data and dose
      limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during the first 28 days of rucaparib, the starting dose
      of rucaparib may be increased in subsequent Group 2 patients. The starting dose for Group 2
      patients may also be lowered, based on the patients' real time PK and emerging safety data.
      The Sponsor and key clinical research organization (CRO) staff will review available adverse
      event, laboratory, and PK data to determine the starting dose for subsequent Group 2
      patients, as well as allowing intra-patient dose escalation of rucaparib after Cycle
      1.Treatment with rucaparib will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or other appropriate clinical reason for
      discontinuation.
