    
      We will study 10 women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no evidence of obstructive
      coronary artery disease.

      Procedures:

      Aerobic fitness: Incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a exercise bike to
      assess the maximal rate of oxygen consumption.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: To assess cardiac morphology and function. Cardiac
      perfusion imaging: Using MRI, we will assess the rate of uptake of a contrast media
      (gadolinium) at rest and in response to a vasodilating substance (adenosine) to evaluate
      myocardial perfusion reserve.

      Protocol:

      Participants will undergo aerobic fitness testing, cardiac MRI and perfusion imaging at
      baseline and following 8-weeks of regular exercise training.
