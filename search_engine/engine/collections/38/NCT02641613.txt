      plexus block. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups The first group -
      supraclavicular group - will receive an ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block via the
      supraclavicular approach, by injection of 30 ml of a mixture of ropivacaine 0.5 % +
      mepivacaine 1 %. The second group - retroclavicular group - will receive an ultrasound-guided
      brachial plexus block via the retroclavicular approach, by injection of 30 ml of a mixture of
      ropivacaine 0.5 % + mepivacaine 1 %. Primary outcome is success rate at 30 minutes after the
      injection defined as loss of sensation to pinprick in the forearm and hand. Secondary
      outcomes are: needling time, time to first analgesic request, postoperative opioid
      consumption, pain scores at 12 and 24 hours postoperatively, block-related complications, and
      patient satisfaction.
