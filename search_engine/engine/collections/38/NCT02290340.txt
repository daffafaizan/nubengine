      safety in children. The population to be enrolled is healthy preterm infants born between 32
      weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days gestation who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or other local guidelines. These subjects will not be
      receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group to begin collecting data on
      incidence rates of RSV medically attended lower respiratory illness (MA-LRI) and efficacy.
      Enrollment is planned at approximately 20 sites in the USA, Chile, and South Africa.
