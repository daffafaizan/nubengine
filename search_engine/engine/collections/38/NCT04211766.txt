      They either receive the dietary fiber supplement and fish oil supplement orally (PO) daily or
      they receive a fiber control and corn oil supplement daily for 30 days during the first
      intervention period. Then they enter a washout period for 60 days when they do not receive
      any treatment. After that they complete the second intervention period during which they
      receive the other intervention.
