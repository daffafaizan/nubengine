      respiratory mechanics, secretion removal, and gas exchange in mechanically ventilated
      patients; however, there are no recommendations on the best ventilator settings to perform
      the technique. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare six modes of VHI, concerning
      physiological markers of efficacy and safety criteria, in order to support the optimal VHI
      settings selection for mechanically ventilated patients.

      Methods: In a crossover study, every included mechanically ventilated patient underwent six
      modes of VHI in a randomized order: Volume Control Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (VC-CMV)
      with inspiratory flow = 20Lpm (VC-CMV20), VC-CMV with inspiratory flow = 50Lpm (VC-CMV50),
      Pressure Control Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (PC-CMV) with inspiratory time = 1s.
      (PC-CMV1), PC-CMV with inspiratory time = 3s. (PC-CMV3), Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
      with cycling off = 10% of peak inspiratory flow (PSV10), and PSV with cycling off = 25% of
      peak inspiratory flow (PSV25). The maximum expansion (tidal volume), expiratory flow bias
      criteria (inspiratory and expiratory flow patterns), over-distension (alveolar pressure),
      asynchronies and hemodynamic variables (mean arterial pressure and heart rate) were assessed
      during the interventions.
