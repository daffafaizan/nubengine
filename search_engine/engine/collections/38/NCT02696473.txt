      either the night before or the morning of the test session. They will have fasted blood taken
      before eating a portion of carrots with bread and butter. Further blood samples will be taken
      at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours. All urine and all stool samples (after 4 hours) will
      be collected up to 48 hours after the carrot dose. They volunteers will attend two test
      sessions and will be randomised to receive high and low doses of carrot. At least a week will
