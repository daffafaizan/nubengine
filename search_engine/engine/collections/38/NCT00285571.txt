      intake and body weight remains uncertain. In this study we propose to investigate the
      relative effects of dietary variety vs dietary fat on voluntary energy intake in adults. We
      will quantify and compare the effects of typical ranges of variety & fat intakes in the
      American diet on voluntary energy intake. The primary hypotheses to be tested are 1)an
      increasing availability of entree/side/snack/dessert variety offered will significantly
      increase voluntary energy intake in a dose-response fashion when other dietary factors known
      to influence energy intake are held constant. 2)The separate effects of dietary variety &
      dietary fat on energy intake will be similar.

      We anticipate that the results of this investigation will lead to a greater understanding of
      the relative importance of eating patterns versus macronutrient composition in the etiology
      of obesity, and more specifically, dietary variety versus dietary fat in determining energy
      intake. More importantly, it will help lay a foundation for improved dietary recommendations
      concerning weight loss and prevention of excess weight gain in adulthood
