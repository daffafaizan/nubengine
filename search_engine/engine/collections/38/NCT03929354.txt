      globally. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 30% of total global deaths are
      due to CVD, and approximately 6 million deaths result from cerebrovascular disease.

      A common cause of cerebrovascular disease is internal carotid artery stenosis. Despite recent
      advances in carotid artery revascularisation, risk factor modification remains the
      cornerstone of therapy for this devastating disease. According to the European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC), the lifestyle risk factors for vascular diseases include; cigarette
      smoking, physical inactivity, increased body mass index, and unhealthy diet, and stress,
      while the medical risk factors include; High blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and
      hyperlipidaemia. All these factors have been identified in several studies as significant
      modifiable risk factors that should be targeted for preventing morbidity and mortality
      resulting from cerebrovascular disease.

      Previous studies indicated that modifiable risk factor programmes can help cardiac patients
      to achieve their risk factor modification targets. However, to date there do not seem to be
      any studies assessing the outcomes of a multidisciplinary risk factor modification programme
      in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Our study will evaluate the impact of an intensive
      12-week, multidisciplinary risk factors modification programme on medical and lifestyle risk
      factors modification, as well as on risk reduction for stroke and cardiovascular events,
      among patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. We will compare these outcomes to
      that of standard care traditionally provided to this high-risk patient group.
