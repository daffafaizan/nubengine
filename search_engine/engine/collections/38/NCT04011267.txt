      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot care
      by international consensus with no foot exercises) or an intervention group that will perform
      exercises at home, three times a week, through the SOPeD (Diabetic Foot Guidance System)
      software for 12-weeks. The exercise program is customized during the performance by a
      perceived effort scale reported by the participant.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 3 different times to access the effect of the intervention:
      baseline and 12 weeks, for all outcomes; and 24 weeks, for follow-up reasons for all
      outcomes. The following outcomes will be assessed in all times: (1) diabetic neuropathy
      symptoms and signs by Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, (2) fuzzy score of the
      neuropathy severity, (3) foot-ankle kinematics during gait (infrared cameras) (4) foot-ankle
      joint moment during gait (infrared cameras and force plate), (5) plantar pressure
      distribution during gait, (6) tactile (monofilaments), (7) vibration sensitivity (tuning
      fork), (8) foot health and functionality by the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, (9) Foot
      isometric strength (pressure plate measurement), (10) functional balance reach test.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention will increase the perception of the
      tactile and vibratory sensitivity of the foot, reduce the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy,
      increase the strength of the foot muscles, increase the functional balance score, decrease
      the severity of the diabetic neuropathy (fuzzy score), decrease the number of neuropathy
      symptoms, promote a more physiological foot rollover with a redistribution of plantar
      pressure during gait, as well as increase foot-ankle mobility after 12-weeks of intervention.
      There will be also beneficial biomechanical changes during gait, such as: (1) increase in the
      ankle extensor moment and ankle concentric power in the propulsion phase and (3) increase in
      the ankle flexor moment and ankle eccentric power in the load phase.
