    
      During a period of two years (from January 2013 to July 2015) 35 patients with acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
      refused endotracheal intubation after failing NIV and were treated with extracorporeal Co2
      removal plus NIV as last resort therapy.

      The collected data of these patients will be retrospectively matched with data obtained from
      35 historical controls who received conventional treatment with endotracheal intubation. The
      study will retrospectively compare intubation rate, acid base homeostasis, norepinephrine
      requirements (in the patients who due to clinical conditions were under norepinephrine before
      starting extracorporeal Co2 removal ) and coagulation parameters.
