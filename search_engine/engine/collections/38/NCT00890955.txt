    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      This study will follow the 3+3 design with the following dose levels:

        -  Dose Level -1: Amrubicin 20mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 1: Amrubicin 25mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 2: Amrubicin 30mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 3: Amrubicin 35mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 4: Amrubicin 40mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

      Dose escalation starts from dose level 1.

      Amrubicin will be given as a slow IV push or infusion over approximately 5 minutes once daily
      for 3 consecutive days starting on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.

      Cyclophosphamide will be given at a fixed dose as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 1
      of each 21 day cycle (following amrubicin).
