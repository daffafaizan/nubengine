      plus paclitaxel in women with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the
      activity of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of
      trastuzumab and paclitaxel in this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms. Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90
      minutes followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 0. Paclitaxel is repeated every 3 weeks
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm I: Patients
      receive trastuzumab subcutaneously (SC) weekly starting day 7. Arm II: Patients receive
      trastuzumab SC twice weekly starting day 7. Treatment with trastuzumab SC continues for 48
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
