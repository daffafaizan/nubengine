      essential and essential. This assessment could be performed by a non-invasive MRI method.

      The main objective of this study is to show that the measured perfusion-related scattering
      value (D *) is related to the hepatic fibrosis stage.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Evaluation of infusion fraction (f) and fibrosis stage.

        -  Evaluation of molecular diffusion (D) and fibrosis stage.

        -  Evaluation of ADC and fibrosis stage.

        -  Assess whether there is a link between the etiology of fibrosis and the value of the
           diffusion.
