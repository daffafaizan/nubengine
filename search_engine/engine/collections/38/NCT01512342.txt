      fatigue syndrome (CFS), it is examined whether physical behavior and health status of
      patients with CFS improve in response to a pacing self-management program. The effects of
      pacing will be compared with those observed when applying relaxation therapy to patients with
      CFS.

      According to the power calculation, 36 patients fulfilling the 1994 Centre for Disease
      Control and Prevention criteria for the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) will be
      randomized to either 3 weeks of pacing activity self-management or relaxation therapy. Both
      treatment groups will receive 3 weekly sessions spread over 3 consecutive weeks. All
      treatments will be delivered by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. One treatment
      session lasts for about 45 minutes each.

      Outcome measures include the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Medical
      Outcomes Short Form 37 Health Status Survey (SF-36), Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), CFS
      Symptom List and autonomic activity at rest and following 3 activities of daily living
      (writing a standardized test on a laptop computer, ironing, and climbing 26 flights of
      stairs). For measuring autonomic activity, the Nexus 10 device (Mind Media, the Netherlands)
      will be used. Skin conductance, body temperature, heart rate, blood volume pressure and heart
      rate variability will be measured continuously in real time during a 2 minutes period, with
      the patient sitting on a chair (back supported and hands resting on legs). Electrodes will be
      placed on the left hand in all patients.
