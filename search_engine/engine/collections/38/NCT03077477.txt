    
      The Phase 1 study, which will assess the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      orally-administered AMXT 1501 dicaprate in normal healthy male volunteers.

      The study is comprised of a total of 8 cohorts; 4 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, 1 Food
      Effect (FE) Crossover cohort, and 3 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Tablets will be
      administered after an overnight fast (10 hours) with at least 250 mL water. No food will be
      administered (exception for "fed" subjects, see below) for one hour thereafter.

      Each cohort will have a total 6 subjects: SAD and MAD (2 subjects receiving placebo and 4
      subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate); and FE crossover (6 subjects receiving active
      AMXT 1501 dicaprate).

      SAD cohorts are defined as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: One placebo and one AMXT 1501 dicaprate subject will be treated as sentinel
           subjects receiving one tablet each of their assigned treatment. Assuming no intolerance
           is noted after at least 3 days, the remaining cohort subjects (placebo, 1 subject and
           AMXT 1501 dicaprate, 3 subjects) will be treated.

        -  Cohort 2: 2 subjects 2 placebo each and 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each

        -  Cohort 3: 2 subjects 4 placebos each and 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each

        -  Cohort 4: 2 subjects 8 placebos each and 4 subjects 8 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each

      FE Crossover:

      â€¢ Cohort 5: 6 new subjects will be randomized to a fed (n=3 standard meal) or fasted (n=3)
      group and administered one dose lower of the maximum tolerated AMXT 1501 dose in the previous
      SAD cohorts. First dose and accompanying assessments will be referred to as Period 1.
      Subjects will then crossover to the opposite diet plan (fed or fasted) and receive a second
      administration of study treatment at the same dose level. The second dose and assessments are
      referred to as Period 2. There will be a 7-day washout between doses administered in Periods
      1 and 2.

      MAD cohorts will receive dosing once daily for 14 consecutive days. Dosing will be contingent
      on adequate tolerance in Cohorts 1-5.

        -  Cohort 6: 2 subjects 2 placebos each; 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each

        -  Cohort 7: 2 subjects 4 placebos each; 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each

        -  Cohort 8: 2 subjects 8 placebos each; 4 subjects 8 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each
