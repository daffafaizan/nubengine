      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and 4-year disease-free survival of patients with locally
           advanced carcinoma of the urothelium undergoing radical cystectomy treated with
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine followed by
           cisplatin, gemcitabine, and ifosfamide.

      Secondary

        -  Compare perioperative morbidity and mortality of patients treated with this regimen vs
           historical standards.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising ifosfamide IV over 3 hours on
      days 1-4, doxorubicin IV on day 3, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 2 and 4, and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 7-12 or until blood counts recover. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 3 courses. Patients then receive cisplatin IV,
      gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes, and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for a total of 4-6 courses. Four to six weeks after the completion of all
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo cystectomy.

      Patients are followed at 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 30 months and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-49 patients will be accrued for this study within 16-25
      months.
