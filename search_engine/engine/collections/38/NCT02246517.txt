      block NMDA receptors. Nitrous oxide, an inhalant agent used extensively In anesthesia, also
      have antagonist property of NMDA receptors. The investigators hypothesize that prolonged
      treatment with N2O can alleviate chronic neuropathic pain of different causes (e.g. diabetic
      neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia etc.). In order to examine our theory we Will recruit 40
      patients aged 18-65 that suffer from chronic neuropathic pain. The patients will be divided
      to two groups of which half will receive treatment with N2O and half with placebo (pure O2)
      as a repeated weekly treatment for 4 weeks. At the beginning of the each session the patient
      will be asked to fill questionnaires regarding their pain quality and severity
