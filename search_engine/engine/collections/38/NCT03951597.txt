      metastases and lose the opportunity for surgical resection. For patients with unresectable
      ICC who have been in stages IIIb and IV (AJCC/UICC, V2, 2018), the survival time is less than
      4 months, and there is currently no standard treatment. The Gemox chemotherapy (oxaliplatin +
      gemcitabine) has been used in the treatment of advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but
      the efficacy is still unsatisfactory. Lenvatinib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor,
      the main targets including VEGFR1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-4, PDGFRÎ±, RET(ret
      proto-oncogene ), KIT(KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), have anti-angiogenic
      effects, have been proven effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, monoclonal
      antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) have shown remarkable therapeutic
      effects in the treatment of various solid tumors. Combined with other means such as
      chemotherapy and targeted drugs is an important direction to improve the therapeutic effect
      of immunological checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the
      effects and safety of Gemox chemotherapy combined with Lenvatinib and immune checkpoint
      inhibitor PD-1 antibody (JS001) for patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.
