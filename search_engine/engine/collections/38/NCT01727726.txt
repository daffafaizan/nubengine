    
      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole (flexible dose)
      as adjunctive therapy to an assigned known anti-depressant in depressed subjects. The trial
      consists of a continuous 18-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up.
      Subjects who complete all trial visits through the Week 18 visit may be offered entry into an
      optional open-label rollover trial.
