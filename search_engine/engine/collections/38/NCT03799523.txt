      position & minimize variability of port films thus reducing systematic error. The primary
      objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of using surface imaging to combine
      an ideally gated treatment planning CT and verification images timed to the breathing cycle,
      quantified as the total within-subject variation of the measured location relative to current
      methods of radiation delivery not using this approach. The secondary objective is to
      demonstrate the superiority of specialized light-based surface imaging for daily radiation
      set-up without tattoos compared to standard-of-care methods with regard to the total
      within-subject variation of the measured location determined by weekly port films during a
      course of radiation for breast cancer.
