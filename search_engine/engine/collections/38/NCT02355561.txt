    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence crossover
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and
      single-center study of JNJ-54861911. The duration of study will be approximately of 7 weeks
      per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study
      commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 3 single-dose treatments, either
      JNJ-54861911 formulation 1 [reference] or JNJ-54861911 formulation 2 [test] under fed or
      fasted condition), in subsequent 3-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 7
      days); and End-of-Study (up-to 14 days after last study drug administration). All the
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 treatment sequences. In fasted
      conditions, study drug will be administered following a 10-hour overnight fast. In fed
      conditions, participants will also fast from food for 10 hours, but will consume a high
      fat/high calorie breakfast within a 30-minute period. Study drug will be administered 30
      minutes after the start of breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4
      hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of
      two formulations of JNJ-54861911 (test and reference) will be evaluated primarily.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
