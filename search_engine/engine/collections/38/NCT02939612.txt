      accompanied by a multitude of stressors for the patients and their support network.
      Uncertainty of outcome and invasive medical procedures with aversive side effects are not
      uncommon, and while people differ widely in how they experience and cope with such
      challenges, cancer related distress including anxiety, depression, worry and rumination is
      prevalent. With multiple domains of function impacted it is also not surprising that quality
      of life (QoL) often is diminished.

      Stress management interventions can facilitate adjustment to cancer, including reduced
      distress and improved quality of life. Unfortunately, many people with cancer do not have the
      strength or opportunity to attend groups or in-person interventions.

      This study will therefore test the effect of an app for stress management among patients with
      different cancer diagnosis. The app contains 10 modules distributed over five weeks, focusing
      on education of different techniques for reduction of stress and stress reduction exercises.

      The app was tested in a feasibility pilot study among 25 patients with a variety of cancer
      diagnoses and is now being tested in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 175
      cancer survivors. The participants were randomly assigned to use the 10 module app or to a
      control group that receive treatment as usual, and will be followed with repeated measures
      over 12 months.
