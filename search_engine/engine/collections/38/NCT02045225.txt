      intervention for MSM. This intervention will build upon empirically supported interventions
      to reduce HIV risk among MSM and cognitive-behavioural therapy to reduce social anxiety. This
      pilot study will serve 3 related major objectives: 1) to provide data on the acceptability
      and feasibility of the intervention administered, 2) to provide pilot data testing the
      intervention, and 3) to provide data that will allow Dr. Hart and his team to apply to CIHR
      for a Phase II trial that will test the efficacy of the intervention relative to HIV
      prevention interventions that do not reduce social anxiety or substance use in sexual
      situations among MSM.

      Participants attend 4 assessment sessions, during which they complete a series of interviews
      and questionnaires regarding social anxiety, substance use, and sexual risk behaviours.
      Participants also attend 10 sessions of counselling, where a therapist seeks to help the
      participant work towards reducing his anxiety in social and sexual situations and try to
      better manage his use of alcohol and drugs in sexual situations. The participant undergoes a
      baseline assessment, followed by 10 weekly counselling sessions, a post-treatment assessment,
      and 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.
