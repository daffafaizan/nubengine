      Cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1) are found in several tissues such as brown adipose tissue
      (BAT). Endocannabinoids and CB1 receptors participate in the control of lipid and glucose
      metabolism, and blockage of CB1 receptors has been found to improve metabolic factors linked
      to obesity and cardiovascular disease, making CB1 antagonists potential drugs against obesity
      and diabetes.

      In this study the investigators use a PET radiotracer [18F]FMPEP-d2, which binds to CB1
      receptors in vivo, to quantify the CB1 receptor density in BAT, white adipose tissue, muscle
      and the brain. This study is done once in warm conditions and once during controlled cold
      exposure. To verify whether the subject has metabolically active BAT, an additional PET scan
      with the radiotracer [18F]FDG is performed.
