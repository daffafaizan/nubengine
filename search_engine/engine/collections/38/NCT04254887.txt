      at 47.1%. A large number of literatures refered that duodenal papillary diverticulum is a
      high risk factor for postoperative complications and recurrence of choledocholithiasis . Till
      now, there have been no randomized controlled trials to explore the effect of nipple balloon
      dilatation (EPLBD) on the treatment and prognosis of patients with choledocholithiasis
      complicated with periampullary diverticula (found during ERCP).
