    
      Objectives The overarching aim of the study is to stimulate the hypothalamus-cognitive brain
      network to improve insulin sensitivity and eating behavior.

      Specific Objectives

        1. Implement tDCS stimulation compared to sham stimulation in overweight and obese adults
           to assess the impact on eating behavior, cognition and metabolism.

        2. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation of the hypothalamus-cognitive
           network has a causal effect on metabolism.

        3. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation has a significant effect on brain
           functional connectivity and diffusion parameters.
