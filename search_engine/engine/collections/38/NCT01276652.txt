      sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      protocol enrolls acutely ill medical patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The
      feasibility of assessing sleep and circadian rhythmicity through the use of continuous
      bedside polysomnography and the measurement of core body temperature and urinary hormonal
      levels at frequent intervals will be explored. As a secondary goal, the feasibility of
      delivering routine care according to classical day/night routines, and of employing various
      noise and light reduction strategies at night, will be explored in a subset of subjects.
