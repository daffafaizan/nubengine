      cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthwashes to assess changes in the threshold cycle value of
      the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 oropharyngeal saliva sample, in patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19 and with symptomatology compatible with the disease. A randomized double-blind pilot
      clinical trial (evaluator and patients) will be developed in patients with a diagnosis of
      COVID-19 and symptoms of the disease. The experimental group will perform a single rinse with
      a mouthwash containing Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) while the placebo group will perform
      the same rinse, but with a harmless liquid that will act as a placebo. The study will be
      carried out in the Zaragoza III Health Sector, with patients belonging to the Zaragoza II
      Health Sector, collaborating with the "Seminario" health center and the Lozano Blesa Clinical
      University Hospital (HCULB). This project will be carried out in accordance with the CONSORT
      guidelines for clinical trials.
