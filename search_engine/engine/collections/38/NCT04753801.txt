      increase a person's positive affect and optimism. The BPS has been used in different forms
      (writing vs. imagining/visualizing vs. writing + imagining/visualizing the best possible
      self). However, it remains unclear which 'ingredients' are necessary to let the BPS unfold
      its effects. This online study aims to determine the relevant 'ingredients' to make the best
      possible self (BPS) intervention most efficacious. Since mindfulness interventions have
      recently indicated promising effects on positive and negative affect, another goal of this
      study is to test whether the BPS's efficacy can be enhanced by including aspects of
      mindfulness.
