      diabetes health promotion intervention among participants recruited from rural churches
      located in the southern United States. The intervention, called Project Power, is a
      culturally relevant, church-based diabetes education program that was developed by the
      American Diabetes Association (ADA). Participating churches were randomized to experimental
      and control groups using random numbers tables having numerical parity no greater than 2.
      Since an individual church is the unit of randomization, all of the participants in that
      church received the same treatment condition. Churches randomized to the intervention group
      received the health promotion program, and those designated to the control group received an
      educational brochure. Recruitment, data collection and intervention delivery, for the
      intervention group, occurred on the church grounds.
