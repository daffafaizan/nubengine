      for the diagnosis of PPLs without radiographic fluoroscopy.Bronchoscopes with a 3.0-mm distal
      end diameter and a 1.7-mm working channel diameter are used (BF-Y0058;Olympus).The final
      diagnoses are established by pathological evidence from biopsy or cytology specimen including
      bronchoscopy or other procedures,microbiological analysis and clinical follow-up.The study is
      designed as a single center prospective randomized controlled trial.The participating center
      is Department of endoscopy, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
      China.Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to UTB-VBN-EBUS-X-ray group and UTB-VBN-EBUS group
      based on a randomization schedule.The study is expected to enroll 200 patients with 100
      patients of each group.
