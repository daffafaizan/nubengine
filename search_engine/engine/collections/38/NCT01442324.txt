      (IRE) as the sole treatment of nodules not considered treatable by resection or thermal
      ablation.

      This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an
      alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with
      particular reference to metastatic liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, where the current
      therapeutic arsenal is inadequate or counter-indicated.

      To perform the IRE procedure the IRE NanoKnifeâ„¢ System (AngioDynamics) will be used.
