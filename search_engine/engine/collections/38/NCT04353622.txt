      functional disabilities. The majority of patients after stroke need rehabilitation to gain
      independence in daily life as the first target. Therefore, different treatment approaches are
      used in stroke rehabilitation.

      The use of technology in stroke rehabilitation has become very common in recent years.
      Robotic devices used in rehabilitation enhance the healing process by giving patients more
      intensive and task-oriented exercises. A lot of systematic and meta-analysis studies have
      shown that robot-assisted devices provide positive motor recoveries, especially in the
      treatment of upper extremities. However, the optimal timing, duration, and dose of robotic
      rehabilitation that should be applied after stroke remain uncertain.

      In the light of this information, this study examines the effects of the robotic device
      produced for upper limb rehabilitation on daily life activities and motor function.
