      been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of patients with polyarticular
      JIA. However, many patients experience primary or secondary response failure, suggesting that
      individualization of treatment regimens may be beneficial. It has been shown that the
      clinical response to two anti-TNFalpha biological agents (infliximab, adalimumab) closely
      follows the trough drug levels and the presence of antibodies directed against the drugs.
      This study was undertaken to investigate whether serologic monitoring of etanercept
      bioavailability and immunogenicity in individual patients with JIA would be useful in
      optimizing treatment regimens to improve efficacy and tolerability
