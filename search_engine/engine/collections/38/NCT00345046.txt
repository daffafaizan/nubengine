      Structure:

      This is a randomized, double-masked prospective study. The study medications will be masked
      and randomized by the outpatient pharmacy at Indiana University Hospital.

      Duration:

      Treatment duration: The duration of each subject's participation will be for up to 2 months
      after surgery. One hundred and two subjects will be enrolled over a twelve-month time span.

      Controls:

      Examiner, staff, and subjects are masked. Parallel group comparison.

      Dosage/Dose Regimen/Instructions:

      Subjects scheduled for glaucoma and/or cataract surgery will be recruited. Subjects may not
      be currently on any steroid or ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy for
      a minimum of 6 weeks prior to surgery. Subjects will be randomized to receive a dose of Pred
      Forte 1% (Allergan), Econopred Plus 1% (Alcon) or prednisolone acetate 1% (Falcon) four times
      a day starting immediately after finishing the surgery for two weeks, then twice a day for
      two more weeks. After 1 month of therapy subjects will stop or continue steroid treatment
      based on clinical findings. No other subconjunctival steroid or ointment will be used
      intra-operatively or post-operatively. The eye drop will be instilled per labeling
      instructions.
