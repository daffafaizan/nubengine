      Optimal Primary Schedule of 3 Recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) Anthrax Vaccines
      Administered in Two Intramuscular Doses to Healthy Adults aged 18 to 50 years. The targeted
      number of subjects is 270.The study objectives are:To confirm the safety and tolerability of
      2-dose regimens of 100 g rPA vaccines (3 products) administered by the intramuscular (IM)
      route to healthy adultsTo describe the immunologic responses to 2-dose regimens of 3 rPA
      vaccines and to compare the responses to those following administration of Anthrax Vaccine
      Adsorbed (AVA or BioThraxTM), the currently available vaccine. The primary immunologic
      outcome is the proportion of volunteers in each group that mounts an antibody response
      (defined as a 4-fold or greater increase from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination of anti-rPA
      IgG antibody with a minimal concentration of 10 Âµg/ml as measured by ELISA). Secondary
      outcomes are time to peak response and GMC of anti-PA antibody at peak for each group. In
      addition, the following immunologic assays will be performed: toxin neutralization assay,
      oral fluid ELISA, antibody avidity, IgG subclasses, and B-cell memory,T-cell memory and
      effector subpopulationsThis is a two center study; in which 270 healthy adults aged 18 to 50
      years are randomly assigned to 1 of 9 groups; knowledge of rPA product received is
      double-masked, but schedule and receipt of AVA are unmasked. The duration of study
      participation is 12 months per volunteer following a screening period of no more than 30
      days: administration over a 1- to 4-week period of two doses of IM rPA or 3 doses of SQ AVA
      with 12-14 follow-up visits. A subset of the approximately 45 volunteers who have agreed to
      participate in the special immunology subgroup (those with continued antibody responses at 1
      year) will be offered extended participation beyond 1 year in which blood is drawn at 18
      months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years for examination of long-term immune responses.
