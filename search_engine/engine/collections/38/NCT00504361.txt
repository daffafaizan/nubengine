      material) for the study of the genetic basis of lung disease. The study population will
      include individuals with known lung diseases and controls without lung disease. Individuals
      in the study population will be individuals at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar (HMC), as
      well as other individuals recruited for this study. In this protocol, researchers will survey
      medical records of patients with chronic lung disease, in order to study the clinical
      characteristics of these individuals, and the researchers will collect blood to evaluate the
      genetic characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases including asthma, and COPD
      (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. The researchers
      will also collect blood samples of individuals without lung disease to serve as control.

      This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical
      Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0508008095, entitled,
      "Collection of Blood for Gene Expression/Genomic Studies in Individuals with Chronic Lung
      Diseases", ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical College - New York.
