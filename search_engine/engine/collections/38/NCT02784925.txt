      weight. Fatty liver (FL) is commonly associated with alcohol or metabolic syndrome (diabetes,
      hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia), but can also be due to any one of many causes. Most
      people were detected from serum lipid abnormalities in the physical examination, and
      confirmed as the fatty liver disease by ultrasound imaging. In some previous studies,
      ultrasound was reported to provide an accurate and reliable measurement tool for the
      thickness measurements of subcutaneous adipose tissue. This method can overcome some
      limitations of the skinfold thickness measurements. Ultrasound (US) B mode image is an
      alternative method to measure tissue structure and has proven to be an accurate technique to
      measure subcutaneous fat thickness. However, pressing the transducer onto the skin with too
      much force will significantly reduce the subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. In this
      study, a force controlled system combined with US transducer was used for 3D subcutaneous fat
      imaging and reconstruction. Finally, the correlations between body fat percentage and
      subcutaneous fat in steatosis patients have been investigated. The body fat percentage was
      determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, GE Lunar iDXA canner) and bioelectrical
      impedance analysis (BIA, Omronï¼ŒHBF-370), and then, the correlation between body fat
      percentage and subcutaneous adipose tissue in normal and steatosis patients have been
      evaluated.
