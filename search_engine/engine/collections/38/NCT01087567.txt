      control faster than any other treatment regimen. However, it is typically used as the
      treatment of last resort in T2DM. In this study, the investigators offer a novel approach to
      use insulin as the initial therapy in new-onset T2DM with the aim of determining its efficacy
      toward producing lasting glucose control.

      Hypothesis: Treating newly diagnosed T2DM patients with insulin therapy versus standard of
      care for a short period of time will lead to improvement in glycemic control that is durable
      beyond the length of time taking the insulin and it may improve beta cell function.

      Primary endpoints: Time to need rescue therapy, Need for rescue therapy at all time points.
      A1C change at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

      Secondary endpoints: Mean glucose and mean fasting glucose at 3, 6, 12 months. C-peptide,
      HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, A1C the same time points, OGTT at week 12 and 56. Total number of
      hypoglycemic events (minor and major) and tolerability based on side effects.

      Treatment arm: Weight based protocol of insulin Glargine and Glulisine. Control arm: oral
      medications per ADA 2009 recommended treatment algorithm. Rescue group available for both
      arms after initial 12 weeks.
