    
      It is an open-label , single group, multi-center study. At around 30 investigate sites, 500
      dyslipidemic Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent, whose
      TG â‰¥1.70 mmol/L (150mg/dl) and <5.65mmol/L (500mg/dl) after at least 2 month statin
      monotherapy with standard dose will be enrolled. After at least 2 month statin monotherapy
      with standard dose, patients having high TG will be recruited and given statin-fenofibrate
      combination therapy for 8 weeks. Several lipid parameters and safety parameters will be
      compared between baseline, after 4 weeks treatment and after 8 weeks treatment. Primary
      efficacy endpoint is the percentage of TG decrease before and after 8 weeks treatment.
      Secondary endpoints on efficacy are the absolute change and the percent of change on TC,
      LDL-C, HDL-C, apoA1, apoB and apoB/apoA1 of baseline, after 4 weeks treatment and 8 weeks
      treatment, absolute change and percentage of change of hsCRP from baseline to 8 weeks of
      treatment. Second endpoints on safety is the incidence of AE/SAE, change on CK, ALT, AST, BUN
      and Cr before and after treatment and the number of clinical meaningful abnormal change
      defined as ALT or AST >3ULN, or CK >10ULN, or BUN >1.5ULN or Cr >1.5ULN. Other Arm type is a
      self comparator
