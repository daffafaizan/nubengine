      condition is now thought to be the commonest cause of secondary hypertension, with the
      prevalence ranging up to 10-15 % of all hypertensives. Identification of patients with PA
      allows for specific treatment, for instance unilateral adrenalectomy in case of an
      aldosterone-producing adenoma or the administration of an aldosterone-receptor antagonist in
      case of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

      Since the introduction of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) as a screening tool for PA in
      1981, there has been considerable debate about the diagnostic value. The values for
      aldosterone and renin are highly dependent on many factors, including posture, time of day
      and medication. Also, the cut-off values for the identification of PA remain controversial.

      This study aims to evaluate the test characteristics of the ARR in a population of patients
      with therapy-resistant hypertension, the dependence of the ARR on medication type and the
      predictive value on the response on eplerenone, a selective aldosterone-receptor antagonist.
