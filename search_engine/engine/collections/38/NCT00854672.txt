      sarcoidosis. In this longitudinal study the changes in prevalence of exercise intolerance,
      reduced muscle strength and fatigue will be established in a two-year follow-up. Also the
      relation between these physical impairments in time and other clinical parameters, such as
      QOL, will be established.

      Study design: sarcoidosis patients referred to the ild care team of outpatient clinic of the
      department of Respiratory Medicine of the MUMC and also participated in the baseline study
      between November 2008 and September 2009 will be included in this longitudinal study. A
      six-minute walk test and peripheral muscle strength measurements (included in the regular
      clinical work-up of sarcoidosis patients) will be performed under supervision of a physical
      therapist at the department of physical therapy of the MUMC. Moreover, the patients will be
      asked to complete the WHOQOL-bref questionnaire and the Fatigue Assessment Scale. A maximum
      of 124 patients will be included.
