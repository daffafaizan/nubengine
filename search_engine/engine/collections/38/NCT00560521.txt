      the group of patients using the anti-TB standard regimen to that using the anti-TB standard
      regimen AND adjuvant treatment of physical therapy during four weeks.

        -  Control group: The patients received rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide
           daily(anti-TB standard regimen)

        -  Interventional group: The patients received anti-tb standard regime and Continuous
           Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 3 times a week for 30 minutes with positive expiratory
           end pressure of 10 cmH2O.

      Evaluation of the pleural effusion size: a helicoidal thoracic computed tomography (CT) was
      carried out in all patients enrolled. The valuation was conducted by two radiologists blinded
      for the treatment used, specifically trained for the purpose of the study.
