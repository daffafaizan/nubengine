      at Clear Passage (CP) with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO). These patients have
      completed multiple questionnaires as a standard of care for outcome monitoring in the clinic
      setting, no new data will be collected. The second segment is a prospective observational,
      online questionnaire based study of subjects with a history of SBO not treated at CP. Data on
      the impact of quality of life (QOL) over time of subjects not treated at CP will be assessed
      using the same questionnaire used as standard of care in the clinic twice, 90 days apart.
      This will be accomplished using the NIH Assessment Center, with subjects able to complete the
      questionnaires with ease via the Assessment Center. As this segment is observational, there
      is minimal risk to these subjects. The data obtained from the untreated subjects will allow
      for reporting of overall impact on QOL in this population, data that is not available, as
      well as provide a control group for assessment of improvement for interventions for SBO.
