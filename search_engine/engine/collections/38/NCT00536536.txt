      provides a proven and effective treatment service for childhood obesity and is one of only a
      few specialist centres in the UK. The clinic service is based around a multidisciplanary team
      comprising: consultant; specialist nurses; dietitian: exercise specialist. This pilot study
      examines the feasibility of transferring the hospital clinic to a nurse led primary care
      setting in preparation for a full RCT. The study involves training a practice nurse to
      deliver the service in primary care alongside a dietitian and exercise specialist. Initial
      work will collect the views of staff delivering the hospital service and patients and parents
      which will enable us to identify the components of the service that will be needed to run a
      primary care based service. As a pilot we will focus on: (a) whether weight management is
      equally good in primary care; (b) whether recruitment, patient retention and satisfaction can
      be improved in primary care and (c) what data need to be collected for a full economic
      assessment.

      Children will be recruited to the trial by GP via electronic referral form designed by the
      study team. Families of children fulfilling recruitment criteria (age: 5-16, BMIâ‰¥98th
      centile) will be sent a study pack and reply form, all those who do not respond will be
      contacted by the COCO consultant to clarify willingness to participate. Families declining
      participation will follow usual care pathway. Recruited families will be randomised to one of
      two primary care clinics or COCO clinic.
