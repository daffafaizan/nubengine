      Primary

        -  To compare the efficacy of sodium thiosulfate vs observation in preventing hearing loss
           in young patients receiving cisplatin for the treatment of newly diagnosed germ cell
           tumor, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or other
           malignancy.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the mean change in hearing thresholds for key frequencies in these patients.

        -  To compare the incidences of cisplatin-related grade 3 and 4 nephrotoxicity and grade 3
           and 4 cytopenia in these patients.

        -  To compare the event-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the association of two key gene mutations (TPMT and COMT) with the
           development of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior cranial
      radiation (yes vs no), age (< 5 years vs ≥ 5 years) and duration of cisplatin infusion (< 2
      hours vs ≥ 2 hours). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (sodium thiosulfate): Patients receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes
           beginning 6 hours after the completion of each cisplatin infusion. Treatment with sodium
           thiosulfate continues until the completion of cisplatin therapy.

        -  Arm II (observation): Patients do not receive sodium thiosulfate.

      Patients undergo audiological assessment at baseline, prior to each course of cisplatin, and
      then at 4 weeks and 1 year after the last course of cisplatin or other cancer treatment. Some
      patients may undergo saliva collection for DNA studies.

      After completion of study, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.
