      symptoms after hospital discharge. On 11th March 2020, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Egypt has been one of
      the worst affected countries with over 101,500 confirmed cases and more than 5,696 confirmed
      deaths at the time of writing (17/9 2020) .1 COVID-19 is caused by the corona virus SARSCoV-2
      and presents with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. Wu et al reported that 81% of people
      with COVID-19 in China presented with mild symptoms; 14% presented with symptoms of severe
      respiratory dysfunction; and 5% developed a critical illness with respiratory failure, septic
      shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure.2 The medium and long-term problems
      experienced by survivors of COVID-19 after discharge from hospital are currently unknown, but
      there is some emerging evidence. An Italian study followed-up 143 individuals 7 weeks
      post-discharge and found 53% reporting fatigue, 43% breathlessness and 27% joint pain.3
      Post-discharge symptoms may also be predicted from the previous coronavirus outbreaks of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
      in 2012. A meta-analysis of 28 follow-up studies found that one quarter of hospitalised
      survivors of SARS and MERS had reduced lung function and exercise capacity at six months
      post-discharge.4 At one year, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety,
      and reduced quality of life were observed Specific data concerning the rehabilitation needs
      of this group is therefore urgently required.
