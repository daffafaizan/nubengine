      interfere with an individual's thoughts, behavior, mood, and physical health. People who
      suffer from MDD often experience feelings of worthlessness; they may feel hopeless and may be
      unable to cope with problems in their life. In addition, they often experience sleep
      disruption, loss of appetite, and chronic pain.

      It often takes several weeks to find out if an antidepressant medication is going to work for
      someone. This research study aims to identify tests that are able to predict if a medication
      will work, even before a person starts to feel better. The first test is a measurement of the
      blood protein Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which is involved with brain cell
      growth. The second test is a Quantitative Electroencephalogram (QEEG), which measures brain
      activity.

      The study lasts for 8 weeks and involves 5 total visits to the clinic. Throughout the study,
      all subjects will receive either escitalopram (Lexapro) or citalopram (Celexa) on the basis
      of the study doctor's clinical judgment. The dose of the medications can be increased at any
      point in time if the study doctor thinks it is appropriate. After the first screen visit
      (which lasts about 3 hours), each subsequent half-hour visit will involve a 2-tablespoon
      blood draw to measure BDNF levels, as well as a QEEG in which small, painless electrodes are
      stuck to the subject's forehead and electrical activity of the brain is measured. At the end
      of the 8 weeks, subjects are offered 3 months of free follow-up care, including medications.
