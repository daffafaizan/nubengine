        -  No of patients with mean Hb level of +/-1.0g/dl difference from the baseline Hb

        -  Incidence of RBC transfusion during the titration and evaluation periods

        -  Mean Hb during the total study period

        -  Intrapatient Hb variability (mean within-patient standard deviation for Hb)

        -  Frequency of Micera dose level

        -  safety
