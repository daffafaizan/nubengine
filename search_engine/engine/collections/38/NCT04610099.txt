      weight regain can occur. An intervention to prevent weight regain in the future is to place a
      silicone band (non-adjustable) around the sleeve (Banded-Sleeve Gastrectomy: BSG) which
      increases weight loss and decreases weight regain on the longer term. The question is whether
      primary application of a banded sleeve gives a greater weight loss and / or prevent weight
      regain in the future versus a standard sleeve gastrectomy.

      Study is a prospective, randomized, multi centre trial.

      Study population: patients who qualify for a SG are eligible to participate. The primary SG
      patients may participate if there is a BMI of 35 kg / m2 with a morbidly obesity-related
      comorbidity or a BMI of 40kg / m2 or higher.

      Intervention: The standard SG is compared with a banded-SG (BSG)
