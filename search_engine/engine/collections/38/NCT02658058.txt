      residents in training. Thus the investigators will compare preprocedural ultrasound-guided
      paramedian technique using parasagittal oblique view vs preprocedural ultrasound-guided
      midline technique using transverse median view vs landmark-guided midline technique of spinal
      anesthesia in the elderly population. Our hypothesis is that both preprocedural US-guided
      techniques are superior to the conventional landmark-guided midline technique with regard to
      ease of performance defined as success rate at first attempt, number of puncture attempts,
      spinal procedure time, and patient satisfaction.
