      increasing. The effects of these substances on blood lipid profiles, biochemical,
      hematological parameters, inflammatory and glucose metabolism markers are not well known. So
      the investigators of this study planned to search the effects of these substances on blood
      tests. Totally 69 subjects going to the gym for at least three preceding months were included
      to the study. They were divided into two groups: the ones using protein supplements and the
      ones who never used these substances. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded.
      Dietician assessed the dietary habits of the subjects. Blood was drawn for the tests
      mentioned above from all of the subjects. And the results were compared between the two
      groups.
