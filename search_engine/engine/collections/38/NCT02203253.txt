    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial, aimed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of thalidomide in improving prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting (CINV) in chemotherapy-naive patients after
      highly emetogenic chemotherapy(HEC) (cisplatin-based regimen or cyclophosphamide combination
      with doxorubicin/epirubicin). A total of 820 patients are planned to be enrolled into the
      study. Patients treating with highly emetogenic chemotherapy will be randomized into two
      groups, and be treated with Thalidomide+ Palonosetron+ Dexamethasone or Placebo +
      Palonosetron+ Dexamethasone, respectively. The primary end point is complete response rate
      (CRR) for delayed CINV, and the secondary end points include the safety and quality of life
      (QOL).
