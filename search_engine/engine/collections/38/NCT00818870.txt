      treated by the study medications in a randomized, open-label, cross-over study.Up to 60
      volunteers may be enrolled to ensure that at least 30 subjects will complete all the study
      treatments. Omeprazole 20 mg will be administered before breakfast. Vecam 40/300 and Vecam
      20/300 will be administered at bedtime w/o food. 24-hour gastric pH will be measured after
      the fifth dose (day 5).Following screening procedures, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive the different treatments.

      All pH measurements will be done in the study center under supervised conditions. All drug
      administrations will be supervised.

      This study is part of the Vecam clinical development plan.
