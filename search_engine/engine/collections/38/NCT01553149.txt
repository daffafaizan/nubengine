      I. To determine the objective response rate in children with recurrent, refractory, or
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with
      Regimen A low-dose (20 mg/m^2/dose) or Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m^2/dose) lenalidomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) (based on standard two-dimensional tumor
      measurements, determined by each institution) of children with recurrent, refractory, or
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with
      lenalidomide.

      II. To compare response categories and EFS across the 3 magnetic resonance (MR) sequences
      (T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], T1-weighted post-contrast).

      III. To correlate steady-state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (1 sample obtained between
      days 5-21) with objective response and EFS.

      IV. To evaluate toxicities of long-term lenalidomide use.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (Regimen A): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (Regimen B): Patients receive high-dose lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for approximately 3
      years.
