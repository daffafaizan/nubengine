      volunteers will be included in this phase IIa study investigating three dose levels. 16
      subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for GHB11L1 or placebo.

      Healthy male volunteers, 18-50 years of age and seronegative with respect to the applied
      virus antigens (antibody titers <1:10 detected) will be randomised.

      GHB11L1 will be administered once on day 1. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 2, 8
      and 29.
