      product of inflammation. In animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), these chemical
      reactions have been associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and CNS tissue
      damage. In addition, MS patients have serum uric acid levels that are lower than age- and
      sex- matched healthy individuals. The primary purpose of this study to determine whether
      raising low serum uric acid levels by daily oral administration of its precursor inosine has
      an effect on the cumulative number of newly active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inosine in patients diagnosed with
      relapsing remitting and secondary progressive MS.
