      6 areas of the back, each measuring 0.9 cm^2 in order to evaluate their pigmentary response
      to visible light. The doses will be 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 J/cm^2. At Day 0, a visual
      inspection will establish which subjects qualify for the remainder of the study, based on the
      presence or absence of pigmentation induced by visible light. Subjects who do not exhibit
      pigmentation at 640 J/cm^2 or lower will not pursue the study.

      Subjects who demonstrate pigmentation will move on to the next step of the study. On this
      same Day 0 visit, these subjects will be randomized to receive a topical antioxidant
      preparation on one of two halves of their back and a control on the other side. The
      antioxidant and control will be applied twice before the exposure to visible light is done on
      Day 1: 24 hours prior (Day 0) and 30 minutes prior (Day 1) exposure. On Day 1, the skin with
      antioxidant will be exposed to fluences of 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 1920 J/cm^2 whereas
      that with control will be exposed to the same lower doses as on Day -7. This will be done on
      a total of 12 different areas of 0.9 cm^2 each, with six on the side with antioxidant
      preparation, and six on the side with control.

      On Day 7Â±1, a visual assessment will be done of each exposed area, as well as quantitative
      colorimetric measurements and a research photograph. The visual assessment will consist in
      determination of the lowest fluence inducing visible pigmentation on each half back (with
      antioxidant and with control). The colorimetric measurements will be done on areas exposed to
      320 and 640 J/cm^2 to compare the pigmentation present on skin to which antioxidant was
      applied and on skin to which control was applied. The colorimetric assessment of adjacent
      unexposed skin will also be performed. At Day 0, 1 and 7 visits, subjects will also be
      evaluated for adverse events.
