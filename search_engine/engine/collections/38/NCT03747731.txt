    
      The present physiological, monocentric, observational clinical study evaluates the effect of
      progressive PEEP increases on renal perfusion in mechanically ventilated patients who
      underwent surgery with the need of ventilatory support and monitoring in intensive care.

      Precisely, will be evaluated:

        -  The morphometric parameters (coronal diameter and cortico-medullary thickness) and the
           renal resistive indices (IR). The inter-lobar arteries will be sampled and the IRs will
           be measured as the upper and lower level and the mesorenes. Measurements will be
           performed both in the kidney and in baseline conditions and incremental values of PEEP
           (0 - 6 - 12).

        -  Gas exchanges, FC, systolic BP, diastolic and mean, Pmax, P1 and P2 of the airways,
           total and ohmic resistances and static respiratory compliance indexed for weight body
           (RRSmaxI, RRSminI, CrsI will be recorded).

      The intra-class correlation coefficient will be measured to estimate the intra-observer
      reproducibility of the conducted measurement.
