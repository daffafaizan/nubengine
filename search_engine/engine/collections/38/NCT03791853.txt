      feature or dynamic feature of tissue and cells, is used to detect malignant cells or tissue
      in fresh specimens. Morphological structure and pathological changes could be captured in
      minutes, which implies a possible application in intraoperative diagnosis. In this study,
      fresh breast tissue, fat, benign breast lesions, breast cancer and axillary lymph node
      specimens are collected to assess the usefulness of Light-CT. During the in vitro
      examination, both FF-OCT and DCI images are obtained and stored. Imaging analysis would be
      performed in traditional imaging analysis like manner and an artificial intelligence aided
      approach as well.
