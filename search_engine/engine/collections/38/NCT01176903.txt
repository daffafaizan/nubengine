    
      The study is divided into two parts:

      - Part 1 will be conducted according to a single-centre, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation, alternating crossover design in two groups of
      COPD patients.

      Treatments to be administered on Part 1 (SD1, SD2, SD3, SD4, SD5, SP). The primary objective
      of Part 1 is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of Glyco after single
      administration.

      - Part 2 will be conducted according to a single-centre, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 4-period, 4-treatment, repeated dose cross-over design followed by an
      open-label extension period with tiotropium.

      Treatments administered on Part 2 (MD1, MD2, MD3, MP, Tiotropium). On the last treatment day
      in the morning, Formoterol 12 Âµg will be administered to all patients on top of placebo or
      Glyco or Tiotropium.

      The primary objective of Part 2 is the evaluation of the efficacy of Glyco after repeated
      administration.

      Part 2 will start after a safety review of the results obtained from Part 1.
