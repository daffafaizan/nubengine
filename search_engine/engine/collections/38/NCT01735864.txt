      previous clinical studies which demonstrated the efficacy and safety of topical indigo
      naturalis ointment, showing its ability to provide significant improvement of psoriatic skin
      lesions.

      We developed a new formulation in which indigo naturalis powder is refined and reduces the
      blue discoloration of skin and clothes, making the treatment more user-friendly. We had
      observed an equivalent efficacy of the refined form of indigo naturalis (INEO) ointment on
      treating psoriasis as the crude form. However, it is necessary to determine an appropriate
      dosage of the refined form regarding its efficacy and safety.

      This is a double-blind, 4-arm parallel study. The aim of this study is

        1. To determine an appropriate dosage of indirubin in INEO ointment, regarding its efficacy
           and safety.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of INEO ointment in different local skin signs of plaque
           lesions.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of INEO in different traditional Chinese medicine clinical
           syndromes of psoriasis vulgaris.

        4. To investigate the effects of INEO ointment on the immune system.

        5. To evaluate the effects of INEO ointment in improving quality of life after treatment.
