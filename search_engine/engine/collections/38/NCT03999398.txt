      Swedeheart which is the national Swedish intervention-related quality register for
      cardiological interventions (such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) and cardiac
      surgical procedures that are performed every year in Sweden.

      After the approval of the Regional ethical review board in Uppsala (Sweden), one could review
      all the subjects that received a PCI in a venous graft between January the 1st, 2006 and June
      the 30th, 2020 either at the Angiographic unit of the University Hospital of Orebro or at the
      Angiographic unit of the Hospital of Karlstad. All the participants has been previously
      operated at the Cardiothoracic department of the University hospital of Orebro with a
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure, with one type of vein graft (no-touch) or
      the other (standard) All the relevant data for the study that are missed in the quality
      register, are extrapolated by the clinical registers of the two hospital involved (Orebro and
      Karlstad).

      Once finished the data extraction and review, the data will be statistically analysed in term
      of short and long term results; and an advanced comparison between the two different type of
      venous graft involved. This is to show if there is a significant difference between the two
      techniques also after a PCI procedure (already proven clinical different between the two
      technique in favour of the no-touch one by numerous studies).

      Moreover an assessment of the patientsÂ´ quality of life in the two different studies will be
      performed with the use of Health related quality of life surveys (RAND-36); even a health
      economics analysis will be preformed (QALY).
