      paramedics and one EMS physician on scene.

      Telemedicine networks between medical personnel and medical experts were shown to be
      beneficial for the quality of health care in many medical fields. The investigators have
      developed a holistic multifunctional mobile EMS teleconsultation system, as a complementary
      structural element to the ground based and air based EMS. This tele emergency system was
      evaluated and implemented during two third-party funded telemedicine projects (Med-on-@ix and
      TemRas) in the city of Aachen, Germany.

      The EMS teleconsultation system was step-wise introduced in the clinical routine of Aachen.
      Several cases (hypertensive emergency cases, stroke, dislocated fractures etc.) with the
      primary indication for an EMS physician are already dispatched solely to the paramedics, who
      can demand support by a tele-EMS physician at any time.

      Our aim is to demonstrate that the tele-EMS system is non-inferior in comparison to the
      conventional german EMS physician system with respect to safety. Moreover, the investigators
      want to evaluate which system provides a better quality with respect to recording important
      aspects of medical history and a more guideline conform treatment.
