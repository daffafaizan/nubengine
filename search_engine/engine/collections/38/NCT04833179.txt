      different severities. Usually the hair loss will be contained to the scalp and / or beard,
      but in some cases, there will be total hair loss from the entire scalp (alopecia totalis), or
      complete loss of all body, facial and scalp hair (alopecia universalis).

      AA is an autoimmune disease that produces an inflammation surrounding the hair follicles,
      this leads to temporary hair loss. In cases the disease become chronic, the immune system
      attack may lead to a permanent hair loss. This common hair disease has a significant impact
      on the patient's quality of life, it can cause impairment on the patient's confidence,
      self-esteem, lead to depression and more.

      Lately two patients with AA and clostridium difficile infection were treated with fecal
      transplantation for their infection (Rebello et al. 2017). After the transplant a significant
      improvement was notice in hair growth. These 2 cases raised the option that a fecal
      transplant may have an additional effect on the autoimmune reaction against the hair follicle
      in AA.

      the investigators intend to analyze the microbiome in the diseased areas, healthy skin and
      fecal samples. In addition, the investigators plan to evaluate how the fecal transplant can
      influence the severity of the disease and hair growth, all in hope that fecal transplant can
      help to treat or even cure AA. This may help dermatologists in the future and expand the
      treatment options for AA.
