        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with unresectable stage IV
           malignant cutaneous melanoma treated with thalidomide and temozolomide.

        -  Determine the objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response and
           partial response) in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-56 and temozolomide once daily on days
      1-42. Courses repeat every 56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at week 9, every 2 months until
      disease progression, and then every 6 months until 3 years from study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
