      main focus of this proposed study will examine whether insulin resistance is correlated with
      decreased cardiac function which will hopefully pave the way for future clinical trials using
      medications that sensitize insulin such as metformin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1
      agonists) as possible therapeutic agents. The exploratory piece of this study will
      investigate a novel therapeutic target by determining whether FGF21 has any direct effects on
      cardiac function and whether it interacts with insulin resistance in altering cardiac
      function. Patients with cardiomyopathy normally undergo ECHO as part of routine evaluation
      and follow up and is standard of care. At this time, there are no official guidelines for
      pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy to undergo oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and
      thus it is not part of the standard of care. Based on findings from this study, the
      investigators hope to justify performing an OGTT on pediatric patients with dilated or
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and incorporate the procedure in future practice guidelines.
