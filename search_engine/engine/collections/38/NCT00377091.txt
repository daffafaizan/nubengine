      This study is being conducted to determine if treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) with
      fondaparinux will decrease the length of stay and hospital costs of therapy while maintaining
      safety and efficacy, when compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH). Primary research
      questions: Determine if PE treatment utilizing fondaparinux will reduce the inpatient length
      of stay (LOS) and costs of hospital care to St. Mary's Duluth Clinic Health System (SMDC),
      when compared to a matched group of patients treated with UFH as standard care, during the
      same time period. Secondary research questions: Determine if bleeding and recurrent
      thrombosis rates are similar between the fondaparinux cohort and the UFH matched control
      group.

      Specific Aims

        1. Enroll 30 St. Mary's Medical Center (SMMC, an affiliate of SMDC) patients into the
           treatment cohort, utilizing fondaparinux as their primary immediate antithrombin
           therapy, while warfarin is being titrated to therapeutic effect.

        2. Retrospectively identify a matched control group of 30 PE patients, treated with UFH as
           standard care, during the same period of time.

        3. Determine the LOS and costs of inpatient care on a standardized scale for both the
           treatment cohort and the control group.

        4. Perform a retrospective review of patients' medical records for the 3 months after the
           initial pulmonary embolism, to determine the rates of:

      4a. repeat venous thromboembolism events (VTE) 4b. bleeding events
