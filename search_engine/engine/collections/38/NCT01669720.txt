      liver is the dominant site of metastases. Approximately 20-25% of patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer will be candidates for resection/ablation of all sites of metastatic
      disease.1 Unfortunately, despite resection/ablation of all metastatic sites only about 20% of
      these patients are ultimately cured.1 An effective adjuvant agent would prevent tumor
      recurrence.

      Aflibercept and bevacizumab are effective when combined with FOLFIRI for metastatic colon
      cancer. Neither has been tested in a randomized study in the adjuvant setting for patients
      with resected metastatic disease. Since aflibercept more effectively inhibits all forms of
      VEGF including VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PIGF, in striking contrast to bevacizumab which inhibits
      only VEGF-A, aflibercept likely will be more effective than bevacizumab as a single agent in
      the adjuvant metastatic setting. Therefore, we propose a randomized study of adjuvant
      aflibercept for patients metastatic colorectal cancer who have received 10-12 cycles of
      perioperative FOLFOX and have had had a complete response to all sites of metastases after
      chemotherapy and local modalities such as surgical resection or ablation. SBRT may also be
      used to produce a complete response in a metastatic site not easily amenable to surgery or
      ablation. Only patients with very high risk of recurrence, defined as 3 or more metastatic
      sites, will be included in this study.
