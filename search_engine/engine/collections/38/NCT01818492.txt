    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new drug
      aimed at controlling disease activity in patients diagnosed with primary haemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis. The new drug can be administered as the first-line therapy, to patients
      not previously treated with the current standard of care, or can be given to patients who
      have either failed or were unable to tolerate the current standard of care. Administration
      will be on top of a glucocorticosteroid, which is usually part of the current recommended
      treatment.

      All participants in the NI-0501-04 study (NCT01818492) were invited to participate in the
      long-term follow-up study NI-0501-05 (NCT02069899). For the primary completion date,
      mentioned here, we refer to the NI-0501-04 study, even though in accordance with the
      NI-0501-04 study objectives, namely the assessment of long-term efficacy and safety
      endpoints, the study analyses also included data collected in the long-term follow-up study
      NI-0501-05. Hence these data are reported together. Study NI-0501-05 accepts patients from
      NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-06. Data collection for the patients from NI-0501-04 is completed.

      The primary efficacy and safety analyses are based on the regulatory cut-off date of 20 July
      2017. Refer to the publication in N Engl J Med 2020 May 7; 382 (19):1811-1822. Follow-on
      analyses have been conducted on all patients enrolled in the study, i.e. including the
      patients enrolled after the cut-off date of 20 July 2017. The results reported here refer to
      the totality of the 45 patients enrolled.
