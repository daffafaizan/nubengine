    
      This study allows patients who have successfully participated in ACTG 347 or other trials
      involving amprenavir to continue treatment with amprenavir, ZDV, d4T, and 3TC. Additionally,
      this study provides patients whose HIV-1 RNA was not reduced to undetectable levels or who
      had a significant increase in plasma levels ("treatment failures") the opportunity to change
      to a potentially more active regimen that includes indinavir, nevirapine, lamivudine, and
      stavudine.

      Patients with HIV RNA less than 500 copies/ml on a regimen containing amprenavir are treated
      on Arm A; those with greater than or equal to 500 copies while on or intolerant to a regimen
      containing amprenavir are treated on Arm B.

      Arm A: Amprenavir + ZDV + d4T + 3TC. Arm B: IND + NVP + 3TC + d4T. Patients enrolled in Arm A
      who fail therapy may roll over to Arm B. Patients in Arm B who fail therapy discontinue study
      medications and seek best available treatment.

      [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/98: Patients with HIV RNA less than 500 copies/ml currently on triple
      therapy with amprenavir + 3TC + ZDV (or d4T if ZDV-intolerant) are treated on ARM A. Patients
      with HIV RNA greater than or equal to 500 copies/ml, who have been intolerant to a regimen
      containing amprenavir or who were previously enrolled on ACTG 347 who elected to receive a
      treatment regimen other than amprenavir + ZDV (or d4T) + 3TC or IDV + NVP + 3TC + d4T or
      other regimens are assigned to Arm C.

      Arm A: Amprenavir + ZDV* plus 3TC. Arm B: IDV** + NVP + 3TC + d4T***. Arm C: Observation
      only. Patients are followed for the duration of the study.

        -  Patients intolerant of ZDV may elect to receive d4T. **Patients intolerant of IDV may
           take study-provided nelfinavir. ***Patients who switched to open-label IDV/NVP/3TC/d4T
           prior to enrollment on this study and who were intolerant to any of the study
           medications may enroll into Arm B with appropriate substitution of the intolerant study
           drug(s).

      Patients initially assigned to Arm A who are intolerant of amprenavir or who fail therapy
      have the option of receiving Arm B therapy. Patients initially assigned to Arm B who are
      intolerant of any of the assigned study drugs may make an appropriate antiretroviral
      substitution (with approval of the protocol chair).]
