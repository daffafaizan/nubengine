      data point out to an inappropriate and exaggerated inflammatory response of the intestinal
      mucosal immune system toward intestinal commensal flora as initial trigger. Several
      strategies were developed in the treatment of active CD. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as
      steroids proved to be very helpful in the induction of a primary remission as is the use of
      exclusive enteral nutrition. Besides a long standing experience with EN in the management of
      CD in several centres, the mode of action and the molecular mechanisms of a specific EN, such
      as Modulen IBD ® remain still unknown. The ultimate aim of this study is to compare the
      efficacy of Modulen IBD ® in inducing remission compared to steroids with a detailed analysis
      of the mucosal repair and anti-bacterial defence mechanisms within the inflamed intestinal
      mucosa and the composition of the commensal flora before and during therapy. This approach
      may help to elucidate the interaction between the intestinal mucosa and the commensal flora
      during the onset of CD and induction of remission.
