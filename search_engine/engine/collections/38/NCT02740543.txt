      recruited from the WTC EHC = 30 with WTC dust cloud exposure, patients will be recruited from
      the NYUBAR (n=30) and have asthma as defined by NIH guidelines, and control patients will be
      recruited from the NYUBAR (n=30) and will have no respiratory sx, no asthma diagnosis, or no
      WTC dust exposure.

      The study will entail two to three visits. On visit 1 (V1) all individuals will sign informed
      consent to participate in the study under an NYU IRB approved protocol. A questionnaire will
      be completed with standardized questions that include information on WTC exposures,
      demographics, presence and severity of respiratory symptoms, tobacco history and past medical
      history. Individuals will undergo spirometry with inhaled bronchodilator. Individuals will
      undergo methacholine challenge test (visit 1a) if they have normal spirometry or no bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness. On visit 2, individuals will return to undergo ENO, EBC and spirometry
      with pre and post bronchodilator maneuvers and induced sputum. Blood will be obtained for CBC
      with differential cell count, and assessment of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE. Blood
      will also be stored for future analysis of inflammatory markers. Based on experience, there
      have been individuals unable to produce enough sputum and thus yield too small a number of
      cells. These individuals are excluded from data analysis. In addition, there will also be
      subjects who are able to produce sputum and return for repeat sputum testing.
