      remain asymptomatic, while others have repeated periods of porphyria symptoms. Glucose
      inhibits ALA synthetase (ALAS), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the haem synthesis. Studies
      of individual patients point to the fact that increased glucose and/or fructose content in
      the diet inhibits porphyria attacks. A high sugar intake can reduce the disease activity in
      patients with AIP. The diet and related biomarkers of those with latent and manifest AIP will
      therefore be mapped to explain why some have latent and others have manifest acute
      intermittent porphyria. Other studies point to the fact that people with manifest AIP who
      have later developed diabetes type 2 no longer have porphyria symptoms. Dental health will
      also be examined.

      Inflammation also affects the haem synthesis. Infections and/or inflammation are known to
      trigger AIP attacks. The disease activity in patients with acute intermittent porphyria in
      relation to inflammatory status, iron status, glucose metabolism and diet will therefore be
      examined.

      The iron metabolism is interesting to study because it is believed that the overstimulation
      of the haem synthesis is what triggers porphyria attacks. Haem consists of iron and
      protoporphyrin IX, and it is therefore possible that iron supplements in cases of iron
      deficiency can induce increased haem synthesis and by doing so trigger and/or aggravate AIP.

      Kidney failure is a serious secondary complication in some patients with MAIP. Protein
      markers for kidney injury in urine will be examined.
