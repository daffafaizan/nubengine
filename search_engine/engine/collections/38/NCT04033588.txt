    
      At all the clinical/telephonic follow-up visits i.e. at 8 weeks ± 1week, 1 year ± 1 month, 3
      years ± 6 months, 5 years ± 6 months and 10 years ± 6 months implant survivorship and vital
      signs such as weight, heart rate etc including blood pressure will be recorded. Physical
      examination, lab measurements (optional), Radiographic assessment, concomitant
      medication/surgery and AE/SAE should be recorded. Also at all clinical follow ups OKS, KSS,
      range of motion will be recorded. The post-operative radiographic evaluations will be
      conducted at 0-8 weeks ± 1 week (which is considered as standard of care), 1 year ± 1 month,
      3 years ± 6 months and optionally at 5 years ± 6 months, 10 years ± 6 months and Unscheduled
      visits, if required. The unscheduled visit is expected in some patients based on the fact
      that such patients might prone to complications like surgical site infections, venous
      thrombotic events, acute blood loss causing anaemia, nerve injury, and pain unresponsive to
      oral analgesics.
