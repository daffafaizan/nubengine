      caused by either persistent or secondary intra-radicular infection .Conventionally,
      nonsurgical retreatment has been believed to be an ''all or none'' treatment approach in
      which the endodontist has to remove all restorations from the tooth and to remove the
      obturation materials from all the canals in order to perform thorough disinfection of the
      entire root canal system. Nowadays, All operations in the medical field are aimed basically
      at the conservation of the human body. The alternative concept allows the endodontist to
      formulate clinical treatment decisions with respect to the presence of periapical pathosis
      related to individual roots rather than the tooth as a whole.

      The literature is lacking the clinical outcome studies dealing with the prognosis of cases
      treated with "selective root retreatment" concept so the aim of this study was to compare the
      prognosis of such cases in comparison to the traditional retreatment approach.
