    
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of recoil tape with 0-30% tension, by using
      one application of Kinesio tape over the muscle fibers of the quadriceps femoris from its
      origin to its insertion. The participants will be divided into intervention group (taping)
      and control group (no intervention). Muscle strength test will be performed before and
      immediately after taping (20-30 minutes) for both groups using hand-held dynamometer
      measurements (MicroFET 3).

      Work is based on the following hypothesis: "Kinesio taping using recoil taping provides
      increased isometric muscle strength in quadriceps femoris immediately after application".
