      mAb ADG20 in the prevention of symptomatic COVID 19 in adults and adolescents with no known
      history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose circumstances place them at increased risk of
      acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing symptomatic COVID-19. This objective will be
      independently evaluated in a cohort of participants with reported recent exposure to an
      individual diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (post-exposure prophylaxis) and in a cohort
      of participants with no reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2 ( pre-exposure prophylaxis). These
      cohorts will enrich for participants whose advanced age (â‰¥55 years old) or health status
      places them at risk for severe COVID 19 or COVID 19 complications.
