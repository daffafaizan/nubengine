      women with chronic pelvic pain symptoms, with or without infertility, who require evaluation
      by laparoscopy. Women undergoing laparoscopy for elective tubal ligation will also be
      investigated similarly and serve as the negative control. Subjects will be queried regarding
      sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, pain and lifestyle as
      well as assessment for differential diagnoses such as interstitial cystitis and idiopathic
      bowel syndrome. Endometriosis severity will be captured by rASRM staging during laparoscopy.
