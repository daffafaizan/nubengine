      study conducted in normoglycemic healthy subjects (NHS) (Part 1) and subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are treated with monotherapy metformin (a stable dose at
      randomization) along with diet and exercise (Part 2). Subjects with T2DM who are not on a
      stable dose of metformin but meet all other entry criteria may be enrolled in the study at
      the discretion of the Investigator, but must undergo a stabilization period of at least 12
      weeks before determining eligibility for the study. In Part 1, a single group of healthy
      subjects will be dosed with repeated oral doses of 15 mg of LGD-6972 or placebo once daily
      (QD) for 14 days. In Part 2, a maximum of 3 groups of subjects with T2DM will be dosed with 3
      sequential, increasing doses of LGD-6972 (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo QD for 14 days.
