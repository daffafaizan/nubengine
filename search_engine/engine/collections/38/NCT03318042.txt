      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to obesity, metabolism and cardiovascular disease
      with the body mass index (BMI), intestinal microbiota related to the metabolism of
      polyphehnos and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a cohort of children and adolescents
      from the southeast of Spain.

      The volunteers (n=423) with ages ranging from 5 to 18 years consumed for three days a daily
      serving of walnuts (30g) and provided a sample of urine (to determine mirobial-derived
      metabolites from walnut polyphenols) as well as a swab specimen from the inner cheek to
      provide DNA for further genotyping.
