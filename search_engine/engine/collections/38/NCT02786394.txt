      Everyday Activities in the Community and Home (REACH) is a health promotion program aimed at
      middle-aged and older adults. The goal of REACH is to reduce sedentary behaviour, increase
      physical activity, and increase strength and balance. The REACH program is comprised of six
      sessions which include evidence-based education, behaviour change theory, and activity
      instruction. REACH also teaches goal setting techniques, mindfulness, and encourages active
      community engagement. In this study we are running the REACH program for women aged 55 and
      older alongside a supplementary optional walking program run by SportMedBC. We will gather
      pre- and post-intervention measures of program perceptions, delivery psychological variables
      and physical performance outcomes. We will also collect participant feedback about course
      delivery, content and effect throughout the program. This study will allow us to describe the
      delivery strategies of REACH and involve the participants in the development of the REACH
      program. The optional walking program will emphasize the importance of increasing daily
      physical activity.
