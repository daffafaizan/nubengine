      emergencies. Hydroxychloroquine has proven to inhibit coronavirus in-vitro but no data to
      date has proven in-vivo effects. Nevertheless, hydroxychloroquine is a low cost, limited
      toxicity and broadly used agent. Since there is currently no treatment for COVID-19 exposure
      prophylaxis, the investigators will implement a triple blinded, phase III randomized
      controlled trial with parallel groups (200mg of hydroxychloroquine per day vs. placebo) for
      60 days.
