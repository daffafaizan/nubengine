      with chronic periodontitis and to evaluate changes after nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

      Twenty-seven CP and 27 periodontally healthy controls were enrolled in this study.
      Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal treatment. GCF and saliva sampling
      and clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and a month after treatment. IL-32,
      IL-10 and TNF-α levels in GCF and saliva were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

      Unstimulated salivary samples were collected using standard techniques. About 2 mL whole
      saliva was collected in disposable tubes and centrifuged immediately to remove cell debris
      (10,000 g x 10 minutes). The supernatants (50µL each) were stored at -40C until analyzed. GCF
      samples were collected from a mesio-buccal and disto-palatal site on each tooth. In the CP
      group, the samples were obtained from patients at areas with ≥5 mm CAL, ≥6 mm PD and ≥30%
      bone loss. In the healthy group, GCF samples were collected from teeth exhibiting PD<3 mm
      without CAL and BOP. The area was isolated with cotton rolls, saliva contamination
      elimination was ensured, and it was slightly air dried. GCF was sampled with paper strips.
      Paper strips were placed into the crevice until mild resistance was felt (intracrevicular
      method) and left in the position for 30 seconds. Strips contaminated with blood or saliva
      were discarded. Each sampled strip was placed into a 400µl eppendorf centrifuge tube and
      stored at -40C until analyzed.
