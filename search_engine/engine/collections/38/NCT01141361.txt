      such patients. The gold standard method to assess this walking capacity is the measurement of
      the maximal walking distance on a treadmill. However, treadmill measurement are not readily
      accessible and the relationship with free-living walking capacity is, although not well
      known, weak. A novel approach was developed using a Global Positioning System in order to
      assess community-based walking capacity. This method showed interesting results, validating
      the technique, but was limited to one laboratory and to the place where the measurements were
      performed. The next step is therefore to assess the feasibility of home-based measurement of
      walking capacity using the GPS technique, through a multicenter study regrouping university
      hospitals, independent vascular specialists (angiologists) and private clinic(s).
