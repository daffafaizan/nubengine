      (age 17-25) by trained Peer Mentors (age 20-35) during the transition between pediatric and
      adult diabetes care. The study aims to optimize transition in T1D by leveraging and building
      on young adults' diabetes strengths, self-management skills, and social supports. This
      intervention will maximize protective processes that can facilitate optimal transition by
      training Peer Mentors (experienced young adults with T1D who have successfully established
      care in an adult setting) to provide relevant information about successful transition, teach
      strengths-based skills for managing transition-related challenges, share personal
      transition-related experiences, encourage young adults to access their social support
      network, and serve as a positive role model. Delivery of these strengths-based intervention
      components through a Peer Mentor has potential to reduce isolation, increase access to
      relevant information, and facilitate engagement with self-management and T1D care. This
      intervention is a complement to existing systems of care for young adults with T1D for 12
      months as they leave the pediatric setting.
