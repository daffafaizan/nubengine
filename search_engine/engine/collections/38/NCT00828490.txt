        1. Refine and implement a computerized surveillance and trigger tool to support medication
           therapy and risk management services. The ePRM tool will be used to (1) identify
           potential drug-therapy problems, which include quality, safety and cost-related
           problems; (2) select patients and providers for in-depth clinical reviews and possibly
           direct intervention (i.e., letter, phone call, Medication Therapy Management Services
           (MTMS), or Academic Detailing); (3) identify potential fraud and diversion of controlled
           substances; and (4) track patterns of medication use and evaluate ePRM performance,
           identify improvements, and direct policy change.

        2. Conduct innovative multi-pronged interventions that are guided by the ePRM trigger tool.
           Clinical areas chosen for review include diabetes therapy, hypertension, asthma,
           antipsychotic therapy, pain management (opioid narcotics and anticonvulsants) and
           anticoagulation/antiplatelet drugs. Interventions in these areas will address potential
           under and overuse, or patient safety concerns. Clinical pharmacists and physicians will
           implement five types of inter-related interventions: a) provider level reviews, which
           includes prescribers' profiling and feedback for outlier prescribers; b) patient level
           reviews and letters to prescribers for high-risk patients; c) phone consultation and
           Academic Detailing with outlier prescribers; d) MTMS; and e) detecting and pursuing
           suspected fraud and abuse cases.
