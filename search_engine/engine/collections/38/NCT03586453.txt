      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genetic mutation. The
      EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in the
      genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients who
      have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or "inhibit") the effect of the mutation in the EGFR
      gene.

      - Osimertinib has been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for this
      disease.
