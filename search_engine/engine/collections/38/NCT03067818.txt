      These improvements could potentially be enhanced by combining non-invasive brain stimulation
      with practice.

      To develop such an intervention, it is necessary to understand which brain areas should be
      stimulated in which types of patients. It is probably more beneficial to target one side of
      the brain vs. the other, for example, depending on the characteristics of the stroke.

      This study will examine the effect of stimulating one side of the brain vs. the other on the
      amount of improvement that occurs from physically practicing functional arm movements.
