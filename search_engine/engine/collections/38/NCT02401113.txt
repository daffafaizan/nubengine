      efficacy and tolerability of Ursolic Acid of Loquat Extract for treatment of muscle function
      improvement with relatively health adults. 54 subjects received 500 mg of Loquat Extract per
      day or a placebo for 12 weeks. Change over time in muscle fuction was evaluated by four
      outcomes: assessment of appendicular skeletal mass using DEXA (dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); quadriceps muscle power by Biodex; hand grib power; and Short Physical
      Performance Battery, SPPB.
