    
      Turner syndrome is a common chromosomal disorder with only one X-chromosome or partial
      deletions in one X-chromosome in all or some of the cell-lines in the body. Appr. 18
      girls/year are being born with the syndrome in Denmark. The syndrome is mostly known for
      reduced final height and the lack of pubertal development with infertility, but it is also
      known for diseases influencing other parts of the body like the heart with the risk of
      development of aortic dilatation and subsequently dissection with the risk of rupture,
      profuse bleeding and sudden death. Reduced bone strength and increased risk of bone fracture
      are also features of the syndrome. Treatment with growth hormone and female sex-hormones are
      well-established treatments.

      Girls and young women with Turner syndrome ages 10 to 21 years will participate. The girls
      ages 15 to 21 years will randomly and double blindly receive treatment with either 2 mg or 4
      mg estrogen for 5 years. Yearly examinations with blood tests, physical examinations,
      questionnaires, ultrasound and MR-scan of the internal female genitalia, DEXA-scan of the
      bones and MR-scan of the heart will be performed.
