    
      In this non-blinded,auto-control study,patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease（COPD）or asthma will serve as their own controls during the 2-week treatment phase.The
      subjects will be co-administered oral doses of sustained release theophylline (100mg
      tablets,twice daily) and azithromycin (2x250mg capsules,once daily )in the first week.Then
      patients will received theophylline therapy alone with the same dose in the second week.Blood
      samples for the measurement of theophylline plasma concentrations will be collected on Days 8
      and 15 prior to dosing.All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported
      or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the investigator and reported in the
      subject's case report form.
