      symptoms make it difficult to cope with disease and treatment process in children with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) . Sleep difficulty is not affected by the direct effects of the
      disease but it is affected and becomes more difficult with the fatigue and difficulty of
      treatment as a secondary. Parents with ALL children stated that they experienced 12.4% of
      sleeping difficulty. It turns out that about a quarter of the children are sleeping problems.
      It is stated that 27% of these children have drowsiness, and more than 25% of them have
      frequent awakenings at night. It is also stated that parents use the option of rest-sleep as
      an option to benefit from treatment in coping with the disease, but children with sleeping
      difficulties also make it difficult to treat them. Being a healthcare professional as a
      biopsychosocial approach model and planning the treatment interventions for the deficiencies
      and disorders that will be done in order to get rid of the symptoms of the disease as soon as
      possible will make it easier to cope with the disease with both child and parent and
      multidisciplinary approach. In this way, we will investigate the effects of children's
      exercise habits on their sleep and sleep related complaints by using video-based game
      consoles which are currently used in our workout approaches. The games to be selected from
      the aerobic exercise programs that are used to increase the functional capacity on the basis
      of exercise will also be targeted to the exercises with maximum motivation and participation
      of the children. In the exercises where goodness and continuity are also taken into
      consideration, in-game guidance will be provided with verbal commands under the supervision
      of a physiotherapist.
