      I. To assess the effect of denosumab in Her2/neu negative ER+ and/or PR+ metastatic breast
      cancer patients who are in partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after starting
      systemic therapy with bone metastases and >= 5 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by measuring
      the fraction of patients with reduction in CTCs after 3 cycles of denosumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of denosumab on CTCs enumeration considered as a continuous variable
      (percent change from baseline) in this population.

      II. To evaluate median progression-free survival (m-PFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. CTC enumeration after enrichment. II. To assess the effect on CTC profiling and
      characterization of stem cell phenotype (CTC-EMT).

      III. To evaluate the type of progressive disease (new site versus [vs.] progression of
      lesions in previous sites).

      IV. To analyze the expression of RANKL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression, unexpected toxicity, or patient
      withdrawal or death.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2
      years.
