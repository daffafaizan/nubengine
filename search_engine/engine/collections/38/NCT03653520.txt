      advantage that it eliminates the need for an IV in 85% of patients although that number was
      established anecdotally. This alternative, however, is very cost limiting.The investigators
      wanted to see if the current regimen (valium only) or a combination similar to the MKO melt
      (valium + tramadol + zofran) are as good if not better than the MKO melt for anesthesia and
      how many patients could have indeed gone with an intravenous line (didn't need any extra
      medications).
