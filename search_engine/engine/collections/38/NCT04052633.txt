    
      From January 2018 to August 2018 all consecutive elective and emergency cholecystectomies
      performed were entered in a prospective database. IOC has been instructed to be performed
      routinely when feasible during cholecystectomy since 1998. All elective operations were
      performed either by residents or specialist surgeons. For this study the investigators
      collected the radiation exposure values from exposure and pulsed fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy
      time (s) was recorded.The operating surgeon was asked to fulfill a questionnaire directly
      after the cholecystectomy. The technical success and reasons for possible deferral of IOC
      were documented.Patient data from unsuccessful or deferred cholangiography cases was checked
      6 months after cholecystectomy for possible symptomatic residual
      choledocholithiasis.Laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed both by residents and
      specialist surgeons.

      Ethics: The study was approved by the hospital administration.
