      inflammatory macular edema (Deuter C. M. E., Kötter I., Günaydin I., Zierhut M. Treatment of
      the Cystoid Macular Oedema in Behçet's Disease with Interferon Alfa-2a, Retina, in press). In
      an interventional, multi-centric pilot-study we could demonstrate a positive effect of
      interferon beta on ED associated uveitis, especially in reducing the macular edema. Undesired
      effects of the treatment were not observed.

      Thus we want to test the efficacy and safety of interferon beta compared to standard
      treatment with methotrexate in a prospective, clinically controlled trial on patients who
      suffer from intermediate uveitis with inflammatory macular edema who either have associated
      ED or have no systemic disease association, i.e. primary uveitis. .
