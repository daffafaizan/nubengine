      deliver deep brain stimulation (DBS) like a standard clinical neurostimulator, but which
      allows recordings of local field potential (LFP) activity from the implanted DBS lead.

      LFPs are composite electrical signals generated by the brain. They are conventionally divided
      into frequency bands, as follows: 0-3 Hz (delta), 4-7 Hz (theta), 8-12 Hz (alpha), 13-30 Hz
      (beta), 31-200 Hz (gamma), and >200 Hz (high frequency). The instantaneous amplitude and
      power of the LFP recordings are believed to represent the degree of synchronization among
      neurons surrounding the electrode. A transient increase in power in a particular band, in
      response to a behavioral event, is called an event-related synchronization (ERS), while a
      transient decrease in power is called event-related desynchronization (ERD). ERD and ERS are
      typically calculated by averaging the power across time segments and comparing this average
      to a reference epoch.

      Research staff at the University of Minnesota will follow FDA guidelines for software
      development for the RC+S.
