      with the aim to compare which protocol leads to a better outcome for the patient.

      A 'better outcome' is defined as the method, which leads to the least crestal bone loss, and
      the fastest healing time.

      Immediate gradually loaded side: will include transmucosal healing of dental implants using
      gingival formers which will be replaced every 2 weeks by consequent larger size gingival
      former.i.e. at surgery time the implants will receive 2 mm height gingival former which will
      be swapped by 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm and the last is 6 mm

      early loaded side: implants will be submerged from the surgery time till loading time (2
      month).
