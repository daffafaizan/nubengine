      I. To determine the feasibility of HPV self-testing as a potential cervical cancer screening
      strategy and obtain preliminary efficacy data of culturally appropriate materials on
      self-test use.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive a study kit that includes culturally appropriate instructions for
      using and returning the HPV self-test device and a photo story information sheet about HPV
      and HPV self-testing. Participants are asked to complete the HPV self-test and return the
      test for HPV testing.

      ARM II: Participants receive a study kit that includes standard instructions for using and
      returning the HPV self-test device and a standard information sheet about HPV and cervical
      cancer. Participants are asked to complete the HPV self-test and return the test for HPV
      testing.

      Participants are followed up at 4 weeks for return of their HPV self-test device and then for
      2 months after notification letters are sent.
