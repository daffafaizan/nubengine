        -  Determine the safety of adoptive immunotherapy comprising
           2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate-stimulated gamma delta (gd) T cells, zoledronate, and
           IL-2 after nephrectomy, especially with regard to the incidence and frequency of adverse
           events.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of the transferred gd T cells in patients.

        -  Determine the doubling time of tumor growth before and after adoptive immunotherapy.

        -  Determine the tumor-size reducing effect of adoptive immunotherapy based on the Best
           Overall Response Chart.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis for the harvest of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs). PBMCs are stimulated with 2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate and aldesleukin for 11
      days. Patients then receive the expanded Gamma Delta T cells, aldesleukin, and zoledronic
      acid once a month for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 month.
