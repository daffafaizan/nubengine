      laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be invited to participate in this study. The laparoscopic
      instrumentation will be sterilized using standard methods. Conventional and new laparoscopic
      and endoscopic equipment will be used for this project; all equipment is commercially
      available and is FDA-approved for laparoscopic procedures. Access will be obtained into the
      peritoneal cavity at the umbilicus in a standard fashion, either by use of a Veress needle
      technique or by insertion of a trocar using the open technique. Through a single umbilical
      incision, a 5mm trocar will be placed into the peritoneal cavity. A 5mm laparoscope will then
      be inserted into the peritoneal cavity. This will be used to monitor safe peritoneal entry of
      a dilating12mm transvaginal trocar. Subsequent operative visualization will be by use of a
      flexible endoscope which will be placed through the transvaginal port. The gallbladder will
      be retracted using sutures as well as endoscopic and / or laparoscopic graspers. In order to
      obtain the critical view of safety [5] the cystic duct and artery will be dissected, ligated
      and divided by use of conventional laparoscopic and new articulating instruments. The
      dissected gallbladder will be retrieved transvaginally. If for any reason suitable retraction
      or dissection cannot be performed using the transvaginal strategy, the case will be promptly
      converted to a standard laparoscopic approach by the insertion of additional transabdominal
      trocars.
