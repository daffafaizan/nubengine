      during treatment, and compare them to a control group of healthy participants. The aim will
      be to better understand both the neurobiology of depression and how the neurobiology changes
      in response to treatment of depression and the outcome of treatment. The study will include a
      variety of assessments of the neurobiology of depression including: scans of brain areas are
      involved in depression by looking at structures in the brain and how they work and blood
      tests and how these change in relation to several measures of depression severity.
