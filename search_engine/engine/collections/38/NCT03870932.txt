      and many authors suggested improving standardized exercise prescription for FM to achieve
      optimal results. In the literature, as an alternative approach, rehabilitative protocols in
      Group Music and Imagery seem to improve well-being and reduce anxiety in women with FM and
      suggest that Music and Imagery may help diminish pain intensity and depression. A
      rehabilitative approach should also consider the psychological and emotional aspects and,
      when possible, be accompanied by cognitive-behavioral therapy. The purpose of this research
      is to evaluate the possible efficacy of a novel approach with a motor imagery-based exercise
      program versus conventional rehabilitative approach in FM syndrome: the reduction of pain was
      set as the primary outcome as well as taking into account the patient's psychological and
      emotional condition. This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.
