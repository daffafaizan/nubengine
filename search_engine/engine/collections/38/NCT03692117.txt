      unit. Many recently clinical studies have showed that ECCO2R can effectively remove CO2,
      reduce patient breathing work, improve the patient respiratory failure, and avoid
      endotracheal intubation. But there are also treated failure and high incidence of
      complications such as bleeding in the AECOPD patients with ECCO2R treatment, and the
      treatment related to airway management are less mentioned. Therefore, we set a more strict
      inclusion criteria in AECOPD patients and evaluate the clinical effectiveness and associated
      risk of ECCO2R in the treatment of AECOPD.
