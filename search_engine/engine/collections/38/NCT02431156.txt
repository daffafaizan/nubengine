    
      Patients who underwent mini-monovision (with bilateral myopic defocus, MM-BMD) surgery for
      presbyopia correction with monofocal intraocular lenses implantation are supposed to have
      sufficient uncorrected vision capacity for activities of daily living (ADLs) that require: a)
      distant vision(DV), (ie. driving), b) intermediate vision (IV), (ie. computer word
      processing), c) near vision (NV), (ie. book reading). Primary objectives of the study are: 1)
      the development of a series of tasks in a research setting that will simulate common ADLs
      that require DV, IV, and NV. 2) the identification of potential correlations of the tasks in
      the research setting with demographic, clinical and other parameters of the study
      participants
