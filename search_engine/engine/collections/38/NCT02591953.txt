      the patients that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered to enroll in the study.
      Study will be described to the patient with regard to protocol and consent. All questions
      regarding the study will be answered, and it will be explicitly described that the study
      involvement will not change clinical care. It will be explained that investigators expect a
      follow up appointment at minimum at three weeks and three months. There may be further follow
      up requested up to 1 year from enrollment.

      After collection of informed consent, the patient will be randomized to either
      ultrasound-guided or landmark-guided injection. The patient will complete clinical scores at
      the initial visit prior to the injection. After injection, the patient will have follow up
      scheduled for three weeks and three months. To ensure patient blinding, an ultrasound will be
      placed on the patient for both groups, but only active imaging with be performed for the
      ultrasound-guided patient group. For clinician blinding, a different clinician than the
      injecting clinician will perform the follow up examinations. The patient is instructed to not
      seek additional injections or physical therapy during the study.
