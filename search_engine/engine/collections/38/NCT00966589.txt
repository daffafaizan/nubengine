      (rest, physical treatment, corticosteroid injections, anti-inflammatory analgesics) versus
      surgery (laparoscopic TEP) on the healing of sportsman hernia. Diagnosis of sportsman hernia
      is always based on careful clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. 25 patients
      with sportsman hernia are randomized into conservative treatment and 25 patients in surgery.
      The duration of follow-up is 1 year. The main end-point of treatments is disappearing of
      chronic groin pain (visual analogue scale, entering to sports).
