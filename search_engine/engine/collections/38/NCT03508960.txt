      disease. Early-onset PD (EOPD) has its unique clinical feature and genetic
      basis.Investigators aim to establish a database of EOPD,and characterize the clinical
      feature, genetic basis, environmental factors and their interactions EOPD in China.

      Method:

        1. Clinical feature will be measured by scales and neurological tests.Standard scales
           includes: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr stages, NMSS,
           MMSE, PDSS(Parkinson disease sleep scales),Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder
           Questionnaire(RBDQ-HK),ESS(Epworth Sleepiness Scale),Rome III functional constipation
           scale，SCOPA-AUT (the Scale for Outcomes in PD for Autonomic Symptoms)，PFS(Parkinson
           Fatigue Scale)，CH-RLSq，Hyposmia rating scale(HRS)HAMILT depression scale，the 39-item
           Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire(PDQ-39)，Freezing of gait scale(FOG)，dyskinesia related
           scales, Wearing-off scale(WO)

        2. Peripheral blood from patients was collected for whole exome sequencing.

        3. The environmental factors are explored by questionnaires including smoking,drinking,
           pesticide and heavy metals.
