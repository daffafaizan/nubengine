      almost pur eccentric contractions.

      Fifteen healthy volunteers realize a incremental test until exertion on a concentric
      ergometer. If the minimal power output of 200W is reached, the volunteers are familiarized
      with eccentric exercise during several bouts of exercise. This habituation session allows
      avoiding the secondary muscular effects of high intensity eccentric exercise.

      Then, volunteers could take part in a two-stepped eccentric protocol: 1) an incremental test
      consisting in 3 stages. Each stage lasts 4 minutes.

      2) A constant-load test realized at 320W during 6 minutes. Each test is realized twice: at 50
      and 80 rpm and sequence is randomly assigned.

      [One step (incremental or constant load) = two tests (50 and 80 rpm)]

      During each step, oxygen consumption is continuously measured, as well as cardiac output and
      muscular activity and intramuscular oxygen kinetic.
