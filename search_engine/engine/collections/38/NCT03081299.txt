    
      This is a two institution (Naval Medical Center San Diego and Walter Reed National Military
      Medical Center) prospective descriptive correlational design looking to characterize
      postoperative pain variables across various procedures that historically have significant
      levels of persistent post-surgical pain.

      A total goal of 1500 subjects (750 subjects at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
      and 750 subjects at Naval Medical Center San Diego) will be queried regarding their
      postoperative pain experience following mastectomy, thoracic surgery, total knee
      arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, spinal fusion, and major abdominal surgery. Descriptive
      multidimensional tools (the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and the electronic
      Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) will be used preoperatively, as
      an inpatient, and up to 6 months postoperatively.
