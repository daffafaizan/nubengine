    
      Study has two parts, Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Part 1 is divided
      into Parts 1A, 1B, and 1C and Part 2 is divided into Parts 2A and 2B. In Part 1A, single
      escalating doses of PF-07248144 alone will be administered to determine the maximum tolerable
      dose (MTD) and select the recommended dose for expansion (RP2D). In Part 1B and 1C,
      PF-07248144 will be administered in combination with either fulvestrant or letrozole +
      palbociclib.

      After the determination of the monotherapy expansion RP2D in Part 1A, PF-07248144 will be
      evaluated in a dose expansion cohort as a monotherapy in Part 2A. After determination of the
      combination RP2D from Part 1B and Part 1C, PF-07248144 in combination with an either
      fulvestrant (Part 1B) or letrozole + palbociclib (Part 1C) may be evaluated in Part 2B. The
      specific combination partners that will be carried forward to Part 2B will be contingent upon
      preclinical evidence, clinical safety and potential efficacy as well as PK and PD data.
