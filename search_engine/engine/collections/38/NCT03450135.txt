    
      Framed within a diathesis-stress model of disease, the primary objective of this research is
      to determine a pathophysiological role of estradiol (E2) variability in the context of severe
      psychosocial stress exposure in regulating neurophysiological correlates of affective state
      change in girls (ages 11-14) during the pubertal transition (i.e., Tanner developmental
      stages 3 or 4). The rationale for examining E2 variability as a diathesis for mood impairment
      is twofold. First, sensitivity to hormonal flux during specific reproductive events has been
      shown to trigger affective symptoms in susceptible women, and second, E2 is a powerful
      neuroregulator of neural networks implicated in depression.

      55 peripubertal girls undergoing a healthy pubertal transition will be recruited for the
      study. Over an 8-week period, depression symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies
      Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC)), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-C)),
      and perceived stress (perceived stress scale (PSS)), and salivary E2 measured by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will be assessed on a weekly basis. An
      electroencephalogram (EEG) during an emotional go/no-go task will be performed after the
      8-week collection period to probe neurophysiological correlates of maturing fronto-limbic
      circuitry and assess key domains of cognitive and emotional processing impacted by the
      hormonal milieu. At the follow-up visit, an acute psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress
      Test) will be administered to examine cortisol and autonomic stress reactivity. The central
      hypothesis of the proposed research is that the amplitude and synchrony of frontal neural
      oscillations evoked during the cognitive-affective processing paradigm, and cortisol
      reactivity to the psychosocial stressor will partially mediate the relationship between
      greater E2 variability and elevated depression symptoms in peripubertal girls, and this
      relationship will be particularly strong in girls who have experienced recent (within six
      months) psychosocial stress.
