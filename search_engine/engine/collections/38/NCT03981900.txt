      evaluate the factors predictive of Tofacitinib's survival in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis

      If catastrophisation is described as a distortion of the perception of pain involving a both
      emotional and cognitive component, pushing the patient to see only the worst, coping involves
      adaptive strategies by which the patient attempts to find solutions in order to better cope
      with his/her disease. It has been demonstrated that such behavioural strategies can influence
      directly or indirectly the intensity of symptoms in patients suffering from chronic disease.

      Therefore, as secondary objectives, the impact of behavioural strategies on drug survival and
      other clinical parameters as well as Tofacitinib effectiveness and tolerability will be
      studied under real-life conditions of use in French patients with RA.

      The duration of this study will be approximately 48 months including a 24-month recruitment
      period and a 24-month patient follow-up period.

      Patients will be followed prospectively and follow-up visits will be conducted after the
      initial consultations. No visit or additional test is required by the protocol, since the
      study is observational
