      positive cardiovascular and metabolic effects in animal models. In this study, the
      investigators will determine if angiotensin-(1-7) can increase resting energy expenditure and
      promote white adipose tissue heat production (thermogenesis) in obese human subjects. The
      investigators will perform a randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel group study to
      determine effects of acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) versus saline infusion on resting
      energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry in obese human participants. In addition,
      blood pressure and heart rate will be measured and blood samples obtained to measure for
      changes in circulating renin-angiotensin system and metabolic hormones. Abdominal
      subcutaneous white adipose biopsies will also be obtained from obese human participants
      during acute angiotensin-(1-7) versus saline infusions to examine for changes in gene
      expression for markers of thermogenesis. The findings from these studies will advance
      understanding of hormonal mechanisms involved in the etiology of obesity, and provide new
      insight into the potential for targeting angiotensin-(1-7) to improve energy balance in human
      obesity.
