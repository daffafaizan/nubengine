      implicated in the neoangiogenesis required for tumor growth. In the central nervous system
      (CNS), MMP-2, MMP-9 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are overexpressed
      in orthotopic models and also in human brain tumor specimens. Furthermore, serum and urinary
      levels of these markers have been shown to correlate with the presence and status of brain
      tumors in all types of primary brain tumors. A major challenge in the treatment of primary
      brain tumors is the dependence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate disease
      progression from treatment-related change. This is particularly challenging in glioblastomas
      (GBM) where multimodality therapy with radiation and chemotherapy is commonly used and can
      lead to pseudoprogression and treatment-related tissue necrosis, both of which can masquerade
      as true tumor progression. Often we are faced with the decision to treat based on imaging
      findings alone or to recommend that patients have another invasive surgery. We hypothesize
      that MMP-2, MMP-9 and NGAL will: 1) be detected on tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and
      not on non-tumor (epilepsy) brain tissue, 2) parallel the course of disease in the urine
      and/or serum of patients and 3) remain unchanged in the event of pseudoprogression and
      treatment related imaging changes. Quality of life, patient symptoms, and cognitive function
      are vitally important in patients with GBM. Quality of life and selected symptoms will also
      be assessed and correlated with serum and urine biomarkers. We hope to confirm the utility of
      MMP-2, MMP-9 and NGAL in the management of GBM.
