      effectiveness of hypofractionated RNI for women with resected node-positive breast cancer.
      The study hypothesis is that a 3-4 week hypofractionated course of post-lumpectomy or
      postmastectomy EBRT is as safe and effective as the biologically equivalent dose given in
      conventional fractionation over 5-7 weeks.

      Eligible patients are women â‰¥ 40 years old who have undergone definitive surgery for
      node-positive breast cancer. Surgery may have been lumpectomy, mastectomy without
      reconstruction, or mastectomy with reconstruction. Nodal staging may have been performed by
      only sentinel lymph node (SLN) or by axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection. Patients may have
      received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating medical
      oncologist.

      Breast and RNI will be administered to 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions. (RNI will exclude the axilla
      in patients who have had an ALN dissection.) A treatment boost of 4 to 6 fractions of 2.66
      Gy/fraction to the lumpectomy cavity will be included for all patients who have had
      lumpectomy; a chestwall boost (4 to 6 fractions of 2.66 Gy/fraction) will be administered to
      patients who had mastectomy (with or without reconstruction) and close (< 2 mm) surgical
      margins. Total number of EBRT fractions will be 20 to 22 with a boost; 16 without a boost.

      Bilateral measurements of arm circumference will be used to assess lymphedema by comparing
      the ipsilateral arm to the contralateral arm. Patients will also be assessed for and will
      complete questionnaires related to lymphedema, decreased arm function, breast and chestwall
      pain, other EBRT-related toxicities, cosmetic outcome, and local, regional, and distant
      breast cancer recurrence.
