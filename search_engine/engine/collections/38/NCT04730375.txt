      times more than that of clonidine. It also has powerful sedative, analgesic,
      anti-inﬂammatory, and organ protective properties. dexmedetomidine has favorable respiratory
      effects in humans. The effects of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation and lung mechanics had been
      investigated in obstructive lung disease. Dexmedetomidine decreased dead space and improved
      both lung compliance and oxygenation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients
      undergoing lung cancer surgery. Morbidly obese patients are characterized by the high
      prevalence of restrictive lung disease.The study include 2 equal groups, each group is 35
      patients: Group A(N=35) dexmedetomidine is infused intraoperative after intubation at dose of
      (1μg/Kg LBW) bolus, followed by 0.5μg/Kg/hour continuous infusion till the end of surgery and
      Group B(N=35) dexmedetomidine is infused intraoperative after intubation at dose of (0.5μg/Kg
      LBW) bolus, followed by 0.3μg/Kg/hour continuous infusion till the end of surgery.
