      utmost importance with significant effect on survival. Procalcitonin is a reliable sepsis
      marker but results about its usefulness in initiating antimicrobials are conflicting. Our aim
      is to investigate the predictive value of 24 hours procalcitonin kinetics before starting
      empirical antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients as an indicator of the presence of
      bacterial infection.
