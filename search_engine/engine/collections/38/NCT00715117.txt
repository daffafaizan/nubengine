    
      The present proposal is designed as double-blinded placebo controlled study involving 30
      children between 6-17 years of age with active Crohn's disease. Children will be treated with
      either naltrexone or placebo for the first 8 weeks then all subjects will receive active
      naltrexone drug the last 8 weeks. A one month follow-up appointment will be scheduled 4-weeks
      after completion of the active drug for safety and to assess Crohn's activity. Low dose
      naltrexone (LDN) will be dispensed in either capsules at a dose of 4.5 mg for those ages 10
      years or older and in liquid form at 0.1 mg/kg for those under age of 10 or less than 45 kg.
      Half of the subjects in the first 8 weeks will be randomized to placebo which will be either
      capsules filled with avicel (see section 6.0) or diluent (flavored water) if in liquid form.
      Children are eligible who are not of child-bearing potential or are using two means of
      effective birth control, have a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) of at least
      31 points, and have the confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease by either endoscopic or
      radiographic tests.
