        -  Determine the impact of vaccination with adjuvant BCG and monoclonal antibody BEC2 on
           the survival of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the progression free survival in these patients after receiving this treatment
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%), and response to first
      line combined modality treatment (complete remission vs partial remission). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination with BCG and monoclonal antibody BEC2 intradermally
           on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further therapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at
           weeks 6, 12, and 24; and every 6 months thereafter until disease progression.

      Patients are followed at 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 570 patients (285 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
