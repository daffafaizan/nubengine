    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the D1 receptor occupancy (D1 RO) in striatum after a single oral
           administration of PF-06412562

        -  To assess the relationship of D1 RO in the striatum versus plasma exposure of
           PF-06412562 after a single oral administration.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To evaluate the plasma exposure of PF-06412562for the duration of PET scan following a
      single oral administration of PF-06412562.

      Safety Objectives:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06412562 of single oral doses of PF-06412562.
