      approach in reducing pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The mechanism responsible for
      this pain reduction is not well-understood. It is not known whether placing a medial or
      lateral wedge in the shoe results in alterations in lower extremity alignment, knee joint
      moments or some combination of the two. The longterm effects of this intervention on OA
      patients' functional status as well the progression of their OA has not been studied.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of in-shoe wedged orthoses in
      patients with knee OA on the frontal plane knee joint moment. Methods: 38 patients between
      the ages of 40-70 yrs with knee OA (grades I-IV) will be recruited from within the medical
      community. Subjects with a diagnosis of unilateral knee OA of greater than 3 months duration,
      as defined by the American College of Rheumatology Guidelines, will be included. 19 subjects
      will be assigned to a treatment group and 19 subjects will be assigned to a control group.
      The treatment group will receive custom molded orthotics with a lateral wedge. Both the
      treatment and control groups will be tested initially and then again 1 year later. The
      dependent variable is peak knee adduction moment. Statistics: A two-way ANOVA will be used to
      test the hypothesis. This design will include 2 levels of group (control and treatment) and
      two levels of trial (pretest and 1 yr posttest). Significance will be determined at a level
      of p<.05.
