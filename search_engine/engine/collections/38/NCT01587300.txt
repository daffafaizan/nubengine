      To establish a storage place or bank of samples of blood, bone marrow, and/or tumor, and
      molecular components isolated from these samples from children with neuroblastoma. The stored
      specimens will be shared with laboratory researchers studying high risk neuroblastoma.

      To evaluate a new test of blood and bone marrow specimens to find tumor cells. The results of
      this new test, called 5-gene TaqManÂ® Low Density Array or TLDA, will be compared between
      blood and bone marrow and imaging (radiology) studies. Radiology studies (CT scans, MRI
      scans, and MIBG scans) and the TLDA test will be compared for their ability to measure the
      amount of tumor present and how this changes with therapy.

      To collect clinical data (such as treatments received, date of diagnosis, tumor stage, etc)
      and radiology scans to provide this information as needed for the laboratory studies to be
      done on the specimens.

      To obtain neuroblastoma tumor cells from tumor tissue, bone marrow, and/or blood to use to
      start cell lines, or tumor cells that will keep growing in the laboratory. These cell lines
      will be shared with laboratory researchers studying high risk neuroblastoma.
