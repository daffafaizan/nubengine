      diagnosis of having migraine headaches will be enrolled. Thirty (30) patients will be
      recruited mainly from the primary care practice. Recruitment will include males and females
      aged 21-65. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. The patients who
      do not have migraine headaches will also be enrolled and function as controls. Non-migraine
      patients will meet inclusion criteria 1, 2 and 3 and all of the exclusion criteria.
