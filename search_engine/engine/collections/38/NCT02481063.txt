      possibility of an injury. Understand the changes in the mechanical tissues is a key tool for
      prevention.

      The evaluation of the thickness and area in tendons, the existence of new vessels within the
      tendon, muscle pennation angle or thermography are tools that have been widely used to detect
      these changes.

      Running is one of the activities that can cause more muscle-tendon injuries, specially
      overuse injuries. However, the eccentric exercise suggest to make some adaptations in
      different tissues that may be beneficial to prevent damage after exercise.
