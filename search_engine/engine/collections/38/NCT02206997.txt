      recommendations of the new german S3-guideline "Prevention of perioperative hypothermia" with
      respect to incidence and complications of perioperative hypothermia. Prewarming should enable
      the patients to preserve their core temperature for a longer period and to avoid
      perioperative hypothermia.The study hypothesis is that postoperative core temperature in
      adult patients after prewarming is significantly higher than in patients who were treated
      following the actual standard protocol (passive insulation).
