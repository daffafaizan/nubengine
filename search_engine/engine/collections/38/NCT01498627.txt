      a drug on the risk of adverse events that are infrequent and/or with a long delay of onset.
      It uses some characteristics of the ad hoc case-control or case-referent design, transposed
      on a prospective, on-going, population-based recruitment plan. This particular design is
      called here systematic case-referent design in contrast to the ad hoc case-control or
      case-referent methodology. The PGRx information system is based on the routine and targeted
      recruitment of cases of a series of pathologies, compared to population-based referents for
      the study of exposure to a wide variety of drugs. Drug exposure ascertainment is obtained
      from two different sources in the PGRx.

      system: A) A structured patient interview (telephone-administered questionnaire) B) The
      medical data form with the computerized medical prescriptions (interview guide)
