        -  To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival of patients with extensive-stage small
           cell lung cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate in combination with cisplatin and
           etoposide.

        -  To evaluate the 1-year overall survival and response rate in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the safety of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on
      days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily beginning
      on day 1 of course 1 and continuing for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
