      influenced by the design and the specific sizing strategy. Design determines the actual
      geometric orifice area (GOA), sizing strategy the actual size of the selected valve.
      Currently, hemodynamic performance is generally assessed by determining the effective orifice
      area (EOA, derived from the continuity equation by relating flow velocities and LVOT area).
      The question whether a prosthesis patient mismatch (PPM) is present is then addressed by
      relating EOA to body surface area (EOAi). However, this relation may not be reasonable
      because EOAi relates flow velocity twice to patient-specific anatomic parameters (LVOT area
      and body surface area) . Considering this potential methodological flaw, debate and confusion
      regarding PPM is easily understood, despite the fact that, intuitively leaving a gradient
      behind after aortic valve replacement cannot be irrelevant. Thus a reliable and comparable
      method to determine the presence of PPM is needed. In PAR I Trial the relation between true
      prothetic GOA and LVOT area will be assesses as a potentially new parameter for prediction of
      hemodynamic outcome, to possibly guide future valve size selection (inclusive valve-in-valve)
      and to allow the detection of functionally relevant PPM. In the trial it will be assessed how
      anatomic dimensions of patients and implanted valves relate to each other and whether they
      allow the prediction of hemodynamic outcome.
