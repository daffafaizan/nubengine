      detected by one or several muscle groups and reflected pain manifestation caused by palpation
      of these points. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a physical therapy
      modality that provides an analgesic effect by delivering a controlled low voltage electrical
      current to the nervous system through electrodes placed on the skin. Knowledge on how
      modulation parameters such as frequency, wave width and form alter TENS activity are limited.
