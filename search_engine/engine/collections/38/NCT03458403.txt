      teach and learn complex endoscopic procedures. Nowadays experts are facing the challenge of
      explaining precisely an elaborate choreography of movements performed during the procedure,
      while novices are confronted with a broad range of hand, wrist and shoulder movements each
      resulting in different endoscope responses. The teaching strategy of endoscopy could benefit
      from a dedicated motion library that would associate the endoscopist's motion and the
      consequent endoscope response. A simplified endoscopic language made of individual motions
      could greatly shorten the learning curve.

      The aim of the study is to record and analyze endoscopist and endoscope motions to identify
      key movements in flexible endoscopy.
