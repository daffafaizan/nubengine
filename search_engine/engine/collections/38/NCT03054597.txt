      around thirteen hours of video games per week. When their eyes are focused, people tend to
      blink their eyes less, exacerbating the problem of eye fatigue or stress. The objective of
      this study is to see if a novel exercise technique can increase eye muscle strength and widen
      peripheral vision. Experiments were conducted by asking the test subjects to follow, with
      their eyes, a set of blinking LED lights on 3 vision exercise devices. These LED lights were
      laid in circular or diagonal configurations, and programmed using a microcontroller to blink
      or 'move' in certain directions and at certain speeds. An endurance score, measured as total
      time that the test subject completed while following the blinking LED lights before his/her
      eyes became tired, was recorded. Nineteen test subjects aged 12-81 were asked to exercise
      their eyes four times over 2 weeks using the devices for as long as they could until they
      experienced mild eye fatigue. Endurance scores, peripheral vision, and peripheral reading
      ranges were assessed before and after the training sessions.
