    
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 41 elderly
      subjects with previous evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction to evaluate whether the
      administration of MTP-131 (elamipretide) will change either hand skeletal muscle energetics
      or muscle performance in age-related skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either elamipretide at 0.25 mg/kg/hr intravenously at
      a rate of 60 mL/hr for 2 hours, or placebo (lyophilized excipients without elamipretide)
      intravenously at a rate of 60 mL/hr for 2 hours. Each treatment group went through three
      distinct periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (1day), and Observation (7 days).
