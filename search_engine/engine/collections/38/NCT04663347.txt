    
      The following regimens will be investigated:

        -  Arm 1: epcoritamab + rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
           prednisone (R-CHOP) in subjects with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
           (DLBCL)

        -  Arm 2: epcoritamab + rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in subjects with
           relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL)

        -  Arm 3: epcoritamab + rituximab and bendamustine (BR) in subjects with previously
           untreated FL

        -  Arm 4: epcoritamab + rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (R-DHAX/C) in
           subjects with R/R DLBCL eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)

        -  Arm 5: epcoritamab + gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) in subjects with R/R DLBCL
           ineligible for ASCT due to age, performance status (PS), or comorbidity

      For each arm, there are 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (expansion). Within each
      arm, subjects can only participate in one part.
