      have been shown to improve outcomes for both DM and MDD for use in primary care. More
      specifically, the aims are: 1) to evaluate the benefits of CDDI in improving diabetic
      outcomes compared to usual care for MDD plus disease self-management for diabetes; 2) to
      evaluate the benefits of CDDI in improving depression outcomes compared to the UC for MDD
      treatment protocol; and 3) to evaluate the benefits of CDDI in terms of improved (1)
      cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, body mass index, lipids, and abdominal fat), (2)
      levels of exercise and better diet, (3) clinician and patient satisfaction with care, (4)
      fidelity to treatment guidelines, and (5) cognitive function.
