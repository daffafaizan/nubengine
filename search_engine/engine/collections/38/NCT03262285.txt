      in developing countries. Population-based studies have reported that cataract is responsible
      for 47.8% to 51% of all global blindness.

      Several studies compared phacoemulsification and conventional extracapsular cataract
      extraction regarding several aspects such as postoperative inflammation and visual
      rehabilitation. studies proved that phacoemulsification has faster rehabilitation ,less
      astigmatism and better postoperative vision .However, Extracapsular cataract extraction is
      still the operation of choice in some cataract cases.

      The normal corneal endothelium is a single layer of uniformly sized cells with a
      predominantly hexagonal shape. Adult density of approximately 2400 - 3200 cells/mmÂ².The
      number of cells decreases at about 0.6% per year and neighbouring cells enlarge to fill the
      space as the cells cannot regenerate.The minimum cell density necessary for adequate function
      is in the range of 400 to 700 cells/mm2.

      The effect of cataract surgery on corneal endothelium is an important factor that affects
      postoperative vision .However, it is accepted all over the world that there is definite loss
      of some endothelial cells with all techniques of cataract surgery. Previously, cataract
      surgery caused enormous loss of endothelial cells , but with enhancement of equipment and
      surgical techniques, cataract surgery today results in 6-14%loss of endothelial cells.

      Specular microscopy is a noninvasive photographic technique that allows visualization and
      analysis of corneal endothelium. specular microscopy is used to show cell count and cell
      shape in the scanned area.
