    
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of JCAR017 in adult patients with aggressive B-cell NHL. The study will enroll
      patients in Europe and Japan with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise
      specified (NOS; de novo or transformed follicular lymphoma [tFL]), high-grade B-cell lymphoma
      with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology (HGBL), follicular lymphoma
      Grade 3B (FL3B), and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Patients with secondary
      central nervous system (CNS) involvement are allowed.

      Once enrolled, patients will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 cell product generation.
      Upon successful JCAR017 cell product generation, patients will receive lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy followed by infusion of JCAR017. JCAR017 will be administered at a dose of 100 x
      10^6 JCAR017-positive transfected viable T cells by intravenous infusion. Patients will be
      followed for approximately 2 years after their JCAR017 infusion for safety, disease status,
      survival and health-related quality of life.

      Delayed adverse events following exposure to gene modified T cells will be assessed and
      long-term persistence of these modified T cells will continue to be monitored under a
      separate long-term follow-up protocol for up to 15 years after JCAR017 infusion as per
      competent authority guidelines.
