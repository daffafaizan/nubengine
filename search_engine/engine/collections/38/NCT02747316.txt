      be reduced, leading to iron deficiency over time. How all this will influence iron supply of
      the fetus in obese pregnancy has not been well investigated to date. Even if maternal and
      fetal iron uptakes are regulated separately, it is unclear to what extent maternal
      subclinical inflammation might influence this process. A small study by Dao et al. indicated
      that maternal-fetal iron transfer was impaired in obese pregnant women, possibly due to
      hepcidin up-regulation. In this study, both maternal BMI as well as hepcidin were negatively
      correlated with cord blood iron status. Maternal hepcidin and c-reactive protein were
      significantly higher and cord blood iron was significantly lower in the obese compared to the
      normal weight. Hepcidin was shown to have an effect on iron transfer across the placenta in
      the study by Young et al.: the transfer was increased in women with undetectable hepcidin at
      delivery compared to those with higher levels. As of now, clear associations between maternal
      BMI or maternal hepcidin concentration and fetal iron status were not shown.
