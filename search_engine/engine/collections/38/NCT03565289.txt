      outcome, i.e. distinguishing PCa from benign prostatic conditions as well as high-grade
      cancer. The quantities of the two protein analytes cathepsin D (CTSD) and thrombospondin 1
      (THBS1) are measured in human serum samples. In combination with percent free PSA (%fPSA),
      the results are correlated with prostate biopsy outcome. The potential future benefit of
      using this glycoprotein panel is to validate positive tPSA tests in men with negative digital
      rectal examination (DRE) and enlarged prostates to reduce the need for undergoing a biopsy,
      thereby reducing unnecessary biopsies and potentially predicting high-grade disease.
