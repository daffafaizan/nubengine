      injection, in subgroup of patient they fail to fertilize or poorly fertilized, some authors
      recommend chemical activation for those group of patient with Ca ionophore but still with Ca
      ionophore there are some cases with total fertilization failure or low fertilization
      specially in those patient with 2 separate factors like teratozoospermia with poor quality
      Oocytes so the investigators decided to test the effect of double activation methods by using
      tow agents proven with life birth rate Ca ionophore and strontium chloride.

      We Do intracytoplasmic sperm injection and immediately activate oocyte with Ca Ionophore
      followed by strontium chloride activation and monitoring the embryogenesis until the
      blastocyst formation and pregnancy outcome in multicenter assessment.
