      care despite numerous medications being available to prevent and treat CINV.

      CINV decreases quality of life in roughly one third of patients receiving highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy. In addition, roughly half to two thirds of all patients receiving chemotherapy
      require rescue anti-emetic medications despite being given guideline-based prophylactic
      anti-emetics.The anti-emesis armamentarium continues to grow with new medications, including
      olanzapine and fosaprepitant, being studied in recent years. However, despite the addition of
      these medications and guideline-based antiemetic regimens, the ability to control CINV is
      still inadequate as even moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy regimens cause roughly 20% of
      patients to have vomiting and over 40% to experience significant nausea.

      In this study, the investigators aim to test a new transcranial vibrating system that has
      shown promise in phase I studies for treating dizziness, motion sickness and nausea.
