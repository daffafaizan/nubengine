      Subjects will be screened for up to 28 days before study drug administration to ensure that
      all eligibility criteria are met. On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 dose groups
      of 15 subjects each (INCB047986 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, or placebo QD). Study drug will be self
      administered on Days 1 through 28. A follow-up telephone call to the subject to assess safety
      will occur at Day 42. A final safety and efficacy evaluation will be performed at the Day 58
      visit.
