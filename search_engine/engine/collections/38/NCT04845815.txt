      of these functions can give rise to a host of disorders. These disorders can lead to life
      threatening disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance. In Egypt, there is little
      data about these disorders. Many of these cases are diagnosed late, therefore Early suspicion
      for diagnosis can improve the overall clinical outcome of these children. As a result,
      starting management early will help those children have a better life. Therefore awareness
      about these disorders and long-term outcome is really important. The investigators present
      the clinical characterizations of many tubular disorder and the follow up in our center.

      The aim of this study is to reveal the different clinical presentations and the main lab
      features of renal tubular disorders in children to promote early recognition and management.
