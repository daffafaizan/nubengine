    
      The other objectives are :

        -  the evaluation of the hyperinflation defined by an increase of the residual volume (RV),

        -  the observation of the relationship between the hyperinflation and the asthma
           characteristics,

        -  the study of the improvement of the functional parameters after a reversibility test

        -  the evaluation of the correlation between hyperinflation parameters evolution, chest
           tightness and dyspnea
