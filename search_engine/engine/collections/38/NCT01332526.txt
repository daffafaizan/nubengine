    
      The study will be performed in two experimental groups. Proposed study groups Study I
      Patients with BMI> 30 and metabolic syndrome. Patient with BMI> 30 without metabolic
      syndrome. Normal healthy controls. Study II Patients with CKD stage III and uric acid < 7
      mg/dl Patients with CKD stage III and uric acid > 7 mg/dl Patient with asymptomatic
      hyperuricemia and eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, , uric acid > 7 mg/dl Hemodialysis patients

      Characteristics of the particular patients group- including criteria:

      10- 15 participants in each subset of each group age 18-65 y. Gender: females and males in
      equal proportion. Group I Patients with BMI> 30 and metabolic syndrome ( ATP III). Patient
      with BMI> 30 without metabolic syndrome. Normal healthy control- healthy persons( without
      renal disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, BMI < 25;normotensives ).

      Group II Patients with CKD stage III (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1,73 m2) and uric acid < 7 mg/dl.

        -  without diabetes mellitus proteinuria < 3,5 g/24 h without immunosuppressive agents,
           ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment well controlled hypertension ( < 140/90 mmHg) Patients
           with CKD stage III(GFR 30-59 ml/min/1,73 m2) and uric acid > 7 mg/dl

        -  without diabetes mellitus proteinuria < 3,5 g/24 h without immunosuppressive agents,
           ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment well controlled hypertension ( < 140/90 mmHg)

      Patient with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, uric acid > 7 mg/dl with normal renal function
      Hemodialysis patients.

        -  CKD: nondiabetic nephropathy

        -  duration hemodialysis 3-48 months

        -  Hb-11-13 g/dl

        -  well controlled hypertension ( < 140/90 mmHg)

        -  without ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment

        -  residual diuresis will be estimated for last 48 hours-between mid and next dialysis
           Method of investigation All patients and controls ( but hemodialysis) will present after
           overnight fast. Baseline tests include 24 hr urine collection for: sodium, calcium,
           phosphorus, creatinine, uric acid, NAG, albumin will be carry out and the same morning
           fasting sample of blood for: creatinine, cystatin C , uric acid, sodium, glucose,
           insulin, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, hsCRP. BP will be
           determined as the mean of three readings taken 5 min apart while sitting. Next in all
           patients and controls fructose tolerance test will be performed. The test consists of
           giving 1 gram/kg b.w. of fructose p.o. with blood collection at 0,30,60 and 120 min
           afterward for serum uric acid determination and uric acid area under the curve will be
           calculated. The calculated area under curve is the measure of occult uric acid
           disturbance when compared to controls.

      Day before the urine collection the ABPM , BMI, IM (intima media ratio) , renal duplex
      ultrasound (RI) will be done

      Measure BMI, waist circumference
