      failure and the many insights that it provided for the development of new therapies, there is
      increasing clinical evidence that suggests that our current models fail to completely explain
      the disease progression. Thus, neurohormonal models may be necessary but not sufficient to
      explain all aspects of disease progression in the failing heart. There is evidence suggesting
      that in heart failure there is a metabolic imbalance characterized by the predominance of the
      catabolic status over the anabolic drive.

      Aim of this registry is to determine the prevalence of hormone/metabolic deficiencies in
      heart failure patients and to look for possible association with clinical variables.
      Moreover, enrolled patients will be followed up for a mean of 2,5 years in order to collect
      outcome data including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalizations.
