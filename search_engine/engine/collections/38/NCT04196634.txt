        -  To compare the predictive ability of the STarT MSK tool and the Ã–MPSQ-SF, and other
           established risk factors for long-term sickness absence (e.g. symptoms of depression and
           emotional distress, low motivation for returning to work, low self-efficacy, work
           expectancies) for identifying prolonged sickness absence at 6- and 12-months follow-up
           due to MSK conditions

        -  To develop a prognostic model to predict risk of prolonged sickness absence at 12-month
           follow-up in people with MSK conditions

        -  To assess predictors for high costs (productivity loss and health care use) at 6- and
           12-months follow-up in people on sick leave due to MSK conditions

      The study will also include additional methodological and descriptive aims.

      Prior to the data collection we translated and culturally adapted the Keele STarT MSK and
      MSK-HQ following the Beaton guidelines.

      The study is conducted within the Norwegian Welfare and Labor Administration (NAV) system in
      collaboration with OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University. Data on sickness absence from the
      NAV registry will be retrieved prospectively in the period from study inclusion to 12 months
      follow-up, and retrospectively 12 months prior to inclusion in the study.

      Previous studies show that 30-40% of people with MSK conditions have not RtW after 3 to 12
      months. In order to conduct analyses including 15- 20 predictor variables, we aim at
      including 500-600 people on sick leave due to MSK conditions. As the main outcomes are
      collected through registries, we do not expect any dropouts.
