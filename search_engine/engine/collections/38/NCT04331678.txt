      provides wide-ranging functionality, including: reminders for appointments and tasks, the
      ability to track health measures (fitness, emotion, pain, sleep), archive health related
      documents, maintain notes and recordings from visits, social networking functions to connect
      with family and friends to coordinate support activities and share news, and educational
      resources. We will randomize 230 patients initiating chemotherapy cancer treatment and up to
      one caregiver to the App group (asked to use the app once or more per week) or the Usual Care
      group, and evaluate the 3-month efficacy of app use on key outcomes.
