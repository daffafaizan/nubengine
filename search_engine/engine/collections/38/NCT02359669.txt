      growing up milk (GUM) fortified in micronutrients and cognitive stimulation on cognitive
      abilities, mother-child- interaction and behavior in children of 3 to 5 years from less
      enriched home environments with HOME score less than 26. The control group will receive
      skimmed milk but no extra stimulation materials ( however, no restrictions on normal
      mother-child interaction). The cognitive abilities, mother-child interaction and child
      behavior will be assessed after a 6 months intervention.
