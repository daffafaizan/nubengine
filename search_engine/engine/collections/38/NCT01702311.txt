      bedtime, has not been prospectively evaluated in insulin-treated patients with T2DM. In the
      non-ICU setting, practice guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with
      T2DM favor the use of physiologic (basal-nutritional-correction dose) insulin regimens over
      sliding scale regular insulin. POC testing is invasive and painful, and has the limitation of
      providing glycemic profile that is an incomplete picture of BG excursions and is not always
      an accurate method to monitor glucose compared to laboratory assays in addition to the major
      expense in health care delivery. The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct the
      first prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the POC glucose testing and
      use of insulin supplementation at bedtime in improving glycemic control and in preventing
      hypoglycemia in insulin-treated non-ICU patients with T2DM. The central hypothesis of this
      proposal is that routine BG measurement and insulin supplementation at bedtime does not
      improve glycemic control or reduce frequency of hypoglycemia in insulin treated medicine and
      surgery patients with T2DM.
