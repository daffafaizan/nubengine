      young adult survivors of childhood cancer do not engage in the recommended healthcare
      designed to detect late effects and secondary cancers. There is a scarcity of data on
      adherence to survivor-focused healthcare, particularly at the critical transition from
      pediatrics to adult care. In order to improve transition outcomes, the investigators need to
      create media to educate survivors about need for adherence to adult survivor healthcare.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of electronic educational materials on AYA survivors'
      knowledge about late effects, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and intentions to engage in
      lifelong survivor care.
