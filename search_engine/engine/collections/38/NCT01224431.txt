      evaluation of meningitis. Subcutaneous injection of lidocaine prior to lumbar puncture for
      local anesthesia is not a pain free procedure. The J-Tip Device allows an intradermal
      needle-free jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine. This study compares needle-free jet
      injection of lidocaine to saline in reducing pain prior to lumbar puncture in infants.

      Methods: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial involving infants, less than 3
      months of age, presenting to the emergency department meeting clinical criteria for a lumbar
      puncture. All patients were administered the J-tip and randomized to either treatment with 1%
      lidocaine or an equivalent amount of sterile normal saline prior to lumbar puncture. Vital
      signs were recorded during the procedure. Facial expressions as well as crying times were
      video recorded from start to finish. Independent reviewers assigned pain scores based on the
      validated Neonatal Facial Coding System with possible scores ranging from 0-5.
