      relationship with glucose and lipid metabolism, placental function, and newborn size. To do
      this we will conduct both a prospective cohort study of pregnant women without
      pre-gestational or early gestational diabetes assessed at both 12-16 weeks gestation and at
      32-36 weeks gestation and a case-control study of women with normal and impaired glucose
      tolerance in the early third trimester. Physical assessments will be performed by the Oregon
      Health and Science University bio-nutrition unit and will include the use of magnetic
      resonance imaging, ultrasound, and blood draws.
