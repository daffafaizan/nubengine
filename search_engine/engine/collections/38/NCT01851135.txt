    
      The study cohort will consist of 150 patients with NF1 (100 adults and 50 children) recruited
      from the Neurofibromatosis Clinic at the University Hospital in Nantes and Cr√©teil (France).
      A sample of 150 healthy controls (100 adults and 50 children) will also be recruited from
      sport and leisure clubs to serve as a normally developing control group.

      The protocol assessment includes a standard and thorough neuropsychological examination
      specific to children and adults, to investigate the different aspects of cognitive domains:
      language, visuoperceptive and visuomotor abilities, memory, attention, executive function and
      intelligence skills. Quality of life is measured by a questionnaire specifically adapted to
      children and adults.

      Other factors linked to the NF1 disease (familial or sporadic form, severity and visibility)
      and to demographic characteristics (sex, age, education level) will be taken into account to
      study their respective impact on quality of life, as compared with neuropsychological
      measures.
