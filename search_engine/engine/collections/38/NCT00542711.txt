    
      Twelve healthy participants enrolled to the study. All volunteers will have pre study
      evaluation to confirm healthy state. After enrollment, each participant will be tested twice,
      one with the liquid tumeric/curcumin (study drug) and once with the curcumin powder
      (control). The days of testing will be on two days, separated by two weeks wash-out period.
      The participants will be assigned to randomly receive study drug or control on the 1st day,
      with the other regimen administered at the 2nd day. Both study drug and control will be
      diluted in 150ml of water. The doe of study drug will be escalated from 30 drops (4
      participants), 50 drops (4 participants) and 70 drops (4 participants). Blood sample will be
      collected at 0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,2,3,4,5,6,8h post drug. Quantization of curcumin plasma levels
      will be done by the high pressure liquid chormatography method. A biomarker for the potential
      effect of curcumin, platelet function pre and post curcumin consumption will be tested.
