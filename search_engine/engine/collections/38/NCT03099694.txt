      pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes in very low birth weight infants. Various modes of
      non-invasive respiratory support are being increasingly used to minimize the incidence of
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this trials to compare the effect of noninvasive
      high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (NCPAP) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as a primary noninvasive
      ventilation support mode.

      Methods/Design:In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 300 preterm infants at
      gestational age (GA) less than 34 weeks with a diagnosis of RDS will be randomized to NHFOV
      or NCPAP as a primary mode of non-invasive respiratory support. Study will be conducted in 18
      tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China.

      The primary outcome is the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)during the first 7
      days after enrollment in preterm infants randomized to the two groups. The secondary outcomes
      include days of hospitalization, days on noninvasive respiratory support, days on IMV, days
      on supplemental oxygen, mortality, need for surfactant, incidence of retinopathy of
      prematurity(ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD), occurrence of abdominal distention, air
      leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH â‰¥ grade 3) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC> II
      stage). Other secondary outcomes include scores of Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 2
      months and 2 years of corrected age.
