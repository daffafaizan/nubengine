      period which, in turn, may lead to organ morbidity. Currently, in routine surgical procedures
      in otherwise healthy children, hemodynamic status in the perioperative period is primarily
      assessed by non-invasive systemic blood pressure management. While this approach can detect
      systemic arterial hypotension, it does not provide us with guidance on whether the decrease
      in blood pressure is the result of changes in cardiac output and/or in systemic vascular
      resistance. This information would be important to know since treatment modalities may
      differ.

      Recent technical development in electrical cardiometry allows us to non-invasively monitor
      cardiac output. The accuracy of the method has been validated in neonatal and pediatric
      cohorts, and electrical cardiometry is now regularly used to monitor cardiac output in the
      perioperative setting. Nevertheless, the temporal patterns of cardiac output changes in
      otherwise healthy young children undergoing routine surgical procedures have not been
      systematically reported. This information is important since it will increase our
      understanding of hemodynamic changes in small children during anesthesia/surgery and would
      ultimately lead to a better anesthesia care in this patient population.

      The primary objective of this pilot exploratory observational study is to describe temporal
      patterns of cardiac output in young children ( under18 months of age) during the
      perioperative period. The secondary objectives are to describe how changes in cardiac output
      are associated with (i) non-invasively-measured systemic arterial blood pressure; (ii)
      near-infrared spectroscopy; (iii) other anesthesia factors (arterial oxygen saturation,
      concentration of anesthesia agents, CO2 levels).
