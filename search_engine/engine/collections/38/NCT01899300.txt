    
      The purpose of this study is to establish clinical proof of concept of temporary indwell of
      the WallFlex™ Esophageal Fully Covered Metal Stent (FCMS) for the treatment of refractory
      benign esophageal strictures caused by caustic ingestion. Also to collect data in support of
      a hypothesis required to prospectively document the safety and effectiveness of temporary
      indwell of the WallFlex™ Esophageal Fully Covered Metal Stent (FCMS) compared to repeated
      Bougie Dilation for the treatment of refractory benign esophageal strictures caused by
      caustic ingestion.
