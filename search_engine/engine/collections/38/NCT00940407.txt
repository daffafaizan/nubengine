      may progress to the wet form where leaking and bleeding in the retina can cause sudden severe
      visual loss.

      There are no proven active treatments for Dry AMD. Dry AMD accounts for over 80% of AMD
      cases.

      There are estimated to be 30 million people afflicted with AMD by the year 2020 in North
      America.

      Photobiomodulation in this study is utilised by using two devices that are already approved
      for other indications by the FDA and Health Canada.

      Photobiomodulation is a novel clinical application for treating dry AMD. As this is a pilot
      study there is no placebo or control group.
