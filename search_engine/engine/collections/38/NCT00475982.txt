      progression and mortality from prostate cancer. Prior work in the investigators' laboratory
      in pre-clinical prostate cancer models and in obese men found that a low fat diet, exercise,
      and weight loss resulted in antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on prostate cancer
      tissue through mechanisms related to the IGF-axis. The investigators now propose to conduct a
      prospective, randomized clinical trial in overweight and obese men with prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy to evaluate if weight loss prior to radical prostatectomy
      results in antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in prostate cancer tissue. The
      investigators will accomplish this aim by enrolling overweight and obese men with prostate
      cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. Following informed consent, men will be
      randomized to either immediate radical prostatectomy or to an 8-week weight loss intervention
      group that will undergo a diet and exercise weight loss program followed by radical
      prostatectomy. Proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in the prostatectomy
      specimen will be compared between the groups and relative to the baseline prostate needle
      biopsy specimens. Further studies will evaluate potential serum surrogate biomarkers that the
      investigators developed in the investigators' laboratory (ex-vivo serum bioassays) and serum
      and tissue IGF-axis proteins that have previously been related to obesity, weight loss, and
      prostate cancer progression. The goal of the investigators' project will be to evaluate the
      potential anticancer effects of weight loss on prostate cancer tissue and to identify
      surrogate serum biomarkers that reflect antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic tissue effects
      and can be applied to future secondary prevention trials in overweight and obese prostate
      cancer survivors.
