    
      The Trammpolin® meniscus prosthesis is intended to replace the native medial meniscus to
      provide pain relief in the medial compartment of the knee joint, when this is caused by
      medial partial meniscectomy.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who are implanted with the Trammpolin®
      meniscus prosthesis will be followed for 2 years. The patient reported outcome measures for
      knee pain and function, and knee clinical condition by MRI and X-ray is assessed
      post-operative compared to pre-operative.
