      placement after ERCP reduces the risk of PEP but the optimal duration of stent placement
      remains an open question. It has been suggested that in truly high-risk patients the
      pancreatic stent must be left in place for a minimum of 24 hours or more whereas in patients
      at lesser risk pancreatic duct drainage probably only needs to be maintained for a few hours
      or less. Leaving the stent in place at the end of the ERCP procedure carries the disadvantage
      of radiological follow-up until spontaneous dislodgment occurs or endoscopic removal is
      deemed timely; moreover, proximal migration has been reported, requiring endoscopic or even
      surgical removal. There is a paucity of data comparing immediate removal with spontaneous
      dislodgment in high-risk patients. In one study, significantly higher rates of PEP were
      detected in patients in whom a pancreatic stent was removed immediately at the end of the
      ERCP procedure than in those in whom the stent was left in place: unfortunately, only
      patients undergoing a precut sphincterotomy were evaluated in that study which was published
      only in abstract form. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether leaving a stent in place is
      more effective than immediate removal in preventing PEP in high-risk patients.
