    
      In this study, metabolite profiling analysis will be carried out on urine samples of
      individuals with malodor conditions related to metabolism inefficiencies. Metabolic profiles
      will be identified using the metabolomics equipment located in the NMR, HPLC and MS
      facilities of the Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC). Multivariate statistical analyses
      will be used, as well as other approaches to mine complex data from heterogeneous sources.
