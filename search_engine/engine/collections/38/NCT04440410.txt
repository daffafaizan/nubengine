    
      This study is an exploratory correlative study in subjects with HS or AD. Blood samples and
      skin biopsies will be collected from all subjects and used to assess the following: cutaneous
      and circulating inflammatory biomarkers and IRAK4 target levels in primary samples,
      correlations between cutaneous and circulating inflammatory biomarkers and disease severity,
      effects of IRAK4 degradation on IRAK4 levels and downstream inflammatory biomarkers in ex
      vivo-treated whole blood from patients.

      De-identified routine clinical data that is collected will be correlated with the research
      findings.
