      esophagus, scleroderma, diffuse esophageal spasm or hypertensive LES) previously referred for
      clinical esophageal motility testing will be contacted. These twenty subjects must have
      previously undergone esophageal manometry testing using the standard clinical protocol at the
      University of Utah motility with solid state manometry catheters. After obtaining informed
      consent, these twenty subjects will undergo the esophageal manometry using air-filled balloon
      catheters per the standard clinical protocol. Following the repeat procedure a short one-page
      questionnaire will be completed by the subject and the motility nurse.

      Five subjects with the diagnosis of incontinence previously referred for clinical anorectal
      motility testing will be contacted. These five subjects must have previously undergone
      anorectal manometry using the standard clinical protocol for an anorectal manometry study
      with water perfused anorectal manometry catheters. After obtaining informed consent, these
      five subjects will undergo the anorectal manometry using air-filled balloon catheters per the
      standard clinical protocol. Following the repeat procedure a short one-page questionnaire
      will be completed by the subject and the motility nurse.
