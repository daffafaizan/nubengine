    
      Aim: To investigate the glucagonostatic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) during
      prolonged and intermittent stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor independent of the gastric
      emptying rate. Glucagon concentrations will be measured following a liquid meal administered
      in duodenum at baseline and after exenatide, and liraglutide treatment.
