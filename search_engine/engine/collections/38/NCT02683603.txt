      aerosolised (AS) colistin versus colistin intravenously (IV). Included were patients who have
      mechanical ventilation over 48 hours and that have developed a VAP. A VAP was defined as a
      CPIS (Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score) >6. Exclusion criteria were septic shock and/or
      bacteraemia. Included patients were divided into two randomized groups. The 1st received
      colistin in AS as 4 MU by nebulisation 3 times per 24 h. The 2nd received colistin in IV as a
      loading dose of 9 MU followed by 4.5MU two times per 24 h. Colistin was given for 14 days or
      until extubation. Patients were followed for 28 days. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by a
      primary outcome: the cure of VAP at day 14 of therapy and defined as resolution of clinical
      and biological signs of infection that means a CPIS< 6 and bacteriological eradication.
      Secondary outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay-length and mortality at day
      28. Systemic toxicity was assessed by the occurrence of acute renal failure (ARF) defined as
      increase of plasma creatinine more than 1.5 times its base value.
