    
      -  To reduce the number of donors treated with intravenous (IV) AMD3100 who require a
           second collection to obtain the minimum CD34/kg (2 X 106) necessary for allogeneic stem
           cell transplantation when compared to our historic group who received 240ug SC AMD3100
           from 33% (8 in 24) to 11% (3 in 27).

        -  To estimate with 95% confidence intervals the proportion of human leukocyte antigen
           (HLA)-identical sibling donors who experience grade 3-4 infusional toxicity and the
           proportion from whom â‰¥ 2.0 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight are safely mobilized
           following one or two intravenous infusions.

        -  To determine the kinetics of stem cell and lymphocyte mobilization using IV AMD3100 and
           to determine if peripheral blood stem cell products collected after mobilization with IV
           AMD3100 can be used safely for hematopoietic cell transplantation in HLA-matched
           recipients as measured by neutrophil engraftment by day +21.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IV AMD3100 on stem cell and
           T-cell phenotyping and on immune reconstitution after transplantation.

        -  To determine the rate of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD in
           patients who receive IV AMD3100 mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.
