      making strategy. With less or even zero neurotoxicity grade 2-4 (defined as worst toxicity),
      the Nal-IRI plus 5FU/LV (Fluorouracil/leucovorin)combination is expected to outperform the
      standard combination capecitabine plus oxaliplatin and may also outperform capecitabine plus
      carboplatin. To compensate for a higher neurotoxicity grade 2-4 level, the capecitabine
      combinations should demonstrate increased progression free survival (PFS) according to the
      next schedule.

      Table 1. Decision making strategy

      Difference in % neurotoxicity grade 2-4 Compensating Increase in PFS >10 - 30% + 3 months >30
      - 50% + 4 months

      The total number to be included will be 269. Patients will be randomized to respectively the
      Nal-IRI plus 5FU, the capecitabine plus carboplatin and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin group
      following a 2:2:1 scheme until 49 patients have been included in the capecitabine plus
      oxaliplatin group and following a 1:1:0 scheme 10 afterwards for the remaining patients.
      Taking into account 15% withdrawal of patients from the trial before start of study
      medication, the investigators will include 310 patients.
