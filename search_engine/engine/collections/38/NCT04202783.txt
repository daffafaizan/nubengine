      agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial
      ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be
      demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes are thought to play a
      normal physiological role in intercellular signaling, and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and
      pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports. Clinical trials have
      deployed exosomes intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection, and have
      claimed safety and clinical efficacy.

      Focused ultrasound has been shown to enhance local blood flow and has been presented as a
      non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents.
