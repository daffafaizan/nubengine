      promotes biliary fibrosis. BA is the leading cause of pediatric chronic end-stage liver
      disease and pediatric liver transplantation. Relief of cholestasis by the Kasai
      portoenterostomy is only partly successful with continued progression of fibrosis to hepatic
      insufficiency and, for long term survival, with eventual need for liver transplantation in
      the majority of the patients. In animal models of liver injury, GCSF enhances hematopoietic
      stem cell HSC mobilization and engraftment in the liver with associated improved liver repair
      response and attenuated hepatic necrosis and fibrosis. Randomized controlled trials of GCSF
      intervention for chronic liver failure in adult patients with acute hepatic decompensation
      showed improved short-term survival and hepatic indices such the model for end-stage liver
      disease (MELD) scores.

      The Investigators propose that post Kasai GCSF therapy attenuates biliary fibrosis and
      progression to cirrhosis. The objectives are meant to demonstrate that Kasai-GCSF sequential
      therapy improves biliary drainage, and delays the progression of hepatic insufficiency.
      Toward this goal, Investigators will first evaluate in post Kasai subjects the maximum
      tolerated dose of GCSF in mobilizing circulating CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, with the
      limiting dose based on GCSF-related severe adverse effects. A one-month safety of GCSF will
      be tested with the 2 standard doses of 5 ug/kg/d and 10 ug/kg/d.
