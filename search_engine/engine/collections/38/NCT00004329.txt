      An oral challenge is administered as follows: clonidine on day 1, yohimbine on day 2. The
      order of administration is reversed in alternate subjects.

      Timed measurements of norepinephrine, glycerol, and free fatty acids follow each challenge.
      Structural gene sequencing is evaluated for each participant.
