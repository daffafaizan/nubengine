      Those CT images that were retrospectively reviewed by experienced radiologists. The CT scans
      of 1000-1500 subjects aged 50 and above with and without thoracic or lumbar compression
      fractures were included in this project for machine learning and deep learning. The control
      group included those without compression fractures while the patient group were those with
      compression fractures. Subjects that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded.

      The cortical layer of the T12-L5 spine images were manually labelled with the labeling
      software by the the technologists and confirmed the correctness of the image by an
      experienced radiologist. All the de-linked and completed images were provided to Quanta
      Computer Inc. for subsequent classification and analysis of AI machines for deep learning to
      facilitate the development of a system for automatic detection of pressure fractures by CT.
      This newly developed automatic system will be of valuable clinical impact in assisting
      radiologists to detect and classify vertebral compression fractures precisely and accurately.
