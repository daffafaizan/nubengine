      Î²-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), as a potential neurotoxin responsible for this disease. BMAA
      is a non-essential amino acid and is produced by a cyanobacterium which is present in all
      ecosystems. Subsequently several groups have identified high concentrations of BMAA in brain
      tissues of patients from North America and Europe with several neurodegenerative diseases
      including ALS, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Diseases. It has been hypothesized that
      chronic intake of BMAA in the diet leads to mis-incorporation of the amino acid into brain
      proteins, where it produces slow neuronal damage and recent evidence has shown that BMAA is
      mis-incorporated into proteins in neuronal cell lines via seryl tRNA synthetase, thereby
      producing protein mis-folding and protein aggregates, leading to cell death. It has been
      demonstrated in mammalian neuronal cell cultures that exogenous L-serine could prevent the
      BMAA neurotoxin from being mis-incorporated into proteins, thereby preventing cell death and
      that very high doses of L-serine may compete with the transport of a number of non-essential
      amino acids across the blood-brain barrier via the y+ transporter. These findings have led us
      to believe that high doses of L-serine could possibly stop the mis-incorporation of BMAA into
      brain proteins which in turn would slow or even abate the progression of ALS. This study will
      determine the safety of different doses of L-serine given to ALS subjects at 0.5 gm twice
      daily (BID), 2.5gm BID, 7.5g BID or 15 grams BID for six months.
