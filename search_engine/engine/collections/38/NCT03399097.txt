      individuals around the world. In recent years, the enteroendocrine cells system with its
      diverse hormones (Glucagon, GLP-1, GIP and others) was increasingly recognized as a key
      player in obesity and DM homeostasis.

      Bariatric surgery induces weight loss as well as an improvement in glycemic control often
      leading to diabetes reversal and occasionally to postprandial hypoglycemic events. The aim of
      the study is to characterize the composition and secretory profile of enteroendocrine cells
      in the obese, non-obese and non-obese post bariatric surgery.
