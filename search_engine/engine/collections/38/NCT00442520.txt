      to predict the safety, toxicity and/or efficacy of drugs. DNA will be extracted from
      patients' peripheral blood to study SNPs in DPD, TS, MTHFR, UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1,
      GSTT1, GSTP1, HO-1, ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1 and EGFR genes. The results of genetic study will be
      compared to treatment efficacy and toxicity. The ultimate goal is to use genotype profiles to
      provide individualized cancer treatment to improve outcome and decrease toxicity.
