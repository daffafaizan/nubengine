      UB-421 monotherapy in suppressing viral rebound while replace HAART in virally suppressed
      HIV-1 infected adults. In this study, approximately 375 subjects on stable HAART treatment
      will be randomized to receive either continuing HAART treatment alone (Cohort 1) or UB-421 as
      the monotherapy (Cohort 2) in 1:2 ratio. For Cohort 1, subjects will receive current standard
      HAART treatment as the active control group. For Cohort 2, UB-421 will be administered to
      enrolled subjects without HAART treatment in the Cohort 2 during the 26-week treatment
      period. After treatment period, both cohort 1 and cohort 2 enter 22-week follow-up period.
