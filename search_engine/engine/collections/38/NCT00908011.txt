      are not reaching specified lipid targets will benefit from the addition of a second lipid
      lowering drug (ezetimibe) to existing lipid lowering therapy with a statin (specifically
      rosuvastatin) versus increasing the dose of the ongoing statin in terms of improvements in
      serum lipid parameters namely total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and apolipoprotein
      B100 (apoB), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), apoB/apoA1 ratio.

      The target population will be HIV+ patients with hypercholesterolemia due to highly active
      antiretroviral therapy, the study will have a randomized, parallel design. Sample size will
      be 50 patients already taking 10 mg of rosuvastatin who are not reaching lipid targets to
      receive either an increased dose of rosuvastatin (20mg) or to receive 10mg ezetimibe in
      addition to their ongoing rosuvastatin therapy. There will be 25 patients randomized to each
      group.

      At baseline serum samples will be obtained and tested for serum triglycerides, total
      cholesterol, HDL, total cholesterol:HDL ratio, apoB, apoA1, apoB/apoA1 ratio, liver
      transaminases (AST and ALT), CK, thyroid stimulating hormone, creatinine and fasting blood
      glucose.

      After 12 weeks of therapy serum samples will once again be obtained and tested for serum
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, total cholesterol:HDL ratio, apolipoprotein B100,
      liver transaminases (AST and ALT), CK, thyroid stimulating hormone, creatinine and fasting
      blood glucose.

      The primary hypothesis is that the combination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe will lower serum
      apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein A1 ratio more so than an increased dose of rosuvastatin
      alone, in participants with mixed dyslipidemia associated with HIV therapy.

      Secondarily we believe the combination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe will lower the
      concentrations of serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B100 and
      C-reactive protein more so than an increased dose of rosuvastatin alone, and that there will
      be no increase in side effects when administered to participants with mixed dyslipidemia
      associated with HIV therapy.
