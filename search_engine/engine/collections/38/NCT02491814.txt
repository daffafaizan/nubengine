      of type 2 diabetes and obesity. This may be due to dairy's ability to increase satiety and
      decrease post-prandial glycemia. However, most clinical studies have only investigated
      isolated dairy proteins (whey and casein) and the effects of whole dairy products remains
      unclear. Additionally, as non-dairy alternatives are becoming more popular there is interest
      to see if they can elicit similar benefits as dairy. Therefore, this study will test the
      effects of commercially-available dairy and non-dairy beverages when consumed with cereal at
      breakfast time.

      Thirty healthy young males and females (20-30 years, BMI 20.0-24.9 kg/m2) will be recruited
      for the randomized, unblinded, crossover study. Participants will fast overnight, and at
      baseline will consume 250 mL of 1% milk, soy beverage, almond beverage, yogurt beverage, or
      water with 54 g of Cheerios cereal. At 0 (baseline), 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 minutes
      (pre-meal period) 140, and 170 minutes (post-meal period) blood will be collected for glucose
      analysis and subjective appetite ratings completed. Insulin will be analyzed every 30 minutes
      and for the last two timepoints. Between 120-140 minutes, an ad libitum lunch will be
      provided to assess food intake.
