      fallopian tube opens into the uterine cavity cancer cells from ovarian/fallopian tube cancers
      can travel through the uterus to the cervix and vagina. Likewise, endometrial cancer cells
      shed through the cervix into the vagina. It may be possible to develop a screening test for
      ovarian and endometrial cancers by collecting vaginal cells.
