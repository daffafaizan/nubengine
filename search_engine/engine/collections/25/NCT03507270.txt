        1. Physical examination (at baseline) and monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure, heart
           rate, breathing rate) at hours 1, 2, and 3 after admission to hospital.

        2. Registration of 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (at baseline, after 24 hours, and at the
           day of discharge).

        3. At baseline (at the time of admission to hospital), venous blood will be obtained to
           perform blood tests for determination of troponin I, FABP, and CPK-MB levels. At the
           same time, venous blood will be sampled for routine clinical laboratory blood tests. At
           hours 1, 2, and 3 after admission to hospital, venous blood will be sampled for
           assessment of the troponin I and FABP levels.

        4. Echocardiography will be performed 24 hours after admission (LVEDV, LVESV, and EF). At
           day 3, standard echocardiography will be performed.
