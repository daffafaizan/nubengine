      relapsed Ph+ ALL show limited clinical benefit in this population of patients with a high
      unmet medical need. Remissions induced by imatinib are of short duration and resistance to
      imatinib represents a major clinical challenge. The exact benefit and role of nilotinib in
      this leukemia remains to be determined and requires further analysis. Until further data is
      available patients with Ph+ ALL should be treated with nilotinib through the Individual
      Patient Program.. Studies to date indicate that nilotinib may provide clinical benefit to Ph+
      ALL patients and may represent a novel treatment option for these patients.
