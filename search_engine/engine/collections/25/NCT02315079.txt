      sitting comfortably at the slit lamp (a slit lamp is the standard device used to examine the
      eye and merely requires the participant to sit upright and place their chin on a chin rest
      and their forehead up against the slit lamp apparatus). The participant will then be asked to
      look upwards and while gently lowering the lower eyelid, a sterile blunt glass pipette will
      be used to collect tears from the natural tear lake (the tear lake is a reservoir of tears
      that sits on the surface of the eye and above the lower eyelid). Collected tears will then be
      taken for analysis of inflammatory markers.

      In addition, a survey to evaluate the symptoms and the symptoms impact daily life (Ocular
      Surface Disability Index Survey of National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-
      25).
