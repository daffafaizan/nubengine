      distribution of activated brain microglia/macrophages using the PET ligand [18F]DPA-714 in
      individuals with recent AMI. The basic premise is that AMI leads to systemic inflammation
      that includes inflammation in the brain. The PET tracer [18F]DPA-714 binds to the 18 kDa
      translocator protein (TSPO, also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in the
      mitochondria of activated microglia/macrophages and provides a non-invasive measure of
      neuroinflammation. The estimates of brain TSPO binding in patients with recent AMI will be
      compared to a matched group of patients who have undergone a recent elective PCI procedure.
