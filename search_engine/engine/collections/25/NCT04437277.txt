      anti-HCV antibodies. In the case of positive C viral serology, the search for the C virus
      from a blood test makes it possible to detect the genome (RNA) of the virus, which is thus
      directly detected by a so-called "PCR" technique. Although screening activity is important in
      France, it remains insufficient. In December 2016, HAS concluded that risk-based targeted
      screening has limitations and contributes to the persistence of a hidden epidemic of viral C
      infection. It is estimated that 75,000 people are unaware of being carriers of the hepatitis
      C virus. However, there is safe, effective and well-tolerated treatment. With duration of 8
      to 12 weeks it allows a healing of HCV in more than 95% of subjects. AFEF recommendations aim
      to achieve viral elimination C (as early as 2025). This elimination is defined as a 90%
      decrease in new infections associated with a 65% reduction in HCV mortality. OMS has planned
      this target for 2030. To achieve this goal, a number of measures are gradually being
      implemented focusing on universal treatment and universal screening. The hospital may be a
      place where systematic screening is interesting. In 2017, the prevalence of anti-HCV positive
      antibodies in the facility, apart from the Hepato-Gastroenterology service, was 1.7%, more
      than twice the estimated prevalence in our general population. These data give a rationale
      for the realization of this study.
