    
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), multi-center (when more
      than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), single-arm study of
      decitabine. The study will consist of 5 phases: Pre-treatment phase (before 30 days of first
      dose), Treatment phase (consist of 8 cycles, each cycle of 28 days), End-of-treatment phase
      (consist of 30-42 days after the last dose of cycle 8, or at time of discontinuation),
      Extension phase (1 cycle of 4 weeks) and Post-study phase or follow-up phase (every 2 months
      until 1 year, lost to follow-up or death). Participants who achieve a complete remission
      (when a medical problem gets better or goes away at least for a while) will be treated for at
      least 2 more cycles after first documentation of complete response (CR), after which
      treatment can be discontinued. Decitabine in a dose of 20 milligram per square meter (mg per
      m^2) will be administered intravenously over 1 hour infusion, 1 hour, once daily for 5
      consecutive days of a 28 days cycle up to 8 cycles or continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective is to evaluate the best response rate (complete
      response and partial response). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
