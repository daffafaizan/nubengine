      The first surgical procedure is early neonatal cheiloplasty applied in the first week of the
      newborn's life, which has been practiced in the Czech Republic for many years. It is a
      popular parental choice and has a lot of benefits compared to classic cheiloplasty performed
      between 3-6 months. Unrestricted growth of jaws is essential for the successful therapy of
      aesthetics and functions. Although there are known a lot of benefits to this surgery, its
      influence on facial growth is still being studied.

      The methodology of this study is based on modern three-dimensional imaging methods and will
      be evaluated by classic and geometric morphometric analysis of virtual dental models. The
      existing database includes 137 virtual dental casts (complete and incomplete bilateral or
      unilateral cleft lip and palate).

      The main aim is to verify that the effects of early neonatal cheiloplasty on the facial or
      palatal growth are minimal in affected individuals and therefore the subsequent development
      of these structures can be predicted at a later age. Other goals are to evaluate palatal
      morphology before and one year after early neonatal cheiloplasty, to assess growth of maxilla
      and palate using classic and geometric morphometry, to assess morphological differences
      between cleft types and to compare the results with previously published data of neonates
      operated by later operation protocol and noncleft control groups.
