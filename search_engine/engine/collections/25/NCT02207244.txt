    
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab. The active comparator study
      drug is adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis. Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg
      dose regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). From Week 28 up to Week 76, treatment for all
      participants will be based on their level of response. All participants will receive
      guselkumab every 8 weeks from Week 76 through Week 252 with a final safety follow-up visit at
      Week 264 (open label treatment period). The end of the study is defined as the time the last
      participant completes the Week 264 visit. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 268 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants will be monitored
      for safety throughout the study.
