      study (n=380) are equally randomized to either the experimental or the control group.
      Patients in the intervention group receive counseling during a period of six months, in line
      with the Lively Legs program. Patients in the control group receive regular care. Recruitment
      takes place within a period of nine months. Data are collected at baseline, directly after
      the intervention period at 6 months, and at follow-ups at 12 and 18 months. Quality of life
      is additionally assessed at 3, 9 and 15 months.

      The population for this study consists of leg ulcer patients, suffering from peripheral
      circulation disorders of venous or mixed (venous and arterial) origin. The population is
      restricted to patients treated at outpatient clinics for dermatology.

      Individual counseling is performed by nurses, based on the Lively Legs lifestyle-program for
      leg ulcer patients. This evidence-based program was systematically developed using the
      Intervention Mapping framework, thus integrating scientific evidence, relevant theories and
      patient and care provider expertise. The program aims at improved compliance with compression
      therapy and prescribed exercise level in all patients.

      Social Cognitive Theory provides the theoretical framework and the core methods for the
      Lively Legs program. Nurses will perform the central role as health counselor. In a maximum
      of six consultations, they will offer tailored counseling, including compliance and physical
      activity assessment, identification of relevant determinants of behavior, goal setting, and
      the application of methods and strategies from the Lively Legs program
