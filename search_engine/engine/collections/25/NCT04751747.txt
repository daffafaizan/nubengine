      I. To evaluate whether implementing set intervals for radiation replanning reduces
      cardiopulmonary toxicity and preserves healthy lung and heart tissue, with the intention of
      establishing a new standard treatment modality.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) stimulation with or without intravenous (IV)
      contrast over 1.5 hours on days -15 to -1, then undergo standard of care (SOC) chemoradiation
      on days 1-40. Patients also undergo additional CT scan simulations without IV contrast over
      20 minutes each on days 15 and 29.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-12 weeks, and then every 6 months
      for approximately 2 years.
