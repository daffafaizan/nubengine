      opposite ear as well as in the implanted ear. The amount of useful residual acoustic hearing
      varies among these implantees. There are several acoustic and electric combinations in the
      bilateral-bimodal listening mode depending on the amount of useful residual acoustic hearing
      in each ear. The combination of low frequency acoustic information provided by the hearing
      aid on each ear, completes the high frequency electric information provided by the Cochlear
      Implant (complementary bimodal benefit). Each of the different rehabilitation combinationsfor
      unilateral Cochlear Implant users enablesa unique integration of the three aspects of
      bilateral hearing bilaterality, binaurality and bimodality which may provide significant
      advantages over unilateral Cochlear Implant stimulation in terms of speech perception in
      noise, complementary information as well as localization abilities.

      The study will include 20 bilateral-bimodal users with moderate-to-severe hearing loss at 250
      Hz, 500 Hz and 1000 Hz in the non-implanted ear, who use hearing aids for at least 75% of
      their waking hours. Evaluation utilizes bilateral-binaural and bimodal complementary effects
      task-specific test batteries based on published doctoral research project. The assessment
      protocol consisted of tests that include various speech materials, different maskers,
      presentation of the noise from different locations in space, right/left speech
      lateralization, pitch-related tasks and subjective questionnaires. All tests will be
      administered in three listening conditions: Cochlear Implant -alone, hearing aid-alone and
      Cochlear Implant +hearing aid.
