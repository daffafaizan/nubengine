      symptoms of this tumor are visual or visual impairment. One of the primary complications of
      these operations is visual impairment, which directly relates to the quality of patients'
      life. Flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs) is an important means of intraoperative visual
      function evaluation under general anesthesia. Intraoperative visual function damage can be
      avoided or reduced by observing the changing of FVEPs waves to guide the choice of surgical
      path.

      However, since the diversity of anesthetic drugs and methods, there is still a great
      uncertainty impact on FVEPs, which will interfere with the interpretation and judgment of
      surgeons and neuroelectrophysiological physicians respect to the changes of FVEPs amplitude
      and latency, and further affect the operation decision-making. Therefore, it is urgent to
      establish a perfect anesthesia method for intraoperative monitoring of FVEPs. Although total
      intravenous anesthesia has been widely accepted for FVEPs monitoring, there are still some
      limitations, such as the possibility of intraoperative body movement and cough due to the
      restriction of muscle relaxant use under electrophysiological monitoring, as well as the
      depression on FVEPs of high maintained dosage under total intravenous anesthesia. The purpose
      of this study was to investigate the feasibility of FVEPs monitoring during endoscopic sellar
      tumor resection under combined intravenous anesthesia compared with total intravenous
      anesthesia.
