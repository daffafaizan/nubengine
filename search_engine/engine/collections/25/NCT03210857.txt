      Accidental drowning are frequent on the French coast every year and many of them concern
      apneists victims of apnoeic blackout.

      Neck extension is thus suspected to possibly produce an apnoeic blackout at the end of the
      dive since 1965, when Sir Sciarli (diving medicine pioneer) suspected this hypothesis.

      Physiologically, during a dive in apnea, the human cardiovascular system is subjected to a
      parasympathetic dominance, via the apnea reflex and the diving reflex. This parasympathetic
      dominant could be reinforced during a neck extension at the end of snorkeling during the
      ascent.

      Hypothesis: the neck extension at the end of apnea contributes to increase the pulsatility
      index of the right internal carotid artery by vagal component and thus causes a decrease in
      cerebral blood flow and may lead to the initiation of syncope in the healthy amateur free
      diver or underwater fisherman.
