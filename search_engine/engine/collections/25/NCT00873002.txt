      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of panobinostat when combined with standard doses of
           sorafenib tosylate in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat when combined with standard doses
           of sorafenib tosylate in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival.

        -  Determine the overall survival rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of panobinostat.

      Patients receive panobinostat IV on days 1 and 8 and oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
