    
      To measure the test performance characteristics of the CardioFluxTM Magnetocardiograph in the
      assessment of magnetic field map findings associated with various cardiac risk factors for
      cardiac disease to replicate the work associated with GEH. CardioFlux will only be used as is
      stated in 510k approval.

      All patients presenting to the Genetesis facility (5950 Mason Montgomery Rd, Suite 1400,
      Mason, OH 45040) meeting the inclusion criteria for performance of a magnetocardiograph scan
      for diagnosis, risk assessment, or treatment monitoring due to cardiac illness (as determined
      by the Investigators) may participate.

      Patients will be contacted at intervals over a 1 year period for follow up data for the
      patient registry, based on consideration of a patient's clinical disposition. The patient may
      choose whether or not to provide follow up data or to participate in another scan.
