    
      patients were allocated to one of two groups. Group (I): patients will be received N&H
      technique Group (II): patients will be received cesarean hysterectomy. In the N&H group,
      after acceptable control of bleeding from the placental bed, the internal os of the cervix
      was identified a double uterine compression suture at the lower uterine segment with inflated
      Foley's catheter balloon tamponade was performed as follow: (i) 100-cm Vicryl no. 1 was
      thrown to form two nearly equal parts (each 50 cm) on a blunt semicircular 70-mm needle, the
      curve of the needle was straightened.

      (ii) The needle transfixed the right side of the uterine wall from anterior to posterior,
      about5 cm below the hysterotomy incises posterior, then the needle transfixed the left side
      of the uterine wall from posterior to anterior, about 2 cm below the hysterotomy incision.

      (iii) another transverse compression suture undertook above the first one by 3 cm and below
      the hysterotomy incision by 2 cm.

      (iv) At the end of the suture application and before tying the knots, the internal os of the
      cervix was identified and a double-way 20 Fr Foley's catheter with a 30-50-ml balloon
      (Medical Industries, 10th of Ramadan City, Egypt) was inserted through the cervix to be
      handled by an assistant through the vagina and fixed to the patient's lower limb after
      inflation of the catheter balloon by 80 ml warm saline and pulling it against the lower
      uterine segment between the two transverse sutures . Only one catheter was used for
      tamponade.

      (v) Lastly ties the sutures.
