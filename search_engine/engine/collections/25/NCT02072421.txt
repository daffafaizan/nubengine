    
      The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study ("Cohort Study" is a prospective,
      multi-center, single-arm study of non-emergency PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals in
      patients with myocardial ischemia (other than STEMI). The Cohort Study is designed to allow
      non-SOS hospitals to continue to perform non-emergency PCI after enrollment to the MASS COMM
      trial is completed and before the 30-day and 12-month results are available.

      Specifically, all eligible subjects, after enrollment to the MASS COMM randomized controlled
      trial is completed and before the final results are available and a decision is reached by
      the MA-DPH, will be consented and enrolled into this Cohort Study. Subjects will be followed
      through 30 days post procedure.
