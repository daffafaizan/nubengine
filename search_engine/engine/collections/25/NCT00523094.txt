      lung resection, bullectomy and lung transplant are frequently evaluated for differential lung
      function by a semi quantitative lung scintigraphy. VRI may offer the same differential lung
      function information for the physician without the risks, time and patient discomfort of lung
      scintigraphy in the treating physician office.

      Moreover, VRI may provide a safe, quick and simple method to measure "split function" in lung
      cancer patients who are candidates for lung surgery. Thus eliminating the safety and
      complexity issue related with the current ventilation perfusion "split function" methods.

      In addition the VRI may aid in achieving the goal of developing strategies to reduce risk and
      maximize the number of patients that can benefit from surgical therapy.
