      SCI. Neuromodulation techniques have also been safely and successfully used to strengthen the
      abdomen in stroke patients.10 Most similar to our TINS protocol is transcutaneous tibial
      nerve stimulation (TTNS), which has shown to mitigate the development of neurogenic bladder
      in acute SCI.6 However, neuromodulation is rarely performed in acute SCI, and, to our
      knowledge, neuromodulation has not been performed to prevent the development of chronic
      neuropathic pain. There has been little published regarding the effects of electric
      stimulation upon the trunk in acute SCI as a prevention for chronic neuropathic pain and
      spasticity. Gaps in the knowledge which we intend to fill are:

        1. Safety and feasibility of TINS in acute SCI during inpatient rehabilitation.

        2. Effectiveness of a 2-week TINS protocol in acute SCI based on changes between admission,
           discharge, and weekly numerical pain scores and spasticity questionnaire scores in those
           with TINS compared to sham TINS for 2-months.

        3. Analysis of neuropathic pain medication dosages in those with and without TINS at
           admission, discharge, and 2 months post-discharge, and evaluation of morbidity at 2-
           months post-discharge
