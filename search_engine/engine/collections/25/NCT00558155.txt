      gastrectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy were screened for eligibility to participate in the
      study. Additional eligibility criteria included: age between 18 and 80 years, Karnofsky
      performance status score of 80 or more, and adequate organ function measured by routine blood
      tests. Patients requiring preoperative nutritional support, as well as those with
      disseminated tumors, serious comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class
      of 4 or 5), and renal or liver failure were excluded. The study was designed to test the
      hypothesis that immunonutrition and enteral nutrition would reduce the incidence of
      infectious complications following upper gastrointestinal surgery. Therefore, patients were
      randomly assigned in a 2Ã—2 factorial design to four groups receiving immunostimulating versus
      normal diets, and enteral versus intravenous nutritional support. The secondary objective of
      the study was to evaluate the effect of nutritional intervention on overall morbidity and
      mortality rates, and the length of hospital stay.

      After completing tumor resection, patients who met the eligibility criteria were
      intraoperatively assigned to either of the treatment groups using sealed envelopes containing
      computer-generated allocation numbers. The following groups were generated: standard enteral
      nutrition (SEN), immunostimulating enteral nutrition (IMEN), standard parenteral nutrition
      (SPN), and immunostimulating parenteral nutrition (IMPN). The study was carried out following
      the international ethical recommendations stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.
