      duodenal ulcer, or gastroduodenal ulcer are invited to participate in the study. These
      patients had endoscopically and histologically proven ulcers or active chronic gastritis and
      are all H. pylori-positive. Written informed consent to participation must be obtained from
      each patient before the study.

      During gastroduodenoscopy, biopsy specimens obtained from both the antrum and the corpus of
      the greater curvature are subjected to the bacterial susceptibility to clarithromycin by
      culture test or measurements of 23S rRNA mutations at positions 2142 and 2143 (from adenine
      to guanine).

      Patients are treated with 30 mg of lansoprazole bid, 200 mg of clarithromycin bid, and 750 mg
      of amoxicillin bid for one week. In addition, they take placebo bid, FP10 1 g bid, or FP-10 2
      g bid (2 hour after breakfast and at the bed time) for the same one week. Administration of
      placebo, FP-10 1 g or FP-10 2 g are performed in a double blinded manner.

      Eradication of H. pylori was confirmed by a 13C-urea breath test performed one month after
      eradication therapy. Throughout the study period, the investigators involved in the
      assessment of H. pylori eradication are blinded to susceptibility to clarithromycin H. pylori
      strains.
