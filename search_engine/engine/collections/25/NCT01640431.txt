      TENS on pain, functional capacity and ability to activate the TrA of individuals with chronic
      back pain caused by disc herniation.

      Design: Sixty patients are being randomized into two groups namely: Lumbar Segmental
      Stabilization (LS ) (specific exercises for the muscles transversus abdominis and lumbar
      multifidus) (n = 30) and TENS group (TG) (n = 30) receiving assistance under a current of
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Groups were contrasted regarding pain
      (visual analogical scale and McGill pain questionnaire), functional disability (Oswestry
      disability questionnaire) and TrA muscle activation capacity (Pressure Biofeedback Unit =
      PBU). The program lasts for 8 weeks, and sessions happen twice a week, with duration of one
      hour each. Evaluations will be performed before, after and with a follow-up six months after
      treatment. Significance level is established at 5%.
