      cells, including allogeneic originated γδT cells, in clinical treatment of active HBV. At the
      same time, we will carefully and thoroughly examine and evaluate the clinical efficacy of γδT
      cells against active HBV, including lowering speed of DNA copy number, and the transferring
      rate of HBeAg from positive to negative.
