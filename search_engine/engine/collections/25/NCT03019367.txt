    
      Aim 1. Compare the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and/or death in
      premature newborns <33 weeks gestational age (GA) delivered by C/S receiving UCM to those
      receiving DCC.

      Hypothesis1: First demonstrate infants in the UCM group are not inferior to the DCC group
      (reject H10).

      Hypothesis2: If H1 is true, demonstrate lower incidence of severe IVH and/or death in UCM
      infants compared to DCC.

      Aim 2. Compare the safety and efficacy profiles of premature newborns <33 weeks GA delivered
      by C/S receiving UCM vs. DCC during their hospitalization.

      Hypothesis3: UCM group will have a decreased need for resuscitation interventions with no
      differences in bilirubin or polycythemia compared to DCC.

      Hypothesis4: UCM group will have improved blood pressures in the first 24 hours of life
      compared to DCC.

      Aim 3 (exploratory). To compare the outcomes of premature newborns <33 weeks GA delivered by
      C/S (Cesarean section) (from Aims 1 and 2) with those born by V/D (vaginal delivery)
      receiving UCM or DCC.
