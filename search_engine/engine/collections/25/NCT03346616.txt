      significantly; during this time, text messaging has become the primary means of communication
      in some instances. Despite the popularity, text messaging and smartphones have been rarely
      utilized in the context of medical education. Few studies have been performed examining the
      effect of text messaging as an adjunct to traditional medical education. A previous study
      with the Saint Louis University (SLU) Pediatric Residency program, showed the feasibility of
      using text messaging to deliver medical information to pediatric residents through the
      Text4Peds program.

      This study aims to expand Text4Peds to third NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation performance.
      The NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation is a national, standardized pediatric knowledge based
      exam from the NBME taken by all medical students at the end of their pediatric clerkship.
