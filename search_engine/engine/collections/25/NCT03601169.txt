      subjective sleep maintenance problems, and at least mild progressive cognitive deficit. The
      study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design, in which
      participants will receive oral placebo, low dose MMFS, and high dose MMFS twice daily for 6
      weeks. Over three study periods (2 weeks each), subjects will receive two different dosages
      of MMFS (low dose: ~22.5 mg/kg LBM/day and high dose: ~35 mg/kg LBM/day) and placebo. After
      periods 1 and 2 there will be a one week washout period in which the subject will not take
      any study tablets. Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 5
      assessments total: at baseline in the clinic (visit 1; prior to taking any study tablets),
      and 4 times at home via online assessments (at the beginning of period 1 and at the end of
      periods 1, 2, and 3. The effectiveness of different MMFS dosages on cognition, mood, and
      sleep quality will be assessed using a Neuropsychological Test Battery, Profile of Mood
      States-Brief Form, daily sleep diaries, and Insomnia Severity Index. The safety profile of
      different MMFS dosages will be determined by monitoring the AE/SAE and subjective remarks
      during the study period. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be
      performed (including vital signs and laboratory tests).
