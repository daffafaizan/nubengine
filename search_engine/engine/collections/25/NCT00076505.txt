      and how they relate to alpha-synuclein (SNCA) expression and function. Individuals from
      families with inherited Parkinson's disease (affected and at risk members), as well as normal
      individuals, will be enrolled. All subjects will be asked to provide blood samples in order
      to study bioenergetic function in mitochondria from their platelets. These studies will
      include genotyping and determination of polymorphisms in the subjects' mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA) in order to delineate any significant abnormality that may be associated with a
      particular group. Cardiolipin levels will be obtained fee for service at Lipomics. Basic
      respirometry, enzyme activity, and somatic cell hybridization will be performed in the PI's
      lab. Protein analysis will be performed in the proteomics facility at NIMH.
