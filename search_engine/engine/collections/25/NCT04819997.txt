      on worry management skills, values-based goal setting, and brief mindfulness-based practices,
      then complete patient workbook activities after each session over 15-20 minutes per day.
      Patients also complete a survey over 8 minutes at 6 weeks, an exit interview at 7 weeks, and
      questionnaires over 25 minutes each at baseline, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks.
