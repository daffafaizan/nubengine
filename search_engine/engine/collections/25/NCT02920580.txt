      stroke, and infection. Extensive clinical research in weaning from mechanical ventilation has
      led to recommendations for prompt extubation following a successful trial of spontaneous
      breathing in general intensive care unit (ICU). However, little evidence exists to guide
      decisions about when to remove the breathing tube in patients with severe brain injury. It is
      unclear which of the following strategies would optimize important patient outcomes: prompt
      extubation vs. waiting and extubating or performing a tracheostomy, timed according to
      physicians' discretion. Each strategy has associated risks: prompt extubation may lead to
      higher rates of extubation failure and reintubation, whereas waiting longer may expose
      patients to complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy may lead to
      procedural complications (or unnecessary procedures, if prompt extubation would be
      successful). This trial in brain-injured patients will test which of the following will lead
      to better patient outcomes: (1) removing the endotracheal tube promptly once a spontaneous
      breathing trial is passed; or (2) usual care, with the airway management strategy selected
      according to the preference of the treating physician.
