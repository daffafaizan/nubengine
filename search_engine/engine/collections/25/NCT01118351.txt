      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of oral sunitinib (Sutent) given continuously for a
      maximum of 12 weeks, with respect to complete response rates at 12 months after completion of
      treatment in patients with high-risk superficial bladder cancer who have failed previous
      intravesical BCG.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of sunitinib treatment in recurrence-free survival, progression-free
      survival, and overall survival in patients with high-risk superficial TCC of the bladder who
      have failed previous intravesical BCG.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib (Sutent) administered in patients
      with high-risk superficial TCC of the bladder who have failed previous intravesical BCG.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pre-treatment tissue baseline angiogenic markers and to evaluate the magnitude
      of the difference among these variables with post-treatment tumor tissue after treatment with
      sunitinib (Sutent).

      II. To evaluate the effects of Sunitinib (Sutent) on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells
      (Tregs).

      III. To determine the presence of circulating tumor cells in superficial BCG-refractory TCC
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
