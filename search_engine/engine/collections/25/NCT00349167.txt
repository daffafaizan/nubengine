      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PR-104 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PR-104 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its alcohol metabolite in these
           patients.

        -  Assess evidence of antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  Examine metabolic changes in tumors of these patients using fludeoxyglucose F 18
           positron emission tomography scanning.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive PR-104 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PR-104 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline and then periodically during study treatment for
      pharmacokinetic and tumor marker studies. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron
      emission tomography scanning before beginning study treatment and after completion of course
      2 to assess metabolic activity of the tumor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
