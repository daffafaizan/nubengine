    
      The T Cell Validation Study is designed to determine the ability of T cell assays to identify
      differences in responses from participants with type 1 diabetes compared to normal control
      subjects, and to compare four different laboratory tests which examine T cells to determine
      whether the measurements are quantitatively reproducible.

      Antibody assays that confirm the presence of type 1 diabetes will be evaluated including:
      Diabetes Biochemical Autoantibody Assay (anti-GAD65, anti-ICA512, anti-insulin) and Islet
      Cell Autoantibody testing; genetic testing (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and human leukocyte
      antigen [HLA]) will also be done to learn more about the T cell assays.

      The following T Cell Assays will be conducted in individuals with type 1 diabetes, as well as
      those without type 1 diabetes:

        -  Cellular Immunoblot Testing

        -  T Cell Proliferation Assay

        -  Tetramer Assay

        -  Cytokine ELISpot Assay
