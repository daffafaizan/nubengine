      The twenty children with spastic diplegia or hemiplegia CP will be randomized by a
      statistician to one of two treatment groups. One group will undergo a 12-week at-home gait
      training program with ES, subjects/guardians can choose either the surface or percutaneous
      stimulation subgroup, and the second group will undergo a 12-week at-home gait training
      program without ES. For both groups, data will be collected at five points: just before gait
      training, after 4 and 8 weeks of gait training, at the conclusion of gait training (after 12
      weeks), and 4 weeks after gait training has been discontinued (16 weeks post initiation of
      gait training). Data collection at each follow-up point will include the kinetics and
      kinematics of walking, standing posture, gait initiation, plantar pressures, the
      administration of the Timed Up & Go and Functional Reach Test, and the assessment of lower
      extremity muscle strength using a hand-held dynamometer. The Canadian Occupational
      Performance Measure (COPM) will be applied before and after the 12-week gait training program
      and 4 weeks after the gait training has been discontinued. For the 20 children with typical
      development, the same data will be collected (except for the COPM) and used for comparison to
      the pre-training data collected from all 20 children with CP.
