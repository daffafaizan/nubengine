      interruptions or disruptions has been identified among relevant non-technical skills (NTS)
      for practicing emergency medicine. However, the link between these skills and the quality of
      care has not been quantified. NTS are usually analyzed by qualitative methods such as
      interviews, direct observations, or questionnaires that have low performance according to the
      GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

      The investigators have created and validated an experimental model of a virtual, authentic
      and realistic Emergency Department (ED). The platform has been modelled in a "Second Life"
      environment. The NTS of emergency physicians will be assessed and recorded during simulated
      care of multiple virtual patients. The NTS association with ED length of stay and disposition
      decision will be analyzed. This study will be an internal pilot study and will include 30
      emergency physicians who practice emergency medicine for at least two years.

      Sessions will be performed in the Toulouse Institute of Health Care Simulation, Toulouse
      University Hospital. They will be composed of three stages: briefing (30 minutes), simulated
      practice (3 hours), and debriefing with an explicit interview (30 minutes). Two researchers
      and a computer technician will supervise the sessions. The data will be obtained by analyzing
      the video recorded during the simulated practice and the interview.
