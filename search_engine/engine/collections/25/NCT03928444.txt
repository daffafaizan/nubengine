      intrinsic aging. Intrinsic aging is an inherent degenerative process caused by decreased
      proliferative capacity leading to cellular senescence. Extrinsic aging is caused by factors
      such as UV radiations, smoking and alcohol consumption.The physiological changes associated
      with aging of the skin are manifested in xerosis, dramatic loss of skin elasticity due to
      damage to collagen and elastin fibers; as well as barrier function, modification of rhytides
      and deficiencies in the regenerative property of the skin. All of which ultimately result in
      thinning of the skin, malar fat atrophy and pigmentary changes.Aging skin undergoes thinning
      of the epidermis that is caused by reduction of vascularity and hydration. On average, the
      thickness of the epidermis is reduced by about 6.4% during each decade of life.Skin aging
      effects can be assessed based on the skin appearance (texture and roughness, fine lines and
      wrinkles), structure, elasticity, hydration and barrier function. Many new non-invasive or
      minimally invasive bioengineering advances in recent years have enabled the quantitative
      analysis of skin properties during the aging processRecently, adult stem cells such as
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in variable dermatologic conditions due to its
      regenerative properties such as wound healing, rejuvenation, acne scar and hair fall
      treatment. Different types of MSCs could be derived from different tissues as for example;
      bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and skin-derived
      stem cells (SDSCs)Adipose tissue derived stem cells are currently favorable compared to other
      types of adult stem cells as the procedure is easy, safe with minimal donor site morbidity.
      The process of obtaining a considerable amount of adipose tissues sufficient to use in skin
      regeneration is highly appealing due to its relative availability and accessibility. They
      secrete variable growth factors that affect surrounding environment as vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin like growth factors
      (IGF) and others
