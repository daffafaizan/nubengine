    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine time to treatment failure in patients with stage II-IIIB squamous cell
           carcinoma of the anal canal treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy
           (i.e. Capecitabine (Xeloda)/Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) With Concomitant Radiotherapy (XRT)
           shortened to XELOX/XRT).

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 2-year local regional control in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 2-year colostomy-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 2-year median overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine* twice daily on days 1-2, 6-10, 20-24, 27-31, and
      41-42, and undergo radiotherapy* once daily on days 1-3, 6-10, 13-17, 20-24, 27-31, 34-38,
      and 41-42. Patients also receive oxaliplatin intravenous (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 22,
      and 29. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients with T3-4 lesions also receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo
      radiotherapy once daily on days 43 and 44.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 and 12 weeks and then periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.
