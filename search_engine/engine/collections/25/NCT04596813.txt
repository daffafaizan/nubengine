        1. To investigate the efficacy of Cytosorb® treatment in attenuating perioperative changes
           in IL-6 during CF-LVAD implantation

        2. To investigate the feasibility, and safety of Cytosorb® treatment during CF-LVAD
           implantation.

        3. To pilot the effect of Cytosorb® treatment on vasoplegia and organ dysfunction with
           specific focus on right ventricle failure, liver failure and acute kidney injury (AKI).

        4. To establish a collaborative biobank of patient's biological samples to allow extensive
           characterisation of patient phenotype prior to CF-LVAD implantation and their individual
           inflammatory and metabolic responses to surgery and perioperative management.
