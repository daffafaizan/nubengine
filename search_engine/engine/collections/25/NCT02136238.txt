      crossover study with a subjective follow-up. Two subject categories will be evaluated: 1.)
      healthy non-amputees, and 2.) unilateral transradial amputee subjects who currently use, or
      are interested in using a body-powered prosthesis. We anticipate data collection data with 10
      non-amputee subject, and 8 amputee subjects.
