      common global phenomenon, including in the UK. This can have significant effects on
      pregnancy, infant outcome and enduring consequences into adolescence. Babies born with
      neonatal abstinence syndrome may spend months in neonatal care units, requiring complex,
      24hour care. Here, healthcare workers may experience conflict between preserving maternal
      autonomy, and the challenge of caring for a withdrawing newborn.

      However, there is discrepancy between the objectives of policy-makers "Reducing the harm to
      children from parental problem drug use should become a main objective of policy and
      practice" and those recommended in healthcare "These women need supportive and coordinated
      care during pregnancy." Therefore, conflict arises between mother-centred and child-centred
      models of caring for pregnant women who use substances.

      The objective of the proposed project is to investigate how healthcare workers providing
      treatment for pregnant women who use illicit substances perceive their duty of care and
      whether they experience tension between the conflicting objectives of mother-centred and
      child-centred approaches through semi-structured qualitative interviews. The investigators
      will explore the ways in which healthcare workers frame problematic substance misuse in
      pregnant women, what they perceive to be the major challenges in providing care and their
      views on the responsibility of a mother to have a healthy baby. The main hypothesis is that
      healthcare workers providing care for pregnant women engaging in problematic substance misuse
      experience conflict between mother-centred and child- centred approaches to care.
