      targeting PAI-1 (TM5614) for patients with severe COVID-19. This is a randomized (1:1),
      double-blinded trial that will enroll adult patients (> 65 years OR <65 years with at least
      one major cardiometabolic comorbidity [diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease])
      with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The study intervention will be a small molecule
      inhibitor of PAI-1, TM5614, up to 180 mg, compared to matching placebo for up to 7 days.

      Research blood samples for PAI-1 and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be collected at time of
      enrollment, 48 hours after 1st dose of medication and at day 7 or discharge, whichever comes
      first.

      These objectives will allow for the planning of subsequent phase 3 study, and strengthen
      implementation of a multi-center randomized trial should this study confirm safety, and
      suggest efficacy of therapy.
