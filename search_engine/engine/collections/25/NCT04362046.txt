      cancer often arises from a precursor lesion called atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH).
      Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for EC and AH. It is well recognized that EC may
      be diagnosed in younger women of child-bearing age. The diagnosis of EC or AH in these
      younger women is devastating as a hysterectomy is frequently required. Though some of these
      women respond to high-dose progestin treatment, the failure rate is high (60%), necessitating
      surgery. Recent case series show that some women with AH and early EC can be treated by
      resecting the precursor lesion of the early cancerous area in the uterus by hysteroscopy
      without the need for hysterectomy. The fertility-sparing approach is outlined in this
      research protocol.This is a multidisciplinary research project with input from gynaecologic
      oncology, general gynaecology, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and pathology. Our
      hypothesis is that hysteroscopic resection (HR) is a safe and effective treatment for AH or
      EC in women who want to preserve their fertility and have not been successfully treated using
      progestin therapy. Patients will be closely monitored to ensure that this is a safe and
      effective treatment option.
