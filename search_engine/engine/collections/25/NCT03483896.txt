      nonpharmacological treatment option for reducing depression and other neuropsychiatric
      symptoms for people living with dementia in long term care facilities. However, there are
      currently no minimum requirements for daylight access in care facilities. In urban settings,
      it is common for residents to spend the majority of the day indoors, illuminated by
      electrical light sources that deliver light with significantly lower intensities and reduced
      spectrum compared with daylight.

      A 12-week pilot study was conducted in 8 dementia care facilities involving (n = 83)
      participants addressing the hypothesis that an intervention increasing indoor exposure to
      daylight will reduce depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. At 4 facilities, staff
      was enlisted to increase daylight exposure by taking participants to a perimeter room with
      daylight exposure for socialization in the morning (8:00 - 10:00 AM) each day. At the other 4
      facilities, a control group were taken to a similar sized area without daylight for
      socialization under typical electrical lighting conditions. Outcome measures for depression
      and other neuropsychiatric symptoms were taken at the beginning and end of the 12-week study.
