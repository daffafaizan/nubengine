        -  Determine the effect of chronic vinblastine and methotrexate on time to disease
           progression in children or young adults with progressive plexiform neurofibroma
           associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to tumor status (severely debilitating and/or
      life-threatening vs cosmetically disfiguring).

      Patients receive methotrexate and vinblastine IV weekly for 26 weeks and then every 2 weeks
      for 26 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months during study participation.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      3 years.
