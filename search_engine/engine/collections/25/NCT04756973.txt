    
      Object: The current study examined the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of: 1) adding
      self-compassion (SC) skills training to a standard behavioral weight loss program (BWLP), and
      2) utilizing video conferencing software to deliver small group, weekly, weight loss classes.

      Method: The BWLP program utilized Webex video conferencing software to deliver a 12-week,
      interactive, small group, weekly weight loss intervention. Participants were randomized to a
      standard BWLP or a standard behavioral weight loss program augmented with self-compassion
      skills training (BWLP+SC).
