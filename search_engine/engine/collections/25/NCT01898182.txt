      photoaged facial skin. The study will enroll around 132 subjects from selected private
      dermatology clinics in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines.

      Patients from selected private dermatology clinics of a tertiary hospital will be screened
      and recruited to participate. They will be provided a written consent form (Appendix I)
      before they will be included in the study.

      Following enrollment, subjects will return for outpatient visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12 for
      assessment.

      The whole study will be conducted from July 2013 to November 2013. The first month would
      involve recruitment of patients. Qualified patients will start the 12-week treatment period
      and will be asked to follow up every 4 weeks. The last two months would be for data analysis,
      interpretation and writing of the scientific report.
