      movement) in adult patients may be prolonged and ideal outcomes may not be achieved with
      traditional orthodontic tooth movement. One method for enhancing orthodontic tooth movement
      is the use of surgical access of the local site to initiate a regional tissue reaction to
      induce trauma, which leads to a limited inflammatory healing process. This process is also
      known as regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP), which allows for more rapid bone turnover
      and has been shown in other protocols to enhance orthodontic tooth movement. While PAOO has
      been shown to rapidly increase tooth movement, to our knowledge, localized use of PAOO in
      combination with molar protraction in adults has not been evaluated in a prospective trial
      for differences in clinical outcomes (tooth movement time, adverse orthodontic outcomes,
      periodontal and soft tissue defects) and patient-centered outcomes (pain, swelling, change in
      daily activities, patient assessment of surgical benefit, and patient-assessed esthetics) in
      a controlled study.
