      the patient receives), placebo-controlled study in adult patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms of relevant severity. The study will consist of 3
      phases: a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, an 8-week double-blind treatment phase, and a
      2-week post-treatment (follow up) phase. Patients will continue to take the same daily dose
      of their antidepressant (as directed by the investigator) at the same time of day, from
      screening through the end of the study, including the post-treatment phase. The total study
      duration for each patient will be approximately 12 weeks.
