      includes an evaluation of rate of immune cell infiltration into the esophagogastric tumor
      tissue following two and four cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Potential study participants
      will be assessed for eligibility during a 28-day screening period that includes central
      verification of clinical stage and eligibility. Eligible patients will be enrolled and
      randomized to perioperative treatment with either atezolizumab with FLOT (Arm A) or FLOT
      alone (Arm B). Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by clinical nodal
      stage (N+ vs. N-), location of the primary (GEJ type I vs. GEJ type II/III vs. stomach), and
      MSI-status (MSI / MMRd vs. MSS / MMRp). Quantitative PDL-1 mRNA expression will be performed
      but not used as stratification factor.

      Following randomization, study patients will enter the study treatment period which will last
      approximately 22 to 52 weeks depending on treatment arm and timing of surgery.

      Arm A: FLOT with Atezolizumab:

      Patients randomized to treatment Arm A will receive atezolizumab + FLOT in four 2-week
      treatment cycles as described below prior to undergoing surgery. Following surgery, patients
      will receive four further 2-week cycles of atezolizumab + FLOT followed by 8 additional
      3-week treatment cycles with atezolizumab alone.

      Arm B: FLOT alone:

      Patients randomized to Arm B will receive FLOT alone for four 2-week treatment cycles prior
      to surgery. Following surgery, patients will receive four further 2-week cycles of
      chemotherapy alone.
