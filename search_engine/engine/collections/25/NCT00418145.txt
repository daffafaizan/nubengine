      However, the IV administration is cumbersome, inconvenient and expensive. A true comparison
      of these different approaches has not been undertaken in rigorous fashion. Prior studies have
      demonstrated the safety of such high doses of oral steroid. For this proposal we employ
      equivalent oral dosing (1400 mg/day) and compare that to 1000 mg/day IV therapy in patients
      seen within seven days of an acute exacerbation of MS.

      In addition, there are 2 arms to this double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial. One
      arm has an active IV and an oral placebo while the second arm has an IV placebo and an active
      oral dose. Therefore, each subject will receive an active treatment.
