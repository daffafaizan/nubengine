      for Dupytren´s disease (Dd) despite considerable risk of complications.

      There is an increasing interest in Scandinavia in the treatment of Dd with Clostridium
      Histolyticum (Xiapex ®, Auxillium). However the enzyme is expensive and long-term effects are
      not well documented. More studies are needed to analyze both short and long term clinical
      outcome as well as cost-benefit analysis.

      The treatment arm of Xiapex in this study follows the recommendation as by the producer.

      The other treatment of Dd contracture in this study is needle fasiotomy/aponeurotomy. We use
      multiple perforation technigue with 26 G needle needle, with as little local anesthesia
      (xylocin w adrenaline) as needed during contionus extension of the finger untill successfully
      extended.

      The two procedures leave little scar tissue lessening the challenges posed by the
      reoperations.

      Recurrence rate of contracture following different treatments of Dupuytren's disease differs
      widely in the literature, and the rate is influenced by multiple factors.
