      receive standard of care treatment and procedures for management of DMD. Treating Physicians
      participating in the expanded access program are required to collect and document any
      physician, patient, or caregiver reported safety events and report to the Sponsor. The
      subject's dose of vamorolone may be increased or decreased within a range of 2.0 to 6.0
      mg/kg/day (only doses of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg are allowed), given once daily.
      Administration of vamorolone (taken with an 8 ounce (240 ml) glass of full fat milk, or
      equivalent high-fat food portion) will be unchanged from the VBP15-LTE or VBP15-004 studies.
      In the absence of safety concerns, and while this Expaneded Access protocol is active,
      vamorolone may be provided indefinitely or until approval, provided that the Treating
      Physician and family agrees that continued administration of vamorolone is in the best
      interest of the child
