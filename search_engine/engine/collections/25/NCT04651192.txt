      maintenance of anxiety disorders. This study aimed to characterize the mental resilience of
      combat soldiers, and explore the neuro-cognitive impact of prolonged stress, using
      eye-tracking, MRI and fMRI measurements. Participants will be assessed using questionnaires,
      cognitive tasks and magnetic imaging at 5 timepoints over the span of 4 years. Outcome
      measures will be depression, anxiety and post-traumatic scores, as well as dwell time on
      threat in eye-tracking paradigms tested in previous studies, and blood oxygen level-dependent
      (BOLD) signals in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements.
