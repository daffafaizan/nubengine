      metabolism and pharmacokinetics of individual enantiomers of PQ in healthy human volunteers.
      Based on the results of this study, if one enantiomer seems to show a better safety profile
      (in terms of hematological effects), an analogous study will be carried out in G6PD deficient
      individuals (under a separate protocol). The studies are primarily aimed at understanding the
      tolerability and safety of the enantiomers in G6PD deficiency. If one shows a better safety
      profile, ultimately the evaluation of its efficacy will be required.
