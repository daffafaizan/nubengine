      obese or with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This study is a pilot randomized
      controlled trial designed to test whether improved blood pressure control can be achieved
      with the use of remote home blood pressure monitoring in children with uncontrolled blood
      pressure. Study investigators will randomize 60 children who have elevated BP (defined as
      receipt of ≥1 anti-hypertensive agent or office SBP ≥90th percentile) to either home BP
      monitoring with a home SBP target of < 90th percentile or less than 120 mm Hg, which ever is
      lower (intervention group) versus usual care group in 2:1 ratio. This study aims to (1)
      compare the safety of BP lowering in intervention versus usual care patients, (2) determine
      the efficacy of the intervention and provide estimates for the refinement of sample size
      determination for an eventual full-scale trial, and (3) assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention, recruitment rates, and barriers to trial completion.
