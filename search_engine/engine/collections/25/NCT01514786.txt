    
      This two-armed randomized controlled trial (300 patients/arm) will compare Colorectal Web
      (CW), the interactive DA, to a non-interactive control website in ten practices in Metro
      Detroit. Patients will be adults aged 50 years and over, not current on CRCS. In the clinic
      before the patient-physician encounter, participants will complete a Patient Baseline Survey.
      They will be randomized to CW or the control website. Data will be collected after the
      patient reviews the respective website (Post-Intervention Survey), during the
      patient-physician encounter (digital audio recording), and after it (Post-Encounter Survey).
      Chart audit will be performed six months after the encounter to determine whether the patient
      underwent CRCS.
