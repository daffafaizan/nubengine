      pregnancy outcomes in the obese urban population. Approximately one fourth of women in the
      United States are overweight and nearly one third are considered to be obese. Pregnancy
      places obese women at increased risk for several adverse events in the antepartum,
      intrapartum, and postpartum period. There are many studies that have shown that obesity in
      pregnancy has a negative impact on pregnancy. However, currently there are few studies in the
      United States that specifically look at ease of access to nutrition services in an obese
      urban population and the effect this has on pregnancy outcomes. This study will be a
      randomized controlled study that will compare two groups of pregnant women with a BMI of 30
      or greater one of which has access to nutritional services along with routine prenatal care
      while the other gets only routine prenatal care. The investigators hypothesize that the obese
      parturient who has access to nutritional services will have decreased weight gain during
      pregnancy and ultimately have improved pregnancy outcomes. This will help to guide future
      care for the obese parturient in the urban population who may have limited access to
      services.
