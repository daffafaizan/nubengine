      One negative effect of edentulism is resorption of the edentulous ridge over time.
      Construction of a successful mandibular complete denture for patients with advanced
      mandibular ridge resorption is often difficult and on some occasions virtually impossible. It
      has been proved that when implants are placed, bone gets stimulated resulting in minimal bone
      loss. But anatomic limitations to implant placement have been observed in atrophic ridges, so
      short implants introduced as a recent alternative to aggressive surgical procedures proposed
      to compensate for tissue deficiency. Also, Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has proven success
      in improving implant stability which is very crucial in short implants. Thus, the purpose of
      this study is to evaluate and compare the treatment outcome of mandibular overdenture
      assisted by two short implants versus that assisted by four short implants in combination
      with LLLT.
