      90% of bleeding episodes in these patients. Around 25-30 percent of patients develop hepatic
      encephalopathy. Development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with gastrointestinal bleed
      can cause increase morbidity with higher hospital costs in these patients. To date no
      randomized trial has been done in terms of prevention of encephalopathy in gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage. One trial has compared lactulose in combination with antibiotic against mannite,
      showed equal efficacy in both groups. No study has been done evaluate the efficacy of
      lactulose in prevention of encephalopathy in these patients.

      We hypothesize that prophylactic use of Lactulose decreases the risk of development of
      hepatic encephalopathy with upper GI bleed in cirrhotics.
