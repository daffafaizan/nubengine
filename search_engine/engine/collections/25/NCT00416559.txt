      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment alone in young patients with
           stage 2 neuroblastoma without N-myc amplification (NMA).

      Secondary

        -  Determine predictive factors of relapse and survival of patients with stage 1, 2A, or 2B
           neuroblastoma without NMA who have undergone surgery only.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients with stage 1 or 2 disease and no N-myc amplification (NMA) undergo observation
      comprising clinical evaluation, ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen, and chest x-ray
      periodically for up to 5 years. All other patients undergo additional therapy and follow-up
      according to national standards. Patients who develop recurrent disease or disease
      progression may undergo surgical resection, preceded or followed by chemotherapy, according
      to national standards.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.
