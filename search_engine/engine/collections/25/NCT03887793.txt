      model for increasing HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents in primary care settings. UNC
      will partner with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to evaluate the effectiveness of their
      Vaccinate Adolescents against Cancer (VACs) model for HPV vaccine QI within the context of
      integrated healthcare delivery systems (IDSs). The VACs model includes the development of a
      QI action plan and a QI team. The QI team is made up of health care providers from
      participating clinics within the IDSs. The team then helps implement specific QI activities
      in participating primary care clinics. The model also includes vaccination coverage
      assessments in participating clinics at multiple time points to assess the impact of QI
      activities. Specific QI activities that will be offered to participating clinics will be
      chosen from a menu of options that will include the Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention's AFIX model and physician-to-physician engagement. AFIX (Assessment, Feedback,
      Incentives and eXchange) consists of brief quality improvement consultations that
      immunization specialists from state health departments deliver to vaccine providers in
      primary care settings. Using immunization registry data, the specialist evaluates the
      clinic's vaccination coverage and delivers education on best practices to improve coverage.
      Physician-to-physician (P2P) engagement consists of an in-depth training about how to make
      strong and effective HPV vaccination recommendations to primary care providers. The
      investigators will compare changes in HPV vaccination coverage between the quality
      improvement arm or wait list control arm.
