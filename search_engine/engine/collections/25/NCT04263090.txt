    
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study followed by a Phase 2a dose-expansion
      phase to study the combination of Rigosertib and Nivolumab in metastatic Kirsten rat sarcoma
      positive (KRAS+) lung adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed on standard first line
      treatment. Study patients will have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in
      this protocol. The Phase I dose escalation plan will start with an accelerated titration
      design (ATD) using single patient cohorts until grade 2 toxicity is experienced. At that
      point, the ATD will be terminated and the dose escalation will enter a standard 3+3 design
      based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). The MTD (Phase 1 primary endpoint) is defined as the
      highest dose for which at most 1 patient out of 6 experiences a DLT.

      Rigosertib escalation will occur with three dose levels (dose D1: 280mg twice daily; dose D2:
      560mg in the morning (qAM), 280mg in the evening (qPM); dose D3: 560mg twice daily; taken by
      mouth for 21 consecutive days of the 28 day cycle), based on previous dose escalation studies
      in other malignancies, while Nivolumab dose will be fixed at the standard dose (240mg every 2
      weeks, given intravenously).

      Once the MTD is determined, an additional planned 12 patients will be enrolled in the
      expansion phase to further study toxicity and to determine preliminary efficacy endpoints
      including ORR (phase 2a primary endpoint), PFS, and OS (secondary endpoints) of the
      combination.
