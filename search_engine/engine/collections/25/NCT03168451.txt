    
      This is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a text
      messaging-based smoking cessation program among American Indian (AI) smokers who call state
      quit lines, in states with high AI populations. Participants will be randomized to either
      receive culturally-tailored text-messages to support smoking cessation or quit line's
      treatment as usual.

      Participants will be recruited by Optum, the company who runs many state quit lines in the
      US. If - after answering some demographic questions for Optum from the following states:
      Alaska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and New Mexico - a person is found to be a AI/AN and
      18+ years old, that person will be asked if they would like to receive information about the
      study. If they answer yes the WSU research team will receive their contact information from
      Optum via a secure email, and WSU researchers will send a text explaining the study in more
      detail and a link to the e-consent form.

      Participants will also fill out 4 baseline questionnaires. After filling out baseline
      questionnaires, participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or the
      control group. Participants will be stratified into the intervention and control groups based
      on their age, gender, and Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score. Random permuted blocks will
      be used by on-campus research staff to manually assign participants to the two research
      groups.

      All participants will begin receiving text messages one week before their chosen quit date.
