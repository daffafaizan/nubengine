      This study is a single center, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the benefit of
      endovascular intervention on the healing of ischemic foot ulcers when compared to best wound
      care alone. The study population will be comprised of subjects with a foot ulcer and
      non-palpable or diminished pedal pulses. The expected duration of subjects in this trial is 2
      years.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups:

        1. Wound Care (group 1)--Best standard wound care with aggressive debridement

        2. Endovascular Intervention + Wound Care (group 2)--Best standard wound care in
           combination with endovascular revascularization

      Subjects will undergo standard of care evaluation for ischemic foot ulcers. These same
      evaluations would be performed whether or not the subject was participating in this research
      study. In the event that a clinically significant event or unanticipated disease or condition
      is identified, the subject and their doctor will be notified, the investigator, will review
      the results of the tests and procedures that are standard of care, and the results will
      become part of the research record. Prior to undergoing randomization, the subject will sign
      and fully understand an IRB consent form that is HIPAA compliant.
