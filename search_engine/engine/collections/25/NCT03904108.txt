      Primary Objective

        1. To assess the objective response rate to a three-drug regimen (a platinum doublet plus
           an anti-angiogenic agent) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who fail to
           respond, or progress after an initial response, to primary therapy with an immune
           checkpoint inhibitor.

        2. To assess the toxicity profile of the three-drug regimen in this population compared to
           historical treatment-na√Øve population (as published in literature)

      Exploratory Objective

        1. To investigate the role of peripheral blood CD 8+ T cells, absolute eosinophil count
           (AEC) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) as biomarkers of response to salvage
           chemotherapy after primary immunotherapy

        2. To investigate the role of plasma carbonic anhydrase IX level as predictive biomarker of
           response to ramucirumab.
