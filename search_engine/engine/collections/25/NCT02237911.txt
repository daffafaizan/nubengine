      clinical trial. Two hundred forty older adults who underwent TKR at least 2 months prior and
      are otherwise eligible will be randomized into one of three treatment approaches: 1)
      clinic-based individual outpatient rehabilitative exercise; 2) community-based group exercise
      classes; or 3) usual medical care. Subjects will be treated for 3 months. Data will be
      collected before intervention, after intervention (3 months), and 6 months after
      randomization. Physical function is a primary outcome and will be assessed by the Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and a battery of performance-based tests
      germane to patients post TKR that includes ability to walk, manage stairs, lift from the
      floor and the chair, and one-leg balance. We will also use an accelerometer-based monitor
      that provides a real-time measure of physical activity during normal daily living and is able
      to accurately capture most levels of activity. Linear mixed models will be fitted to compare
      the changes in outcome across groups. Logistic regression will identify patient
      characteristics that predict functional recovery in the exercise groups. Survival analysis
      and instrumental variable methods will be used to compare attrition, adherence and adverse
      events between groups.
