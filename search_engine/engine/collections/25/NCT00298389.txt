      disease and emphysema. The major risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking
      therefore, the prevalence of this disease is increasing. COPD accounts for increasing numbers
      of hospital admissions due to increased numbers of chest infections and exacerbations. This
      may be related to the reduced capacity of macrophages from COPD patients to phagocytose
      bacteria and apoptotic cells. The reasons for this defect in the innate immune response in
      these subjects is unclear but there are suggestions that scavenger receptors may be altered
      by oxidative stress and reduce the phagocytotic pathway. This would be relevant in COPD, as
      increased oxidative stress is associated with cigarette smoking. We have preliminary data
      that shows a similar reduce phagocytotic response in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from
      COPD patients compared with smokers and non-smokers. As these cells have not been exposed to
      oxidative stress other mechanisms may play a role in reducing phagocytosis. Using this MDM
      model, by taking blood from patients with COPD, we aim to investigate the mechanism of
      defective phagocytosis in COPD. We will measure the expression and regulation of cell surface
      scavenger receptors in cells of disease patients and control subjects and examine the
      signalling pathways leading to actin polymerization and phagosome formation. Finally, we aim
      to identify novel therapeutic strategies to reverse this effect and augment phagocytosis of
      macrophages in patients with COPD. Such a strategy would reduce chest infections and
      exacerbations and hence improve quality of life.
