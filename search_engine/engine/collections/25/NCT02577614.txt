      country for the treatment of patients with Hemophilia and inhibitors at a dose of 50-100
      units/kg. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of FEIBA
      for Hemophilia patients with inhibitor and has a theoretical advantage compared to current
      blood product transfusion methods, as it replenishes multiple depleted factors that are lost
      with prolonged exposure to CPB.

      This pilot study is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial
      assessing the feasibility and safety of factor eight inhibitor bypass activity (FEIBA) in
      patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery requiring prolonged CPB. The study
      population will consist of adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery at OHSU. Twelve
      participants will randomly assigned to receive FEIBA or placebo during their surgical
      procedure.

      Patients will be followed to review for adverse events while in the ICU, and up to four weeks
      after discharge.
