      in terms of improved myocardial perfusion in STEMI patients. However, myocardial perfusion
      after thrombus aspiration has not been evaluated by a quantitative, invasive method.
      Investigators intend to determine whether thrombus aspiration of the infarct-related artery
      increases myocardial perfusion, as measured by IMR, compared to conventional primary PCI.

      Study design PATA-STEMI is a single center, prospective, randomized trial with a planned
      inclusion of 128 patients with the first STEMI. Patients are randomly assigned, before
      coronary angiography, to thrombus aspiration using the 6 or 7 French Eliminate aspiration
      catheter (Terumo Medical Supply, Japan) or to conventional primary PCI. The IMR will be
      determined in infarct-related artery and non-infarct-related arteries without critical
      stenosis to measure microcirculatory resistance. The primary endpoint is defined as IMR in
      infarct-related artery in thrombus aspiration compared to conventional PCI group. Secondary
      end points are myocardial perfusion grade and resolution of ST-segment elevation, infarct
      size and left ventricle remodeling, as assessed by echocardiographic indices. Transthoracic
      echocardiography will be conducted within 24 hours and at 4 months after the primary PCI.

      Implications: If manual thrombus aspiration reduces microcirculatory resistance, indicating
      improved myocardial perfusion, as compared to conventional PCI, it might become the preferred
      strategy in patients with STEMI.
