      morbidity and mortality. Placing infants < 32 weeks' gestation in a polyethylene bag (PB) in
      the delivery room (DR) reduces the rate of hypothermia on admission to the Neonatal Intensive
      Care Unit (NICU). Since 2012, the rate of admission hypothermia in preterm infants, placed in
      a PB in the DR at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH), has increased significantly. This
      may be as a result of heat loss while the infant remains attached to the cord.

      Our primary objective is to determine if placing preterm infants in a PB immediately after
      birth, before the umbilical cord is clamped will increase the number of preterm infants with
      a normal temperature on admission to the NICU.
