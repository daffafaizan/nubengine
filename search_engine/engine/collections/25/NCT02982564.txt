      increased survivorship. An unintended consequence of increased survival, however, is that
      more women are living with the negative sequelae associated with cancer treatment, including
      decreased physical function. Exercise has been beneficial in arresting these sequelae, but
      adherence to exercise guidelines continues to be a challenge. As most breast cancer survivors
      are middle-aged and older, an alternative to enhance exercise engagement and adherence might
      be providing a low intensity exercise program. The overall purpose of this study is to assess
      the impact of a low intensity versus moderate intensity endurance exercise program on
      physical functioning on breast cancer survivors. It is hypothesized that participants of the
      low intensity exercise program will demonstrate similar physical functioning as participants
      in the moderate intensity exercise program. The Theory of Planned Behavior will serve as
      framework for the intervention. A convenience sample of 142 women, residents of Puerto Rico,
      age 50 or older, with a diagnosis of breast cancer, stage 0 thru III, who have received
      surgical treatment for breast cancer, with or without adjuvant therapy, will be randomly
      assigned to a low intensity or moderate intensity endurance intervention. Both interventions
      will be home-based, have a duration of 6 months, and be provided by physical therapists. An
      evaluator blinded to group assignment will assess participants at baseline and at completion
      of the intervention. Primary outcome measures will consist of physical functioning, and
      health-related quality of life.
