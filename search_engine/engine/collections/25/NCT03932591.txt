    
      This study will include 78 spastic hemiplegic patient ( 39 controlled, 39 intervention group)
      Spasticity , Soleus Hmax/Mmax, Soleus T reflex, Soleus H reflex will be evaluated in this
      study.

      Inhibitory kinesio taping method will be used in intervention group for 64-66 hours. Y shaped
      kinesio tape will be applied on spastic gastrocsoleus muscle. Sham kinesio taping method will
      be used in controlled group for 64-66 hours. 2 pieces kinesio tape 2,5 cm width, 5 cm length
      will be applied on gastrocnemius medial and lateral head, 1 piece kinesio tape 5 cm width, 5
      cm length will be applied on achilles tendon.

      Spasticity, Soleus Hmax/Mmax, Soleus T reflex and H reflex will be measured pre-application
      (T0), after-application ( in a few minutes) (T1), after 64-66 hours ( with band applied) (T2)
      and after band removed (T3). Spasticity in both groups will be evaluated with modified
      ashworth scale.
