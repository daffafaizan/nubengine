      I. Assess feasibility and toxicity of single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) in the post-operative setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess quality of life following post-operative single-fraction SBRT. II. Assess rate of
      in-field failures.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess progression free survival and overall survival following post-operative SBRT for
      stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in the inflammatory markers.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning at least 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo 1 fraction (or 5
      fractions every other day if R2 resection of central tumor) of SBRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5 and 12 weeks and then
      periodically for up to 5 years.
