      I. To evaluate the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness and inflammatory and
      behavioral responses (negative mood, fatigue, pain, and cognitive problems) to typhoid
      vaccine in breast cancer survivors.

      II. To determine the effects of age and depressive symptoms on inflammatory and behavioral
      responses to typhoid vaccine and placebo.

      III. To assess the ability of cardiorespiratory fitness to moderate age- and
      depression-related responses to typhoid vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive inactive typhoid vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at visit 1 followed by
      placebo IM 30 days later at visit 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at visit 1 followed by inactive typhoid vaccine IM 30
      days later at visit 2.

      There is an initial screening visit where patients in both arms complete an audio-recorded
      interview that includes questions about changes in mood and emotion throughout their lives,
      body measurements, a finger stick to assess for anemia and diabetes markers. During visit 1
      and 2, patients in both arms will have blood drawn periodically and complete sets of
      questionnaires that assess feelings, health behaviors, and personality. Patients also
      complete cognitive tasks and a temperature sensitivity task at 3-4.5 hours post-injection.
