      of cases of acute hepatitis are seronegative and show no evidence of prior infection with
      known hepatitis viruses A, B, C, or E. Seronegative acute hepatitis is often complicated by
      autoimmune phenomena or late severe consequences, especially fulminant hepatitis of childhood
      and post-hepatitis aplastic anemia. Efforts in the Hematology Branch to identify an
      infectious agent in these latter two syndromes have been unsuccessful, probably because they
      are immune-mediated and also accompanied by massive tissue destruction. We now propose
      systematic collection of blood and fecal samples from patients with seronegative acute
      hepatitis for purposes of virus identification research. Samples will be collected from
      patients in United States Army clinics; patient identifiers will be employed.
