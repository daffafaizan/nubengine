      began the day prior to initiation of each cyclic bleeding episode (spontaneous menses or
      hormone withdrawal bleeding) and continued until the third bleeding day (inclusive). An
      external committee of blinded independent reviewers was to determine the 4-day cramping
      window for each participant so that analysis of the efficacy data could be conducted. The
      study was terminated early due to a business decision by the Sponsor to discontinue product
      development for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy outcomes. Due to the early study
      termination, the blinded independent review committee that was supposed to determine the
      4-day cramping windows for data analysis was not assembled; thus cramping windows were not
      determined. Without defined cramping windows, the efficacy outcome measures for this study
      could not be analyzed.
