    
      Overall, there will be 1-3 screening visits, a baseline visit where study drug will first be
      administered, and then 10 follow-up visits. Follow-up visits will occur at week 2, week 4,
      week 8, and week 12 in each treatment phase (IGF-1 or placebo), and then again 4 weeks after
      study completion, Parents/guardians will be asked to administer the IGF-1/ placebo by
      injection at home and will also be responsible for monitoring glucose levels in the child.
      Parents/guardians will be trained in these methods, and will have scheduled phone calls and
      appointments where the dose and tolerability will be discussed.
