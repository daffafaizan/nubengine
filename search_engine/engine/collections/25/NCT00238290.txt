      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) monotherapy followed by trastuzumab
           and letrozole in women with progressive advanced breast cancer that is resistant to
           prior treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate HER-2-extracellular domain (ECD) levels with response to treatment in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response and time to tumor progression with changes in serum HER-2-ECD levels
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes once in weeks 1-3 OR once in
      week 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression after 9 weeks receive trastuzumab as
      before and oral letrozole once daily in the absence of further disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease
      progression and then at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
