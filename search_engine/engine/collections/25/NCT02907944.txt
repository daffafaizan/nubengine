      (WHAT IF?) study will evaluate the impact of Implementation Facilitation on the adoption of
      addiction treatment services in four HIV clinics. We will use a stepped wedge design . The
      primary comparison is of the change that occurs from the pre-implementation period to two
      post-implementation periods, the initial six months (evaluation) and the following six months
      (maintenance). This proposal will consist of three main components in each of four clinics:
      1) formative evaluation with key stakeholders at each site to guide and refine the
      Implementation Facilitation, 2) conduct of the Implementation Facilitation and 3) an
      evaluation of the impact of the Implementation Facilitation on organization and
      provider-level readiness, provision of addiction treatments, and HIV outcomes.
