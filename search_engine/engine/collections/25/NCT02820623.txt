      fidelity measurement method; (2) estimate the economic costs and cost-effectiveness of the
      fidelity measurement methods; and (3) compare stakeholders' motivation to use each method, as
      well as identify their perceived barriers and facilitators to use of each method. This study
      will have a significant positive impact in two ways. First, it will validate fidelity
      measurement methods that can be used for research. Second, it will produce tools that can be
      used by community mental health clinics to monitor therapist fidelity, an indicator of
      therapy quality.
