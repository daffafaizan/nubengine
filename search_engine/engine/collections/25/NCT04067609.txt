      administered consistently (same time/same way): that labor nurses could give and without
      requiring the patient to have had an epidural placement. Further, Gabapentin, clonidine and
      ketamine are associated with CNS effects like sedation or confusion that could make health
      care providers less likely to be comfortable giving these women additional oxycodone due to
      possible worsened sedation or respiratory depression. Lastly, the researchers wanted to give
      a drug that both obstetricians and pediatricians were comfortable with from extensive use in
      our maternal population. Thus, a single administration IV dexamethasone was chosen for this
      study. Dexamethasone has been used as an adjunct for post-operative pain management in many
      types of surgeries. Although no large randomized trials exist, several small trials suggest
      an analgesic and opioid sparing effect of dexamethasone post-operatively for both pregnant
      and non-pregnanat patients; however these studies excluded patients on MAT
