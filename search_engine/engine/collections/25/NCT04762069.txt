    
      Berubicin is one of the first anthracyclines that crosses the blood brain barrier and
      overcomes drug resistance (i.e. it is not a substrate for multi-drug resistant/breast cancer
      resistant transporters). A Phase 1 clinical trial of berubicin in patients with primary CNS
      malignancies demonstrated a durable response (one subject alive 13+ years) as well as stable
      disease in heavily pretreated patients. Therefore, this phase 2 study is designed to further
      evaluate Berubicin's activity in patients with rGBM after treatment with standard of care.
