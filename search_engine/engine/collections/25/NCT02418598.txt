    
      Subjects will be hospitalized and conducted the baseline examination on Day -10. The target
      putamen for AAV-hAADC-2 infusion is identified on MRI image that has been taken prior to the
      operation, and then subjects will be bilaterally infused with a total volume of 200 / 600 µL
      at a total of 4 sites (2 sites in left putamen, 2 sites in right putamen; 50 / 150 µL per
      site) at a flow rate of 3 µL per minute on Day 0.

      After the infusion is complete, the cannula devices will be removed, and the surgical
      incision will be seamed in accordance with usual trephination. After that, cranial CT scan
      will be performed so as to confirm whether there are complications such as the occurrence of
      intracranial bleeding or not. Subjects stay in a hospital for 14 days after infusion of
      AAV-hAADC-2.

      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be evaluated the safety and efficacy of all
      subjects at 6 months later assessment in low dose cohort. If there are no events relevant to
      the discontinuance criteria or moderate to severe adverse events with casual relationship,
      "Definitely related" or "Possibly related", to AAV-hAADC-2 in this cohort, the study moves to
      high dose cohort.

      At the time of 6 months after the infusion, investigator assesses the treatment effect of
      AAV-hAADC-2 on the basis of subject diaries, clinical assessment and levodopa requirement
      dosage. At the same time, investigator assesses a relationship between the dose of
      AAV-hAADC-2 infused and the amount of intra-putaminal expression by FMT-PET imaging.

      The investigator also assesses the safety for 5 years after the baseline examination.
      Long-term follow up study is additionally conducted for 10 years in reference to guideline of
      FDA.
