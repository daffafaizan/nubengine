    
      Patients who meet study criteria for treatment of a simple cutaneous abscess and desire to be
      a part of this study, will be consented. Study subjects will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to either the study or control groups.

      Control Group- standard I & D method for cutaneous abscess.

      Study Group- Loop Technique:

        1. Gather all of your material and bring to bedside

        2. Clean area with chlorhexidine or iodine swabs

        3. Anesthetize area

        4. Use your scalpel to make small 5mm incision at most fluctuant area of abscess

        5. Explore cavity with your hemostat and break down loculations

        6. Make second incision less than 4cm away from first incision. Feel borders of abscess,
           and try to make second incision as far within cavity as you can.

        7. For larger abscesses can repeat step 5 thus creating several LOOPs.

        8. Irrigate cavity with saline flush

        9. Pass hemostat through both incisions and pull loop vessel, penrose, or bottom of glove
           through. Keep your loop device equal in length on both sides.

       10. Tie loop device loosely over 30cc syringe to form LOOP. Usually 5-6 knots. This helps
           prevent loop from falling out prematurely.

       11. Slide syringe out, and trim free ends of loop. Make sure loop is mobile.

       12. Cover site with dry dressing. Follow-Up-

             -  Wound check in 1-2 days

             -  Patient may manage drain at home by rotating it to facilitate drainage and prevent
                adhesion

             -  Patient will be instructed to return to the Emergency Department for drain removal
                in 5-7 days.
