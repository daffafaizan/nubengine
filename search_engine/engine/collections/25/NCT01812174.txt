    
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the 17mm On-X Aortic
      Prosthetic Heart Valve and the 23mm On-X Mitral Prosthetic Heart Valve when used to replace
      diseased aortic or mitral valves in human subjects.

      The On-X 17mm aortic valve will be implanted in approximately 20 and at least 15 patients who
      will be followed for at least 1 year. Patients will be any age and will require this size
      valve as determined in surgery but will be recruited prior to surgery based on results of
      preoperative screening tests.

      Enrollment into the 23mm mitral arm of the study has been terminated.
