      secretion and stimulates insulin secretion. This improves glycemia in subjects with type 2
      diabetes with a very low risk for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia nevertheless develops, it is
      important that vildagliptin under such conditions does not inhibit glucagon secretion, since
      that would aggravate the hypoglycemia. It was indeed previously demonstrated in type 2
      diabetes that vildagliptin dos not inhibit glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia. This study
      explores whether vildagliptin affects glucagon counterregulation during hypoglycemia in
      insulin-treated patients of type 2 diabetes. Vildagliptin is given, together with the
      on-going insulin therapy, for one month, whereafter hypoglycemia is induced under
      standardized conditions, and the glucagon response is determined, and compared to that after
      a month of placebo treatment. The hypoglycemia is induced bvy a standardized clamp procedure.
