      sitting are particularly damaging resulting in increased risk for chronic diseases such as
      cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Few interventions have been tested with
      the specific purpose of reducing sedentary time to improve risk factors for cardiometabolic
      diseases. The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a worksite
      intervention for reducing daily sedentary time and improving risk factors for cardiometabolic
      disease (e.g., measures of adiposity, anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory fitness) among
      sedentary, overweight, full-time working adults as compared to a waitlist control. A
      secondary aim will be to test pedal time at work as a measure of compliance with the
      intervention. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks and randomized to either a treatment
      or wait list control group which will have the option to crossover into the intervention
      after 12 weeks.
