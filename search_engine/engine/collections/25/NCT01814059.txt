      characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the
      gastrointestinal wall. The 2 major forms of EGID, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), differ in regard to the site of inflammation (esophagus
      vs. stomach/small bowel). Both EoE and EG are highly associated with coexisting allergic
      disease, and a large fraction of EGID patients are sensitized to multiple food allergens.
      Existing data strongly support the concept that EGID is a food-allergen-driven, eosinophilic,
      inflammatory gut disease. Multiple lines of evidence support a major role for Th2 cells and
      the cytokines they express (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in EGID pathogenesis.

      There are presently no drugs with a labeled indication for EGID. Most adult patients are
      managed long-term with corticosteroid therapy, which raises concerns about toxicity.
      Sirolimus is an immunomodulator approved for use in preventing transplant rejection. It
      specifically inhibits Th2 cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting it may have activity in
      EGID.

      This study is a phase I open-label design intending to target a sirolimus whole blood
      concentration of 6 ng/mL for a duration of 56 days. Twenty adult EGID subjects 10 with EoE
      and 10 with EG with evidence of Th2-mediated IgE sensitization and peripheral blood
      eosinophil counts (Bullet)800 cells/ L will be recruited to participate. Subjects will begin
      sirolimus at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2/day. Blood sirolimus level will be checked at 14- to 28-day
      intervals, and the dose will be serially adjusted in each subject as needed to target the 6-
      ng/mL target trough concentration. Blood will be drawn at each visit to monitor drug levels
      and safety labs.
