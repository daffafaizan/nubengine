      criteria are: severe sepsis on admission requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both medical
      and surgical patients will be included. Any type of infections will be included (pulmonary,
      abdominal, urinary tract, etc.) Antibiotics regimen includes: broad spectrum anti-bacterial
      antibiotics plus caspofungin (70 mg i.v. on the first day day, and 50 mg i.v. on the
      consecutive days, once daily.

      Blood samples (3 mL) will be collected 2, 4, 8,12 and 24 hours after each dose of caspofungin
      for 3 consecutive days. The standard arterial canula will be used to obtain samples.

      30 minutes after each sample collection, blood will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000
      rpms. Subsequently, supernatant will be collected and frozen.

      Serum caspofungin concentration will be measured with high performance liquid chromatography.

      Each patient's hemodynamics parameters will be recorded with the use of transpulmonary
      thermodilution technique (PICCO). Other therapies i.e.: ventilatory support, sedation, an
      antifungal agent will be given as required.
