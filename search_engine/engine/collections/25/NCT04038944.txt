      Inclusion of left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) abnormalities together with
      risk prediction of CVA using CHA2DS2-Vasc score will identify patients at low or high risk
      for adverse cardiovascular events in patients with manifest and silent AF.

      Patients requiring cardioversion have higher risk of recurrent AF in follow up.
