      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) procedure. The technique of using a cotton pledget
      soaked with lignocaine and decongestant is quite effective but does cause some discomfort
      during application of a cotton pledget to the nasal cavity. Hence, an effective method to
      deliver anesthetic agent and maintain a good Ô¨Åeld of vision during endoscopy are all very
      important.

      Using a cotton-tippled applicator to deliver a soaked gauze strip may cause kinking of it
      around the nasal vestibule or just in the anterior end of a turbinate. Endoscopic guidance to
      deliver a gauze strip can confirm delivering it to at least the posterior end of a turbinate.
      We propose that a simple Endoscopic-Guided Gauze Pledgetting method (EGGP) is more tolerable
      than the "blind" cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for anesthetizing
      the nasal cavity.

      We hypothesize that this method can deliver a gauze strip to the superior end of a turbinate,
      thus inducing more adequate nasal anesthesia and reducing nasal pain. Hence, the primary
      objective of this study was to evaluate whether this EGGP method could reduce side effects
      such as nasal pain and bleeding and improve tolerance associated with UT-EGD. In a large
      tertiary referral hospital in Taiwan, We are going to conduct a prospective
      randomized-controlled trial to compare patient tolerance, safety and adverse events between
      EGGP versus cotton-tipped applicator primed gauze pledgetting (CTGP) methods of nasal
      anesthesia.
