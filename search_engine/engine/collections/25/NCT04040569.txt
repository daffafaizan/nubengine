      target smaller treatment volumes than what has been achievable with adjuvant PBI (Nichols
      IJROBP 2010), track radiobiological response to radiation at time of surgical pathology, and
      allow the removal of all irradiated tissue to potentially minimize late effects.The purpose
      of this phase I trial is to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity while dose escalating
      single-fraction preoperative S-PBI to a presumed radioablative dose over 3 cohorts, starting
      with 30Gy in 1 fraction and advancing to 34Gy and 38Gy in 1 fraction. This would be
      accomplished on the CyberKnife or GammaPod. The GammaPod is a novel device dedicated to S-PBI
      utilizing a Cobalt-60 source (Yu Med Phys 2013), which offers a highly reproducible prone
      setup with a mean of 1.8mm of mismatch reported in 15 patients at the University of Maryland
      on consecutive scans (Yu JCO 2011). Implications of this research are far reaching, including
      determination of the maximally tolerated dose for preoperative S-PBI, pathologic complete
      response rates of early stage breast cancer to a predicted radioablative dose, radiographic
      markers of treatment response (radiomics), and translational research assessing mechanisms of
      immune and radiation response.
