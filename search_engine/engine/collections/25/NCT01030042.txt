      Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer progressed after a first
      line treatment containing FOLFIRI and BEV

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Age >18 < 75 years of age

        -  Diagnosis of histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, stage IV

        -  K-ras wild-type

        -  ECOG performance status 0-1 at study entry

      Endpoints:

      - Response Rate, Disease control rate, The duration of overall response, Overall survival,
      PFS, Time to treatment failure, Quality of Life, Incidence of AEs, Frequency and nature of
      serious adverse reactions (SADRs), Premature withdrawals

      Statistical methods:

      Assuming a randomization ratio of 1:1, 282 deaths are required in order to achieve a power of
      80% of detecting a hazard ratio of 0.72 in favour of one of the two sequences, translating in
      an increase of median survival time from 10 to 14 months, with a type I error of 5%,
      two-sided, using the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank test. With a uniform accrual period
      of 3 years and a follow-up of 18 months, about 350 patients will be needed to reach the
      target number of events.

      All statistical analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat approach. CONSORT rules will
      be applied to describe study flow and protocol deviations.

      All OS and PFS curves will be drawn with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results will be presented
      as Hazard Ratio (HRs) and their 95% Confidence Interval (CIs).

      On annual basis, starting from the second year, an interim analysis will be conducted. In
      principle, no formal stopping rule will be applied, unless otherwise suggested by the DSMC.
      Safety reports will be drawn on annual basis.
