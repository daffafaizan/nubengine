    
      An extended release (XR) formulation of rosiglitazone maleate (RSG), a new formulation of
      rosiglitazone, is being investigated as a treatment for patients with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      This study is a randomised double blind, parallel group, and will evaluate the effects of
      repeat oral doses of RSG- XR for 21 days (due to the long half-life of the main metabolite
      M10) on the QTc interval compared to placebo in a population of healthy adult males and
      females between 18 and 45 years of age. Moxifloxacin, a drug with well-quantified QTc
      prolongation, will be included as a positive control in order to validate the ability of the
      study to detect small changes in QTc.
