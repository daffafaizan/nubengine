    
      This investigator-initiated study will investigate the safety and efficacy of Romiplostim,
      thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic, in children (ages: 0 to 21 years) with broad scope of bone
      marrow failure disorders (BMF) including acquired and inherited conditions as a first line of
      therapy along with standard of care.

      Objectives: Primary objectives are to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of Romiplostim
      in children with BMF. Methods: This open label, prospective Pilot interventional study has
      two arms.

      Arm A will include acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders including aplastic anemia,
      refractory cytopenia of childhood without monosomy 7 and 5q deletion abnormalities, toxin
      induced myelosuppression due to infection and inherited cytopenia with or without involvement
      of other cell lines who are transfusion dependent and or showing progression to bone marrow
      failure. Arm B will include children with chemo and or radiotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia/cytopenia and children undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT). Children
      with cancer predisposition and other morbidities which are considered significant by the
      investigator will be excluded from the study.
