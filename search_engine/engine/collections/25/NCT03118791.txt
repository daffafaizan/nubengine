      Increasing evidence from human epidemiological and dietary intervention studies suggests that
      anthocyanins may have cardiovascular health benefits. A double blind randomized controlled
      crossover, dose-response study will be conducted in 10 young healthy men. On 6 different
      days, subjects will consume capsules containing 0, 80, 160, 240, 320 and 480 mg of purified
      anthocyanins with a one-week wash-out period. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and blood pressure
      will be measured at baseline and at 2 and 6 h after consumption. Blood samples will also be
      taken and quantification of plasma anthocyanin metabolites using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS will be
      performed. The aim is to investigate whether purified anthocyanins are able to increase FMD
      at 2h and 6h post consumption and whether these effects correlate with anthocyanin- derived
      phenolic acids quantified in the plasma.
