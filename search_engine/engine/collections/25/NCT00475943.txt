    
      OBJECTIVE:

      Our objective is to determine the factors that cause epiglottic inversion during normal
      deglutition and attempt to recreate this movement by means of muscle stimulation.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      We plan to accrue 30 healthy volunteers so that a set of 20 participants will provide
      reliable data for analysis.

      DESIGN:

      As an observational study, anatomical movement will be examined with videofluoroscopy during
      normal swallows and during stimulation of the thyrohyoid, geniohyoid, hyoglossus, and
      styloglossus muscles.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The principal outcome of this study is the distance of epiglottal displacement as measured
      from videofluoroscopic images during normal swallowing and muscle stimulation. Secondary
      measures are assessed as correlates of epiglottal inversion. These data include motion and
      kinematics of other structures, such as the hyo-laryngeal complex and the tongue; tongue base
      retraction pressures in the oral-pharynx, the hypopharynx, and the UES; and muscle activity
      as measured by surface electromyography in these three locations.
