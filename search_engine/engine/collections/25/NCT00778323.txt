      mortality after elective cervical decompression surgery.Remote ischemic
      preconditioning(RIPC)is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by
      reperfusion in one organ provide system protection from prolonged ischemia.The hypothesis of
      this protocol is that limb ischemic preconditioning could reduces spinal cord
      ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by elective cervical decompression surgery.Serum s-100B
      and NSE concentration will be measured before and after induction ,and at 6 hours,1,3,5 and
      7days after surgery.JOA scores in all the cases will be evaluated before operation and at
      7days ,1,3,6 month after surgery.
