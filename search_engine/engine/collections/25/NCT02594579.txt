      associated with muscle wasting and physical disability. Recent study showed that treatment of
      vitamin D deficiency with high dose vitamin D improved muscle wasting and may prevent further
      muscle breakdown.

      Investigator want to explore whether a high dose vitamin D3 supplementation, compare to
      placebo will be able to improve muscle wasting in critically ill patients.

      The eligible participant will be asked to sign and date the informed consent document then
      they will be randomized to receive vitamin D3 supplement or placebo, using the computer
      generated code in conceal envelope.

      Vitamin D3 or placebo will be given orally or feeding tube via feeding tube at a dose of
      100,000 IU on day 1 and 3 then 50,000 IU on day 5,7,9,12 followed by 150,000 unit per week
      for 4 week.

      Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D will be measured at baseline (day 0) then
      day 10 and day 43 after vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, Investigator will assess the
      diameter of rectus femoris by using ultrasonography on day 0,10 and 43.
