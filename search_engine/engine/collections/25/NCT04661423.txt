      for real-time monitoring of cardio-respiratory parameters. The MultiSense速 strip measures in
      real-time, remotely and continuously 11 clinical key-indicators by being attached to the
      patient thorax: ECG trace, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate and
      relative respiration depth, pulse transit time, plethysmographic trace, perfusion index, skin
      temperature, physical activity and body position. Designed to be worn continuously for at
      least seven days, the patient can keep the patch during his sleep or in the shower.

      The aim of this study is to determine the quality of measurements of clinical signs provided
      by MultiSense速 strip in comparison to measurements made with conventional medical devices in
      the hospital setting, in terms of accuracy, connectivity, generation of artifactual data and
      stability of data transmission. The study population includes 60 patients transferred to
      post-ICU units for a minimum of 5 days. Once in the post-ICU unit, the MultiSense速 strip will
      be attached on patient's thorax. The monitoring will last between 5 to 7 days.
