      connection between events that occurred during the actual time of birth, to the risk of a
      significant morbidity development in the future. Gas values in cord blood are measurable and
      represent the condition of the fetus close to the time of birth. Their level is one of the
      essential criteria which are used to define acute hypoxic event during birth. As the oxygen
      supply to the fetus significantly disturbed, deficiency of oxygen in the tissues is growing.
      Therefore, the tissues begin to accumulate large amounts of acid and thereby developing fetal
      blood acidosis. Many works connected the presence of cord blood acidosis to development of
      neonatal cerebral palsy. According to the American Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
      cord blood gas sample is necessary when a prenatal event may be related (rightly or not) with
      negative neonatal outcome. This approach might be necessary when the case is legally
      controversial and there is a need to prove that umbilical cord gas values were normal at the
      pre-natal period.

      Aim of study Our aim is to find the effect of the cord blood sample storage way, and the
      effect of the sample taking time from the delivery.
