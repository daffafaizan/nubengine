    
      This study is an international phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy
      and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral daily relugolix 40 mg co-administered with
      low-dose E2 and NETA (Group A) and 12 weeks of daily oral relugolix 40 mg alone followed by
      12 weeks of daily oral relugolix 40 mg co-administered with low-dose E2 and NETA (Group B)
      compared with 24 weeks of placebo (Group C).

      All participants completing the Week 24 visit, including participants randomized to placebo,
      were offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all eligible
      participants will receive relugolix co-administered with low-dose E2 and NETA. Participants
      who did not enroll into the extension study had a follow-up visit approximately 30 days after
      the end of treatment (that is, after the participant's last dose of study medication).

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs,
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and assessments
      of bone mineral density.
