      refractory epilepsy.The investigator observed efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of in one
      child who got Kawasaki disease. Subsequent adjunctive aspirin therapy in four patients
      yielded a reducted frequency of seizure for 51.2-89.7%. The investigator intend to evaluate
      whether aspirin would be an effective add-on treatment in TSC patients with refractory
      seizures.

      Refractory epilepsy was defined as more than 8 times of epileptic events in 4 weeks at
      baseline, and had been given more than two antiepileptic drugs maintaining for more than 3
      months.TSC patients aged 6-30 years' old would be recruited with refractory seizures and
      randomly assigned to two groups, aspirin and antiepileptic drugs(AEDS) group and placebo-AEDS
      group after written informed consent be obtained. Patients and their guardians would be
      instructed to record their own seizure diary on the epileptic events and report monthly.The
      primary outcome would be reduction of seizure frequency (measured by average seizure
      frequency and response rate). The secondary outcome would include seizure-free days,
      seizure-free rates, changes in EEG, changes of facial angiofibromas, and exposure-response
      relationship analysis.The study is designed as a placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded
      evaluation trial.
