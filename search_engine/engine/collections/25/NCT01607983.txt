      undergo a staged surgical palliation to a situation where the single ventricle is recruited
      as the systemic pumping chamber and some (following a Glenn surgery) or all (following a
      Fontan surgery) systemic venous return flows passively to the lungs. While this physiology
      eliminates ventricular volume loading and normalizes systemic arterial oxygen saturations,
      there remain a number of physiologic burdens that limit functional capacity and life
      expectancy. Evidence suggests that this surgical imposition of the systemic and pulmonary
      vascular beds in series results in ventricular loading conditions that adversely affect
      ventricular function. At present, there exist limited means by which to mitigate these
      burdens, however, new therapies directed at reducing total pulmonary resistance may favorably
      affect patients with this physiology by reducing systemic venous pressures and improving both
      ventricular preload and afterload. One such therapy is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), which is a
      selective pulmonary vasodilator that has been shown to reduce total pulmonary resistance and
      improve systemic venous pressures in this patient population. However limited data exist
      regarding the affects of pulmonary vasodilators like iNO on ventricular loading and
      ventricular-arterial coupling. This study proposes to assess the effects of pulmonary
      vasodilator therapy upon ventricular loading and ventricular-arterial coupling in single
      ventricle patients with passive pulmonary blood flow presenting for elective cardiac
      catheterization. The study components include obtaining routine (they would be obtained as a
      part of the clinically-indicated catheterization) hemodynamic measurements with hi-fidelity
      catheters rather than standard fluid-filled catheters, as well as simultaneous additional
      measurements with the same catheters at rest and during administration of iNO.
