      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide with or
           without rituximab followed by maintenance therapy comprising lenalidomide in patients
           with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma who have undergone
           autologous or syngeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Consolidation phase: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

             -  Group I: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14. Treatment
                repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Group II: Patients receive lenalidomide as in group I. Patients also receive
                rituximab IV once on the day before the start of lenalidomide and then once between
                days 25-30, 50-55, and 75-80 for a total of 4 doses in the absence of disease
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Maintenance phase: Beginning 2 months after completion of consolidation therapy, all
           patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then annually
      thereafter.
