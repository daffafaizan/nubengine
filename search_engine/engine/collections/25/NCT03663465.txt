      always been a cause for global concern and discussion. Although Hawthorn is widely used in
      the treatment of heart problems and the lowering of blood lipid levels, it is unknown whether
      Hawthorn has an effect in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. Hence, there
      are several areas of interest in the present study: 1) the effect of Hawthorn on lipid
      profile levels in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics; 2) a comparison of
      lipid profile levels between schizophrenic patients and healthy adults; 3) the contributing
      factors that relate to changes in lipid profile levels in patients who take Hawthorn.
