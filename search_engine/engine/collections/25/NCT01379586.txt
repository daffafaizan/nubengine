    
      This is a first-in-human study of ONO-4053 in healthy volunteers. This study consists of
      three parts. Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when
      single ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Part B will
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in the fed and fasted state in an open-label
      manner. Part C will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when multiple
      ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Doses for Part B and C
      will be determined after data from Part A are available.
