      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods used to prevent GVHD include diverse
      pharmacologic interventions and ex vivo methods of T-cell depletion, the latter being the
      most effective ones. Historically depletion of T-cells from the graft is associated with
      increased rate of graft failure, relapse of malignant disease and prolonged immune
      deficiency. Selective depletion of TCR-alpha/beta T-lymphocytes is a new method of
      hematopoietic stem cell graft manipulation which is thought to conserve important cell
      populations, e.g. NK cells and gamma/delta T cells within the graft. Preliminary results
      suggest that TCR alpha/beta depletion ensures high engraftment rate, low early mortality and
      good control of GVHD. The problem of delayed immune reconstitution and life-threatening viral
      infections remains incompletely resolved.

      Depletion of naive (CD45RA-positive) T-cells was developed as a new method of graft
      manipulation to prevent GVHD. Research data indicate that alloreactivity is associated mainly
      with naive T-cell fraction. In vitro depletion of CD45RA lowers significantly the
      alloreactive response while retaining reactivity to pathogens.

      In the current protocol we plan to test whether relatively low doses of CD45RA-depleted
      mononuclear cells can be safely infused after TCR-alpha/beta depleted transplantation. The
      biologic readout for the protocol will be quantitative assessment of T-cell reactivity to
      common pathogens after infusion.
