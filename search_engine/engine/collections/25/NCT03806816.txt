    
      It is a randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial on 100 neonates with moderate to
      moderately to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) . HIE infants are randomized into
      two groups: Whole body cooling group (N = 50 receive 72 hours of whole body hypothermia) and
      melatonin/ hypothermia group (N = 50; receive hypothermia and 5 daily enteral doses of
      melatonin 10 mg/kg). Serum melatonin and autophagy levels are measured at enrollment, daily
      during the hypothermic treatment, at day 5 and 7 for the two HIE groups.

      aEEG will be performed for 72 hrs during the hypothermic treatment and the re-warming. MRI
      and Spectroscopy analysis will be performed between day 5 and 7 of. After hospital discharge
      the infants will enter a follow-up program consisting in periodic clinical and developmental
      assessments until 2 years of age corrected for prematurity. An expert psychologist and a
      neonatologist will assess neurodevelopmental outcome using the Bayley Scales III at 6-12-24
      months of corrected age.
