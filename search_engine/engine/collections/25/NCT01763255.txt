      cells.the children(4-12years)with definite diagnose of cerebral palsy enroll to the
      study.first of all all the physical exam,laboratory test,EEG and MRI is done.after hospital
      admission,the patient underwent bone marrow transplantation.In laboratory,the cells are
      separated and prepared for injection.after 24hours the neurosurgeon inject the
      cells(intrathecal).the patient would be under observed for 48hours.If no allergic reaction or
      abnormal neurological symptoms accrued,patients can be discharged and would be followed up
      1,3 and 6months after injection.at the end of the 6months,the patients would receive second
      injection as same as the previous process.then they are followed at 1,3 immediate local and
      systemic side effect(fever,respiratory distress,erythema,rash,increase of heart rate or blood
      pressure)and neurological symptoms:motor dysfunction,sensory dysfunction,sphincter
      dysfunction,nausea,vomiting,head ache.EEG,MRI,GMFM66
