    
      The aim of this study is to pilot and assess the feasibility of a fully remote effectiveness
      evaluation of a smartphone self-management app for those living with Sjogren's syndrome.

      The fully-remote evaluation will involve minimal contact with researchers. Potential
      participants will be recruited internationally online through social media and mailing lists
      for Sjogren's syndrome support groups. Adverts will direct people to download the
      self-management app on app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play). The app has been
      designed to automate all study procedures, by guiding users through the following processes:
      screening, informed consent, randomisation, and the collection of outcome data through in-app
      surveys sent at 0, 5, and 10 weeks. Users will be randomised to receive the full intervention
      or a control:

        -  Intervention group: full version of the app containing multiple behavioural components:
           Symptom and Lifestyle Information, Energy Management, Goal Setting, Managing Difficult
           Times, Assertiveness and Communication Skills.

        -  Control Group: minimal version of the app containing only the Symptom and Lifestyle
           Information component.

      To pilot and assess the feasibility of the planned methodology, and inform the design of a
      future definitive randomised control trial of the app, the primary objectives of this study
      are to: characterise users (i.e. international recruitment and consent rates), and test
      screening, randomisation and data collection procedures (i.e. outcome measure completion
      rates and score variability). The secondary objectives are to explore app engagement patterns
      (using log data) and the acceptability of the study procedures and the app (using remote
      semi-structured interviews).
