      not requiring immediate surgery. There are many studies evaluating the effect of Medical
      expulsive therapy in treating ureteral stones, including a-blockers, and calcium channel
      blockers. Most of shuties concluded that the benefit of a-blockers might be among those with
      larger (distal) stones. There is no good method for the removal of upper ureteral calculi,
      except drinking water and exercising.

      Recently, a new extracorporeal physical vibrational lithecbole (EPVL) device named Friend-I
      EPVL (Zhengzhou Fu Jian Da Medical Instrument Co., Zhengzhou, China) has proven to be an
      effective treatment for upper urinary tract residual calculi. The device was approved by the
      Chinese food and drug administration in 2012. A Simple harmonic motion technology in
      multi-direction was applied. The Lateral acceleration was provided by the physical vibration
      device in the base through the harmonic vibration wave in the horizontal direction, which
      induces the urinary stone separate with the kidney or ureter, and expands a moving space for
      the stone. Meanwhile, an axial effect was produced to push the stone by the physical
      vibration device in the handle through the harmonic vibration wave in the multi- direction.
      So, we think that EPVL may be effective in treating ureteral stones.
