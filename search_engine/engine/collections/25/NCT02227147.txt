    
      An 8-week phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel
      group study with a 24 or 32 week follow-up period to evaluate the efficacy of a formulation
      containing anti-oxidant of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) in 20 μg/ml, eye
      drops solution versus vehicle containing anti-oxidant in patients with Stage 2 and 3
      Neurotrophic Keratitis. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 20 μg/ml 6
      times a day of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) containing anti-oxidant, eye
      drops solution compared to vehicle (formulation containing anti-oxidant) given 6 times a day
      in inducing a complete healing of stage 2 (PED) and 3 (corneal ulcer) NK as measured by the
      central reading center, evaluating the clinical pictures of corneal fluorescein staining.

      Secondary objectives were to assess the duration of complete healing, improvement in visual
      acuity and improvement in corneal sensitivity, and percentage of patients achieving complete
      corneal clearing defined as complete absence of staining on the modified Oxford Scale.
