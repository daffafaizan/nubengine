      for 10-months between health and wellness services in the selected zip codes: 75210, 75215,
      75216, 75217, 75223, or 75227. Participants will receive a multi-level intervention utilizing
      the current I-POP Health model that includes: 1) Access to health services (including oral
      health), 2) Access to clinical prevention services, 3) Access to education and facilities to
      increase physical activity and improved nutrition choices, and 4) Scheduled visits with CHWs
      for education and navigation. Individuals will complete study measures at baseline, 6-months,
      and 10-months.

      The control group participants will receive access to the same I-POP Health resources without
      CHW navigation until the end of 10-months (delayed CHW navigation). The current usual care
      model is outlined below (section 2.3) Participants will complete study measures at baseline,
      6-months, and 10-months timepoints. Upon completion of 10-months measures, these individuals
      will be assigned a CHW and receive delayed navigation.
