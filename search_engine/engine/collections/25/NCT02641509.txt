      quality of polypectomy is scarce. A recent paper from Pohl et al focused on non-pedunculated
      polyps of 5-20 mm, evaluating non complete polypectomy and factors related to it, revealing
      that 10% of these polyps were not completely resected. This fact was attributed to size and
      histology (the majority of non completely resected ones, were polyps of 10-20 mm and with
      serrated characteristics at the histology). In this study the investigators want to evaluate
      the radical resection of non-pedunculated polyps of 5-20 mm by performing biopsies on the
      margins immediately after polypectomy, to establish if the use of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI)
      could be useful in the definition of the margins of the lesion before polypectomy.
