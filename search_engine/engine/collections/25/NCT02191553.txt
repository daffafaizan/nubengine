      attentional focus, so that it enhances the ability of sustained attention. It involves a
      complex process of self-regulation and inhibition of internal and external stimuli
      interferences.

      Although the overall effects of meditation on brain bioelectrical signals are still being
      characterized, there is some consensus on the fact that meditation helps alter brain activity
      in both state and trait.

      The specific aim of this study is to assess the differential effect of four different
      practices of mindfulness in psychological well-being and their corresponding
      neurophysiological correlates.

      The hypothesis is that different exercises within the range of mindfulness practices exert
      different effects in terms of electroencephalographic activity, expecting different band
      increases in alpha (activity 7-to 2 Hz), beta (activity more than 13 Hz), theta (activity 4-6
      Hz) and delta (activity less than 3 Hz) respectively, as well as changes in the
      lateralization of the activity (left or right hemisphere). We also expect an improvement in
      the variables such as mindfulness, self-compassion, positive affect, anxiety, depression and
      sleep quality.
