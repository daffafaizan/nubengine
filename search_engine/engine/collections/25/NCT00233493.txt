      is examined and a dermatophyte is isolated from either toenail or foot scale, other family
      members are examined and cultured. All dermatophyte isolates obtained from each family unit
      are compared using DNA typing and restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine whether
      family members share the same organism or were infected by an outside source.
