      lymphatics after injection into the tissue and draining regional lymph nodes are thereby
      colored black,which may provide surgeons the guidance to lymph node dissection and help them
      harvest lymph nodes after surgery,especially some small ones. but there was insufficient
      evidence to justify its efficacy for those purposes.Therefore,the investigators carried out a
      prospective randomized controlled trial on lymph node vital staining for lymph node
      dissection and harvesting in advanced gastric cancer to test this idea.
