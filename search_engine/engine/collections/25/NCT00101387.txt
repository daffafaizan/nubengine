      LBP. When LBP becomes chronic, it can lead to functional and emotional impairment, increased
      health care utilization, and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment for LBP typically
      consists of non-opioid analgesics and physical therapy; however, analgesic-associated
      morbidity in older adults often limits their utility. This study will determine the efficacy
      of PENS treatment, a neuroanatomically guided form of electroacupuncture, and exercise in
      reducing pain in older adults with chronic LBP.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: PENS alone, PENS
      placebo, PENS plus GCAE, or PENS placebo plus GCAE. The treatments will be given twice weekly
      for 6 weeks. Pain intensity, physical function, health care utilization, and psychosocial
      function will be assessed with self-report and performance-based measures. These assessments
      will be conducted at study start, immediately after the last treatment session, and 6 months
      after study completion.
