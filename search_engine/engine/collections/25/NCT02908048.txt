      liver cancers such as hepatocellular cancer or biliary cancer, and chronic liver diseases.
      The use of selected exRNA biomarkers for diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) or biliary
      tract cancers in patients with cirrhosis will be evaluated in a prospective case-control
      study. The study will create a registry of patients who have chronic liver disease,
      cirrhosis, liver and biliary tract cancers. A risk factor questionnaire will be administered
      to facilitate identification of risk factors for development of liver cancer. Patient
      information will be obtained from the medical record, and include demographics, medical
      history, liver disease, smoking and alcohol history, etiology, family history, and clinical
      laboratory data.
