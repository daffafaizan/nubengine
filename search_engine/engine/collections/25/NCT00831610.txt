      complications than in non post-bariatric patients. Surgical techniques that provokes less
      complications are required.

      Anchor-line abdominoplasty is a technique published in the years 1950 as well the first
      bariatric proceedings. Abdominoplasty without flap undermining is feasible in pendular
      abdominal wall of the former morbidly obese women with scarred abdomen.

      Classical abdominoplasty (with flap undermining) is known to impair significantly the skin
      sensation. Post-bariatric abdominoplasty without flap undermining keeps the skin sensation
      unaltered since the early post-operative period.

      Now that the post-bariatric anchor-line abdominoplasty improves the abdominal wall contour by
      removing the exceeding, pendular and striated skin saving the perforant skin sensory nerves.
      Could this technique improve the skin sensation of the anterior abdominal wall of the
      post-bariatric patients?
