      with several potential advantages over traditional instrumentation (TI). Shortened surgical
      time, fewer surgical instruments, and improved alignment are some of these proposed
      advantages. We sought to examine these assertions.

      52 patients (26 per group) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized trial comparing
      CT-based PSI with TI. No difference was seen in average patient age (68 years) or BMI (31)
      between groups (p=0.84 and p=0.89), although there were more males in the PSI group (14 vs 7,
      p=0.002). A single surgeon and consistent staff performed the surgeries with the same knee
      prostheses, and all cases were videotaped to measure the length of surgery and each
      individual step. Any additional bone cuts, size changes, or ligament releases made to achieve
      correct alignment and balance were documented. The number of instrument trays opened for each
      case was recorded. Postoperative long alignment and lateral radiographs were taken to measure
      the coronal and sagittal plane component alignment and mechanical axis in each patient.
