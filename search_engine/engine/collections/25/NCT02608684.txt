    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      anti-PD-1 antibody MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with standard of care gemcitabine
      and cisplatin chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
      (encompasses ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer). Subjects will receive 2 cycles
      of gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy followed by 4 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin
      combined with pembrolizumab in 21-day treatment cycles. Subjects will continue to receive
      single-agent pembrolizumab every 21 days as maintenance therapy for up to 2 year until
      progression or the subject meets withdrawal criteria. Tumor imaging with CT scan will occur
      at baseline and every 6 weeks (after each second cycle) during chemotherapy treatment and
      every 9 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint is efficacy as defined overall response rate
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1). Secondary endpoints for
      efficacy include progression free survival at 6 and 12 months, time to progression, duration
      of response and overall survival. Safety and tolerability of the regimen will be determined
      by assessing the frequency and intensity of adverse events as defined by the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4). Quality of life will be measured using
      the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire
      (QLQ-C30).
