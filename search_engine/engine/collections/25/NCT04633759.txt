      therapy strengthening exercises using blood flow restriction (BFR) in people with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) who have moderate-to-severe walking problems. BFR training involves placing a
      cuff on the leg being exercised in order to restrict blood flow. The cuff is attached to a
      specialized device that automatically detects the appropriate amount of pressure to place on
      the limb. Testing will occur before and after the 8-week treatment period.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of BFR by assessing recruitment rate, retention,
      adherence, satisfaction, and safety.

      Hypothesis: Feasibility will be demonstrated by: 1) enrolling 20 participants in 8 months, 2)
      retaining at least 16 (80%) participants, 3) 80% adherence to intervention, 4) 90%
      satisfaction with intervention, and 5) no serious adverse events related to the intervention.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine changes in knee and hip extension, hip abduction, and ankle
      plantarflexion muscle strength after the 8-week intervention.

      Hypothesis: Following intervention there will be clinically important within-group strength
      changes that correspond to established minimal detectable change values and which can be
      characterized as having at least a moderate effect size as defined by Cohen's d.

      Exploratory Aim: Explore changes in functional mobility (30-Second Sit-to-Stand, Berg Balance
      Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk. 10-day average activity level) and self-report measures (12-Item
      MS Walking Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MS Impact Scale-29, and Patient-Specific
      Functional Scale) after the 8-week intervention.
