    
      This multicenter study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design. A screening (SCR) period running up to 10 weeks before randomization will be used to
      assess subject eligibility followed by a treatment period of 52 weeks.

      At baseline, approximately 380 patients with active psoriatic arthritis will be randomized to
      one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 randomization:

      Group 1: Approximately 190 patients with active psoriatic arthritis; These patients will
      receive secukinumab 6 mg/kg i.v. at BSL, followed by the administration of secukinumab 3
      mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at Week 4.

      Group 2: Approximately 190 patients with active psoriatic arthritis; These patients will
      receive i.v. placebo at BSL and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, followed by the administration of
      secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at Week 16.

      Study will consist of 4 periods: a screening period (up to 10 weeks), treatment period 1
      (total duration of 16 weeks) and treatment period 2 (total duration of 36 weeks) followed by
      a safety follow up period of 8 weeks after the end of treatment visit (i.e., Week 52).

      Primary endpoint analysis will be performed with Week 16 data (last patient completing
      Treatment period 1 (Week 16). Long-term efficacy and safety assessments will be performed up
      to Week 52.
