      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor
      types. TRC105, a monoclonal antibody to CD105, is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor that
      complements bevacizumab in preclinical models. Together, these antibodies may result in more
      effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with
      bevacizumab alone. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and
      determine a recommended Phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose bevacizumab in
      patients with advanced solid tumors for which bevacizumab is indicated.
