      This protocol was designed as a descriptive analysis, not to support a hypothesis. This
      information is being provided to the public in the interest of transparency and for
      demonstrating the BBCIC's Distributed Research Network's (DRN) ability to define exposures,
      outcomes, covariates and confounders. When published, the report will caution that the
      protocol does not support any ability to compare safety or effectiveness but instead is to be
      used only to explore the feasibility of future, more detailed comparative analyses and to
      better understand the capabilities of the BBCIC project. Further, the report will caution
      that information from this protocol should not affect use of the medical products described
      in any way and the fact that the BBCIC is performing this descriptive analysis in no way
      suggests there is a safety or effectiveness issue with any of the products described.
