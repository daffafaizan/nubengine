      anesthesia and surgical team in a difficult position. Failure to perform an adequate
      preoperative evaluation may result in the team being unprepared. Therefore, various methods
      have been investigated in the prediction of difficult airway from past to present. With the
      development of technology, imaging methods have become routine applications in clinical use.
      Ultrasonography and indirect laryngoscopy have been shown to be used in predicting difficult
      airway in the literature, but there is no study showing which is a better predictor.
