      to a state of decreased physiological resistance. It is characterised by a "constellation of
      symptoms and signs that describe the heterogeneous response of older adults to physiological
      and metabolic challenges." While frailty is not necessarily synonymous with chronological
      age, it is more prevalent among the older adult population and is associated with up to a
      threefold increased risk of mortality or major morbidity postsurgery. Thus, it has become
      critically important for healthcare systems to develop strategies designed to improve
      clinical outcomes in this high-risk population when undergoing surgeries.

      Currently there is no clear intervention that has been proven to modify the syndrome of
      frailty or its impact on postoperative outcomes. This study investigates a novel
      multidisciplinary approach that can be implemented within a short time frame prior to
      surgery.

      We plan to study the efficacy of a preoperative "bundle" of interventions, which consists of
      preoperative physiotherapy, nutritional support and cognitive exercises on elderly frail
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, and evaluating their outcomes based 1) length of
      hospital stay 2) Functional recovery from surgery 3) post-operative complications.
