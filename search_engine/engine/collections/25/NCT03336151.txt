      healthier food choices at the point-of-purchase.

      Recently, the French government has selected the Nutri-Score as single front-of-pack
      nutrition label.

      Evaluations of the Nutri-Score suggest it is in helping consumers making healthier choices.
      However, its impact in vulnerable populations has not yet been tested. Students are thought
      to be a vulnerable population due to their limited resources and to their unhealthy food
      choices.

      The objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of the introduction of the
      Nutri-Score in campus cafeterias on the nutritional quality of food purchases. The
      intervention is conducted during several months, with a control period without front-of-pack
      nutrition labelling at the beginning of the university year.

      Data on purchases is collected regularly through receipts, and the nutritional quality of
      purchases is evaluated over time between the intervention situation and the control
      situation.
