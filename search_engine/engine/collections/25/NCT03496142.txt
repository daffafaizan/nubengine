      transperineal versus transrectal approach for prostate biopsies in the setting of prostate
      cancer suspicion.

      Post-biopsy infection is becoming a more and more challenging situation due to the increase
      of incidence and development of antibiotic resistant germs.

      The aim of this study would be to compare in a prospective randomized trial the rate of
      infection with transperineal vs transrectal approach.

      Patient presenting an indication of prostate biopsy (PSA elevation, suspicious lesion at
      digital rectal, suspicious lesion on MRI) would be randomized 1:1 among transrectal vs
      transperineal biopsies.

      Post-biopsy infection would be monitored by systemic urine analysis at one, two and four
      weeks after procedure and in case of clinical symptoms.
