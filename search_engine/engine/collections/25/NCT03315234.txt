      severity and complexity of coronary artery disease by incorporating genetic information into
      the SYNTAX score and providing personalized therapeutic guidance to patients. The ultimate
      goal of the study would be to identify, design and develop a panel of genetic markers that in
      combination with clinical and angiographic information will be a reliable tool for predicting
      cardiovascular risk for future adverse events. Clinical and genetic patient information are
      systematically collected in a fashion that will enable also retrospective evaluation.
