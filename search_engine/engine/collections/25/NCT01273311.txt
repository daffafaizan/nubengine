      epidemiologic investigation of the determinants and evolution of cardiovascular risk factors
      among 5,115 African American and white young to middle age adults 18-30 years of age at
      baseline in 1985-86. Participants were recruited from the populations of four geographic
      locations (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA). The study
      population was approximately balanced according to sex (54% women), ethnicity (52% African
      American), and education (40% with less than equal to 12 years of education) at each center
      (Friedman). After the 1984 baseline, additional examinations were undertaken at years 2
      (1987-88), 5 (1990-91), 7 (1992-93), 10 (1995-96), 15 (2000-01) and 20 (2005-06). To date,
      72% of the total baseline cohort is still active in the study.

      Based on 20 years of follow-up, the longitudinal data on this cohort provide clear evidence
      of an increase in the prevalence of many cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity and
      diabetes. Therefore, the study presents an ideal and unique opportunity to study change in
      cardiovascular risk factors beginning at an age we hypothesize may be critical in determining
      future trajectories of brain disease. Furthermore, the trends in CV-RF reflect general trends
      in the US population. Thus, CARDIA participants are ideal to study now because the cohort
      reflects the characteristics of the next generation of older persons.

      This is an ancillary study of MRI-evident neurodegenerative and vascular brain changes in a
      subset of 719 CARDIA participants who participate in the Year 25 Exam. Specifically, we will
      study the relations of timing length of exposure and levels of cardiovascular risk factors to
      presence of sub-clinical brain lesions and cognitive impairments. Participants were recruited
      from the CARDIA field sites at Birmingham, AL (PI: Cora E. Lewis, MD, MSPH- University of
      Lalbama, Nirmingham), Minneapolis, MN (PI: Pamela Schreiner, PhD, MS- University of
      Minnesota) and Oakland, CA (PI: Steve Sidney, MD, mPH- Kaiser Permanente).
