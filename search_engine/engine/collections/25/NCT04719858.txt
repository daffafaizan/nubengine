      years) by motivating them to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Adolescents can protect their mental
      health by increasing physical activity, reducing sitting time, getting sufficient sleep, and
      taking a daily breakfast. Targeting these healthy lifestyle behaviours in young adolescents
      is an empowering, low-threshold approach that can create large public health effects. The
      MOV-E-STAR project aims to meet the need for an intervention targeting these behaviors in the
      adolescent population. Therefore, the mobile intervention '#LIFEGOALS' was developed in
      collaboration with stakeholders and users. The theory-based intervention consists of an
      application that includes (a) a self-regulation component for goal setting, self-monitoring
      and feedback, (b) a narrative in the form of short episodes from a youth daily drama for
      modelling, attitude change and increased engagement, and (c) an automated chat-function for
      social support and sustained engagement with the intervention.

      The current study will test the intervention in a group-randomized controlled trial for its
      effects on mental well-being. Participants in the intervention group will have the #LIFEGOALS
      intervention installed on their phone and will be asked to use the intervention for 12
      consecutive weeks. Participants in the control group will not receive an intervention but
      will only participate in the measurements. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
      intermittent (7 weeks after baseline) and post (13 weeks after baseline). Measures will
      include smart wearables and surveys.
