      Restylane® Silk for correction of mid to low cheek fine lines and wrinkles. Twenty (20)
      subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will receive Restylane® Silk to a defined area of mid
      to low cheeks. The injections will be delivered intradermally via multiple 0.02 cc
      microinjections distributed in a grid array pattern with 1 cm between each injection point. A
      total surface area of 9-15 cm2 per cheek will be treated depending on the extent of fine
      lines in each subject. Following completion of injection treatment, manual massage will be
      applied to the full area to promote even distribution of the product. Each subject will
      undergo a total of three treatment sessions, one month apart, day 1, week 4, and week 8. The
      maximum amount of Restylane to be used per treatments session/per cheek is 1.5cc (not to
      exceed a total of 9 cc) per treated patient. Three dimensional digital photography utilizing
      the Vectra 3D System (Canfield) will be utilized to document pre-treatment status, sites of
      injection, and post-treatment effect. Subjects will be followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks,
      post-treatment day 90, and day 180.
