      through Standardized Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation for Ulcerative Colitis(UC) and
      Crohn's Disease(CD).Investigators have established a standardized isolation, store, and
      transport steps of fecal bacteria from donated fresh stool in the laboratory. Then the
      bacteria will be transplanted to mid-gut by nose-jejunum nutrition tube or
      capsules.Participants in this study will be assigned to receive Standardized Intestinal
      Microbiota Transplantation three times a week or traditional medicine and would be followed
      up for at least 1 year. The clinical symptoms, sign, blood tests, endoscopy and questionnaire
      will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of Standardized Intestinal
      Microbiota Transplantation at the start and end of the projects. At last, investigators will
      use 16S-rDNA to estimate the change of intestinal microbiota.
