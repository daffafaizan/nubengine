      Primary

        -  Validate a new screening tool (G8).

      Secondary

        -  Validate the French version of the screening tool "Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13)".

        -  Evaluate the merits of the screening tools (G8 and VES-13).

        -  Assess the screening tool in specific populations.

        -  Assess the number and type of interventions proposed after thorough geriatric
           assessment.

        -  Compare the two new tools (G8 vs VES-13).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      During the first consultation, patients have an initial clinical evaluation questionnaire
      comprising the G8. They also complete the self-questionnaire VES-13. Within 30 days, patients
      have a thorough geriatric assessment, including quality of life and physical function, by a
      physician without access to the G8 or VES-13 questionnaires. A blood specimen is also
      collected.

      Information on health status and quality of life is collected from medical records or from
      the doctor after 1 and 5 years.
