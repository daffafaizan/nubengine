      hemorrhagic injury on the battlefield is virtually always associated with pain, it is
      paramount that the selected pain medication does not disrupt appropriate physiological
      mechanisms that are beneficial towards the maintenance of blood pressure and vital organ
      blood flow during that hemorrhagic insult. Current guidelines for the selection of pain
      medications of a hemorrhaging soldier are based upon limited scientific evidence, with the
      vast majority of supporting studies being conducted on anesthetized animals. Thus, the
      interaction between hemorrhagic shock and pain medications commonly employed on the
      battlefield is yet to be determined in the conscious humans.

      With this background, we will test the hypothesis that fentanyl will impair the capacity for
      a conscious human to tolerate a hemorrhagic insult.

      The obtained data will provide the necessary scientific evidence in humans to support the
      Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC) guidelines on the analgesic of choice for
      moderate to severe injuries where the casualty is in hemorrhagic shock. Notably, such data
      will identify the analgesic that least compromises a human's ability to tolerate a
      hemorrhagic insult, ultimately providing critical information to the combat medic on which
      analgesic should be employed for such an injury.
