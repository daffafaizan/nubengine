      the treatment of de novo lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

      The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open, single-arm
      study. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled at up to 7 sites in Belgium and Germany. Follow-ups
      are scheduled before discharge, at 30 days, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. Each patient
      will have a follow-up contact via hospital visit and telephone.
