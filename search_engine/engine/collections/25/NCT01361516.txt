      lithotriptor; and it is not clear the reason why there is decrease in efficacy of the new
      lithotriptors. Is it due to their small focal point or to increased patient movement while
      under intravenous sedation.When the patients get sedated then it will be difficult to control
      their respiratory movements. Retrospective comparisons suggest that intravenous may
      facilitate earlier discharge if no manipulation of the airway was done; but they are often
      associated with pain, hypoxemic respiratory episodes and disruptive movements during
      lithotripsy Instead of intravenous sedation, general anesthesia offer pain free procedures,
      no movement of the patient and controlled movement of the respiration leads to stable
      position of the urinary stones and receives persistent shock wave energy on to the stone
      bringing about better and early fragmentation. Hence we work on the hypothesis that the new
      generation shock wave lithotripters have a small focal point, every movement of the stone
      during the respiration or patient movement, will take the stone out of the focus and there
      results in loss of shocks leading to lithotripsy failure and use of more fluoroscopy for
      refocusing the stone.

      Thus we think the proper choice of anesthetic technique will improve the efficacy of stone
      fragmentation in shock wave lithotripsy treatment at least in those who are obese and suffers
      from occult sleep- apnoea syndrome
