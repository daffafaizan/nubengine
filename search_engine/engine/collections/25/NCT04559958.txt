      morbidity and mortality. Tongue diagnosis is an important diagnostic tool in traditional
      Chinese medicine. However, tongue diagnosis often biased by subjective judgements and
      environmental factors. The automatic tongue diagnosis system can noninvasively capture tongue
      images, automatically correct any lighting and color deviation and analyze tongue
      manifestations.

      This protocol is a cross-sectional, case-controlled observational study investigating the
      tongue features of non-dialysis CKD and end-stage renal disease patients by using the
      noninvasive ATDS. CKD patients who meets inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.
      Participants will be divided into 3 groups according to their renal function and accept
      dialysis or not, including a non-dialysis CKD group, end stage renal disease (ESRD) group and
      control group. Tongue images will be captured and 9 tongue features including tongue shape,
      tongue color, fur thickness, fur color, saliva, tongue fissure, ecchymosis, tooth mark, and
      red dots will be extracted and analyzed by ATDS.

      This protocol aims to apply noninvasive ATDS to analyze tongue features of CKD patients.
