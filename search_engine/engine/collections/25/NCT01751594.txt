      (H4L) a comparison intervention, which will serve as the basis of comparison for Mobilizing
      Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE), the treatment intervention. H4L will be a health promotion
      and life skills intervention to account for time and attention. Following this the protocol
      team will then implement Trial 1. In this trial, the intervention specialist and a "peer
      buddy" (intervention co-facilitator) from one AMTU will conduct one wave of both MOVE and
      H4L. The team will then conduct an analysis of the process data and revise the two
      interventions (MOVE and H4L). Upon revising the interventions, the protocol team will
      implement Trial 2. In this trial, the protocol co-chairs and the interventionist from Trial 1
      will train interventionists and peer buddies from four new AMTUs; these interventionists and
      peer buddies will run the revised MOVE and H4L interventions. Each site will be designated as
      either a treatment or comparison site, and they will conduct two waves of their assigned
      intervention. The team at that time will conduct data analyses and then modify and manualize
      the final version of MOVE and H4L.
