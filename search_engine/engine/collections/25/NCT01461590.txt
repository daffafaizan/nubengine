    
      Severe anemia (SA, hemoglobin <6 g/dl) is a leading cause of pediatric hospital admission in
      Africa, with significant in-hospital mortality. The underlying etiology is often infectious,
      but specific pathogens are rarely identified. Guidelines developed to encourage rational
      blood use recommend a standard volume of whole blood (20 ml/kg) for transfusion, but this is
      commonly associated with a frequent need for repeat transfusion and poor outcome. Evidence is
      lacking on what haemoglobin threshold criteria for intervention and volume are associated
      with the optimal survival outcomes.

      We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a higher volume of whole blood (30 ml/kg; Tx30: n =
      78) against the standard volume (20 ml/kg; Tx20: n = 82) in Ugandan children (median age 35.5
      months (interquartile range (IQR) 12.5 to 52.5)) for 24-hour anemia correction (hemoglobin >6
      g/dl: primary outcome) and 28-day survival.
