    
      Objective: The primary objective of this multicenter single arm feasibility study is to
      provide an assessment of enrollment and follow up feasibility for this patient population
      being treated with the Apollo or Artemis Minimally Invasive Surgical Treatment (MIES).
      Patients who do not qualify for the INVEST Feasibility Study will be referred to the INVEST
      Registry study.

      Study Design: This study will be a prospective, multi-centered trial that will enroll 50
      patients at up to 10 United States (US) centers.

      Patient Population: Patients with moderate-large volume (20-80 cc) supratentorial
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who present within 24 hours of symptom onset. Enrolled
      patients will receive minimally invasive endoscopic evacuation with the Apollo system or
      Artemis Device.

      Indication: The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of
      tissue and/or fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with
      a Penumbra Aspiration Pump. The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for
      the Penumbra Aspiration Systems. The Apollo system has been cleared for the controlled
      aspiration of soft tissue and/or fluid during endoscopically guided neurosurgery of the
      ventricular system or cerebrum. In the present study, the researchers propose to investigate
      the feasibility of studying this patient population for eventual implementation of efficacy
      trials.
