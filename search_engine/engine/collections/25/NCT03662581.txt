      co-op and public health students in Ajax, Ontario. The program was started in January 2018
      and is run through the Ajax Harwood Clinic, which is a clinic housing a Family Health
      Organization (FHO) comprising of 5 physicians and approximately 6,500 patients. The purposes
      of the program are:

        1. To teach mindfulness skills for stress reduction, self-compassion, and dealing with
           difficult thoughts and emotions,

        2. To promote an integrative concept of health, which treats the whole person

        3. To promote community building and positive relationships

        4. To capitalize on the power of groups to:

             1. Foster peer-to-peer learning and support when it comes to coping with life
                challenges

             2. Combat isolation

             3. Increase efficiency, quality, and timeliness of care

      This study evaluates the 8-week rolling admission mindfulness program, by first doing a
      retrospective chart review to identify effect sizes and then conducting a before-after study
      evaluation of the effect of the mindfulness program on key mental health outcome measures.
