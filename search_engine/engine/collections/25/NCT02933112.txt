      appliance that covers the upper and lower teeth acts to pull the lower jaw forward, opening
      the throat passage and allowing for normal breathing. However, oral appliance therapy does
      not treat sleep apnea effectively in all individuals. In order to identify those individuals
      for whom oral appliance therapy will work, the study sponsor has developed an investigational
      device called an auto-titrating mandibular positioner. The device automatically pulls the
      lower jaw forward in response to respiratory events while the individual sleeps. Study
      participants will learn the outcome of their sleep tests and will provide feedback on the
      ease of use of the device.
