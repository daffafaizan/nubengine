      clinically required heel lance will be studied after obtaining appropriate verbal and written
      consent from the respective parents. Subjects will be monitored during a baseline resting
      state, during vibratory stimuli alone, and during a heel lance that is randomized to be
      preceded or not preceded by the vibratory stimulus. The sessions will include time-locked
      video recordings and electroencephalography using a specialized net of 128 electrodes
      (Electrical Geodesics Inc., EGI; Eugene, OR). Behavioral and cortical responses will be then
      be analyzed in a blinded fashion to determine the efficacy of the vibratory intervention, as
      well as to validate what behavioral responses are most correlated with nociception-specific
      cortical activity.
