      preventing post operative pulmonary complications (PPC) like alveolar collapse.

      Alveolar collapse can be measured by oxygen saturation drop when no oxygen therapy is given,
      when full neuromuscular block (NMB) reversal and no opioid is given intra and postoperative.

      LPV means:

      tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, inspiratory-expiratory (I/E) ratio of 1/1, positive end expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) minimum 5 cmH20 and higher during laparoscopy in obese patients, Inspiratory
      oxygen concentration (FIO2) max 80% during induction and max 40 % during maintenance and
      extubation. Extubation in an awake, full NMB reversed patient getting no opioids while giving
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during withdrawal of the tube. Lung recruitment
      maneuver (LRM) when lung compliance decreases below 40 milliliter per centimeter water.
