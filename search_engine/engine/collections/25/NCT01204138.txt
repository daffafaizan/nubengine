      combination with a background DMARD and TNF inhibition in patients with active RA using the
      ACR responder index looking for a 20% improvement.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apremilast when used in combination with TNF
      inhibition in patients with active RA.

      To evaluate the clinical outcomes in RA using the individual domains of the ACR responder
      index1 .

      To evaluate the clinical outcomes of RA using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28)2 To
      investigate the effects of apremilast on change in cytokine plasma concentration levels (from
      baseline to Week 12) and the achievement of an ACR response
