      colorectal surgery at CHU Liége (Belgium). Since October 2015, the University Hospital of
      Liège has been labelled as reference center for ERP after colorectal surgery by a
      French-speaking organization GRACE (French-speaking group for Enhanced Recovery after
      Surgery; www.grace-asso.fr). Despite the benefits for the patient and the economic benefits
      of such programs, some criticize ERP arguing that patients are asked to return home too
      early, while they have not recovered a satisfactory autonomy. Few studies have investigated
      the comfort and quality of home life of patients who have had ERP. We recently conducted a
      retrospective study to evaluate this quality of life. It turns out that patients report
      little postoperative pain, a sufficient degree of autonomy at home, and a high general
      satisfaction score (> 8.5 on a numerical scale of 0 to 10). However dietary and digestive
      difficulties were described by about one third of the patients questioned. [6] Others have
      also reported a caloric-protein deficit during the immediate postoperative period after
      colorectal surgery, up to the 7th day in some of their patients [7].

      Aim of the study. The aim of this study is to assess caloric-protein intake up to one month
      after colorectal surgery within ERP.

      General description. This observational study will quantify caloric-protein intake in 75
      patients undergoing colorectal surgery according to an ERP at CHU Liège. A dietary survey
      will be performed preoperatively and repeated postoperatively via telephone calls on Day + 3,
      Day + 7; Day + 15, and Day + 30, after leaving the hospital. The deficits observed will be
      correlated with the medical and surgical characteristics of the patients.
