    
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome that often occurs in
      critically ill patients.

      Patients with ARDS invariably require mechanical ventilation to improve oxygen transport. An
      improvement in oxygenation can be obtained by an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure
      (PEEP).

      In critically ill patients with ARDS, lung imaging is been held by the use of chest
      radiography and the "gold standard" technique, Computed Tomography (CT).

      We designed an observational study in which we included patients under mechanical ventilation
      admitted in our ICU. In all patients PEEP changes were applied and lung sonography was
      performed.
