      diagnosis, e.g., Orthostatic Intolerance, Pure Autonomic Failure, Multiple System Atrophy,
      and Baroreflex Failure. However, some patients present with a unique constellation of
      symptoms of autonomic dysfunction so that they do not fit into a diagnostic category. We
      hypothesize that a genetic cause exists in some of these patients. We further propose that
      our comprehensive evaluation of these patients will provide us with information on the
      pathophysiology of their condition and assist us in optimizing their treatment.
