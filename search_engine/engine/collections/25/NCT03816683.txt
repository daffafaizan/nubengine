      approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma
      (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. The approval of these newer therapies will
      have an impact on the treatment patterns, toxicity patterns, and outcomes in the MCL
      population. A prospective, observational study will help to better understand the evolving
      real-world treatment outcomes (including treatment patterns, reasons for discontinuation/dose
      reduction, treatment interruption or treatment switches), physician-reported clinical
      outcomes, and patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among
      patients diagnosed with MCL who newly initiated a novel therapy in the past 3 months, and
      treatment is ongoing at the time of enrollment
