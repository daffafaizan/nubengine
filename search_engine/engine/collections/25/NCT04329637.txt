      and often triggered by stress. The current disease-centered model of care does not address
      psychosocial factors that impact patient outcomes. The investigators hypothesized that a
      holistic, patient-centered care model integrating meditation and addressing psychosocial
      needs through a care coordinator, will improve healthcare outcomes in CVS.

      Methods: The investigators conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 49 patients
      with CVS (mean age: 34 Â± 14 years; 81% female) who were randomized to conventional healthcare
      (control group) or Integrative Health Care (IHC) (27: control group, 22: IHC group;). In the
      IHC group, patients were assigned a care coordinator and received meditation sessions from
      certified trainers from the Heartfulness Institute. Outcomes including psychological
      distress, coping strategies to manage chronic stress, cognitive symptom management, and
      Health-Related Quality of Life were measured with validated tools. An intention-to-treat
      analysis was performed.
