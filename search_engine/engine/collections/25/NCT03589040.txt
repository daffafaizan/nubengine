      with some antiretroviral therapies (ART) represent a barrier to effective family planning
      methods for HIV-infected women. It is therefore critical to generate data on the combined use
      of hormonal contraceptives and ART. This study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label,
      parallel, two-group, sparse-sampling pharmacokinetic study to describe etonogestrel (ENG)
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in two treatment groups (rilpivirine or darunavir- based ART)
      in 60 HIV-1 infected women. The primary endpoint is the comparison of the mean ENG
      concentrations at month 6 between the rilpivirine or darunavir treatment groups versus
      historical controls. This study will provide information on effective ART options for HIV
      positive women who opt for the contraceptive implant as a family planning method of choice.
