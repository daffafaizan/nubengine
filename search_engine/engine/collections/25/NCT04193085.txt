      that often result in progressive weakness and impaired function. Results from this study will
      help characterize how gait is affected in SMA and DMD. This novel device can serve as a more
      affordable and versatile measurement instrument for neuromuscular disorders that affect gait
      and balance. All participants will be observed and measured while wearing the instrumented
      insoles in the lab and in real-life environments.
