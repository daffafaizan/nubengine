      Appropriate patients who meet the inclusion criteria and complete the consent process will be
      asked to donate a small sample of excess tumour tissue after the completion of their surgical
      procedure. This tissue will be transferred to the research laboratory in Leeds University for
      analysis and subject to a variety of investigations and scientific procedures to achieve the
      study objectives.

      These include:

        1. - amyloid extraction by tissue homogenization and centrifugation as already documented
           in the literature.

        2. - mass spectrometry analysis to identify and characterize the most prominent proteins
           present in the amyloid deposits and their possible post-translational modifications.

        3. - Transmission Electron Microscopy to characterize at the gross features of the
           extracted amyloid fibrils at low resolution (>20Ã…). This relatively simple procedure
           allows for quick characterization of the samples in order to optimize them for Atomic
           Force Microscopy (AFM) and Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM).

        4. - Atomic Force microscopy to characterize helical parameters of the amyloid fibrils
           needed to calculate the structure from Cryo-EM data.

        5. - Cryo-Electron Microscopy to elucidate the structure of the amyloids extracted from
           tissue affected in each disease
