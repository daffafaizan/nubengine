    
      NKTR-255 is a cytokine that is designed to regulate T and natural killer cell activation,
      proliferation and promote their anti-tumor effects.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation, dose expansion, safety
      follow-up, and survival follow-up of NKTR-255 as a single agent and NKTR-255 in combination
      with DARZALEX FASPRO TM or rituximab. Study treatment is defined as any investigational
      treatment(s) or marketed product(s), intended to be administered to a study patient according
      to the study enrollment.

      Part 1 will enroll relapsed/refractory MM and NHL patients. In Part 2, Cohort A will enroll
      NHL patients who have progressed on a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) product,
      Cohort B will enroll MM patients who previously received daratumumab and other anti-CD38
      therapies to receive NKTR-255 alone and/or in combination with daratumumab, and Cohort C will
      enroll iNHL patients who previously received rituximab and other therapies to receive
      NKTR-255 alone and/or in combination with rituximab.
