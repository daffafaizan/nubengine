      costly to purchase and repair. Issues with flexible ureteroscopes include loss of deflection
      and visual performance (fiberoptic pixels) with use and the high repair costs. Reprocessing
      and sterilization of reusable ureteroscopes also requires staff who are specially trained and
      dedicated in this area. Inadequate sterilization could also lead to transmissible infections
      between patients. A single-use flexible digital ureteroscope has recently become commercially
      available (LithoVue, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA). Pre-clinical testing show the
      accessibility to the ureter and all areas of the kidney to be equivalent to current flexible
      ureteroscopes. However, clinical data comparing this single-use ureteroscope to a current
      state of the art reusable ureteroscope is lacking. Establishing at least equivalence in
      performance between the new single use ureteroscope and a reusable digital ureteroscope will
      help surgeons and operating room managers/administrators help determine how to most
      efficiently equip their operating rooms with endoscopic equipment.
