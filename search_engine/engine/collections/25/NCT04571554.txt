    
      The enrolled patient will be sedated according to the ICU protocol. A calibrated esophageal
      thermometer will be inserted by the attending intensivist through the nostril or oral cavity
      into the lower third of the esophagus to approximately 10-20 cm.

      IRT will be performed using FLIR C2 compact thermal camera. The focal length of the thermal
      camera will be adjusted at 0.5 meter from the patient head. scanning will conducted over a
      period of 10-seconds. The researcher will record the highest reading obtained from medial
      canthus. No cold fomentations will be applied to the head nor the axilla of the patient for
      30 minutes at least before measuring IRT.

      FLIR C2 thermal camera will be calibrated before use to eliminate the effect of the ambient
      room temperature.

      The researcher of will obtain the IRT temperature will be blinded to the esophageal probe
      reading.
