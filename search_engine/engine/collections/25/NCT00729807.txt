      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory melanoma that
           expresses wild-type p53 and S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B) treated with
           pentamidine.

      Secondary

        -  To observe the effect of this drug on the expression of S100B and p21 in tumor biopsy
           samples.

        -  To observe the effect of this drug on S100B detectable in serum.

        -  To observe the time to progression in these patients.

        -  To assess the toxicities associated with the administration of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pentamidine IV over 2 hours 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for correlative
      laboratory studies. Samples are assessed for p53 status and S100B, p53, and p21 expression by
      immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, luminescence assay, and
      ELISA.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
