    
      The main objective of this study is to collect and analyze additional information about the
      safety and effectiveness of the NIRxcell Stent System in the treatment of de novo stenotic
      lesions in native coronary arteries in the US population. The primary endpoint will be the
      rate of target vessel failure (TVF) at 3 years of treatment with the NIRxcell Stent System.
      This rate will be compared with a performance goal derived from a meta-analysis of coronary
      stenting with bare metal stents (BMS).
