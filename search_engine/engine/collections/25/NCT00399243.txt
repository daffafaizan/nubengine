    
      This is an open label trial of sumatriptan 4 mg using the StatDose injector system for the
      treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache.

      Patient entering the trial must either be in the first 3 weeks of an episodic cluster
      headache cycle or have chronic cluster headache. Patients with episodic cluster headache may

      regimen of preventive medications. Patients with chronic cluster headache must be on a stable
      regimen of preventive medications.

      Patients must be in good health with no contraindications to the use of sumatriptan such as
      either having or having increased risk factors for CAD or CVD. They may not take during the
      time of the study preventive medications that are 5HT1B/1D agonists. Episodic use of
      triptans, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is permitted provided they are not used within 24
      hours of use of the study medication.

      Patients will be required to treat 3 acute attacks of cluster headache with the study
      medication or to use more than 1 dose of study medication to fully treat an individual attack
      of cluster headache with a maximum of 3 doses of the study medication within a 24 hour time
      frame.

      Efficacy of the study medication will be determined from diary data collected. Safety data
      will be determined by adverse events reported by the patient.
