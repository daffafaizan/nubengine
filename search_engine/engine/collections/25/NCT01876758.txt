      years. They will be randomly assigned to one of three research conditions (a) participants in
      Mem-ECT condition will receive memory training before and after their ECT course, (b)
      participants in the active control condition will work on commercially available puzzle games
      at the same times prior and after ECT to determine if the developed memory training program
      is more effective than mere mental stimulation, (c) participants in the "treatment as usual"
      will not work on the memory training or the puzzle games but just undergo the study
      evaluations. Participants will be evaluated a few days before ECT, within 2 weeks following
      ECT, and once again 2 months later. The evaluation will consist of interviews, mental skill
      testing, and measuring brain waves using an electroencephalograph (EEG) before ECT and 2
      months after ECT (no EEG right after ECT). It is our hope that developing a safe and
      effective strategy to minimize the adverse memory side effects of ECT will make ECT a better
      and more easily tolerated treatment for patients with severe depression who need this
      therapeutic option.
