      criteria. Use the same anaesthesia and management and record information needed by the case
      report format. Patients are examined by fMRI on their brains during the first week after
      surgery. Follow up the patients after surgery for three months to find out whether they have
      chronic pain. The NRS, DN4, ID pain and QLQ-C30 are used for each patient.
