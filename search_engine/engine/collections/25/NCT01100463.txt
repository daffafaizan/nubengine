      Following absorption, capecitabine is converted enzymatically to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The
      administration of capecitabine or 5-FU can cause a cutaneous toxicity known as hand-foot
      syndrome (HFS) or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). HFS is progressive with dose and
      duration of exposure to 5-FU or capecitabine. HFS is characterized by progressive redness and
      cracking of hands and feet. Currently, there are no approved therapies for HFS.
