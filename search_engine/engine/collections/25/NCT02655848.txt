    
      Patients older than 50 years with a supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendon rupture sized
      smaller than 3cm, who are encountered with LHB pathology, will be randomized to either LHB
      tenotomy or LHB tenodesis. Clinical and self-reported data will be collected pre-operatively,
      and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery.

      Primary outcome is overall shoulder function evaluated with the Constant score. As additional
      measures of shoulder function, the Dutch Oxford Shoulder Test and the Disabilities of the Arm
      Shoulder and Hand questionnaire will be assessed. Other evaluations include cosmetic
      appearance evaluated by the ''Popeye'' deformity, arm cramping pain, elbow flexion strength,
      MRI evaluation, quality of life, and cost of surgery. To detect non-inferiority with a
      one-sided, two-sample t-test with a 80% power and a significance level (alpha) of 0.025, the
      required sample size is 98 patients.
