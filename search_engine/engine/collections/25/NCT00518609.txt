      meningitis. Together, these infections are termed "neonatal sepsis" and account for over half
      of the newborn deaths at the district and sub-district level in India. Sepsis is the most
      common (80-90 percent) primary diagnosis for admission in Indian hospitals. Phase 1 of this
      study is a prospective, epidemiologic study involving over 1,000 community-based and hospital
      populations of newborn infants. It includes identifying all infants born in study hospitals
      and those brought to the hospitals with suspected sepsis; obtaining blood cultures from these
      infants and identifying the sepsis-causing bacteria; screening of all bacterial strains
      isolated from blood cultures for antimicrobial resistance; collecting basic demographic, risk
      factor, and treatment data on each case; and developing a computer-based system/network for
      data management. A village-level surveillance system was put in place to identify women
      during their pregnancy; monitor pregnancy outcomes; and establish a mechanism for referral of
      all potentially septic infants to participating clinics or hospitals for evaluation,
      including the collection of blood cultures. Potential sources of bacteria causing sepsis will
      be identified using molecular epidemiologic techniques. This involves matching septic
      infants' blood isolates with other colonizing isolates obtained from screening skin, throat,
      and stool cultures in the infant and skin and vaginal cultures from their mothers.
