      of treatment (BWL + ER or BWL) and will follow participants at 12-months post-treatment
      (total time = 18 months). Investigators will recruit adolescents with overweight and obesity
      and their parents. Dyads will be assessed at 5 timepoints: baseline (2 visits), mid-treatment
      (1 visit), post-treatment (2 visits), 6-month follow-up (2 visits), and 12-month follow-up (2
      visits). Assessments will include the following for the adolescent and parent: anthropometry,
      emotion regulation, emotional inhibition, emotional eating, and adolescent-parent
      relationship measures. This program of research has the potential to advance the standard of
      practice for adolescents who are overweight or obese by providing alternative interventions.

      We are currently offering online treatment groups to accommodate the CDC health and safety
      guidelines.
