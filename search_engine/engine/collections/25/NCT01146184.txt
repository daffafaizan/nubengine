      minimally invasive surgery with reports of a variety of laparoscopic procedures performed
      through a single incision.

      However the technique is challenging due to the proximity of the instruments passed through
      the single umbilical skin incision. Several improvisions were made to accommodate this
      technical restriction by making flexible umbilical ports that accommodate several trocars, or
      usage of different length instruments to strategically place the surgeons, minimizing
      collision and improving ergonomics.

      The flexibility of the endoscope will allow improved freedom of movement within the abdominal
      cavity and ease of gallbladder dissection. The investigators believe that this technique will
      take advantage of the flexible nature of the endoscope while avoiding the risks of
      transluminal surgery inherent in natural orifice surgery. Flexible endoscope offers an
      excellent solution to SILS, with its flexible optics and ability to pass working instruments
      through it.

      The flexible endoscope to be used ia a 12mm dual channel Karl Storz or Olympus
      gastroscope.Ethicon instruments are essentially like traditional endoscopic instruments with
      an extra joint at the working end, mimicking a wrist joint. These instruments are FDA
      listed/cleared pursuant to 510(k) provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act with general
      indications for use in endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures. We will be using an
      articulating grasper, articulating biopsy forcepts, and an articulating needle knife.

      We will measure pain with pain scales.
