      study has three parts and each subject will participate in only one part. Tests that will be
      performed before and after treatment include measurements of body weight, blood pressure,
      blood vessel stiffness, heart stiffness, and blood lipids and glucose.

      Part 1: Dietary treatment The overall goal of part 1 is to remove fructose and simple sugars
      from the diets of women and men at risk for future heart disease. Dietary fructose will be
      replaced with starchy foods to keep the research subjects' body weights stable. Subjects will
      be treated for 4 months and measurements of vascular and heart stiffness will be made before,
      during, and after treatment.

      Part 2: Drug treatment The overall goal of part 2 is to treat women and men with mild
      elevations in blood uric acid for 8 months. The treatment will be allopurinol administration,
      ramping up the dose over a 2 month period to achieve a uric acid concentration of 6 mg/dL.
      Measurements of vascular and heart stiffness will be made before, during, and after.

      Part 3: Control, no treatment These individuals will undergo the same baseline and follow-up
      tests as the other two parts but have no treatments.

      Tests that will be completed before and after
