      documented.

      While long-term vascular changes have been noted in women with prior preeclampsia (PE), and
      in a dose- dependent manner, long-term changes to UA vascular resistance following PE have
      not been analyzed. Moreover, regardless of whether they experienced PE or intrauterine growth
      restriction (IUGR), it is not known if women with elevated UA pulsatility index (PI) in
      mid-pregnancy have higher UA well after pregnancy, compared to women whose UA PI was normal
      in mid-pregnancy.

      The investigators propose to evaluate if UA flow remains abnormally high postpartum in women
      who had elevated UA flow mid-pregnancy, compared to women whose UA flow was normal in
      mid-pregnancy.

      This is an observational prospective study. The study recruits women that have recently
      delivered and have undergone a Uterine Doppler ultra sound (US) during the second trimester
      of their pregnancy. Eligible women will undergo one post-partum ultrasound examination.
