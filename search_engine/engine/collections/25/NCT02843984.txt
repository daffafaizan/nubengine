      of Ferrara. The selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of vaginal
      Lactoferrin to obtain 3 groups: A, 20 untreated patients; B and C (20 patients each one)
      respectively treated 4 and 12 h before amniocentesis. Cytokines, chemokines and growth
      factors concentrations will be quantified by a magnetic bead Luminex multiplex immunoassays
      panel technology.

      Amniotic fluid samples will be obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and the sample not
      required for clinical purposes will be centrifuged to remove particulate material and the
      supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C until assay.
