      others intentions from gaze-direction or other social attention cues (Baron-Cohen, Baldwin, &
      Crowson, 1997).

      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a brain computer interface (BCI) using
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals can be used to train social cognition skills (in
      particular interpretation of gaze direction pointing to objects of interest) in ASD patients
      and whether this improves clinical symptoms.

      The intervention comprehends seven BCI sessions spread over four months. The first four
      sessions are planned to occur weekly, and the rest monthly. In each session, the subject is
      asked to identify objects of interest based on the gaze direction of an avatar. The subject
      response is interpreted from the EEG signal (using the P300 component, as established in our
      previous work).
