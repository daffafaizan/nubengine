      role in PE. Aspirin (ASA) has a dose-dependent effect blocking production of TxA2, a potent
      stimulator of platelet aggregation (PA) and promoter of vasoconstriction. Incomplete
      inhibition of PA, designated aspirin resistance (AR), can be reduced by increasing the ASA
      dose.
