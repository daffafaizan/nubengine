    
      This was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial
      investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of FE 202158
      (using three ascending doses) in patients with vasodilatory hypotension in early septic
      shock, when given as continuous infusion for up to 7 days.

      The trial comprised of three treatment arms where FE 202158 was administered in 1.25 ng, 2.5
      ng and 3.75 ng dose, respectively. A placebo arm was also included in the trial where
      patients received isotonic saline.

      Efficacy of FE 202158 was determined by evaluating its ability to maintain mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg and its modulating effect on inflammatory markers. Effects of FE
      202158 on other variables like vital signs, morbidity, mortality and pulmonary function were
      also determined.
