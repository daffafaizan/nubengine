      population-wide cancer prevention. Pediatric primary care office visits are the main site for
      HPV vaccination, yet many missed opportunities (MOs) for vaccination occur in primary care
      and contribute to low vaccination rates. MOs are office visits during which a patient is
      eligible for a vaccine, but does not receive it. Many factors cause MOs - provider factors
      (e.g., time-constrained visits, lack of communication skills, and giving vaccinations only at
      preventive visits) and parent factors (e.g., vaccine hesitancy). This cluster randomized
      clinical trial will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of training providers in
      HPV vaccine communication to reduce MOs and increase HPV vaccination rates. This training
      will be done through online educational modules (sent via text or email), weekly mini lessons
      and live office practice sessions.
