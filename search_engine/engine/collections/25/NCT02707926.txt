      ARV regimen on lymph node (LN) and (GALT) virus reservoirs.

      All participants will give informed consent. At baseline, plasma and PBMCs will be obtained
      and all subjects will have an incisional biopsy of an inguinal LN and pinch biopsy of ileum
      and rectum via colonoscopy. The selected LT-enhanced ARV regimen will be initiated.
      Participants will return to the clinic at weeks 2 and 4 and then monthly for safety
      evaluations, CD4 T cell counts, plasma HIV-RNA and ARV drug concentrations in plasma and
      PBMCs. An intensive PK study will be performed at week 2. At months 3 and 6, the inguinal LN
      biopsy and pinch biopsies of ileum and rectum will be repeated.
