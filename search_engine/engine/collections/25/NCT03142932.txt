      COach2Quit smartphone application by determining whether the use of this app reduces smoking
      more than brief anti-smoking advice alone. This will be a two-arm individually randomized
      trial and participants who are currently smoking will be assigned 1:1 to either study arm.
      Smoking behavior will be measured through self-report at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow
      up visits. Smoking behavior will also be verified by 2 biomarker measurements: carbon
      monoxide breath test and urine cotinine, collected at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow-up
      visits. In addition, participants will receive weekly follow-up calls. The primary outcome
      will be smoking cessation at the 1-month follow-up visit.
