      associated bad prognostic and enhanced metastases spreading.

      In-vitro/in-vivo preclinical studies showed that OTX008 inhibits galectin-1 expression. In
      different cancer models in animals, OTX008 reduced tumor growing and metastases spreading and
      it was observed a blood vessels architecture normalization.

      Thus, OTX008 appears to be an innovating approach to treat cancers and this clinical phase I
      study aims to evaluate OTX008 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
