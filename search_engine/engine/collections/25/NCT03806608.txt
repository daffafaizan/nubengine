      levels and soft tissue dimensions around implants placed with the IAI at different positions
      in relation to the alveolar crest. Subjects will be included with the absence of 2-4 teeth in
      the posterior region of the maxilla or mandibular. Twenty patients will be recruited. Two
      implant placement depths, equicrestal and subcrestal, were randomly assigned to two sites of
      each patient with a predefined randomization tables (one crestal implant and one subcrestal
      implant). Patients will be recalled for oral hygiene maintenance and prosthetic controls at
      1year, 3 years, 5 years after final restoration.
