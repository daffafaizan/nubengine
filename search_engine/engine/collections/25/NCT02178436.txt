    
      Primary Objectives:

        1. Phase I: To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of gemcitabine, nabpaclitaxel
           and selinexor for untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer [COMPLETED]

        2. Phase I: To determine the safety profile of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and selinexor
           [COMPLETED]

        3. Phase II: To test whether the combination of gemcitabine and selinexor improves the
           median overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed
           frontline non-gemcitabine containing regimens beyond 5.6 months (median overall survival
           of patient receiving gemcitabine only based on historical data.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine objective response rate to the combination of gemcitabine and selinexor
           using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

        2. To assess safety of selinexor in combination with gemcitabine in phase II portion of the
           study

        3. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with gemcitabine and
           selinexor

        4. To determine the influence of selinexor and gemcitabine on the nuclear expression and
           localization of tumor suppressor gene proteins.
