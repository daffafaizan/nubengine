      conception, but studies have yielded conflicting results.

      The explanation may be different timing of, and classification systems for, the scan,
      different treatment protocols, and different definitions of success. Also scan quality has
      improved over time.

      This is a prospective study looking at the endometrial pattern as a predictor of IVF/ICSI
      outcome, adjusting for embryo quality, ease of transfer, and fresh or frozen cycles. The
      study will focus on good quality single embryo transfer at the blastocyst stage. Other
      endometrial ultrasound parameters such as thickness, volume and Doppler will also be
      measured. Reliability studies will also be conducted to assess and account for inter- and
      intra-observer variation.

      200 women will be recruited. They will include approximately 100 undergoing fresh and 100
      undergoing frozen embryo transfer. There will be no change to routine clinical care. A single
      operator will analyse all ultrasound images to reduce inter-observer variation. When there is
      uncertainty about the pattern the chief investigator will be consulted to reach an agreement.
