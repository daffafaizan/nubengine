      deficits are a risk factor for developing substance use disorders as well as a consequence of
      substance abuse. Improved social functioning is also a key goal of effective substance abuse
      treatments. While treatment of disrupted social networks is a mainstay of psychosocial
      substance abuse treatments, there are currently no pharmacological interventions aimed at
      improving social functioning in individuals with substance use disorders. Oxytocin
      administration may shift preference from substance related cues to social cues and may
      decrease subjective craving for alcohol.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on social cognition in
           moderate to heavy social alcohol drinkers.

        2. To examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on alcohol craving.

        3. To examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on implicit preferences for
           drug-related and social stimuli in moderate to heavy social alcohol drinkers.
