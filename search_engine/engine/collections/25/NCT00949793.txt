      performed on living tissue in vivo. It is already in clinical use in the fields of
      gastroenterological endoscopy, laparoscopy, dermatology, gynecology and respiratory medicine.
      This study represents the first time that confocal endomicroscopy will be evaluated for
      intraoperative imaging in neurosurgery.

      The procedure involves a small endoscope which is placed gently into contact with the brain,
      providing significant in vivo magnification on a scale similar to that obtained by the
      pathology laboratory microscope. The captured confocal images will be compared with
      corresponding histology (tissue that is being removed as part of the indicated neurosurgical
      procedure). The images will be visually compared among each other and with histology images
      to detect possible clinically relevant information.
