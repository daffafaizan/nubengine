      purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia following stroke, to
      investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and duration of stroke, age, sex, etiology of
      stroke, ambulation status, spasticity, nutrition and malnutrition. Demographic
      characteristics, duration of stroke, sarcopenia presence (walking speed ≥ 0.8 m / s, SARC-F
      score ≥4, short physical performance battery score ≤ 8, thigh circumference <33cm (The data
      for Turkey) <31cm (European data)) were recorded. Hand grip strength (jamar) measured from
      the intact hand and TANITA BIA analysis were planned for all patients.

      Ambulation level with Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), nutritional status with
      24-hour dietary recall (24HR) method, diagnosis of malnutrition with Glim Criteria,
      spasticity with Modified Ashworth Scale, motor development for stroke patient Brunnstrom
      staging, screening for frailty with Frail questionnaire activity of daily living were
      evaluated with Barthel Index.
