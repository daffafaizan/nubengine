      Primary

        -  Identify detectable changes in the transcriptomic or proteomic expression prior to
           clinical manifestations of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in blood samples from
           at-risk patients who have undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize changes in the transcriptome or proteome expression pattern which are
           predictive of clinically significant GVHD in these patients.

        -  Develop reliable tests which enable early intervention for these patients.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected prior to and just after typical onset of clinical
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) on days 1, 7-10, 20-23, 30-33, and 60 after allogeneic bone
      marrow transplantation. RNA is quantified and assessed by microarray analysis to identify
      changes to transcriptome or proteome expression and markers predictive of the onset of
      clinical GVHD. Samples are also stored for future analysis.
