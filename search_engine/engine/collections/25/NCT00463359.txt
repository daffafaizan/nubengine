    
      Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCC) are the commonest form of skin cancer in the white population.
      The face is where they most frequently occur and the nodular BCCs are the commonest type.
      Curettage and cautery/electrodessication (C&C) has been an established way of management of
      nodular BCCs for years, being a simple surgical procedure readily performed in outpatient
      clinics with good aesthetic results and high cure rates. The purpose of this study is to
      determine recurrence rates of nodular BCCs on the face removed with C&C followed by
      application of Imiquimod cream to the base and further to achieve lower recurrence rates than
      after treatment with C&C alone. Imiquimod is an immune response modifier with anti-tumour
      effects already licensed for the treatment of superficial BCCs in the UK.
