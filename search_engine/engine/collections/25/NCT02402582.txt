      to the CCU of an academic teaching hospital from June 2012 to January 2015. The study was
      approved by the institutional investigative review board at Tarbiat Modares University and
      Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences. Patients were block randomized to receive either
      standard home cardiac rehabilitation (CR) or CR using the Family-centered Empowerment Model
      (FCEM) strategy. Patients had not previously gone through CR programs. The difference between
      the two groups was not disclosed at any point. Patients consented knowing that they would
      receive cardiac rehabilitation, but without knowing the details. Patients and their
      designated family/friend were enrolled as a 'unit'.Patient empowerment was measured with FCEM
      questionnaires pre-intervention and post-intervention for a total of 9 assessments.
      Quality-of-life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety were assessed using the
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the 14-item Perceived Stress, and the 20-item State
      and 20-item Trait Anxiety questionnaires, respectively.
