      social cognition, although it remains unclear whether vasopressin could modulate attention
      allocation including stimulus-driven bottom-up control and goal-directed top-down control. In
      the current randomized, between-subject, placebo controlled study, 89 healthy male subjects
      will be recruited and receive either vasopressin (20 IU) or placebo control administered
      intranasally. 45 minutes after treatment subjects will be required to complete a
      social-emotional saccade /antisaccade eye-tracking paradigm. The paradigm uses social (happy,
      sad, angry, fear, and neutral faces) as well as non-social (oval shapes) stimuli to explore
      social- and emotion-specific effects of vasopressin.
