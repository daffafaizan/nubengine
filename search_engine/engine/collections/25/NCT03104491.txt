    
      Primary Objective Phase I: To define a post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation maximum
      tolerated dose of inotuzumab Ozogamicin Phase II: To define the safety profile of inotuzumab
      Ozogamicin therapy after allogeneic transplant.

      Phase II: To determine the rate of veno-occlusive disease / sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
      (VOD/SOS).

      Secondary Objective(s)

        1. To evaluate non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, relapse-related mortality and overall
           survival (OS) at 1 year.

        2. To determine the incidence of myeloid toxicity and secondary graft failure.

        3. To determine if inotuzumab at these doses are effective at eradicating minimal residual
           disease (MRD) in this cohort of patients.

      Study Design This is a Phase I/II study of inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of
      patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation for ALL and have a high risk of relapse.
      The Phase I portion of this study will be a 3/3 dose escalation trial with cohort expansion
      at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects will receive study treatment until relapse of
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, 30 days after cycle 4, or death, whichever occurs first.

      Phase I: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Dosing Escalation Subjects will be assessed for safety and
      tolerability (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory
      assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.

      Phase II: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability
      (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using
      a continuous monitoring approach. In order to be included in the safety profile endpoint
      review, subjects must have received at least of 1 cycle of treatment.
