      microalbuminuria , overt proteinuria and a decline in glomerular filteration rate leading to
      end stage renal disease.

      Despite all the available interventions available for diabetic patients including tight
      glycemic control , and blood pressure control , using angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonist renal disease remains prevalent and progress
      in these patients.

      The newer therapy of diabetes is the use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor as it
      has the potential of renoprotection in patients with diabetic nephropathy just as ACEI and
      ARBS to reduce glomerular hyperfilteration .This action may reduce albuminuria.
