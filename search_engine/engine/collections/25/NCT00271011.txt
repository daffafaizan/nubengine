      with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer with wild type non mutated K-Ras. The
      goals of this investigation are to develop an effective systemic therapy for previously
      treated patients with CRC with wild type K-Ras, to further explore the relationship of
      mitomycin C induced topoisomerase 1 gene expression and response to irinotecan, and to define
      and characterize the biology of cetuximab induced skin rash.
