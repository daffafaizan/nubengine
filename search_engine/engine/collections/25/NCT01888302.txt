      I. Assessment of the percentage of patients who are able to complete therapy through 4 and 6
      months post-registration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse events, rate of dose reductions, and quality of life in these
      patients.

      II. To summarize timed endpoints of time-to-recurrence, disease-free survival, overall
      survival, time to treatment failure, and time until treatment related grade 3+ adverse
      events.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and sirolimus orally (PO) daily or three times weekly.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
