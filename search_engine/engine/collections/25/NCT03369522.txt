      from the Epilepsy Monitoring Units. Each selected record will be analyzed by EMU medical team
      in order to detect seizure on the EEG. The algorithm will adapt in order to obtain the best
      sensitivity and specificity regarding seizure detection.

      in a second step,algorithm will validate on a cohort of other recordings in patients with
      epilepsy
