    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of ficlatuzumab, with or without concurrent cetuximab, in patients
      with cetuximab-resistant, recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
      as measured by progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe toxicity and patient-reported quality of life. II. To evaluate response rate
      and overall survival in both treatment arms. III. To evaluate the relationship between
      clinical outcomes (PFS, response rate [RR]) and candidate tumoral, genomic, peripheral, and
      immune biomarkers, including: HGF/cMet, EGFR/EGFR, and EGFR/HER2 dimers; mutations in PIK3CA,
      PTEN, and HRAS; peripheral serum biomarkers including VeriStrat, HGF, soluble HGF, and IL6;
      peripheral lymphocyte populations; archived and baseline immune infiltrate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ficlatuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60 -120 minutes and ficlatuzumab IV over 30-60
      minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
