      especially in Indonesia. Rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol are the cornerstone of the
      current treatment. The disadvantage of the current treatment is the long, six-months,
      duration of the treatment. This long duration contributes to suboptimal adherence to the TB
      drugs.Thus, there is a very urgent need to evaluate drugs that may help shortening TB
      treatment. The fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has shown early bactericidal activity (EBA) in
      patients with pulmonary TB, and has shown rapid and reliable sterilization. Rifampicin is a
      strong inducer of the CYP enzymes, but it also induces phase II metabolism. As moxifloxacin
      is metabolized by phase II metabolism, rifampicin could cause a decrease in the plasma
      concentrations of moxifloxacin. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction study is warranted.
