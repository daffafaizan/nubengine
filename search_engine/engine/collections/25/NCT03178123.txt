      therapy to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 mAb for injection
      compared to high-Dose interferon in patients with mucosal melanoma that has been removed by
      surgery.There will be 220 subjects enrolling the study, and randomized 1:1 grouped into
      recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 mAb for injection group (experimental group) or interferon
      group (control group).Each group will have 110 subjects.Random stratification factor is the
      disease stage (I vs II vs III).The whole research lasts about 60 months.
