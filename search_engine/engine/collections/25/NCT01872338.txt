      suicide. While the VA has implemented a comprehensive, multifaceted suicide prevention
      approach, it has yet to implement nationally any evidence-based psychotherapies targeting
      suicide, a gap due largely to the dearth of evidence-based therapies for suicide. Primary
      aims of this proposal are to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing an adaptation of a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), for Veterans
      on the VA's High Risk for Suicide List. The investigators' adapted version of MBCT for
      suicide (MBCT-S) integrates mindfulness meditation techniques with the VA Safety Plan to
      enhance patients' awareness of suicide triggers and appropriate coping strategies. This study
      has the potential to increase the range of cost effective treatment alternatives for the
      large number of suicidal Veterans for whom evidence-based therapies are severely limited.
