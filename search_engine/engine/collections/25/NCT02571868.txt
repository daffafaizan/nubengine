      Time Integral (aVTI) values calculated by the two methods at the PV, AV, and VV interval
      settings recommended by both the QuickOptTM and the standard ECHO optimization in CRT-D
      patients, at three index times: pre-discharge, at 6-month and at 12-month follow-ups.

      Secondary end-point was to define the correlation between the optimal AV, PV and VV intervals
      defined by ECHO, using aVTI measurements and by the QuickOptTM algorithm, IEGM-based.
