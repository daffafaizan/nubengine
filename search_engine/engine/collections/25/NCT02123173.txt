      traditional intubated VATS. However, the differences of hemodynamic changes and fluid
      responsiveness during one lung ventilation(OLV) between these two groups were rarely
      reported. For complete lung collapse, spontaneous negative pressure respiration must be well
      maintained on non-intubated VATS. In comparison, positive pressure ventilation on dependent
      lung was applied during OLV in intubated VATS. This study planned to compared the changes of
      hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output) during OLV between
      groups. As functional hemodynamic monitoring (FloTrac system) was mostly utilized with
      positive pressure ventilation, the applicability of FloTrac in non- intubated VATS was also
      testified. In this study, we also measure the fluid responsiveness by FloTrac system with
      rapid infusion (within 10 minutes) of 10 mL/kg crystalloid fluid. We planned to compare the
      changes on cardiac output and the fluid responsiveness during OLV between these two groups.
