      how these measures work with people with cancer. This study will help us answer this
      question. To complete this study, we need people who may or may not be feeling down or
      depressed.

      If you choose to take part, you will be asked to do the following:

        1. Fill out questionnaires that ask about:

             -  Your age, eduction, race, and income

             -  Your mood

           In all, these questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.

        2. Answer questions about your mood. This will also take about 10 minutes to complete.
