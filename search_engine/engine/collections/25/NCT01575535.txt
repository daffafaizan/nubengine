        -  Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+
           precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors.

        -  Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e.,
           origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient
           characteristics.

        -  Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival
           (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that
           originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+
           precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome
      inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by
      fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in
      cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each
      patient clinical data.
