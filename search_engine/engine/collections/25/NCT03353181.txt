      spite of the rapid development of new endoscopic devices.The application of stent (plastic or
      metallic) has allowed us to achieve successful drainage. However,there are many complications
      related to the placement of stents,such as cholangitis,high rate of re-intervention,and so
      on. The application of endoscopic cutting technique is considered to reduce these
      complication.
