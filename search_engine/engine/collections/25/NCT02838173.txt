      incidence of chronic pain varies from 27 to 50% depending on definitions.

      The infiltration of tissues by a local anesthetic is a simple, fast and low risk technique
      but of limited effectiveness.

      Serratus the flat block, performed under ultrasound guidance, is minimally invasive and easy
      to perform. It allows anesthesia and analgesia to an extended part of the anterolateral chest
      wall and the axilla. This regional anesthesia technique provides good analgesia during and
      after breast surgery, but remains to be evaluated; beyond perioperative analgesia, the
      benefit-risk, post operative rehabilitation, and the impact on ambulatory and on chronic pain
      are fundamental objectives.
