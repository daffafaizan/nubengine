      intervention will last for 24 weeks. The laboratory staff who test the HbA1c level, the
      outcome assessor who collects the blood glucose data, and the statisticians will be blinded
      to the treatment allocation.

      Sample size estimation: We propose to enroll 138 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) by
      considering withdrawals, 69 in the smartphone app groups and 69 in the routine care group.
      Sample size estimation is based on hypothesized changes in the primary outcome HbA1c.

      In order to ensure high quality data, two staff are responsible for the input of original
      data into the database to check and confirm the accuracy. When the data entered by two staff
      independently, the auxiliary staff decides which data to use.

      Data analysis will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle by including all the
      randomized patients in the data analysis. Missing data will be filled in with multiple
      imputation method. Any substantial difference in baseline characteristics will be adjusted
      with mixed-model regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted by using
      per-protocol data by excluding those patients who drop out of the RCT.
