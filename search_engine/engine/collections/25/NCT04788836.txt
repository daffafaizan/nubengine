      adults undergoing bariatric surgery.

      The main objective is to observe the effect of bariatric surgery on food purchase behaviour
      using digital receipts from grocery shopping. The investigators hypothesize that bariatric
      surgery leads to changes in food purchase behaviour in obese adults.

      The further objective is to compare food purchase behaviour between obese adults against
      values of an existing reference population, and to assess whether these differences tend to
      be reduced post-surgery among operated participants.
