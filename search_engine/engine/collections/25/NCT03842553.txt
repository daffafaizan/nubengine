      (PTSS) due to exposure to trauma and work-related stressors. Salient predictors for the
      development of PTSS among rescue workers have been identified; however, little is known about
      how predictors (e.g. coping strategies) differ among professions requiring repeated
      engagement in emergencies. The present survey examines how these variables influence PTSS,
      well-being, and suicidal ideation across different professions of rescue Workers using
      multiple regression and structural equation modeling.
