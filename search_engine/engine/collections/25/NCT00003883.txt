      incidence of breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients undergoing allogeneic peripheral
      blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. II. Compare the incidence of combined
      mold/yeast infections and the use of alternative systemic antifungal treatments in these
      patients on this regimen. III. Compare the toxic effects of these two drugs in these
      patients. IV. Determine the survival rate of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive fluconazole orally or IV daily beginning at start of conditioning
      regimen and continuing until day 180 or until 4 weeks after stopping corticosteroids (if it
      occurs between days 120-180). Arm II: Patients receive oral fluconazole daily beginning at
      start of conditioning regimen and continuing until day 0. Patients then receive itraconazole
      orally or IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 180, or until 4 weeks after
      stopping corticosteroids (if it occurs between days 120-180).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 578 patients (289 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 4 years.
