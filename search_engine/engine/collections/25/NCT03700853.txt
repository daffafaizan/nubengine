      that trained nurses can use to carry out swallowing assessments with patients following a
      stroke. It consists of checks to ensure the patient is alert/well enough, checks any
      abnormalities in the muscles of the mouth or throat and trials different types of
      foods/drinks. If they 'pass' the assessment patients are started with regular diet and
      fluids. If they have dysphagia the nurses can recommend modified foods/drinks if they have
      found to be safe during the assessment. If the patients 'fail' with all trials - they remain
      nil by mouth. Around 50% of patients who have a stroke have difficulties swallowing
      (dysphagia). If dysphagia is identified early it reduces secondary complications such as
      pneumonia. There are no similar tools in the UK that have been tested to check they are doing
      what they say they are doing (validity) or the results are the same no matter which trained
      nurse uses the tool (reliability). This study aims to test the validity and reliability of
      the Dysphagia Trained Nurse Assessment DTNAx that is currently used in the acute stroke
      pathway at RDH.

      Over an 18 month period we aim to recruit 50 patients admitted to RDH with a new stroke and
      who have had an initial DTNAx. The results of the DTNAx will be compared to the gold standard
      dysphagia assessment - videofluoroscopy - a video xray of swallowing and also compared to the
      usual SLT assessment. We can calculate whether the tool identifies dysphagia and whether the
      recommendations made by using the tool are accurate and safe. To test reliability - the DTNAx
      will be repeated by the same nurse or by a different nurse. The patients will be involved in
      the study for approximately 24 hours.
