      matched healthy participants recruited from the greater Boston community by Dr. Webb at
      McLean Hospital's Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research. The anhedonic
      adolescents will undergo 12 weeks of Behavioral Activation therapy. This study will include
      three sessions:

        -  The first session will involve a diagnostic interview, and a series of questionnaires
           and assessments.

        -  The second session will take place at the McLean Hospital's Neuroimaging Center, and
           involve an fMRI brain scan and administration of two behavioral tasks, as well as
           questionnaires.

        -  Following the 12-weeks treatment, anhedonic adolescents will return to McLean Hospital's
           Neuroimaging Center for an fMRI brain scan, two behavioral tasks, and questionnaires.
           The healthy control group will complete the same three assessments at corresponding time
           points.
