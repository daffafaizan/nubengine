      reduce sedentary behavior, increase independence and encourage social inclusion. This novel
      system will have two distinct yet complementary features: monitoring and treatment that will
      serve as an "all in one system". The system will consist of wearable sensors and a
      proprietary developed application. The wearable inertial sensors will measure the
      acceleration and orientation of the feet during movement. The sensors will feed real-time
      data to the system, which will process this data using a set of proprietary algorithms
      enabling continuous monitoring of activity, gait and fall risk, and independence. In
      addition, designated applications for direct cognitive assessment and training of older
      adults in their home and community environment will also be used via the Smart phone or
      mobile tablet. The training, both physical and cognitive, will also include multi-user
      interactions .Data collected by the system will be processed and integrated to provide
      comprehensive feedback from multiple domains to the user, caregiver and clinician by way of
      recommendations and personalized treatment goals.
