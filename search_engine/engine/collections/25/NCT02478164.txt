      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ponatinib for your specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Ponatinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by affecting different kinds of
      proteins in cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells can be driven by mutated forms of a protein
      called c-kit (KIT) which are present in glioblastoma cells. Laboratory studies suggest that
      ponatinib has activity against mutated forms of (KIT) which is important in glioblastoma and
      therefore suggests that ponatinib may help to control the growth of glioblastoma. In this
      research study the study team is looking to see if ponatinib is safe and is able to control
      the growth of glioblastoma in people who have not responded to treatment with bevacizumab.
