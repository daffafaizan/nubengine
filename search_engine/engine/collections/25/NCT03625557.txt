    
      This is an observational study of clinical outcomes to be conducted in the United States.
      Patients with a diagnosis of Stage 3-4 advanced cancer who possess specific pathway mutations
      identified by the Guardant360Â® test will be eligible to enroll in the study. Patients will be
      recruited by telephone or email and/or through the Guardant Health Patient Portal to
      determine interest in the study. Should patients be interested in contributing to this
      registry study, they will be prompted to consent via a commercial service for patients to
      request, manage, and view their medical records. Enrolled participants will be requested to
      release copies of their medical records for review by the principal investigator. Study
      adminsitrators will abstract participant demographics, cancer-related therapies, and clinical
      outcomes for analysis.
