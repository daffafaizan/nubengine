        -  Compare the failure-free survival of patients with locally extensive or advanced
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
           (ABVD) vs doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, mechlorethamine, etoposide,
           and prednisone (Stanford V) with or without radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the overall survival and freedom from progression in these patients at 5 and 10
           years after treatment with these regimens.

        -  Compare pulmonary function, incidence of second cancers, reproductive function, and
           deaths from causes other than Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to number of adverse
      risk factors (0-2 vs 3-7), disease characteristics (locally extensive vs advanced) and time
      of entry (before addendum 6 vs. after addendum 6). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm A (ABVD): Patients receive doxorubicin (25 mg/m²), bleomycin (10 u/m²), vinblastine
           (6 mg/m²), and dacarbazine (375 mg/m²) IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28
           days. Patients are restaged after 4 courses. Patients who are in complete remission
           receive 2 additional courses. Patients with a partial response or less are evaluated
           after 6 courses, and if there is an ongoing response, patients may receive 2 additional
           courses for a total of 8. If no ongoing response is observed, patients are removed from
           the study. All patients with massive mediastinal disease, regardless of stage, receive
           radiotherapy 2-3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

        -  Arm B (Stanford V): Patients receive Stanford V chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin (25
           mg/m²) and vinblastine (6 mg/m²) IV on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; vincristine
           (1.4 mg/m²) and bleomycin (5 u/m²) IV on day 1 of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12;
           mechlorethamine (6 mg/m²) IV on day 1 of weeks 1, 5, and 9 (if mechlorethamine is
           unavailable, may substitute with cyclophosphamide [375 mg/m²] IV); etoposide (60 mg/m²)
           IV on days 1 and 2 of weeks 3, 7, and 11; and oral prednisone (40 mg/m²) every other day
           of weeks 1-9 followed by a taper. All patients with bulky disease receive radiotherapy
           2-3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 850 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.3 years.
