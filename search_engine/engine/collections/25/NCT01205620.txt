      the administration of large amounts of intravenous volume, reduce vasopressor medications,
      and thus improve cardiac function and reduce the need for postoperative diuresis.

      The CirQlator TM Intrathoracic Pressure Regulator (ITPR) is an FDA-approved device intended
      to increase circulation and blood pressure in hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock. The device
      is inserted within a standard respiratory circuit between the patient and the ventilator. It
      functions by decreasing intrathoracic pressure during the expiratory phase to subatmospheric
      levels after each positive pressure ventilation. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure
      creates a vacuum within the thorax relative to the rest of the body thereby enhancing blood
      return to the heart and consequently increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Activation
      of the device is also accompanied by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The
      end result is a device that simultaneously improves cardiac output by increasing preload and
      decreasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) while increasing coronary perfusion pressure by
      increasing blood pressure and decreasing left ventricular end systolic pressure and volume
      (LVESP/LVESV).7-14
