    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with women that will be
      recruited from our outpatient obstetrics and gynecology clinic. Women desiring intrauterine
      device insertion will be invited to participate.

      The investigators plan to recruit women desiring intrauterine device insertion into one of
      four groups: A: placebo/normal saline infusion; B: placebo/lidocaine infusion; C: Saline
      infusion/ naproxen; D: lidocaine infusion/ naproxen.
