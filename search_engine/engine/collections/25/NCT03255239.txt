      hernia repairs have low recurrence and low complication rates then suture repair. But for
      hernias less than 3 cm some surgeons defend the treatment by suture. The main variable of
      interest is the location of mesh placement compared to suture repair. The investigator will
      compare in a prospective randomized clinical trial three techniques of abdominal wall hernia
      repair: preperitoneal polyester mesh, retromuscular polyester mesh and suture for hernias
      less than 3 cm. All patients underwent general anesthesia. The investigators used
      Polyester-based mesh because it has shown minimal shrinkage and excellent tissue ingrowth in
      animal models. Operative notes were physician-abstracted and the presence, type, and location
      of mesh prosthesis was recorded. Independent variables of interest were patient-level
      demographics (age and sex), facility where hernia repair occurred, year of hernia repair,
      preoperative comorbid conditions, history of prior repair, and intraoperative variables. The
      results compared postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (range, 0-10)
      on the day of the first outpatient visit, operating time evaluated as skin-to-skin time,
      drain management and both of early and late complications including seroma and hematoma
      formation, wound infection, fistula formation and recurrence rates.
