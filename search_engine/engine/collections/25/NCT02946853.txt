      significant reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume when randomized to
      atrioventricular junction (AVJ) ablation. In this study, subjects will be randomized to
      receive CRT-D or CRT-D with AVJ ablation. Randomization will be stratified by enrolling
      center (1:1 ratio).
