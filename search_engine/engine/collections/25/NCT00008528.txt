      by the physician and patient based on the patient's prior treatment history, prior and
      current laboratory abnormalities, the screening GT/PT antiretroviral resistance testing, and
      any prior GT/PT antiretroviral resistance (if available). The drugs in the OB regimen are
      chosen from among the currently approved antiretrovirals and permitted newly
      approved/investigational antiretrovirals available in the countries where the study is
      implemented, and must consist of 3 to 5 drugs, including no more than 1 newly
      approved/investigational agent. Patients are stratified with respect to viral load and use
      (versus non-use) of any of the allowed newly approved/investigational antiretrovirals.
      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments for 48 weeks: OB or OB
      plus T-20. Patients are followed to assess viral load, safety, antiretroviral resistance,
      T-20 pharmacokinetics, and quality of life. At the end of 48 weeks of treatment patients are
      allowed to (a) roll over and receive OB plus T-20 (for patients receiving OB regimen alone)
      or (b) continue taking OB plus T-20 (for patients already receiving OB plus T-20), for an
      additional 48 weeks (plus 4 weeks safety follow-up period), or until 12 weeks after
      commercial availability of T-20 in the country in which they are treated, whichever comes
      first. All patients are followed in this study for a maximum of 100 weeks from their initial
      baseline visit date.
