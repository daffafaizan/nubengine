      Primary

        -  Evaluate the activity of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea, as measured by 6-month
           progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS),

        -  Objective response rate among patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily and oral hydroxyurea twice daily
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
