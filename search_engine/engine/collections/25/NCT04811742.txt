      and physiological parameters of newborns in neonatal intensive care units.

      This is a randomized controlled experimental study. The sample consisted of a total of 69
      newborns who were born at the 37th gestational week and above, were referred to the neonatal
      intensive care unit of a training and research hospital, and met the study inclusion
      criteria. Study groups were determined through randomization by throwing a dice (immersion
      bathing group:35, showering group:34). Environmental variables were kept the same for both
      groups. Physiological parameters (respiration, high heart rate, oxygen saturation, body
      temperature) and comfort levels of newborns in both groups were compared before, just after
      and 15 minutes after the bath. Their comfort levels were measured using the Newborn Comfort
      Behavior Scale (NCBS).
