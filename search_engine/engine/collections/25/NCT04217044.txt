      methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations is challenging. With the development of artificial
      intelligence, much more potential lies in the histopathology images of HE slices in primary
      gliomas could be excavated to aid prediction of molecular pathology of gliomas. The creation
      of a registry for primary glioma with detailed molecular pathology, histopathology image data
      and with sufficient sample size for deep learning (>1000) provide considerable opportunities
      for personalized prediction of molecular pathology with non-invasiveness and precision.
