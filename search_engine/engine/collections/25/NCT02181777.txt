      cognition problems in people with psychosis. The intervention is a group psychological
      treatment facilitated by a clinical psychologist. The group therapy takes advantage of
      audiovisual material and practical exercises to illustrate strategies and thinking styles
      that may help participants overcome difficulties in social settings.

      A second objective of this study is to test a new method to measure social cognition by using
      portable devices. These devices will be carried by participants in their everyday life and
      will ask about their social activity levels at random times and record activity levels.
