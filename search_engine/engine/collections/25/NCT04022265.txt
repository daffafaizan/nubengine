      the distal segments of the maxilla in recipient sites prepared with either a sonic device or
      conventional drills. Biopsies containing the mini-implants will be retrieved after 2 weeks in
      eight patients, and after 6 weeks in the other eight patients. Histomorphometric analyses
      will be performed
