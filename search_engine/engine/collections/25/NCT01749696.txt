      or apex. The tissue samples were collected from the vaginal wall of the patients with pelvic
      organ prolapse (n=39) during vaginal prolapse surgery. Control samples (n=39) were taken from
      patients after vaginal or laparoscopic removal of the uterus.

      The formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples were stained with Verhoeff van Gieson
      and Movat's pentachrome. Samples were examined by pathologist and gynecologist blinded as to
      the other investigator and to the pelvic organ prolapse status. In case of discrepancy
      investigators evaluated the samples together to gain consensus.
