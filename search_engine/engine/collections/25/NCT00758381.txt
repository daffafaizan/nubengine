      commonly used in patients with pancreatic cancer with the purpose of symptom palliation,
      there is no clear evidence of efficacy in terms of survival increase or progression control.
      Furthermore, attempts at improving results by combining gemcitabine with other cytotoxic
      drugs failed to obtain any advantage. Recently, an EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib) showed a small
      survival advantage when combined with gemcitabine. results obtained with a combination of
      gemcitabine and oxaliplatin seem more promising. A meta-analysis of randomised trials
      comparing gemcitabine versus gemcitabine and platinum analogues showed a statistical
      significant survival advantage for the combination.

      Sorafenib is an inhibitor of the RAS/RAF signalling pathway. Furthermore, sorafenib is able
      to inhibit both VEGFR and PDGFR.

      Since RAS and RAF mutations are quite common in pancreatic cancer, Sorafenib could be useful
      in the management of these tumours. Furthermore, it may be combined with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin without any pharmacokinetic interaction or enhanced toxicity.
