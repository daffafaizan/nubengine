      fractures will be examined. Histological methods and ultra-thin sections for electron
      microscopy will be used to identify structural tissue changes in the granulation tissue in
      different period of time after bone fracture. Immunohistochemical analysis will be performed
      to estimate the dynamic of proliferation, differentiation and cell migration during
      granulation and reticulofibrosis bone tissues development.
