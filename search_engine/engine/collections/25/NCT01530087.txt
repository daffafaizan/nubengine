      stoma barrier with a new formulation. Approximately 34 subjects who are currently using a
      2-piece tape bordered product and able and willing to wear a product will be enrolled. Each
      participant is provided with one box containing 20 of the test barriers to be used
      consecutively according to their normal routine. Each participant is also provided with a box
      containing 30 pouches selected to most closely resemble their current product. Participants
      are asked to record the time of application and time of removal of each test barrier and
      their assessment of relevant characteristics for each test barrier. A clinical evaluation of
      the peristomal skin is conducted at study entry, at approximately mid way through the study
      and again at its conclusion. Photographs are taken of the peristomal skin at each visit using
      a digital camera. Individual participation in terms of wearing the barrier is for 30 days or
      until the test barrier has been used up, whichever comes first. The study is comprised of 3
      visits, an enrolment visit, a mid-study visit and a completion visit and a phone call at
      approximately day 7.
