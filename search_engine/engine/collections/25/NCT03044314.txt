      pulmonary arterial hypertension. Iloprost aerosol has been shown to significantly improve
      pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (PH), with an
      effect greater than nitric oxide and sildenafil. It has also been shown to be more effective
      than nitric oxide at reducing pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) than prostacyclin infusion
      when used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Because of its administration through
      inhalational means, iloprost has the advantage of selective action on the pulmonary
      vasculature with avoidance of the systemic side effects that plague many of the other
      treatments for PH. The investigators intend to compare the efficacy of inhaled iloprost in
      reducing pulmonary artery pressure to the gold standard of nitric oxide in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension.

      Without an established noninvasive algorithm to identify beneficial hemodynamic response to
      vasodilators, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are routinely subjected to expensive
      and invasive testing. Echocardiography is routinely used to facilitate a diagnosis of PH and
      a few echocardiographically-derived estimates have even been shown to correlate with
      vasodilator responsiveness and survival. Dynamic, real time changes in echocardiographic
      parameters have not been previously evaluated as a predictor of vasodilator responsiveness or
      of clinical outcome. The investigators will examine whether echocardiographic changes in
      response to inhaled iloprost can predict invasively derived vasodilator responsiveness and
      help assess prognosis in patients with pulmonary hypertension, possibly even obviating the
      need for invasive testing.
