      clothing. After exiting the changing room in the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center of
      Northwestern Medicine/Prentice Women's Hospital and as they are preparing to leave, a
      research assistant (RA) will screen potential participants to acquire a randomly selected
      convenience sample of eligible participants (n=200). The first 100 eligible subjects will be
      asked if they regularly check their moles for concerning features. If the response is yes,
      then they will be asked if they have found concerning moles and what they did next. Verbal
      assent will be obtained.

      Then the SSE materials will be placed into the changing rooms and the next 100 eligible
      subjects will be surveyed. The women, who found the information relevant, will be asked if
      they chose to check their skin while in the changing room. The skin location checked and use
      of the SSE kit will be ascertained. Women will be asked if they think they have a concerning
      mole. If the woman does not find a concerning mole, she will be asked if she intends to check
      her skin again. In addition, she will be asked if she intends to check the skin of family
      members. Women will be invited to take a brochure to help implement SSE.

      The screening questions are as follows:

        1. During your visit for mammography, did you notice any information about checking your
           skin for melanoma?

           ___Yes __ No

      The RA will record the responses. Women who checked their skin ,either today or in about 2
      weeks, will be invited to participate in a survey about skin location(s) checked, use of the
      SSE kit, and their decision about the spot on the skin.
