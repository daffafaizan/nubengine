      results from ruptured aneurysms. This severe disease often results in death or severe
      physical or cognitive disabilities and reduced quality of life. One frequent complication
      after SAH is cerebral vasospasm, a spasm of the big arteries accompanied by infarction of
      healthy brain tissue. The pathophysiologic processes which drive vasospasm remain unclear.
      This study aims to examine the role of endocannabinoids and cortisol in cerebrospinal fluid
      during the development of cerebral vasospasm. Additionally, this study examines whether side
      difference in the processed electroencephalogram (bilateral bispectral index) may be useful
      for early detection of cerebral vasospasm.
