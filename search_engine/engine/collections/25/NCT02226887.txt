      reinforced with insertion of a rectangular segment (1 cm wide and the length corresponding to
      the incision) of a prosthetic commercially available GORE® BIO-A® Tissue Reinforcement
      prosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) mesh. The BIO-A® prosthesis is
      inserted using a "sandwich" method between the edges of the incision and maintained in situ
      with a continuous polydioxanone (PDS) suture following a suture length to wound length
      (SL:WL) ratio of 4:1.
