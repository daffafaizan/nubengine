    
      -  Patients included in this study were assisted reproductive technique (ART) patients with
           moderate and severe OHSS who were hospitalized for management

        -  Control patients are selected from patients without signs of OHSS

        -  All patients are administered luteal long protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation.
           Pituitary down-regulation with SC injection of GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) (1 mg/day; Lucrin,
           Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) that was started on day 21 of the previous
           menstrual cycle. Subcutaneous administration of recombinant hFSH (Gonal-F, Laboratories
           Serono S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) at dosages from 150-225 IU/day is initiated on the
           second or third day of menstruation.

        -  When there are at least two or three follicles >17 mm in diameter, recombinant human
           chorionic gonadotropin (0.25 Âµgr ; Ovitrelle IM, Serono, Istanbul, Turkey) is applied
           subcutaneously 34-36 hours before oocyte retrieval.

        -  Serum samples are collected on day of HCG for study and control group patients.

        -  Serum levels of ischemia modified albumin (IMA), malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidative
           capacity (TOS), total antioxidative capacity (TAS) and oxidative stress capacity (OSI)
           levels.

        -  This is a case control study

        -  Statistical analyses will be performed using student t-test and fisher chi-square test.
           The correlations between the serums IMA, TAC, TOC, OSI, and MDA levels will be examined
           in all study groups using Spearman correlation analysis.
