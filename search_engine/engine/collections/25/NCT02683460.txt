      at minimum 2 year postoperatively. Secondarily, we compared pain, patient preference at
      minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that there would be no
      difference between the two groups of subjects in the measured outcomes.

      Patients receiving TKA were prospectively enrolled before surgery and randomized
      intraoperatively to either receive patella replacement or not in both knee of same patients.
      Subjects were assessed pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively for pain,
      function, and stiffness using a disease-specific (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis
      Index [WOMAC]) . Other measurements like Knee Society score, Feller's score, Patient
      satisfaction (VAS) also checked pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively.
