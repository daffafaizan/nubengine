      extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, topotecan, and
      filgrastim (G-CSF). II. Determine the side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 and paclitaxel IV over 1
      hour followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour prior to topotecan on day 4. Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. G-CSF must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to beginning each
      subsequent course of chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
