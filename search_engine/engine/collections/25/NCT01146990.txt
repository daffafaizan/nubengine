      developmental assessment of children born to mothers who participated in the 17P Efficacy
      Trial. When subjects reach an age of 23 months after adjustment for gestational age, they
      will be screened for developmental delay using the 24 month ASQ version 3. Subjects who score
      positive (fall below the specified cut-off) for developmental delay in 1 or more domains will
      be referred for the 24 month Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition,
      Bayley-III) and a neurological examination.
