    
      Objectives: To compare the outcome and duration of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients
      with sickle cell disease (SCD) treated with iNO to that of similar episodes experienced by
      patients which receive a placebo.

      Study design: Bi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial

        -  Enrollment: 24 months

        -  Patients will be treated for 72 hours

        -  Patients will be followed for 15 days or until discharged home

      Sample size:

        -  The study will accrue a maximum of 240 patients

        -  Progress of the trial will be reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring
           committee to determine if randomization should stop for safety reasons.
