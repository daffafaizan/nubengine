           conduct individual interviews and focus group discussions with up to 25 Kenyan women
           (age 16-24) to optimally design PrEP My Way (the kit with instructional materials) and
           peer delivery system (including phone communication and kit delivery plans).

        2. Assess PrEP My Way for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact on PrEP
           adherence and program retention. The investigators will randomize 100 Kenyan women (age
           16-24) to PrEP My Way versus standard of care (i.e., clinic-based delivery of PrEP and
           sexual health services) and follow them for 6 months. Feasibility will be assessed by
           receipt of the kit at 1, 3, and 6 months and ability to use its components per protocol.
           Acceptability will be determined through a mixed-methods interview. Preliminary impact
           will be evaluated by dried blood spot tenofovir levels (adherence) and kit use/clinic
           attendance at 6 months (retention). Potential influencing and mediating socio-behavioral
           factors will be explored with questionnaires at 0 and 6 months.
