      I. Determine the impact on overall survival of patients with non-MYCN neuroblastoma below 18
      months of age as compared to neuroblastoma patients above 18 months of age.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived DNA samples are analyzed for segmental chromosome aberrations by multiplex
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
      technique. The following genomic regions are being studied: 1p, 1q, 3p, 4p, 7q, 9p, 11q, and
      17q, as are the copy numbers of MYCN, NAG, DDX1, and ALK genes.
