      ferritin as a measure of nutritional iron status at 2 months of age and would prevent
      definite iron deficiency (ID) in infants with a birth weight of <1301 g. Methods. Infants
      were randomly assigned to receive enteral iron supplementation of 2 to 6 mg/kg/day as soon as
      enteral feedings of >100 mL/kg/day were tolerated (EI) or at 61 days of life (late enteral
      iron supplementation [LI]). Nutritional iron status was assessed: 1) at birth, 2) at 61 days
      of life, 3) when the infants reached a weight of 1.6 times birth weight, and 4) before blood
      was transfused at a hematocrit of <.25. ID was defined by any one of the following criteria:
      ferritin, <12 mg/L; transferrin saturation, <17%; or increase of absolute reticulocyte counts
      by >50% one week after the onset of enteral iron supplementation. Restrictive red cell
      transfusion guidelines were followed and all transfusions were documented. Erythropoietin was
      not administered. The primary outcome variables were: 1) ferritin at 61 days and 2) the
      number of infants with ID. Results. Ferritin at 61 days was not different between the groups.
      Infants in the LI group were more often iron-deficient (26/65 vs 10/68) and received more
      blood transfusions after day 14 of life. No adverse effects of EI were noted. Conclusions. EI
      is feasible and probably safe in infants with birth weight <1301 g. EI may reduce the
      incidence of ID and the number of late blood transfusions. ID may occur in very low birth
      weight infants despite early supplementation with iron and should be considered in the case
      of progressive anemia. Pediatrics 2000; 106:700 -706; preterm infant, iron supplementation,
