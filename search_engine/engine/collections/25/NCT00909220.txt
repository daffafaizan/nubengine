      psychotherapy. However, up to 40% of adults with depression do not show reduced symptoms when
      treated with cognitive therapy or behavioral activation (BA), two common forms of
      psychotherapy. Certain indicators are generally linked with a successful outcome of
      psychotherapy-demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidity, and treatment
      adherence-but no factors reliably predict outcomes of psychotherapy in individuals. This
      study will test whether two characteristics related to the way people process emotions,
      affective asymmetry and affective reactivity, can predict whether people with depression will
      improve with BA therapy.

      Both depressed and healthy participants will be recruited for this study. Participation in
      this study will last 31 weeks. All participants will complete baseline assessments at Weeks 1
      and 2. Depressed participants will then begin receiving 16 weekly sessions of BA therapy. All
      participants will be assessed again after 8, 16, 17, and 28 weeks. Assessments will include
      the following: a urine toxicology screening; interviews on mental and physical health, family
      and childhood experiences, and current mood and functioning; computer tasks; recordings of
      electroencephalography (EEG) activity; recordings of reaction to a startle probe; recordings
      of electromyography (EMG) activity; recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA); and
      measurement of blood pressure.
