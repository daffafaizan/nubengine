    
      The investigators will collect data on 40 obese (Body Mass Index 30-45) Hispanic women ages
      21 to 65 years. The purpose of this research study is to test the efficacy of a mobile phone
      text message-based intervention on weight loss.

      After verifying eligibility and enrolling in the study, participants will come to Washington
      University School of Medicine, at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and fill out some questionnaires.
      The investigators will perform a brief exam that measures the lean and fat tissue using Dual
      Energy x-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) technology and will also do a modified 3-hour oral glucose
      tolerance test (MOGTT).

      Participants will wear an accelerometer (activity monitor) over a 7-day period at the
      beginning (before being randomized and enrolled in the intervention) and at the end of the
      study.

      Half of the participants will be randomized to the intervention group. The intervention group
      will be enrolled in the CareMessageâ„¢ Adult Obesity texting program, which sends a text
      message 3 to 5 times a week, encouraging lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise
      education, and behavioral strategies) that can lead to healthy weight loss. The control group
      will receive an initial talk about weight loss but will not be enrolled in any program or
      intervention.

      After six months have passed, participants will return to Washington University School of
      Medicine, regardless of the group they were assigned to, for two final visits (a short one,
      to pick up another activity monitor seven days before the study ends, and a longer visit, to
      do some final testing and fill out some questionnaires).
