      CellFX System and pre-defined energy profile for all primary and secondary treatments based
      on Fitzpatrick Skin Types and tip size. The comparator group will be treated with the same
      standardized intralesional electrodesiccation procedure conducted by all participating
      clinical sites. Subjects with 4-10 qualifying SH lesions on the face except the scalp, nose
      and within the orbital region will be enrolled. Each subject will be evaluated by the blinded
      site investigator at 7-days, 30-days, and 60-days post-initial CellFX and Electrodessication
      treatments. At the 30-day follow-up visit, lesions will be evaluate using Global Aesthetic
      Improvement Scale (GAIS), for eligibility to receive an additional treatment. In case of a
      second treatment, the subject will be evaluated by the blinded site investigator at 30-days
      and 60-days post-retreatment. Photography of the study lesions will be captured along with
      the blinded site investigator assessments at all visits.
