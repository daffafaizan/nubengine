      into 5 groups, 4 patient per group. The first three groups of four patients will receive
      transplants of increasing dose of HLA-matched umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells,
      starting from 4 spinal cord injection of 4µL of cell suspensions in Group A to 8µL in Group B
      and 16µL in Group C. If more than one subjects show neurological loss attributable to the
      cell injections, the trial will fall back to the previous dose. In the Group D, the highest
      volume of cells that do not cause neurological deficits (e.g. 16µL x4) along with a single
      bolus of 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) will be provided. Subjects in
      the Group E receive the same treatment as Group D plus a 6-week course of oral lithium
      carbonate. All subjects will enroll for three months intensive rehabilitation after the cell
      transplant.
