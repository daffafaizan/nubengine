      I. To assess depth of cervical invasion with positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance
      imaging (PET/MRI) in patients with cervical cancer in clinical Federation of Gynecology and
      Obstetrics (FIGO) staging undergoing evaluation for surgical resection and correlate with
      pathology.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate lymph node involvement on PET/MRI with pathology. II. To assess the
      inter-observer variability in the interpretation of PET/MRI. III. To correlate the
      quantitative imaging parameters of the tumor, such as the volumetric size, blood oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) analysis, apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), metabolic
      tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), standardized uptake value (SUV) and the
      glucose metabolic rate (GMR) with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and tumor grade on
      surgical pathology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 and gadobutrol intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and
      undergo PET/MRI over 90-120 minutes.
