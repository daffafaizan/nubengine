      For current analog classroom study each eligible subject will be optimized at 15, 20, 30, or
      40 mg in a timeframe of five weekly periods. In the sixth week each subject will be
      randomized double-blind to receive either active comparator at the optimized dose or placebo
      comparator treatment. The first classroom session will be held at the end of the week, when
      efficacy measurements including SKAMP and PERMP tests will be administered. At the beginning
      of the following week, the subjects will be crossed-over to the corresponding active
      comparator or placebo comparator treatment. The second classroom session will be held at the
      end of the second double-blind week, when the same efficacy measurements will be
      administered.

      Various safety and tolerability, and quality of life assessments will be conducted.
