      in each arm (n = 200) followed over 9 months. Providers will identify diabetic patients.
      After the baseline visit is completed, patient(s) and their provider will be randomized to
      either Intervention or Usual care arm as partners. The intervention arm will receive diabetes
      self-management education and modest financial incentives (gift cards) for completing
      diabetes process and glycemic outcomes according diabetes "best practices". Usual care
      patients will receive an equal number of educational materials on diabetes self-management
      via mail and will receive usual care through their provider but will not receive additional
      incentives for reaching glycemic outcomes. Both arms of the study will complete outcome
      visits at baseline, 4.5 and 9 months.
