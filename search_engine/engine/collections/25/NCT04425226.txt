      computer-generated allocation based on the envelope method and the hierarchical block
      randomization method(hierarchy: BCLC stage and AFP level). The envelopes are sealed opaque,
      and sequentially numbered.Randomization is performed by the trial coordinator.The random
      number table and the block assignment number table will be kept confidential by the full-time
      secretary of this project.Center-stratified block-permuted randomization is used in this
      trial. Then permuted block randomization is used for each stratum with a block size of 4.
