      obtained from patients where all details of the procedure were explained with emphasis on the
      intended outcome. The research was approved by the institutional review board.

      Ten eyes of 10 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included 6 eyes of 6 patients
      with accidental rupture of posterior capsule during cataract surgery (5 eyes underwent
      phacoemulsification technique and one underwent ECCE). Group B included four eyes of 4
      patients undergoing anterior segment reconstruction (anterior vitrectomy, secondary IOL
      Implantation and iris repair by direct approximation using 10/0 prolene sutures). In group A
      the mean age was 68.1 ± 10.93 years (range 47 to 79 years), 3 were males and 3 were females.
      In group B the mean age was 14 ± 5.6 years (range 9 to 22 years), 3 were males and one
      female. Demographic data and pre-operative Information are presented in table 1 and 2.

      In all patients triamcinolone acetonide was prepared by keeping the bottle vertical to allow
      sedimentation of crystals thus removing the vehicle. It was then injected into the anterior
      chamber (2 ml with concentration 20 mg/ml) just prior to anterior vitrectomy. The direction
      of the tip of the needle was kept away from the corneal endothelium to minimize endothelial
      toxicity. Triamcinolone was removed as quickly & completely as possible after finishing
      anterior vitrectomy.

      Postoperative regimen included topical steroids and antibiotics for about 4-6 weeks. Topical
      anti-glaucoma drugs were used in cases of high postoperative IOP for few days until
      stabilization of IOP. Follow up period ranged from 2 months up to 27 months.
