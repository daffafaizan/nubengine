      with 2 nucleoside analogues. Although effective, the pharmacokinetics of IDV make it
      difficult to use in many patients. The drug has a short half-life and requires administration
      in high doses every 8 hours with significant dietary restrictions. Research has shown that
      IDV kinetics can be improved significantly by the addition of RTV, allowing for
      administration of IDV at lower doses every 12 hours. The half-life of IDV is prolonged 3- to
      5-fold when administered with RTV. Based on these results, it is reasonable to study this
      combination as a twice-daily dosing regimen.

      Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of IDV/RTV for 24 weeks (Arms A and B). All
      patients also receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The NRTIs are
      not provided by the study. Clinical assessments take place at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      and 24 which includes a virology assessment. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/21/00: Patients who
      experience a confirmed virologic failure (defined in protocol) and elect to remain on study
      treatment, are followed through Week 24. Patients who experience a confirmed virologic
      failure and elect to discontinue study treatment will have a final evaluation at the time of
      treatment discontinuation.] Patients are hospitalized for 12 hours at the Week 2 study visit
      for an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis.
