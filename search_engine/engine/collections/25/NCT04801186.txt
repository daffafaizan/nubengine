    
      This is a multi-country, multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study planned
      to include patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, who
      have received at least 1 line of treatment (LOT) in the mCRPC setting, and have 12 months of
      follow-up data available.To describe the real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCRPC

      The data will be collected retrospectively between the date of diagnosis of mCRPC (index
      date) and the end of follow-up, i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or the date
      of data extraction, whichever is the earliest. The data on different types of treatment
      received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics, and
      healthcare utilization will be extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or
      deceased) into a centrally designed electronic data capture system. For the exploratory end
      point on real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCSPC, data on different types of
      treatment received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics
      will be retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or deceased)
      into a centrally designed electronic data capture system.
