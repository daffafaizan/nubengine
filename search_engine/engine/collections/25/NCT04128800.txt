      world. Small cell lung cancer accounts for about 15-20% of all lung cancer. Although the
      initial treatment is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patients with small cell
      lung cancer are prone to recurrence and metastasis in the early stage, and ultimately lead to
      death due to the lack of effective treatment after the disease progresses. Patients with
      relapsed small cell lung cancer had a poor prognosis; untreated patients had only two to
      three months of expected survival.Therefore, it is urgent to find a method to treat SCLC.

      Two single-arm phase II clinical studies on small cell lung cancer have evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with first-line chemotherapy for extensive SCLC.
      Two phase II single arm studies showed good efficacy and safety. Apatinib and bevacizumab are
      both antiangiogenic agents. S-1 is a new oral fluoropyrimidine anticancer agent, but S-1 has
      shown a high remission rate for metastatic NSCLC and relapsed NSCLC.

      In view of the good efficacy and tolerability of oral chemotherapeutic agent S-1, and the
      lack of suitable targeted drugs after NGS treatment in relapsed S LCL patients after previous
      multithreaded treatment, this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of
      combination of anti-angiogenesis drugs and S-1 in patients with failed or dangerous SCLC
      after second-line or more radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
