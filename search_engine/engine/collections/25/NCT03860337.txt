      vitro. Lipase is a valid target for anti-obesity products as shown by the pharmaceutical drug
      orlistat which targets the same enzyme. Reducing the amount of lipase activity will reduce
      the amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) that will be digested and therefore absorbed and will be
      seen as a reduction in the level of circulating TAG in the blood. Adding alginate to a range
      of food products that are simple to include into the diet could help with the management of
      obesity. In this study, sausages containing alginate have been manufactured for us along with
      matched control sausage. The circulating TAG in the blood will be measured via fingerpick
      blood samples every 30 minutes for four hours after the volunteers have eaten either alginate
      sausages or normal sausages. The volunteers will come for two visits and consume the other
      sausage meal at the second so they will have had both types of sausage.
