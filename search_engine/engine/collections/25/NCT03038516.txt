      supplementation to palliative cancer patients - A double blind, randomised controlled trial.
      Acronym: "Palliative-D" Trial Objectives: To test the hypothesis that vitamin D treatment
      during 12 weeks to palliative cancer patients can decrease opioid consumption, fatigue and
      infectious burden and increase quality of life.

      INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (IMP): Test ProductDetremin, MA holder Renapharma;
      Pharmaceutical Form: Oil Route of Administration: Oral route

      METHODOLOGY Trial Design: Double-blind, parallel randomised and placebo controlled trial
      Dose/Duration 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks

      Primary Endpoint:

      The decline of opioid-consumption during 12 weeks in the vitamin D group compared to the
      placebo group, based on 3 measurements with 4 weeks intervals.

      Secondary end Points:

        1. Decline in antibiotic consumption

        2. Improvement in quality of life

        3. Improvement in fatigue

        4. Vitamin D levels in serum after 12 weeks

        5. Association between opioid dose and genetic polymorphism in genes involved in the effect
           and metabolism of vitamin D in the body.

      Efficacy Parameters:

      Opioid dose, translated to fentanyl per hour measured at baseline and at week 4,8 and 12.

      Antibiotic consumption expressed as % of days with antibiotics during the last 4 weeks
      measured at baseline and at week 4, 8 and 12.

      Quality of Life measured with EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL at baseline and after 12 weeks. Fatigue
      measured with EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL at baseline and after 12 weeks. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in
      blood at baseline and after 12 weeks. ESAS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ) measured at
      baseline and at week 4, 8 and 12.

      Safety Parameters: S-calcium will be controlled in all subjects at baseline, at week 4, 8 and
      12 and U-calcium in selected cases Power: The least clinically meaningful effect is estimated
      to be a 20% decline in opioid dose compared to the placebo. To obtain this result with 80%
      power the number of patients is estimated to be 127 in each arm i.e. 254 patients in total.
      This includes a drop-out of 25% per group.

      Statistical Analyse plan: The primary endpoint will be analysed using linear regression,
      using bias corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals, while controlling for
      baseline measure of opioid dose (similar to ANCOVA). Adjustment for other background
      variables - such as vitamin D-level at baseline, gender and age - will be made in a secondary
      analysis to gain efficiency. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analysed using the
      same method as the primary endpoint .
