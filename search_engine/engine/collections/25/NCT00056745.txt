    
      The goal of this vaccination study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      Therion Biologic Corporation (Cambridge, MA) TBC-3B vaccine. TBC-3B consists of live,
      recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the env and gag/pol genes of HIV-1 strain IIIB. TBC-3B
      will be administered by subcutaneous injection in the groin and in the deltoid region, with
      the aim of determining which site is better at inducing mucosal immune responses. Because the
      groin area drains to the inguinal lymph nodes, vaccines given there may stimulate local
      immunologic activity in the draining rectal mucosa as well as systemic immunologic activity
      in the blood.

      Volunteers will be followed for 20 months. The first 2 months of the study will be an
      evaluation of volunteers' normal immune function. Volunteers will then be randomly selected
      to receive the TBC-3B experimental HIV vaccine in either the groin area or in the deltoid
      region. Neither volunteers nor study personnel will know which group the volunteer will be in
      until the day of the first immunization. All volunteers will receive TBC-3B.

      During the 20 months of the study, volunteers will be asked to donate blood up to 14 times,
      undergo seven flexible sigmoidoscopies with biopsies, and receive three pairs of vaccine
      injections. For up to 36 days after each experimental vaccination, volunteers will be asked
      to abstain from activity that might spread the virus in the vaccine and put others at risk.
      Volunteers will receive specific instructions on how to avoid these risks. Volunteers will
      also be asked not to engage in receptive anal intercourse during the study.
