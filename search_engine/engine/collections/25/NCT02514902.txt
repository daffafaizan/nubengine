      feasible and may provide an important diagnostic tool for stroke and traumatic brain injury
      (TBI).

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Determine the first-in-humans feasibility using the investigators' biomarker lateral
           flow device on whole blood samples to diagnose patients with acute stroke (both ischemic
           and hemorrhagic) and traumatic brain injury being evaluated in the Emergency Department
           and Inpatient Services at University of Kentucky. Provide initial pilot data for
           estimating sensitivity and specificity of the assay.

        2. Establish a visual ordinal grading scale that is easy to use clinically to judge the
           severity of injury, from the Lateral Flow Device result. Verify that the visual scale
           has inter-rater reliability, and evaluate it against a digital detection assay.

        3. Examine the correlation between clinical and radiographic parameters of injury severity
           and blood levels of the biomarker. The investigators will correlate the results of the
           test with NIH Stroke Scale and with MRI infarct volume for ischemic stroke, with
           hemorrhage volume on CT for hemorrhagic stroke, and with Glasgow Coma Scale for
           Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
