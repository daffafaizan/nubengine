    
      This study aimed to establish whether Heart Rate Variance (HRV) biofeedback improved HRV
      coherence as well as psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, emotion regulation, and
      mindfulness) over the course of 15 biofeedback sessions in a sample of 14 patients with
      varying diagnoses; Paranoid Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Personality Disorder or
      Mixed Diagnosis. All 14 participants (n=10 male, n=4 female) participated in 15 biofeedback
      sessions. The study was researched and treatment was facilitated by a trainee forensic
      psychologist working with both male and female offenders residing within a Forensic
      Psychiatric Hospital, on both low and medium secure wards. An average coherence percentage
      was captured using the Wild Devine ProgrammeÂ® Relaxing Rhythms software for each session.
      Quantitative data were collected and analysed before, during and after biofeedback treatment
      to assess whether there was improvement in psychometric measures of depression, anxiety,
      emotion regulation and facets of mindfulness. A quasi experimental 'A-B-A design' was
      employed to assess the research questions.
