    
      Specific Aims: Aim 1 -Characterize a national cohort of Veterans with alcohol misuse and
      modifiable CVD risk, their alcohol services utilization, and clinical outcomes. Aim 2 -
      Qualitatively assess barriers to treatment for Veterans with alcohol misuse and CVD risk
      across multiple stakeholders. Aim 3 - Use a successive cohort design to iteratively develop
      an intervention based on patient feedback. Aim 4 - Test the acceptability and feasibility of
      an intervention to reduce alcohol misuse and CVD risk in Veterans.

      Innovation: This application is highly innovative in its attempt to address for the first
      time: 1) perceptions of barriers to treatment in this population, 2) the utility of a
      combined intervention for alcohol misuse and CVD risk, 3) multimorbid patient preferences for
      timing of treatments for multiple different targets, and 4) the sustainability of health
      behavior habits in VA formed by an intervention using "implementation intentions."
      Methodology: Aim 1 will use electronic health records to examine the status of key health
      criteria and services utilization among Veterans with alcohol misuse, both with and without
      comorbid CVD risk. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews of both Veterans with comorbid
      alcohol misuse and elevated modifiable CVD risk, their providers across different settings,
      and systems-level stakeholders to assess current treatment barriers. Aim 3 will employ a
      successive cohort design to iteratively test the proposed intervention with rapid and early
      feedback from multiple Veteran cohorts. Aim 4 will test a refined intervention based on
      feedback from Aims 2 and 3 to determine the acceptability to Veteran patients, as well as the
      feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and intervention.
