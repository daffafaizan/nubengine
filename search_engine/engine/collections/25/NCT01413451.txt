    
      Background:

        -  Amatuximab is a high-affinity monoclonal IgG antibody raised against human mesothelin.

        -  Mesothelin is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-linked membrane glycoprotein thought to
           be involved in tumor metastasis

        -  Mesothelin is over-expressed in many cancers

      Objectives:

      -The primary objective is to determine the biodistribution of radiolabeled amatuximab in
      tumor and nontumor tissues in subjects with mesothelin over-expressing cancers including
      mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, and non small cell lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Female or male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age;

        -  Histologically confirmed mesothelin-expressing cancer;

        -  Transaminases less than or equal to 3 times ULN for mesothelioma, non small cell lung
           and ovarian cancer;

        -  Transaminases less than or equal to 5 times ULN for pancreatic cancer with known liver
           metastasis.

      Design:

        -  This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, pilot study of MORAb-009 in
           approximately 20 subjects with mesothelin expressing tumors.

        -  Indium-radiolabeled MORAb-009 (5mCi) will be administered.

        -  Serial single photon emission-computerized tomography imaging will be performed to
           determine binding to tumor and nontumor tissue.

        -  Subjects will be observed closely for safety and possible development of anti-MORAb-009
           antibodies.

        -  Pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled antibody will be determined with imaging over time.
