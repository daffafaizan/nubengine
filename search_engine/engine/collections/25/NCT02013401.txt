      mother-infant dyadic communication. Assessments include behavioral, physiological, and
      affective indices under conditions where distal stressors may not be directly detectable by
      the infant. The present research examines mother-infant interactions to test the hypothesis
      of whether maternal stress may be transduced to their infants via multiple pathways. The
      secondary aim is to explore effective emotion regulation strategies for the mother as
      potential buffers to stress and additionally reducing early life stress effects on the
      infant's regulatory development.

      While the emotion regulation literature posits that reappraisal may be associated with
      decreased in physiological and psychological stress, this type of regulation strategy may be
      ineffective when interfacing with discrimination. The regulation strategy needs to be
      titrated to the stressor in order to be effective. These findings will have notable social,
      clinical, and psychological significance,
