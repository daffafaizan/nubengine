      It is uncertain whether the intake of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy reduces the risk of
      preterm preeclampsia.

      In a meta-analysis of individual-participant data from the trials, the effect of aspirin was
      not affected by the gestational age at the onset of therapy. In contrast, other meta-analyses
      showed that aspirin started at or before 16 weeks of gestation resulted in halving the rates
      of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and perinatal death, whereas aspirin started after
      16 weeks of gestation did not have a significant benefit. In addition, the beneficial effect
      of aspirin that was started at or before 16 weeks of gestation was dose-dependent, with a
      greater reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia being associated with a daily dose of
      aspirin of 100 mg or more.

      This will be a randomized control trial to estimate the efficacy of two doses (81 mg versus
      162 mg) of aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in healthy, nulliparous obese and
      overweight pregnant women identified in the first trimester.
