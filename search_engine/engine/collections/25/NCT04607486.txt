      the alterations in muscle tone of the lower limb in first-ever chronic stroke patients by
      using a 3D free-hand Ultrasonography (3DfUS) technique in combination with an instrumented
      spasticity assessment (IPSA). In these chronic stroke patients, the spontaneous neurological
      recovery is stabilized
