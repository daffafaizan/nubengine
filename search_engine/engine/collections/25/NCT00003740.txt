      androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer. II. Study HER2 status by
      immunohistochemistry on prostate cancer biopsy samples. III. Study associations between HER2
      protein expression on tumor cells and post-therapy changes in PSA in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 or 90 minutes once a week. Treatment
      continues for a maximum of 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients are followed for time to progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
