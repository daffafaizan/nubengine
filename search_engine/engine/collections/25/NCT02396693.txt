    
      The infants were randomly allocated after extubation used a list of computer-generated
      randomization in NIPPV modes (with the following settings: positive inspiratory pressure
      (PIP) < 16 centimeters of water (cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4-5
      centimeters of water (cm H2O, backup respiratory rate (RR) < 18 cycles per minute flow 6-7
      liters per minute (L / min) and inspiratory time (TI) according to the time constant for idae
      (0.30 to 0.34 seconds), and respirator seal to NCPAP water tower was adjusted to 4-5
      centimeters of water (cm H2O) PEEP, flow 6-7 liters per minute (L / Min.) oxygen for both was
      adjusted to maintain arterial oxygen saturation between 85-95%

      The criteria for extubation were defined using a protocol by the clinic staff, confirmed by
      arterial blood gases and chest X-ray, as well as adjustments of the ventilator settings.

      Vital signs, blood gas parameters and noninvasive brackets were recorded before, immediately,
      15, 30, 45 minutes, 1(hour) h, 2h, 12h, 24h and 48 h after extubation were documented.

      Neonatal morbidities were documented until discharge, among these are: patent ductus
      arterious, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage and
      pneumothorax.

      Data on achievement of prenatal, antenatal steroids and surfactant administration were
      documented. All newborns were natural porcine surfactant CurosurfÂ®.

      The total duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen were documented from birth until
      discharge or death. The supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation days was defined as
      daily requirement of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2)> 0.21 or ventilation > 12 hours,
      respectively.

      The newborns were followed for all interaction until discharge (about 5 weeks).
