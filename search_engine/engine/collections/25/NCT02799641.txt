      control for an extended period of time. IUDs are the most effective type of reversible birth
      control for women who do not wish to become pregnant over the next couple years, have the
      lowest failure rate (Winner, 2012), and in 2007, were used by more than 180 million women
      worldwide (Darney, 2010). Despite the high efficacy and low rates of side effects, women may
      decline placement of an IUD due to fear of pain associated with placement. IUDs may act as a
      barrier to women selecting this method of contraception. Currently there is no consensus in
      the literature as to the most effective way to address analgesia surrounding IUD insertion.

      In order to eliminate barriers to selecting the IUD for contraception, improve the experience
      of women undergoing placement, and standardize local practices, investigators want to
      investigate analgesic options affecting patients' perception of pain during the various steps
      of IUD insertion.
