        -  Determine the tolerance of adjuvant fluorouracil with concurrent radiotherapy in
           patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine survival without local relapse in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of this adjuvant therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive high-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients also receive
      low-dose radiotherapy 4 times a week during the last 2 weeks of the 5-week course of
      treatment. Patients concurrently receive fluorouracil IV continuously for 5 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
