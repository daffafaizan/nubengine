      reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). One
      mechanism of benefit may be through improved endothelial function and enhanced nitric oxide
      (NO) bioactivity, which may improve blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle and to the
      myocardium. We have recently determined in a collaborative study with the Suburban Hospital,
      however, that many CAD patients do not show improved endothelial function despite compliant
      participation in a three month cardiac rehabilitation program with exercise three times
      weekly. The initial data from this study suggest that improvement in endothelial function may
      be dependent on the release of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow into
      the circulation in response to the stimulus of repetitive exercise, with the potential of
      repairing damaged endothelium and improving endothelial function and NO release. Thus,
      patients who have poor EPC mobilization responses to exercise may have limited capacity to
      improve endothelial function over time and, conversely, patients with higher EPC mobilization
      responses to exercise may show improved endothelial function as a result of vascular repair.
      Animal models indicate that NO is necessary for EPC mobilization during exercise, likely
      through nitrosation reactions with key signaling proteins within bone marrow. In many CAD
      patients, NO release from endothelium and transport in blood to bone marrow may be
      compromised because of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and thus limit EPC mobilization and
      vascular repair. We hypothesize that the exogenous administration of NO to CAD patients may
      enhance EPC mobilization from bone marrow in response to exercise. If successful,
      administration of an NO donor (such as nitroglycerin) prior to exercise may extend the
      benefit of exercise to endothelial function-and thus cardiovascular risk-in a larger segment
      of CAD patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs.
