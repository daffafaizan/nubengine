      who had fetal growth assessed during pregnancy. In this cohort an expected 10% of pregnant
      women will be exposed to malaria while the remaining will be free of malaria. Their offspring
      are already followed up for growth monitoring from birth until 2 years of age with
      anthropometric measurements including weight, length, arm and head circumference at each
      scheduled visit. The investigator would like to enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes
      with minimal risk for the child by proposing the following anthropometric and screening
      tests, nutrition questionnaire, and neurodevelopment assessment. In addition a prospective
      cohort of children born after study approval will be followed on both protocols. The
      additional measure include:

        -  Body fat composition (at birth, and monthly up to 4 months unless weight â‰¥ 8kg)

        -  Triceps and subscapular skinfold (at 1 and 2 years)

        -  Anemia, malaria and soil-transmitted helminths screening (every 3 months in first 12
           months and 6-monthly 1-2 years)

        -  Buccal swab (at 1 and 2 years)

        -  Neurodevelopment (every 6 months)

        -  Food questionnaire (at 1 and 2 years)
