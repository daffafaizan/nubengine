      limbal vascular plexus. Infection, inflammation, ischemia, degeneration, or trauma, and the
      loss of the limbal stem cell barrier can cause corneal neovascularization. Growth of new
      vessels may result in corneal scarring, edema, lipid deposition, and inflammation that may
      alter visual acuity and is a leading cause of monocular visual impairment and blindness.
      Additionally, it results in the loss of immune response across the cornea, thereby worsening
      the prognosis of a subsequent penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Growth of new blood and
      lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels are mediated by members of the vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. In previous studies, inhibition of new blood or
      lymphatic vessels has been achieved by neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor A
      (VEGF-A). It has also been shown that platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) plays a role
      in corneal and choroidal neovascularization by regulating mural cell recruitment. Inhibition
      of PDGF-B and VEGF-A signaling pathways has shown to more effectively promote vessel
      regression than solely inhibiting VEGF-A. Pazopanib is a drug designed to block these
      pathways, stop new growth, and regress old vessel growth.
