      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Participants who are discharged from an
      acute heart failure hospitalization are enrolled. The prognostic factors provide information
      about the treatment of this disease in the future. This study is a retrospective
      observational study. Investigators will collect data from May 2014 to July 2019 in the heart
      failure center of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. A follow-up is conducted at the
      Kaohsiung HF center until August 2020. Investigators want to know whether the risk factors
      such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, nephropathy, and some biochemical indexes can be an
      index that predicts future survival or rehospitalization of these patients. Besides,
      investigators will also explore the cardiac rehabilitation can also effectively improve the
      survival rate of such patients.
