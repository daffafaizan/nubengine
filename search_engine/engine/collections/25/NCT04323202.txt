    
      This is a phase 1 study looking at anti-PD-1 Neoadjuvant therapy in Basal cell carcinoma in
      participants with locoregionally advanced, but resectable basal cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck. Participants will undergo fine cut CT imaging (head and neck) and treatment with
      the study drug pembrolizumab.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate pathologic response to pre-operative
      treatment of pembrolizumab in the study group.

      Secondary objectives of this study include assessing safety of the intervention, and
      assessing phenotyping immune infiltrates in non-pathology complete responders (pCRs), as well
      as assessment of changes to the systemic immune system (e.g. peripheral blood lymphocytes
      (PBLs)) in pCRs vs partial responders (pPR) vs non responders.

      The exploratory objective will include assessing one-year recurrence rates after completion
      of NeoAdjuvant-Adjuvant therapy.
