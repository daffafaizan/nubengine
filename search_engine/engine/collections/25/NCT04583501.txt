      Aim 1. The investigation will identify the specific tissue compartment distribution of
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) expression within human nasal polyps. Colocalization studies will
      examine functional interaction of IgE with effector cells.

      Aim 2. The investigation will examine the direct effect of omalizumab on expression of Type
      2, 1, and 3 inflammatory pathways in human nasal polyp tissue from phenotypically
      characterized chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) patients.

      Study Rationale: Human nasal polyps express high local tissue IgE. However, the tissue
      distribution, cellular location and functional consequence of IgE accumulation within the
      polyp tissue is not known. Phase 3 studies of omalizumab demonstrated efficacy, with
      responders. However, the reason for non-responder outcomes in a subset of CRSwNP patients was
      not understood. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the mechanism of action of
      omalizumab in CRSwNP, such that specific responders for this treatment can be identified and
      therapy can be optimally directed.
