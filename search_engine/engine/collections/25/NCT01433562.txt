    
      The duration of treatment for each subject will be 63 - 84 days (or 3 cycles). The cycle will
      be initiated at Day-1 (D1 of the 1st cycle). The subsequent cycles will start on Day-22 (D1
      of the 2nd cycle) and Day-43 (D1 of the 3rd cycle). DLBS1425 capsules will be administered
      orally every day (starting from D1 of each cycle) during the study period. All subjects will
      be under direct supervision of a medical doctor during the study period.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate investigational drug's efficacy and safety
      will be performed at baseline and at the end of every cycle over the study course; whilst
      breast-CT scan will be performed at baseline and at the end of study course.

      In addition, at the end of study, at the discretion of Investigator and subjects' own
      willingness, subjects with good response to treatment (i.e. RECIST and pathological
      evaluation are regarded as complete or partial response) may continue their breast-cancer
      therapy with DLBS1425.
