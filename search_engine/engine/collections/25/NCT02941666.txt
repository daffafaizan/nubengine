      cartilage collapse, the purpose of this study is to determine if the MSC concentration in
      synovial fluid can be correlated to disease stage. In order to do this the investigators
      will:

      Milestone #1:

      Determine the concentration of MSC's in the synovial fluid in patients with osteonecrosis.
      This work will be carried out utilizing FACS-based technique to synovial fluid stem cell
      sub-population.

      Milestone #2:

      Compare concentrations of MSC's in patients with pre collapse, post collapse osteonecrosis
      and "normal" hips. Patient-derived MSC will be quantified at the different stages of disease
      and assays will be performed in order to assess their viability. A control group will be
      selected in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoral/acetabular impingement (FAI).
      Since FAI does not affect the intraarticular environment of the hip, theoretically these
      patients would have a "normal" concentration of synovial stem cells.
