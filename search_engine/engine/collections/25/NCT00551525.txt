      Primary

        -  To assess the effectiveness of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium (as determined by
           a 30% decline in the PSA level within 12 weeks) followed by either three-dimensional
           conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy in patients with
           rising prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA) after radical prostatectomy prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the proportion of patients completing protocol treatment.

        -  To evaluate hematological toxicity at 12 weeks.

        -  To evaluate samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium-related adverse events at 12 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the "acute" and "late" radiation therapy-related events having occurred up
           to 24 weeks from the end of radiation therapy.

        -  To compare the freedom from progression rate at 2 years to that predicted by the Kattan
           Nomograms.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium (SM) IV on day 1. Patients
      are closely monitored for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and SM-associated toxicity
      for 12 weeks. After the 12 weeks, patients undergo either intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 5 days a week for 7-8 weeks. Patients
      may receive hormonal therapy (after radiation therapy) at the discretion of their physician.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression (defined as a PSA doubling time
      less than 3 months), severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of 25,000 cells/mmÂ³
      or less), or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and 12
      months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
