    
      This is a single blind, randomized, pilot trial designed to estimate the amount of change
      between two programs. Subjects will be randomized and stratified by setting into one of two
      groups, over ground walking training with poles (Nordic Walking) or traditional over ground
      walking training (without poles). Randomization will be computer generated using
      randomization scheme from the website Randomization.com at http://www.randomization.com Basic
      descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants and compare the two
      groups at baseline. Paired t-test will be used to estimate the efficacy of each intervention.
      Effects size of each interventions and its ratio will be calculated. Group-specific change
      score will be calculated to explore the impact of prognostic variables (age, gender, number
      of comorbities, baseline gait speed) on change of an outcome (with or without poles).
