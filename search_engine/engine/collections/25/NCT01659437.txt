    
      A total of 415 patients in whom Buruli ulcer has been clinically diagnosed will be included
      in the study, which will consist of 332 cases of category I and II Buruli ulcers (<10 cm)
      confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), plus 83 non PCR-confirmed Buruli ulcers.
      Patients will be randomized to receive treatment with the two antibiotic regimens as follows:

      (i) Regimen I (SR8): 15 mg/kg streptomycin per day intramuscular injection for 8 weeks plus
      10 mg/kg per day oral rifampicin for 8 weeks; (ii) Regimen II (CR8): 15 mg/kg per day oral
      extended-release clarithromycin for 8 weeks plus 10 mg/kg per day oral rifampicin for 8
      weeks.

      Assessments before, during and after the course of antibiotic treatment will include full
      medical history, clinical assessments and monitoring of vital signs, assessment of the
      lesion, laboratory investigations, hearing test, electrocardiogram, pregnancy test, voluntary
      HIV counseling and testing, and functional limitation assessment. The primary efficacy
      parameters are healing without recurrence and without excision surgery 12 months after the
      start of treatment.

      The primary endpoint will be assessed by a panel of experts unaware of the treatment ('single
      blinded' for treatment allocation).
