      standard of care, following major abdominal surgery for bladder removal. Rectus sheath
      catheters are small tubes that are positioned into a specific area of the cut abdominal wall
      at the end of surgeryÍ¾ whereas an epidural is a tube that is positioned into the back. Both
      allow administration of local anaesthetic for pain control. The current gold standard is an
      epidural. This study will aim to evaluate this and show the comparative efficacy of the
      rectus sheath catheter, which anecdotally the investigators have found superior in practice.
