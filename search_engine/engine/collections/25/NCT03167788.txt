      red cells will reduce inflammation and organ injury in cardiac surgery patients at risk of
      large volume blood transfusion when compared to standard care. Organ injury and sepsis
      accounts for the majority of all deaths following cardiac surgery. Once organ injury is
      established care is primarily supportive and there are no effective treatments. Prevention is
      therefore a key clinical strategy to prevent death, morbidity and high healthcare costs
      attributable to these complications. Sepsis and inflammatory organ injury are also the
      principal causes of death following paediatric cardiac surgery, trauma, non-cardiac complex
      surgical procedures and in critical care; clinical settings that are also among the principal
      consumers of blood components. National and international blood management strategies are
      focused on these patients. Evidence of a clinical benefit attributable to the use of
      rejuvenated red cells in cardiac surgery patients is therefore likely to translate into more
      widespread benefits to patients and the National Health Service (NHS).
