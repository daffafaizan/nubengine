      Following entry into the trial, patients will go on a treatment holiday from chemotherapy and
      enter an immunotherapy phase of treatment. Continuation of HER2-targeted antibody therapy is
      permitted during this immunotherapy phase for women with HER2+ disease. Scans will be
      conducted at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy to determine tumor
      response. Radiographic PD at week 6 must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later, either at week
      12 or earlier if clinically necessitated.
