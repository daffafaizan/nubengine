    
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE
      combined with Sintilimab and Bevacizumab Biosimilar (T-Double Therapy) in patients with HCC
      (BCLC-C Stage). Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Sintilimab and
      Bevacizumab Biosimilar after TACE until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death,
      withdrawal of the patient or the researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.

      The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of T-Double
      Therapy for advanced HCC (BCLC C-stage). The secondary outcome measures include the duration
      of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival rate (PFSR) in 6-
      and 12-months, overall survival rate (OSR) in 6- and 12-months, the median progression-free
      survival time (mPFS) and median overall survival time (mOS) of T-Double Therapy for advanced
      HCC. This study also aims to assess the safety and adverse reactions of T-Double Therapy for
      advanced HCC.
