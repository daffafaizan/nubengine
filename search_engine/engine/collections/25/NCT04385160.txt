      with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 will be followed for at least one month. Detailed
      information on the clinical characteristics of these patients and their disease outcomes will
      be retrospectively and prospectively collected in a specific eCRF, including MPN
      characteristics, treatment and comorbidities pre-Covid-19, time of Covid-19 diagnosis,
      drugs/device used for the treatment of Covid-19, any change in MPN therapy, antithrombotic
      prophylaxis employed during the period of infection and - for hospitalised patients only -
      key blood and laboratory parameters. A particular focus will be on exploring final outcomes
      for patients in this study, most notably the incidence of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic
      events. Statistical analyses will also be performed looking for any independent factors that
      can significantly predict patient outcomes after Covid-19 diagnosis.

      Ultimately, this project will provide important insights into disease severity and
      progression in patients with MPN and Covid-19 and uncover the key clinical factors which
      drive outcomes and mortality. Results may help clinicians better understand how patient
      characteristics and management decisions can impact on disease trajectory when MPN and
      Covid-19 collide.
