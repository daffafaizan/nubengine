      with the considerable physical and social burden .Its estimated prevalence varies globally
      and is highest in western countries, where it affects around 2-4% of the population The most
      common form is plaque psoriasis, accounting 90% of all cases and manifesting as sharply
      demarcated erythematous plaques covered by silvery scales The gut microbiota refers to the
      complex community of microorganisms, covering more than 1000 different species of bacteria,
      viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

      The gut commensals predominantly aid in nutrient metabolism, drug metabolism, prevention of
      colonization of pathogenic microorganisms and in intestinal barrier function..

      Dysbiosis or alterations in the composition and function of the microbiota has been
      implicated in the development and progression of various skin diseases. The concept of
      "gut-skin axis" links the effects of dysbiosis with many skin diseases.

      Disruption of the intestinal barrier can cause translocation of bacteria and their endotoxins
      or metabolites, which further induces or aggravates systemic inflammation The intestinal
      barrier function is maintained by a lining of enterocytes and tight junctions, sealing the
      paracellular space between adjacent enterocytes. Intestinal barrier integrity loss can be
      assessed by evaluation of intestinal epithelial cell damage or tight junction loss Claudins
      are transmembrane proteins which participate in the formation of tight junctions by binding
      to the actin cytoskeleton. Blood Claudin- 3 is considered as a useful early non-invasive
      biomarker of intestinal permeability due to its small size Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP)
      are small (14-15 kDa) cytosolic water-soluble proteins, present in mature enterocytes of the
      small and large intestine... It is also considered a reliable marker of intestinal barrier
      integrity Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease with complex multifactorial
      pathogenesis. Recently, considerable interest has been focused on the interaction between the
      gut microbiome, intestinal barrier and immune system. The so-called 'gut-skin axis' has been
      suggested to be a key factor and an interesting area of research in the etiopathogenesis of
      psoriasis with potential attractive therapeutic implications
