    
      A prospective cohort study based on the platform of Ongoing Registry of Treatment of Chronic
      Venous Diseases (NCT03035747). The study will enrol adult patients undergoing any kind of
      varicose veins surgery with and without any prophylaxis. The patients should be examined for
      venous thromboembolic complications during 2-4 weeks after the procedure with mandatory
      duplex ultrasound.

      The study will provide following information:

        -  the rate of asymptomatic DVT after varicose veins surgery

        -  the rate of symptomatic VTE after varicose veins surgery

        -  the rate of thermal-induced thrombosis (EHIT) after endovenous thermal ablation

        -  the ability of Caprini scores to predict VTE after varicose veins surgery

        -  identification of patients with high risk of VTE who will benefit from prophylaxis,
           especially with anticoagulation
