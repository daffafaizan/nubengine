      radiopathomics artificial intelligence (AI) system. Patients who have been pathologically
      diagnosed as rectal adenocarcinoma and defined as clinical II-III staging without distant
      metastasis by enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be enrolled from the Sixth
      Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming
      Medical College and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated by Zhejiang University School of
      Medicine. All participants should follow a very standard treatment protocol, including of
      concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), total mesorectum excision (TME) surgery and
      adjuvant chemotherapy. The MRI and biopsy examination should be completed before the nCRT and
      the images will be subjected to the manual delineation of the tumor regions of interest (ROI)
      by experienced radiologists and pathologists. Subsequently, the outlined MRI and biopsy
      slides images will be employed to the radiopathomics AI system to generate the predicted
      response ("predicted pathologic complete response (pCR)" vs. "predicted non-pCR") of
      individual patient, whereas the actual response ("pathologic confirmed as pCR" vs.
      "pathologic confirmed as non-pCR") will be diagnosed at surgery excised specimen. Through
      comparisons of the predicted responses and true pathologic responses, investigators calculate
      the prediction accuracy, specificity, sensitivity as well as the Area Under Curve (AUC) of
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. This study is aimed to validate the high
      accuracy and robustness of the radiopathomics AI system for identifying pCR candidates from
      non-pCR individuals before nCRT which will facilitate further precision therapy for patients
      with locally advanced rectal cancer.
