    
      The secondary objectives are to compare the following items between the two arms of the
      study:

      A. Central venous oxygen saturation at 4 hours (H4)

      B. Changes in plasma concentration of lactates between H0 and H4

      C. Changes in the tissue oxygen saturation between H0 and H4

      D. Changes in echocardiographic parameters of systolic function of the left ventricle (LV)
      and right ventricle (RV), as well as diastolic LV function between H0 and H4

      E. Vascular Filling volume during the study period

      F. Kidney function: urine output and creatinine changes between H0 and H4

      G. The required vasopressor time between H0 and H4

      H. Use of positive inotropic agents

      I. The inflammatory response via the analysis of HLA-DR between H0 and H4 and M1 / M2
      responses at H4

      J. The duration of ICU stay, mortality, morbidity in terms of organ failures
