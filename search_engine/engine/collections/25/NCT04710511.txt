      deleterious oral habits practicing. Shahraki et al. stated that increased stress levels are
      associated with oral habits as thumb sucking and nail biting. Leme et al. concluded that
      children and adolescents with DOH presented more symptoms of depression than their
      counterparts. Moreover, they were more likely to report symptoms of anxiety.

      Ability to cope (or resilience) includes a person's sense of agency and their ability to
      think and behave, to make positive decisions, and to apply skills and knowledge to life
      challenges. The term resilience has come to mean an individual's ability to overcome
      adversity and continue his or her normal development.

      The association between psychological resilience and practicing oral habits in children
      remains unclear, this study aims to reveal that association, if present.
