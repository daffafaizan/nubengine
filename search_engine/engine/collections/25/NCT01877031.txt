    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the incremental benefit of a innovative, robust,
      intuitive and portable, virtual reality(VR) imaging platform capable of displaying a tracked
      virtual needle tip with path trajectory along with the real time ultrasound(US) image of an
      internal jugular vein compared to US imaging of the internal jugular vein alone to reduce the
      complications associated with insertion of central lines.

      The studies primary outcome is the difference in time to insert a central line, from needle
      insertion to placement and confirmation of the wire in the internal jugular vein, compared to
      standard insertions using ultrasound guidance alone. Secondary outcomes will include the
      number of needle withdrawals, the incidence of carotid puncture and the incidence of
      pneumothorax. Finally, a subjective VAS rating of 1 to 10 for ease of insertion will be
      collected from participating anesthesiologists.
