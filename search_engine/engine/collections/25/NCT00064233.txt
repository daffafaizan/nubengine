        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, maximum administered dose, dose-limiting toxicity,
           and a recommended phase II dose of BMS-354825 in patients with chronic phase chronic
           myelogenous leukemia who have hematologic resistance to imatinib mesylate.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug, in terms of hematologic,
           cytogenetic, and molecular responses in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral BMS-354825 once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 7 days for at
      least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may
      receive further treatment in the absence of disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-354825 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Once the MTD is determined, 20 additional patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD
      of BMS-354825.

      Patients are followed for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (30 for phase I and 20 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
