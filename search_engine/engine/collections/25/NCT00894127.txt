      reacting to the increased number of low-density lipoproteins coating the surface of cancer
      cells and the porous nature of the cancer cell membrane, causing the cell to fluoresce under
      specific wavelengths of light. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine
      the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the CyPath速 Lung Cancer Detection Assay ("CyPath速
      Assay") using sputum specimens from two cohorts of Participants. The Study design included a
      protocol to assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath速 Lung Cancer Detection Assay to
      detect cancer in comparison with routine high-resolution, low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)
      scans.

      Optimization of the Assay can lead to improved sensitivity and specificity. Increase in
      sample size and evaluation of the entire sputum sample can increase data collection and
      differentiation between cohorts. Technicians in the current Study examined 12 slides
      containing approximately 600,000 cells. The average sputum sample pellet translates to a
      potential of approximately 3.5 million cells for evaluation. Evaluating the full sputum
      sample with the CyPath速 Assay can be accomplished through flow cytometry and would increase
      the capture and analysis of exfoliated cancer cells in the sample. In-house studies evaluated
      samples from five different cancer cell lines using flow cytometry. Preliminary results
      showed that cancer cell lines were detected with significant fluorescence apart from normal
      cell fluorescence. Refinements for using the flow cytometer include optimizing the
      liquid-based assay and sample analysis and focus on concentration, incubation time and
      optimal sample volume.
