    
      This is a two-part study. Part 1 compares the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD)
      and safety and tolerability of ASP8232 in healthy subjects with subjects with different
      degrees of renal impairment; Part 2 is a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the PK, PD and safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8232 in T2DM subjects with
      CKD.

      Part 1:

      Subjects reside in the clinic for 9 days, receiving a single oral dose of ASP8232 on Day 1
      under fasted conditions followed by a 168-hours blood and urine PK/PD sampling period.
      Subjects are discharged on Day 8 and return to the clinic on Days 10, 12, 14, 21, 28, and 42
      for the collection of blood PK/PD samples. An End of Study Visit (ESV) takes place after the
      last PK sample is collected on Day 56.

      Part 2:

      Subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -2 in order to collect PD urine samples before
      dosing begins on Day 1. Subjects receive multiple oral doses of ASP8232 or placebo for 28
      days. They are discharged on Day 8 and return to the clinic on Days 14 and 21, and Days 27 to
      29 for blood PK/PD and urine PD samples. An ESV takes place 14 to 28 days after the last
      PK/PD sample is collected.
