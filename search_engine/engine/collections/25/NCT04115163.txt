      I. To report overall response rate (ORR) for the optimized schedule according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report toxicity of the infusion schedule. II. To report disease control rate. III. To
      calculate relative dose intensity. IV. To report the overall survival (OS). V. To report
      progression free survival (PFS). VI. To correlate exploratory biomarkers with clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 17. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
