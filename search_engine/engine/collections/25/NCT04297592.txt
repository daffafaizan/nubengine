    
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether a 7-day course of an oral,
      prophylactic antibiotic following elective, primary total hip and knee arthroplasty
      effectively decreases the risk of periprosthetic joint infection or wound complications
      following surgery in a patient population that is high-risk for these complications. Patient
      with one or more of the following risk factors are considered high-risk for periprosthetic
      joint infection and/or wound complications: body mass index over 35kg/m^2, diagnosis of
      diabetes, chronic kidney disease, active tobacco user, nasal colonization of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus, or autoimmune/inflammatory disease.

      Study participants will be randomized to either a 7-day course of an oral, prophylactic
      antibiotic following surgery or no additional antibiotic. All other standard perioperative
      total joint arthroplasty care will remain the same for both groups, including perioperative
      intravenous antibiotics. Outcomes assessed will include surgical wound complications
      occurring within 90-day of surgery and periprosthetic joint infection occurring within 90-day
      and 1-year of surgery.
