    
      2X20 patients are randomised: Rocuronium-group (R-group) and Placebo-group (P-group).

      All patients receive standardised multimodal intravenous analgesia. After standardised
      induction of anasthesia and patient positioning, the patient is administered either placebo
      or rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion of either placebo or rocuronium 0.4
      mg/kg/h. 1 minute before reduction of the hip joint, the patient is administered either
      sugammadex (R-group) or placebo (P-group) for full reversal of the neuromuscular block.

      During the surgery, time points are recorded for: incision, start luxation of the joint,
      start reduction of the joint, start skin closure.

      The surgeon is blinded for patient allocation. At three moments (after luxation, just before
      reduction of the joint, and after assessment of joint mechanics), the surgeon is asked to
      appraise the surgical conditions on an analogue scale.

      Postoperative analgesic consumption and pain scores are recorded. VAS scores for knee pain
      and hip pain are assessed before surgery, at the moment of discharge from the post-anesthesia
      care unit (=D0), the morning after surgery (=D1), at D2, and at D7.
