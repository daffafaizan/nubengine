      Coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with postoperative cognitive decline, which has
      largely been attributed to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A large recent study by
      Newman et al demonstrated that the incidence of cognitive decline was 24% at six months after
      surgery, but it increased to 42% at five years. In the recently conducted Octopus Randomized
      Trial, cognitive decline at three months after surgery was present in 29% of the patients
      operated with CPB. In the patients operated without CPB, the incidence was 21%, i.e. only
      slightly better.

      Hypothesis:

      Improvement of cognitive outcome by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass will become more apparent
      five years after surgery, compared to three months after surgery.

      Study objectives:

      The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of coronary bypass surgery with
      and without cardiopulmonary bypass on cognitive and clinical outcome, five years after
      surgery.

      Methods:

      The 281 participants of the Octopus Study, who were operated on between March 1998 and August
      2000 and randomized to off-pump or on-pump coronary bypass surgery, will be invited for an
      additional assessment of their cognitive and clinical status and quality of life, five years
      after surgery. Patients will undergo a battery of ten neuropsychologic tests to determine
      their cognitive status. Clinical status will be assessed by an interview. Questionnaires will
      be used to measure quality of life.
