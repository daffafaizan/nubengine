      clinic in Dallas, TX between March 05, 2018 and April 06, 2018 were asked to complete the KSB
      questionnaire. No introduction of the KSB was given to students or faculty. For all patients
      that completed the KSB, a chart review of the first 4 weeks of care was completed to retrieve
      patient follow-up information and treatment provided, including: self-reported LBP on a
      10-point numerical rating scale (NRS), region of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), and
      active rehabilitation provided.
