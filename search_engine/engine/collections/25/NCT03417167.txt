      practice in 18 Rheumatology Unit throughout France. All the participants received a
      standardized training on US-guided synovial biopsies. For each biopsy, the indications,
      clinical presentation, procedure (length, tolerance), biopsy results (Pathology,
      bacteriology, etc ...) will be collected in a Clinical Research Form. The investigator will
      determine the number of cases where the synovial biopsy allows drawing a definite diagnosis.
