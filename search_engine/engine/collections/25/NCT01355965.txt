      These T cells are made using T cells obtained through apheresis and introducing the T cells
      to a temporary gene which will cause them to start making a new type of antibody that will
      attach mesothelin (this antibody is found on the surface of the cancer cells). In theory,
      once the modified T cells attach to mesothelin, the cells will be activated to stimulate the
      subject's own immune system to attack the mesothelin cells. This type of modified cell is
      called a T cell transduced transfected with chimeric anti-mesothelin immunoreceptor. Subjects
      will be enrolled serially with all subjects receiving 1xe8 to 1x1e9 modified CIR T cells
      every other day for 3 infusions. Each patient will be observed for 9 days for toxicity
      assessment prior to receiving a second cycle of modified CIR T cells every other day for 3
      infusions. The preceding subject must have completed the two-cycle regimen and been observed
      for toxicity through day 21 before the next subject can be enrolled.
