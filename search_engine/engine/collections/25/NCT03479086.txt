      Although alcohol use disorders are a leading cause of preventable death in Australia, their
      treatment is generally not evidence based. The medications currently approved for use in
      Australia for the management of alcohol dependence have limited efficacy, and existing
      research does not address the heterogeneity of treatment response.

      Targeted personalised medicine addresses this heterogeneity with better medicine selection
      for patients based on their genotype and clinical comorbidities.

      Members of our research team have recently demonstrated findings that support the use of
      topiramate (TOP) 200 mg/day to reduce heavy drinking and pharmacogenetic findings that
      implicate the GluK1 receptor subunit in the mechanism of these effects.

      This project will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate relative
      to the active control naltrexone (NTX) in heavy drinkers.

      Investigators hypothesise that topiramate treated patients will be better able to achieve a
      reduction in heavy drinking and predict that, based on prior research, that the effects would
      be moderated by a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2832407) in GRIK1.

      Research personnel will utilise an innovative prospective pharmacogenetic randomisation
      approach to a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial.

      Individuals will receive 12 weeks of titrated treatment with topiramate (200 mg/day) or
      naltrexone (50mg/day) and medical management.
