      Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx or matching
      placebo in a 53-week treatment period. The length of participation in the study is
      approximately 74 weeks, which includes an up to 8-week screening period, a 53-week treatment
      period, and a 13-week post-treatment evaluation period. Following the treatment period,
      eligible patients may have the option of enrolling in an open label extension study.
