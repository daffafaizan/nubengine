      knowledge about U=U on HIV testing uptake within men in the Klipfontein Mitchells Plain (KMP)
      district, a resource-limited, densely populated, high HIV disease burden area in Cape Town,
      through a cluster randomized trial design. The study will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1
      is a participatory, human-centered design framework will be used to develop U=U messages to
      increase HIV testing uptake in men. Phase 2 is a cluster randomized trial that will determine
      the effect of U=U messaging on HIV testing uptake. The primary outcome will be HIV testing
      uptake at a community-based mobile clinic. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of
      males tested who are HIV-positive (and newly HIV positive).

      Men in the intervention group will receive invitation cards for mobile HIV testing that
      contain U=U messages. Men in the control group will receive invitation cards for mobile HIV
      testing that contain standard messaging. Mobile clinic days (i.e. clusters of men receiving
      invitation cards on a single day) will be the unit of randomization. Recruitment will be
      conducted by trained mobile clinic staff at high foot-traffic sites in the KMP community.
      Recruitment efforts will be focus on young men in multiple mobile testing sites that are
      located in areas within KMP.
