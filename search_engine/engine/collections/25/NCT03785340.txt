      instability of tear film, which results in damage to the ocular surface and is correlated
      with symptoms of ocular discomfort.

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicenter phase 3 study
      in the United States conducted at approximately 25 centers. Upon meeting the eligibility
      criteria, enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 (test:control) fashion to
      receive either Brimonidine Nanoemulsion Eye Drops 0.20% investigational product (test) or
      ophthalmic buffered saline (placebo).
