    
      Aim 1:

      Feasibility of real time prehospital emergency ultrasound (PEU) transmission in a university
      affiliated preclinical emergency system.

      Aim 2:

      Identify obstacles for PEU transmission including a real time consultation of an ultrasound
      expert.

      Hypothesis:

      We expect that live streaming of emergency ultrasound images in order to allow a second
      opinion could improve diagnostics of life threatening conditions and help us to improve
      patients' safety by digital health. The use of PEU is feasible and safe.
