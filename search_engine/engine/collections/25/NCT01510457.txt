      receive the study drug and one will receive a placebo. You will be assigned a study group by
      chance using a process similar to the flip of a coin.

      At the first visit (week one) we will review and sign the informed consent, obtain your
      medical health history, and conduct a brief physical exam. You will also complete several
      questionnaires about your pain. You will be assessed for your eligibility to participate in
      this study. If you are eligible, we will conduct some physical and sensory tests and collect
      a blood sample. The physical tests include a stair climb, 6-minute treadmill test and a
      1-minute sit to stand test. The sensory tests allow us to understand your perception of
      various stimuli such as vibration, light touch, pinprick, heat, cold, hot pain, and cold
      pain. At the end of the first visit you will be given an electronic diary to record your pain
      throughout the study. We will also ask you to wear a device in a T-shirt, similar to an
      accelerometer, that will be used to record your sleep quality and physical activity for 2
      days.

      At the second (week two) and third visits (week nine) you will be asked to complete the same
      questionnaires, physical and sensory tests as during the first visit. You will also have to
      wear the t-shirt with the device for 2 days after each visit.
