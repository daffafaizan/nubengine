      their lifetime. Because it is so common and considered minor surgery, teaching students or
      interns the principles and techniques usually is left to the most junior of residents

      The optimal method for episiotomy and perineal trauma repair following childbirth remains
      open to debate and a great cause of concern to doctors, midwives, and the public

      Apparently, the ideal method for perineal repair should be quick, painless, easy to perform
      and preferably, without an increase in pain and dyspareunia during the puerperium

      This study will be commenced to question the advantage of using skin adhesive tape (Â®
      Steri-Strip) closure in wound pain and healing over the traditional running absorbable
      subcuticular suture technique in perineal repair after episiotomy in obese primiparous women.
