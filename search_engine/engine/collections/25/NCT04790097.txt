      weeks, and the extension of treatment may adversely affect the tumor cells death, the
      patient's well-being and treatment costs (prolonged hospitalization). In turn, escalating the
      dose may increase the toxicity of radiation therapy by increasing DNA damage in healthy brain
      tissue. Using of dual FET-PET images for treatment planning allow to reduce volumes of
      healthy tissue irradiated. Dose-intensification proposed in the study using simultaneous
      in-field boost allows the dose escalation without increasing the overall treatment time. All
      patient will be treated with moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (2.6 Gy per fraction)
      directed on PET positive volumes and conventional fractionation (60Gy in 30 fractions) on
      tumor margin.
