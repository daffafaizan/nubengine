    
      Aim:

        -  Measurement of the short term effect of post surgical/ post-operative mirror therapy
           concerning pain intensity of patients with upper or lower amputation in comparison to
           standard occupational/ physical therapy

        -  Hypothesis: patients in the intervention group (mirror therapy) suffer from significant
           less phantom limb pain and a lower pain frequency within a follow-up period of 4-8 weeks

      Methods:

        -  Design: multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial

        -  Participants: 70, 35 per intervention and con-trol group

        -  Intervention group: treatment sessions of 60 minutes with mirror therapy over a period
           of 14 days starting directly post surgical (24-48 hours)

        -  Control group: receive treatment session of 60 minutes with the same treatment frequency
           over a period of 14 days

        -  Measurement tools:

      Primary objectives

        -  pain intensity (11 point NRS, phantom limb in-tensity)

        -  pain frequency (amount of pain attacks) Secondary objectives

        -  diary

        -  daily assessment of mirror and physical thera-py sessions

        -  analysis:

        -  in significant differences between the groups a covariance analysis will be performed

        -  comparison of medians
