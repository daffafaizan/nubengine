      common liver disorder affecting 17-46% of adults and parallels the prevalence of Metabolic
      Syndrome (MetS) and its components which also increases the risk of more advanced disease
      both in adults and in children.

      Its pathogenesis is complex and multifactorial, mainly involving genetic, environmental and
      metabolic factors. New concepts are constantly appearing in the literature, promising new
      diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Further studies are needed to better characterize not only
      NAFLD development but overall NAFLD progression, in order to better identify NAFLD patients
      at higher risk of metabolic, cardiovascular and neoplastic complications. Pharmacological
      treatments aimed primarily at improving liver disease should generally be limited to those
      with biopsy-proven Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver Ô¨Åbrosis. Not much
      therapeutic options for NAFLD are accepted until today besides correction of obesity with
      hypocaloric diets and physical exercise and controlling hyperglycemia with diet, insulin, or
      oral hypoglycemic agents. Weight loss generally reduces hepatic steatosis.Essential
      phospholipid (EPL) as a nutritional supplement is one of the drugs under discussion with
      significant positive effects as antioxidative, antifibrotic effects and high biocompatibility
      on NAFLD.
