      Hemoptysis, mild or massive, is worrisome for both patients and physicians. The management is
      different depending on the causes, which are not well defined for the North American
      population. Despite the fact that this symptom is commonly reported in clinic, there are only
      a few studies published on this subject in the North-American population. Tuberculosis was a
      frequent cause of hemoptysis described in populations overseas, which seems less prevalent in
      the investigators center.

      Also, there are no known official guidelines regarding the investigation and management of
      hemoptysis. The investigators hypothesized that the use of modern technology in a North
      American population may result in different findings and provide a more accurate diagnostic
      approach.

      Therefore, the study compares the different etiologies of hemoptysis and investigation
      modalities used in patients presenting in a North-American tertiary center.

      METHOD:

      The investigators did a retrospective analysis of medical chart from patients with hemoptysis
      who visited the investigators center between 2005 and 2010. Each visit has been reviewed
      individually to describe the characteristics of patients, etiologies of hemoptysis and
      investigation modalities used. All-cause mortality at 2 years was also recorded.

      Descriptive statistical analyses will conducted on the data available.
