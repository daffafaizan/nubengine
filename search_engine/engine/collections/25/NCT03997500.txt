      delivery. It affects nearly 50-60% of patients without appropriately treat. Vasopressors has
      been highly recommended for routine prevention and/or treatment of post-spinal hypotension.
      Norepinephrine is new vasopressor that has been suggested as a potential alternative to
      phenylephrine and was recently introduced in obstetric anesthesia because of the minimal
      cardiac depressant effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the preventive effect
      of norepinephrine on post-spinal hypotension and the effect on inferior vena cava
      collapsibility index (IVC-CI).
