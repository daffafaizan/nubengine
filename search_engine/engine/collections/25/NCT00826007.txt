      glucose control is warranted during surgery as well as in the postoperative period.
      Consequently, measures to prevent and treat hyperglycemia - coupled with fasting status -
      places patients at considerable risk for perioperative hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
      Outpatient patient studies support that profound hypoglycemia can be deleterious and even
      fatal to patients.

      This descriptive study will utilize retrospective chart review to examine factors associated
      with hypoglycemia. Charts from 700 subjects who experienced blood glucose values less than 70
      mg/dl primarily in the preoperative and postanesthesia care units at William Beaumont
      Hospital-Royal Oak will be reviewed. Another 1600 charts will be screened for subsequent
      intraoperative hypoglycemia: 800 that had low normal preoperative glucose values and 800 that
      had high preoperative values (with likelihood of insulin therapy).

      Numerous factors believed to be associated with perioperative hypoglycemia will be analyzed
      including type and duration of diabetes, usual diabetes treatment regimen and alterations on
      day of surgery, self-reported usual fasting blood sugar range, duration of fasting, type of
      surgery and anesthesia, co-morbidities, and medications associated with hypoglycemia.

      Determining factors associated with perioperative hypoglycemia will improve prediction of
      which patients are at highest risk for hypoglycemia, enabling healthcare providers to
      institute more conservative insulin therapy when indicated, initiate early maintenance
      intravenous dextrose, and/ or perform more frequent glucose testing. Identifying associated
      factors will improve hypoglycemic predictions and interventions which should lead to safer,
      more effective care for patients with diabetes.
