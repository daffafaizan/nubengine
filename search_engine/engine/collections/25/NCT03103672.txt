    
      Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is a disturbing procedure for patients. Especially
      pain at the time of dilation can be a serious problem. These situations may be required local
      anesthetics, intravenous narcotics and sedatives or general anesthesia (1).

      TIVA with short-acting anesthetics such as propofol and remifentanil is characterized by
      hemodynamic stability and better compilation profile (2).

      The purpose of this study; To compare total intravenous anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia
      in patients undergoing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography under general anesthesia and
      Determine their advantages and disadvantages.
