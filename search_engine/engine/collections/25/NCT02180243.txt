      pain, sleep difficulties, and neurocognitive dysfunction (for example, concentration, memory,
      and attention problems). The most effective treatment approach for what appears to a broad
      spectrum problem found in GWVI may require complementary alternative medicine (CAM)
      approaches to enhance positive outcomes. Mindfulness meditation and acupuncture are each
      broad spectrum CAM treatments designed to target multiple biological systems simultaneously,
      and thus may be well suited for GWVI. Gulf War Health Education group will promote wellness
      and prevention by utilizing a proactive patient care model.
