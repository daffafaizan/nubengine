      neoplasms in the liver. A number of devices are now Food and Drug Administration cleared for
      this indication, and a growing body of literature supports this technique as a therapeutic
      option for patients with primary or metastatic hepatic malignancies. In vivo animal studies
      have also shown that this technique can also be used to treat infections. Insertion of the
      thermal energy delivery probe into an infected liver abscess destroys the bacteria while
      preserving surrounding tissue. Off-label use of RFA was successfully used to treat 22
      abscesses in 4 patients with chronic granulomatous disease who had inoperable liver
      abscesses. The proposed clinical trial will specifically evaluate the feasibility, safety,
      and to a lesser extent, efficacy of RFA to treat liver abscesses in subjects with previously
      diagnosed chronic granulomatous disease. This will be a non-randomized case study conducted
      at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health. One RFA device will be used. Ten
      subjects will be enrolled. If the method proves to be both feasible and safe, detailed
      analysis on efficacy will be performed. RFA eventually could play an important clinical role
      in patients with chronic granulomatous disease and liver abscesses that are not amenable to
      surgical management and are without other effective therapeutic options, or might otherwise
      be incompletely treated with surgical resection and debridement alone.
