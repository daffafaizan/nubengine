      and high mortality despite treatment. While mild cases are often successfully treated with
      conservative measures, such as fasting and aggressive intravenous fluid rehydration, severe
      cases may require admission to the intensive care unit or even surgery to deal with
      complications of the disease process. The diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis at an early
      phase remain a major challenge for clinicians.

      Therefore, many biologic markers have been studied in an effort to improve the diagnostic
      rate and determine the severity of acute pancreatitis but with disappointing results.
      Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), have recently been
      validated to stably exist in peripheral blood. Several publications showed that it may serve
      as potential markers for various diseases, including cancer and inflammation. Our current
      study evaluated whether and which kind of non-coding RNAs could serve as good markers for
      severe acute pancreatitis.
