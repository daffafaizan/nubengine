      to standard of care versus standard of care alone in healing chronic venous leg ulcers in
      subjects who had documented venous stasis and reflux. Subjects that were screened and met the
      major inclusion criteria received standardized treatment of 30 to 40 mmHg compression, moist
      wound healing dressings, and debridement for a two week run-in period. If their study ulcer
      did not decreased by greater than 30% they were eligible for randomization. The primary
      endpoint was wound area reduction after four (4) weeks of study treatment. The study was
      performed at 22 study centers. The study included two sub-studies: fluid and tissue analysis
      and a wound recidivism registry that are ongoing.
