      I. To precisely quantify the absorption, serum concentrations over time, and excretion
      patterns of soy isoflavones and metabolites in men consuming the two bread products to define
      relationships between dietary intake, isoflavone metabolism and the biological outcomes.

      II. To describe the safety as well as incidence and severity of toxicity in men consuming the
      control soy bread or beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread.

      III. To see if consumption of beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compared to control soy
      bread has a greater effect on blood hormonal patterns and biomarkers that favor anti-prostate
      cancer activity.

      IV. To see if beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compared to control soy bread improves
      hormonal patterns (lower insulin like growth factor-I, increased insulin like growth factor
      binding protein 3, lower androgens), reduce prostate specific antigen velocity, and lower
      circulating vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (closed to accrual as of
      02/14/2011).

      ARM I: Patients consume 2 slices of soy bread daily for 8 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients consume 2 slices of soy almond bread daily for 8 weeks.

      After a 2 week washout period, patients crossover to the alternate treatment arm.
