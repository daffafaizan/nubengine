      post-operative physical function status of patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty
      through patient and clinically based assessments. The KOOS score will collect data on the
      patient's physical function, stiffness and pain. The BERG balance, TUG, and TUDS tests will
      be used quantitatively to assess the patient's ability to conduct activities of daily living
      like walking for an extended period of time, standing from a seated position, and maintaining
      balance while performing a series of actions.
