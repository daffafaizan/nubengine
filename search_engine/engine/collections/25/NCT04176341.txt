      Opoid crisis has shown the limit of the WHO 3 step analgesic ladder. Multidisciplinary pain
      management programs, shared decision making and non pharmacological interventions targeting
      subject's empowerment are needed. Among these non pharmacological interventions, patients are
      increasingly turning to traditional and complementary medicines. Evidence about their safety
      and efficacy is hard to build. Thus our study aims to assess the feasibility of a systematic
      proposal for non pharmacological interventions targeting the subject's empowerment.
