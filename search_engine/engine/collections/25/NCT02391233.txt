    
      This randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 420 drug-involved Black women at 5
      probation sites located in communities in NYC heavily affected by HIV and STIs. Eligible
      women will be randomly assigned to: (1) WORTH consisting of an individual evidence-based
      Streamlined HIV Testing session followed by a 4-session group-based multimedia HIV
      intervention (WORTH) or (2) an individual Streamlined HIV Testing session alone (Streamlined
      HIV Testing), which will serve as the comparison condition. Both conditions will be delivered
      by Fortune providers at the 5 sites. Self-reported data on behavioral outcomes will be
      collected from participants via audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI). Primary STI
      outcomes will be measured via biological assay for infection by Neisseria gonorrhea,
      trichomonas, and Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common STIs found among women in NYC. Women
      who meet eligibility criteria will undergo a pre-intervention assessment. This assessment
      will last approximately 60 minutes, consisting of demographic information, history of
      criminal justice involvement, drug and alcohol use and dependence, sexual and drug-related
      HIV behaviors, HIV treatment and care, intimate partner violence, depression and
      posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) , service utilization, and social support. Research
      assistants (RAs) will schedule repeated assessments with participants that will take place at
      baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Each participant will be asked to
      obtain one vaginal specimen for STI testing by inserting a sterile Dacron-tipped swab about
      2.5 inches or as far as comfortable into the vagina, rotating it for 15 to 30 seconds, and
      removing it. The vaginal swabs are placed into separate specimen transport packaging.
