      hospitalizations, surgeries, and reduced cancer risk. However, previous studies have shown
      that 54-69% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients fail to heal ulcers after several weeks of
      treatment, and roughly half do not maintain remission at one year. The single most important
      factor in preventing severe medical consequences, like colon removal surgery or cancer, is
      treatment to completely heal the top layer of the intestine as quickly as possible. Healing
      is a complex process and the dysfunction observed in colitis can only be fully understood by
      comparison to healing in non-IBD patients.

      This is a prospective trial involving three groups of patients: 1) IBD patients with active
      disease, newly treated with anti-TNF therapy (biologic failure or na√Øve); 2) non-IBD patients
      with rheumatoid/psoriatic arthritis who are receiving anti-TNF therapy, and 3) healthy
      control patients. Biopsies will be collected at baseline during standard of care endoscopy
      and at a follow-up research endoscopy.

      This study will probe mechanisms of ulcer healing by analyzing gene expression patterns and
      mitochondrial function.
