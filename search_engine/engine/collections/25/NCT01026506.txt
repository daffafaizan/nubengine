      in asthma-models. Aim of this study was to determine possible beneficial effects of orally
      administered c9,t11-CLA in children and adolescents with allergic bronchial asthma.

      Thirty subjects (14 girls, 16 boys, age 6-18 years) were recruited from regular patients in
      the Clinic for Pediatric Allergology of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. Informed
      consent was obtained from all participants/parents. 29 subjects completed the study.

      The study was designed as a randomized and placebo-controlled study. After a 1-week run-in
      period to ascertain the current state of disease and categorization of allergic sensitization
      by RAST, the participants were randomized and evenly distributed to receive either 3 g/d of
      an esterified CLA preparation free of t10,c12-CLA (75% c9,t11-CLA, 87% purity) or 3 g/d of a
      placebo oil mixed in 100 g portions of milk fat-free yoghurt for 12 weeks. The yoghurt was
      freshly prepared and distributed in frequent intervals.

      At the beginning and at the end of the study, lung function parameters were assessed by whole
      body plethysmography, and venous blood and 24h-urine samples were collected for further
      analyses. Throughout the entire study, the participants daily recorded their peak-flow data
      and kept protocol about their symptoms and drug usage.
