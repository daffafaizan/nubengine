      arrival. Thus, high suspicion must be held, and literally every MLKI must be treated
      immediately as a true knee dislocation until proven otherwise. Failing to recognize the whole
      injury pattern around the knee can lead to disastrous consequences. Thus, an initial
      interdisciplinary systematic approach obtains top priority. Even though diagnostic image
      instruments become more and more reliable, physical examination still remains a fundamental
      element in any accurate assessment of knee dislocation. Several authors describe their own
      experiences and related treatment strategies of knee dislocation. But although a large number
      of studies about knee dislocation and MLKI do exist in medical databases, the complexity of
      this injury, the inhomogeneity of literature, and the persevering controversies in their
      treatment still make it difficult to draw reliable general conclusions.

      Although important advances have been made in knee arthroscopy, ligament reconstruction and
      patient management, recommendations are not always applicable in settings with limited
      resources available. Challenges encountered in these situations include long delays to
      presentation, as well as the lack of sufficient access to operating room time, arthroscopic
      equipment, newer fixation devices, and allografts. Patients are often uninsured; work
      informally as manual laborers and their access to physiotherapy is very limited.

      The purpose of this study is to analyse our institution's experience with multi-ligament knee
      injuries via the following items prevalence, detailed initial management at emergency
      department, types of these injuries, rationale of definitive treatment, rehabilitation
      protocol, postoperative complications and functional outcomes.
