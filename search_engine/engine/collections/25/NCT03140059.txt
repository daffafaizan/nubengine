      in residual periodontal pockets. A method of treatment to these sites would be the surgical
      therapy, because it allows access to root surfaces, making possible a better decontamination.
      However, the surgical approach may bring some negative points, as more discomfort and
      postoperative morbidity, increased transoperatory risk and increased risk of contamination.
      Thus, finding other alternatives to residual pockets treatment, antimicrobial photodynamic
      therapy (aPDT) was recently proposed. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to compare the
      approach of repeated applications of APDT versus surgical therapy for the treatment of
      residual pockets in generalized agressive periodontitis.
