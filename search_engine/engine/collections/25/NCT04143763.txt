      reporting at least one depressive symptom in Hong Kong. However, caregivers can experience
      difficulties in accessing and fully utilising existing services due to the varying types of
      care needs and its intensities amongst stroke survivors.

      Ecological momentary intervention (EMI) as an innovative and personalised intervention has
      shown great potential in supporting psychological well-being; yet, there are no studies on
      using EMI for the caregivers' psychological support. The proposed trial aims to reduce stroke
      caregivers' psychological distress by delivering EMI through instant messaging applications
      to provide personalised and real-time support led by healthcare professionals.

      Stroke caregivers screened by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) with scores ranging from
      5 to 19 will be recruited from multiple sites including community centres, rehabilitation
      centres and outpatient clinics in public hospitals in Hong Kong, and individually randomised
      into the intervention group (n=20) or control group (n=20). The intervention group will
      receive the personalised instant messages for 4 weeks. The control group will receive general
      health information and regular messages reminding them to participate in follow-up surveys.
      The primary outcome will be the score of PHQ-9 at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include
      anxiety, perceived stress, and caregiver burden.
