    
      Double-masked, randomized, crossover trial. In random order, patients will be treated with
      spironolactone 25 mg o.d. and matched placebo for 28 days.

      On the last day of treatment, GFR will be determined twice on the same day: first without
      clonidine and secondly after injection of clonidine (clonidine induces a transient reduction
      in blood pressure, with no influence on renal plasma flow and GFR), in order to evaluate the
      effect of antihypertensive treatment with spironolactone on renal autoregulation of GFR.

      The study will be preceded by a wash-out period of 1 month for patients receiving
      antihypertensive medication. Patients will be instructed to measure blood pressure twice
      daily, three days a week during this period. If, during the washout period, blood pressure
      exceeds 170/105 mm Hg or persistent edemas develop, treatment with long-acting loop diuretics
      will be initiated and continued throughout the rest of the study. If blood pressure despite
      diuretic treatment still exceeds 170 mm Hg systolic and/or 105 mm Hg diastolic, the patient
      will be excluded from the study and previous/appropriate antihypertensive treatment will be
      restarted.
