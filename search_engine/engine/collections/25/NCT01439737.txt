      serum and urine specimens in adult asthmatics; 2. Correlation between metabolomic profiles of
      these specimens with the severity and control of asthma; 3. Comparing metabolomic profiles in
      asthmatics with different phenotypes and endotypes; 4.Comparing metabolomic profiles obtained
      from asthmatics during stable and acute exacerbation periods; 5. Comparing metabolomic
      profiles in asthmatics before and after inhaled corticosteroid therapy.
