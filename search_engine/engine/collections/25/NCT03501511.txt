      refraining from all food, drink, tablets and injections(vitamins & fluids) between sunrise
      and sunset; a period which varies by geographical location and season. Although exempt, many
      diabetics refuse to take this concession as they feel psychologically & spiritually inclined
      to fast along with other Muslims.

      Fasting at Ramadan carries a very high risk for people with T1DM. This risk is particularly
      exacerbated in poorly controlled patients and those with limited access to medical care,
      hypoglycemic unawareness, unstable glycemic control, or recurrent hospitalizations.

      Structured education interventions have been endorsed by the National Institute for Health
      and Clinical Excellence as important in empowering patients to improve their jour¬ney with
      diabetes. In a large observational study, patients who fasted during Ramadan without
      attending a structured education session had a fourfold increase in hypoglycae¬mic events,
      whereas those who attended an education pro¬gramme focusing on Ramadan had a significant
      decrease in hypoglycemic events.

      Conversation Map aims to help people with diabetes experience a healthier Ramadan. The
      interactive Map covers a number of topics including understanding the risks and complications
      of fasting and the importance of creating a diabetes management plan during this time.
