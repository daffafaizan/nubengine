      control group and the triamcinolone treatment group. The cross-over design will apply only in
      the control group when patients are not responding to EGD dilations alone (defined as no
      sustained improvement in baseline dysphagia) and they will be allowed to cross-over to the
      triamcinolone group and undergo 3 successive EGDs with triamcinolone injection.

      Typically, triamcinolone (steroid) injection is given as a standard of care after several
      esophageal dilations are performed and failed to improve the condition. Therefore,
      researchers want to find out if adding triamcinolone (steroid) injection at the participant's
      initial EGD procedure will improve the opening of their esophagus and decrease the need for
      repeat dilations.
