    
      Prospective cohort study that will be conducted in Orthopedic theaters of Kasr Al-Ainy
      hospital, Cairo University.

      Upon arrival to the operating room, routine monitors (ECG, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive
      blood pressure monitor) will be applied, intravenous line will be secured and routine
      premedications (ranitidine 50 mg and ondansteron 4mg) will be administrated.

      Then inferior vena cava ultrasonography will be performed. Maximum and minimum IVC diameters
      over a single respiratory cycle will be measured using built-in software. The CI will be
      calculated as: CI = (dIVCmax - dIVCmin)/dIVCmax , it will be expressed as a percentage.

      Plethysmographic variability index and a perfusion index readings will be taken (preinduction
      three readings on one-minute interval- 1-minute postinduction reading - 2-minute
      postinduction reading - preintubation reading - one-minute postintubation reading until skin
      incision).

      Induction of anaesthesia will be achieved using propofol (2 mg/Kg) and atracurium (0.5
      mg/Kg). Endotracheal tube will be inserted after 3 minutes of mask ventilation. Patients who
      will experience prolonged airway instrumentation due to a difficult intubation will be
      excluded from further data analysis because of excessive stimulation.

      Anaesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane (1-1.5%) and atracurium 10 mg increments every
      20 minutes. Ringer lactate solution will be infused at a rate of 2 mL/Kg/hour.

      Any episode of hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure < 80% of the baseline reading)
      will be managed by 5mcg norepinephrine.
