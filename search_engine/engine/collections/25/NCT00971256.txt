      list of morbidity due to cancer, bladder cancer ranks number nine, yet is number one in
      dollars spent per cancer diagnosis and treatment.

      Guidelines include cystoscopy and cytology/urine study every three months for the first 2
      years and then every 6 months for the next 2 years, with the cycle being reset with every
      recurrence.

      Urine cytology currently considered the gold standard for urine tests has many pros and cons.
      The points that keep it in use include: its high specificity, the ability to detect upper
      tract occurrence, and the ability to monitor the small population of those with bladder
      cancer whose disease becomes more aggressive. Opponents to cytology refer to the fact that is
      has low sensitivity that it is fairly subjective and that newer markers in comparison are
      improved.

      There are multiple journal article which document the performance of cytology and the newer
      markers, the new markers versus cytology and then the performance of cytology in tandem with
      these new markers. The bottom line that is often overlooked is that cytology is expensive and
      each of the newer markers are at least as expensive as cytology. With the fact that a person
      who is diagnosed with non invasive bladder cancer can have up to 13 urine cytology's in 5
      years without any recurrence we believe newer rational recommendations need to be made in
      regards to urine studies and bladder cancer follow up.
