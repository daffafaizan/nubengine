      common, complex diseases using virtual reality technology.

      Men and women between the ages of 25 and 40 who have access to the Internet and were born and
      raised in the United States may be eligible for this study. Participants will be recruited
      from the Washington D.C. area.

      Study subjects complete two phases. The first phase is to complete an online questionnaire
      about their heath-related background, family health history, cancer risk perceptions, and
      demographic information using a secure survey website. The second phase involves interacting
      with a virtual doctor in a virtual environment clinical scenario, followed by completion of a
      second questionnaire. While in the virtual environment, participants wear a head-mounted
      video unit that allows them to see elements of the environment. The activities in the virtual
      environment take about 15 minutes. The total time for the study is about 60 minutes.
