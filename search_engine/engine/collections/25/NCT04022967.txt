      (viral load < detection limit of the technique used) for at least two years: to assess the
      non-inferiority of a strategy consisting of switching to a dual maintenance therapy (DTG+ 3TC
      or ATV/r+3TC), comparing to WHO standard first line regimen (TDF+3TC+EFV), in terms of
      virological success at 96 weeks, in Cameroon, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

      This is a trial including two strategies (dual maintenance therapy and triple reference
      therapy) and three ART regimens (DTG+3TC and ATV/r+3TC used in the maintenance strategy and
      TDF+3TC+EFV used in the reference strategy).

      The primary analysis will compare the two strategies. Secondary analyses will compare the
      three ART regimens two by two.

      In order to make these secondary analyses possible, participants will be randomly assigned,
      at inclusion, to each of the three ART regimens (arm 1: DTG+3TC; arm 2: ATV/r+3TC; arm 3:
      TDF+3TC+EFV). The maintenance strategy will include arm 1 and 2. The reference strategy will
      include arm 3

      Number of participants : 600 (200 in each ART regimen, ie 400 in the dual maintenance therapy
      strategy and 200 in the triple therapy reference strategy)

      The primary endpoint is treatment success, as defined by using the FDA snapshot algorithm :
      patients who are still continuing the assigned strategy and whose last available plasma HIV-1
      RNA in the the window analysis (90 to 102 weeks) is <50 copies/ml at the end of the window
      analysis (90 to 102 weeks)
