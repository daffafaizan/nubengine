      AL amyloidosis who have not received prior therapy. Approximately 40 subjects will receive
      primary therapy with daratumumab. Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a
      Treatment Phase, a Post-Treatment Observation Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up Phase.

      A safety run-in will be conducted in 6 subjects treated with daratumumab for at least 1 cycle
      to establish safety of daratumumab in patients with stage 3B AL amyloidosis. Dosing of these
      6 subjects will be staggered so that no subject will receive their first dose sooner than 48
      hours after the previously enrolled subject. Safety evaluation will be performed by a Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after at least 1 cycle is completed for all 6 subjects. If no
      safety signal is observed, the enrollment of the rest of the patients will begin.

      Subjects will receive daratumumab IV at a dose of 16 mg/kg. All treatment cycles are 4 weeks
      (28 days) in length. Subjects will receive daratumumab until disease progression [according
      to the Major Organ Deterioration Progression-Free Survival (MOD-PFS) criteria], unacceptable
      toxicity, or start of subsequent therapy, for a maximum of 2 years in total.

      Subjects who will not achieve either a hematologic VGPR or better, OR a hematologic PR with a
      major organ response by Cycle 4 Day 1 may receive at Investigator's discretion, in addition
      to daratumumab, bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 weekly for a maximum of 6 cycles) and low dose
      dexamethasone (total maximum weekly dose of 20mg).
