      I. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is a 50% or more reduction
      from the baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
      criteria (PCWG2).

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of CRPC patients
      treated with PDMX1001/niclosamide (niclosamide), abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) and
      prednisone.

      III. To assess the toxicity of PDMX1001/niclosamide, abiraterone and prednisone given in
      combination.

      IV. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the analysis
      of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once a day (QD), niclosamide PO twice a day
      (BID) and prednisone PO BID. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
