    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the antitumor activity of elesclomol (elesclomol sodium) and paclitaxel in
      patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
      primarily through the frequency of objective tumor responses.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of elesclomol and paclitaxel in this
      cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      elesclomol and paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and elesclomol sodium IV over 1
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients who are currently on treatment must not be dosed with elesclomol sodium after
      12/31/2015. All other study procedures, with the exception of elesclomol sodium
      administration and paclitaxel administration, should continue in accordance with protocol
      requirements. Any treatment given after 12/31/2015, including continuation of paclitaxel,
      will be considered off study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
