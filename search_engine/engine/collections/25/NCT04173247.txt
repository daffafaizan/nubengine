    
      Primary Objective(s)

      â€¢ To determine the feasibility of the use of KeraStat Cream in patients receiving
      radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To determine the tolerability of KeraStat Cream in patients receiving radiotherapy for
           head and neck cancer compared to routine skin care.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of KeraStat Cream in reducing the severity of EASR in
           patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, compared to routine skin care.
           This will be performed by evaluating:

        -  Objective evaluation of EASR using the CTCAE Version 5.0 scale of radiation dermatitis,

        -  Patient-reported outcomes of radiation dermatitis using the PRO-CTCAE version 1.0, and

        -  Dermatologic-specific quality of life assessment

        -  To estimate the amount of KeraStat Cream used per patient and coverage on the skin.
