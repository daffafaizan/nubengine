      at our institution during the last year with standard open or laparoscopic approach with
      patients operated with the new technique. Patients in the control arm will be patients
      operated prior to the commencement of the new technique or patients not eligible or possible
      to include in the study.

      It is possible to obtain a macroscopically and microscopically adequate specimen after a
      combined approach with laparoscopic and transanal TME compared to open or laparoscopic
      conventional TME.
