    
      NutriGen project specific aim 1. Establishing a genetic signature model, involved in the
      donation of methyl groups and unsaturated omega-6/3 fatty acids metabolism, with a high
      predictive value for classification of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in obese subjects.

        1. Establishing a genetic signature model in obese adults with dyslipidemia.

        2. Establishing a genetic signature model in obese children with insulin resistance. c.
           Establishing a correlation between blood/plasma concentrations of the relevant
           metabolites, genetic signatures and dyslipidemia profile of adults, and respectively a
           profile for insulin resistance in obese children.

      NutriGen project specific aim 2. Determining the efficacy of a dietary food specific
      treatment, which is also correlated with a genetic signature (nutrigenomics), based on the
      correlations defined in objective 1:

        1. Implementation of a treatment with dietary foods (for adults), in the presence/absence
           of other already prescribed treatments;

        2. Implementation of a treatment with dietary foods (for children), in the presence/absence
           of other already prescribed treatments.
