      radiation in the up-front management of spinal metastases, in the re-irradiation scenario,
      and in the post-operative setting. This study proposes to treat patients with a uniform spine
      SBRT approach, and collect prospective outcome data as a basis for future randomized trial
      design. Preliminary evaluation of our technique has yielded acceptable accuracy in treatment
      delivery as compared to the literature, and our practice follows current standards in major
      university hospitals performing this technique. Furthermore, preliminary data also suggest
      efficacy and safety for patients treated with SBRT for spinal metastases in a previously
      radiated field. However, well defined prospective outcomes are lacking in this patient group.

      There a 3 cohorts for this study each with a target accrual of 30 patients. Cohort 1:
      patients with spinal metastases and no prior radiation.

      Cohort 2: patients with spinal metastases with a history of previous radiation to the
      affected spinal segment.

      Cohort 3: post-operative patients with spinal metastases with or without a history of
      previous radiation to the affected spinal segment.

      All patients will be treated with either 20-24 Gy in one fraction (recommended) or 20-24 Gy
      in two fractions, or 20-24 Gy in three fractions. There is also and optional imaging
      component of this study.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of spine SBRT in select groups of
      patients using image based and symptom based local control criteria
