      Chinese American cancer patients and survivors. For 20 minutes each week over four weeks,
      participants choose to write or voice-record their thoughts about cancer by following
      specific prompts designed to help them process their cancer experiences. During the last week
      of this reflection exercise, participants write or voice-record an anonymous letter to
      another Chinese cancer patient by sharing their cancer experience and providing advice and
      encouragement. Health outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1-month, and 3-month follow-ups. A
      subset of the participants will be invited to share their experiences with the study through
      qualitative interviews after the last writing/voice-recording session. This research study
      provides an opportunity for Chinese American cancer patients and survivors to express their
      feelings without the fear of burdening others, and give them an opportunity to help others by
      sharing their cancer experiences.
