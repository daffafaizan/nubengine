      study.

      The before period will be used as control group in which ward rounds and nurse handovers will
      be observed by the investigators for two months. Then TraceBook will be introduced and
      clinicians, ICU doctors and nurses, will be able to use checklists of TraceBook for ward
      rounds, their shifts and handovers in which they will be observed for two months. The goal is
      at least 120 observations per period.

      Endpoints The primary outcome is the percentage of items that were checked per ward rounds
      and nurse handovers during the before and the after implementation period. Secondary outcomes
      will be clinical outcomes of admitted patients, pharmacist specific outcomes, specific
      checkable item related outcomes, and user experience and acceptance scores.

      Hypothesis TraceBook, with the use of digital dynamic checklists, improves compliance to care
      processes on the intensive care with a high user acceptance score.
