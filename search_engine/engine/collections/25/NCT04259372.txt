      hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a dismal prognosis. Infusion of donor T
      cells can induce graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, indicating the importance of intact T
      cell function for leukemia control. Recent studies have shown the importance of metabolic
      fitness for an effective T cell response.

      In this study we have analyzed the T cell metabolism and immune phenotype in AML patients at
      different time points before and after allo-HCT.
