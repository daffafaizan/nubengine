      diagnosed secondary AML comes from a single randomized Phase II study which observed
      significant improvement in survival in a 52-patient subset of patients with secondary AML. A
      Phase III confirmatory study has recently completed accrual and final results are not
      expected until mid-2016. Therefore, the sponsor has chosen to make CPX-351 available to
      secondary AML patients through this expanded access protocol until commercialization of
      CPX-351 or more information about the clinical utility is known.

      This study is a Phase IV multicenter, single-arm open-label Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) of
      CPX-351 in patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia who are suitable for treatment with
      intensive chemotherapy. Patients may receive up to two inductions and four consolidation
      courses. Patients will be monitored for safety (early deaths, serious adverse events, grade 3
      and 4 adverse events, etc.) while on the study and for SAEs for 30 days after the last dose
      of CPX-351. Study enrollment will be available through commercialization of CPX-351.
