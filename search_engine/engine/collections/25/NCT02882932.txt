      peritonitis. The investigators objectives are to present the potential clinical impact of
      intraperitoneal lavage with solutions for early recovery of the patient by reducing the
      infection rate.

      Methods - A double-blind random clinical trial was performed in 240 patients diagnosed as
      peritonitis at MMIMSR, Mullana, Ambala, India, from December 2014 - November 2015. Subjects
      were divided into 2 groups, i.e. 120 patients in the study group and 120 cases in the control
      group. Both the groups underwent peritoneal lavage ; the study group received SOS where as
      control group underwent normal saline lavage. The effectiveness of both the solutions were
      compared.
