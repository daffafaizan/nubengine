      United Sates. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. Modafinil is a glutamate-enhancing agent. D-amphetamine is a central
      nervous system stimulant that is approved to treat individuals with narcolepsy and attention
      deficit disorder. Both modafinil and d-amphetamine may be effective treatments for cocaine
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of modafinil and
      d-amphetamine, alone and in combination, in treating cocaine dependent individuals.

      This study will last 16 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups:
      1) 60 mg dose of d-amphetamine; 2) 400 mg dose of modafinil; 3) 30 mg dose of d-amphetamine
      combined with 200 mg dose of modafinil; and 4) placebo. All participants will receive 200 mg
      of modafinil over 4 days.
