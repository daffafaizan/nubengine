      test the efficacy of the topical gel formulation with three differing concentrations of
      acetaminophen (APAP) for itch relief. To detect medium effects of the treatments with a given
      Î± of 0.5 and an error probability of 0.05, with a power of 0.95, the number of participants
      needed is 36 (10 within post hoc pairwise comparisons).
