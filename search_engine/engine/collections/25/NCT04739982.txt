      in delivering behavioral therapy to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). GuessWhat
      is a mobile application (available for free for iOS and Android) which contains a suite of
      games: pro-social charades, emotion guessing, and quiz. Participant families will use their
      personal smartphones to download the app and play it with their child according to a
      predetermined regimen. The study will enroll parents who are at least 18 years old and have a
      child between 3 and 12 years old with a formal ASD diagnosis. Parents will be asked to
      complete two clinical outcome measure questionnaires immediately prior to and up to 1 week
      after playing GuessWhat with their child 3 times per week for 4 weeks.
