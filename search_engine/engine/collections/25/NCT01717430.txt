      steroid injections (ESIs) and sacroiliac joint injections (SIJIs), may have adverse metabolic
      and endocrine effects, including suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
      (HPAA), hypertension, weight gain, and hyperglycemia. Based on sparse data on these adverse
      effects following repeated, long-term CIs, current guidelines suggest a maximum frequency of
      four to six injections annually, even though patients may benefit from more frequent
      treatments.

      This prospective cohort study will follow first-time or repeat ESI or SIJI patients receiving
      injections with 0.5 mL bupivacaine 0.25% and 15 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate at a
      maximum frequency of once every six weeks in order to:

        -  determine the frequency and duration of HPAA suppression;

        -  determine the incidence and predictors of prolonged (â‰¥ 3 weeks) HPAA suppression;

        -  determine the baseline incidence and predictors of HPAA suppression in chronic pain
           patients presenting for their first CI; and

        -  determine the effect of CIs on body weight, resting blood pressure, and glycemic control
           over a six-month period.
