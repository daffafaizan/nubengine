    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double masked, multicenter, Phase III study.
      Patients will be stratified by study center and randomized to Visudyne therapy or placebo in
      a 2:1 ratio, respectively. Patients will receive either a single intravenous dose of Visudyne
      or placebo followed 15 minutes after the start of the infusion by light application.
      Follow-up visits will occur every three months (+/- 2 weeks) for the duration of the study.
      Re-treatment may be administered every three months (through the Month 21 visit) if evidence
      of CNV leakage is detected by fluorescein angiography (as judged by the Investigator).

      At baseline and at each follow-up visit, patients will undergo the following assessments:
      ophthalmic examination, best-corrected visual acuity, color fundus photography, and
      fluorescein angiography. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography will be conducted at baseline,
      Month 12, and Month 24. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be done at baseline, Month 3,
      Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be assessed
      throughout the study.
