      catheter into the uterus to compress the bleeding vessels. When this mode of therapy has been
      chosen by the attending physician the patient will be randomized to either the room
      temperature arm (control) or the cold arm (study). The balloon catheter is placed through the
      vagina into the uterus and inflated using normal saline; room temperature for the control
      group and approximately 32 degrees F for the study group. Traction is placed on the catheter
      to tamponade the vessels in the lower uterine segment. Blood from the uterus passes through a
      central lumen of the balloon and will be collected and measured. Total measured blood loss
      for each group will be compared.
