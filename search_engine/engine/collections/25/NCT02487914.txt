      Lidocaine, interferential current and Lidocaine iontophoresis using interferential current.
      Pressure threshold was investigated with a Pesula. Pesula is a pen-like scaled mechanical
      device that measures the skin pressure threshold. Pesula was pressed to the skin and pressure
      threshold was measured in mm. Pain and tactile thresholds were investigated using an
      electrical stimulator.The intensity was gradually increased to the extent that the
      participant reported a tingling sensation. The displayed intensity was considered as the
      tactile sense threshold. Then, the intensity was increased to the extent to be intolerable
      for the participant and this intensity was considered as the maximum pain threshold. The
      thresholds were recorded in milliampere.

      Lidocaine iontophoresis using interferential current can increase perception threshold of
      pain, and pressure sense more significantly in comparison to the application of Lidocaine and
      interferential current alone.
