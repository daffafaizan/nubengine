      discharge is challenging. Evidence shows that delay in HF symptom recognition and poor
      self-management are associated with unplanned emergency department visits and
      rehospitalizations. Clinical trials aimed at preventing rehospitalization using
      telemonitoring have shown limited utility suggesting that monitoring physical changes alone
      may not be sufficient to maintain stability of HF patients at home. A recent cancer study has
      demonstrated that patients receiving cancer chemotherapy achieved a 40% reduction in symptoms
      using Symptom Care at Home (SCH), a computer-interface telephonic interactive voice response
      system pairing patient-reported symptoms with automated real-time, self-management coaching.
      While a few HF studies have used interventions that monitored symptoms, no studies have
      tested a system that monitors and provides real-time, self-management coaching tailored to
      specific patient-reported outcomes(PRO). The objective of this study is to pilot an adaption
      of the SCH system to HF resulting in preliminary data to support a fully-powered randomized
      control trial to test an adapted SCH-HF system that could be widely disseminated. Specific
      Aims over two-parts are: Aim 1] Tailor the real-time self-management coaching system to
      integrate HF symptom monitoring and self-management coaching into the SCH-HF system; and Aim
      2] Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the SCH-HF system. This study is significant
      because it expands our understanding into HF symptom monitoring and management using PRO in
      the home setting. The proposal is innovative because it integrates HF clinician and patient
      perspectives to develop a daily home monitoring and real-time self-management coaching
      system.
