      blood transfusion requirements during spinal posterior fusion in adolescents with scoliosis.
      TXA acts mainly by inhibit the plasminogen activator. Desmopressin (DDAVP ,D) can inhibit the
      fibrinolytic activity by inducing the release of von Willebrand factor from the endothelial
      cells. But at the same time, it releases tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which may
      cripple its hemostatic effect.

      The investigators designed a a randomized double-blind clinical combining TXA with DDAVP in
      scoliosis correction surgery to observe if the blood loss and the transfusion need would be
      reduced or not.
