    
      Up to 40 potential candidates will be pre-screened to identify eligible men and women ages 65
      years and over with a clinical diagnosis of early AD on a stable dose of cholinesterase
      inhibitors for at least 3 months (for example, Aricept).

      Eligible participants will undergo laboratory assessments of blood and urine, receive study
      medications over a twelve week period, and complete pre- and post-treatment testing
      including: an MRI for digital imaging of the brain; lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal
      fluid; memory and thinking assessments; quality of life questionnaires; and tests of walking,
      balance and strength, all of which will be done for research purposes only.

      Participants must be accompanied by a Legally Authorized Representative and have no travel
      plans for 4-5 months that would interfere with study visits.
