    
      This is a two arm randomized controlled trial that incorporates pragmatic features, an
      adaptable intervention, patient choice, and remote monitoring of fluid intake through a
      "smart" water bottle. The study period is 24 months and will enroll approximately 1642
      participants. Randomization will be stratified within a study site by age (adult vs.
      adolescent) and first time vs. recurrent stone former.

      Intervention and control arm study participants will receive a smart water bottle that
      records daily fluid consumption, usual care including guideline-based recommendations of
      adequate fluid intake to decrease kidney stone recurrence, and periodic 24 hour urine
      collections, imaging (low-dose CT scan or ultrasound) and follow-up questionnaires.
