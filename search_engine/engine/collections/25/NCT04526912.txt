    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study intended to assess the potential
      benefit and evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of
      VIB7734 in hospitalized patients with documented infection of severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) with pulmonary involvement. Efficacy will be assessed
      during the 28 days following a single administration of VIB7734. Safety will be assessed for
      10 weeks following dosing. The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and
      immunogenicity of VIB7734 in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections will also be
      assessed.
