      prolonged hospitalization may increase the ratio of respiratory complications. But, there are
      no information in the literature about pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and
      peripheral muscle strength in patients with burn injury. Especially, when the patients are
      discharged from the hospital, it is not known whether the patients are at the same level in
      terms of pulmonary functions respiratory muscle strength and peripheral muscle strength with
      healthy individuals. This study will assess pulmonary functions respiratory muscle strength
      and peripheral muscle strength in patients with burn injury compared to healthy subjects.
