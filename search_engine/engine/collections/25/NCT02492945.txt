      40 patients that meet the inclusion criteria on screening test are assigned to one of two
      groups(PDRN group or 15% dextrose active control group) by randomization. They take the three
      times of the ultrasonography-guided injections for four weeks(0,2,4 weeks) under
      double-blind. PDRN group take ultrasonography-guided 3ml PDRN injection for the lesion( tear
      or tendinosis about extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum communis, radial
      collateral ligament ) of lateral epicondylitis for 4 weeks. Active control group takes the
      15% dextrose solution, 3ml for same procedure. The main outcome variables are measured at 0,
      6 weeks and 3 months after 1st injection as starting point and compared differences from
      baseline to 3 month as primary end points within each group or between both group.
      Polydeoxyribonucleotide is verified whether it has the safety and effect on lateral
      epicondylitis with comparing to prolotherapy.
