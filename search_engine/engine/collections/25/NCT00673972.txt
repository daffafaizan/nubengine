      and with enormous social cost. Previous studies have revealed that functional dyspepsia is
      not a homogenous disease but a heterogenous symptom complex. Because of heterogeneity in
      etiology and pathogenesis, no specific treatment is appropriate for all patients with
      functional dyspepsia. Currently available treatments demonstrated efficacy only in subsets of
      patients.

      Appropriate subgrouping of functional dyspepsia, which categorizes more homogenous patients
      into the same group, will correlate better with specific etiologic factors and pathogenetic
      mechanisms. Consequently patients may have appropriate specific treatment based on more
      directed pathologenesis and subgrouping. To this end, American Gastroenterology Association
      launched new edition of clinical guide for functional gastrointestinal disorder, the Rome III
      in May 2006. The new diagnostic criteria of Rome III de-emphasized functional dyspepsia as an
      entity and recommended sub-classification into two conditions: postprandial distress syndrome
      and epigastric pain syndrome. However whether this new diagnostic criteria and systems are
      effective and clinically relevant remains unknown.

      Aims:

      We aim to compare postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome in demographics
      psychological features, infection of Helicobacter pylori, gastric emptying and therapeutic
      response to lansoprazole.
