      smart-phone-based system compared to sensor augmented therapy in an outpatient setting.
      Twelve study subjects with type 1 diabetes, six each at UVa and Stanford University, who have
      experience with insulin pump use at two clinical sites will be recruited. The first six
      subjects recruited will be aged 15-18 years and this will follow with recruitment of six
      subjects aged 10-14 years. This study is designed to mimic the protocol at camp and will
      include a period of light exercise after breakfast and moderate intensity physical activity
      after lunch, with group activities such as soccer and volleyball. The duration of the
      Outpatient in Residence Study will be 72 hours. The data will be reviewed by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) before proceeding to camp studies.

      The camp study will recruit 48 subjects, with type 1 diabetes who have experience with
      insulin pump therapy. Initial studies will be conducted at a camp with older participants
      aged 15-35 years, with at least 5 of the campers between 15-18 years old. These studies will
      be reviewed by the DSMB and, if safe, we will recruit additional children aged 10-14 years of
      age. The duration of the Diabetes Camp Studies will be up to 7 days/6 nights.
