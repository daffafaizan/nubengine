      major active drug is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most common route of use is through
      inhalation of the combustion products of the dried, buds/flowers from the female plant either
      rolled in paper (joint) or burned through a screen in a dry or water filled pipe (bong).
      Increasingly THC is consumed.

      The side effects of the inhalation of burned leaves are controversial. The purpose of this
      proposal is to establish a prospective cohort of heavy marijuana users to evaluate positive
      and negative long term medical effects of marijuana use. As marijuana has also been reported
      for use to help treat insomnia, a sub-study will focus on how marijuana is used for sleep
      disorders and disturbances.

      This study will enroll individuals that use marijuana to learn more about long-term health
      effects. The study involves one visit where participants will complete questionnaires,
      breathing tests, blood and urine collection. There is a sub-study where eligible participants
      will also complete an at-home sleep monitoring test. Participants will be contacted multiple
      times a year for long-term follow-up.
