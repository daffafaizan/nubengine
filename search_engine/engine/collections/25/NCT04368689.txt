      the therapy's effectiveness within a community-based sample of adults with PTSD. This type of
      sample allows the study the opportunity to recruit both veteran and civilian subjects, two
      populations that can suffer from this clinical diagnosis and stand to benefit from this
      therapy. This study will:

        1. Evaluate the psychological effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with
           PTSD.

        2. Evaluate the physiological effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with
           PTSD.

        3. Evaluate the subjective effects of floating for a clinical, community sample with PTSD.
