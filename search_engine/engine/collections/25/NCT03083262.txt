    
      This is a retrospective chart review that will be performed to identify all female patients
      in the electronic medical records with a diagnosis of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA).

      The records of these patients with VVA will be examined for demographics, symptoms, answers
      to standardized questionnaires ( e.g. Female Sexual Function Index - FSFI - that is routinely
      assessed during clinical evaluation), work-up, diagnosis, and/or treatment of high tone
      pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD). Symptoms of HTPFD include but are not limited to pelvic
      pressure or pain, and dyspareunia. These data will then undergo statistical analysis.
