      postoperative pain following surgical shoulder repair. This has proven to be a reliable means
      of reducing the required doses of intraoperative and postoperative opiates and effectively
      delaying postoperative pain, as well as hastening patient discharge and increasing patient
      satisfaction. Neural blockade has traditionally been performed prior to surgery with the hope
      that preemptive analgesia will most effectively abate postoperative pain. Recently, however,
      it has been argued that sensitization to pain can be attributed to many factors, not solely
      the nociceptive battery associated with incision and subsequent intraoperative events. The
      duration of action and effectiveness of the treatment modality thus appear play a more
      important role than the actual timing of the treatment delivered. The safety and efficacy of
      performing interscalene brachial plexus blockade under general anesthesia has recently been
      reported as being not only safe, but perhaps more effective than when performed in an awake
      patient. We propose a randomized prospective evaluation of the analgesic efficacy comparing
      interscalene brachial plexus blockade performed prior to surgery with interscalene brachial
      plexus blockade performed following the completion of of surgery in healthy ASA I and II
      adolescent patients undergoing unilateral shoulder reconstruction on an outpatient basis.
