      surgical patients. Establishing venous access is critically important and is sometimes
      technically challenging. Among the many indications for point of care ultrasound (POCUS),
      ultrasound-guided venous catheter placement is well described and increasingly used. This
      study was designed to evaluate the utility of peri procedural transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE) as a tool for positioning CVC and for ruling out complications.

      The study population will be screened at the internal wards and medical intensive care unit
      of Soroka Medical Center.

      Research candidates' files will be screened routinely by a study coordinator. The study
      population will be enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The primary objective for the study is to evaluate whether the use of POCUS in CVC insertion
      can help inaccurate CVC tip placement, detect misplacement and complications and better than
      chest X ray.
