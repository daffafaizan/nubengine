      care, but their effects are still uncertain. In the Netherlands 'NHGDoc' a computerized
      decision support system supported by the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) is
      currently being implemented among more than 1.000 general practices in the Netherlands.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of NHGDoc on quality of care. In addition,
      we want to gain insight into the barriers and facilitators that affect the systems' impact.

      A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 120 general practices in the
      Netherlands. Eligible practices will be randomized to receive either the regular NHGDoc
      modules (control arm) or the regular modules and an additional module on heart failure
      (intervention arm). The effect evaluation will focus on processes of care (e.g. prescription
      behavior) as well as on patient outcomes (e.g. hospital admissions, mortality). Additionally,
      a process evaluation will be conducted, which includes a focus group study and a survey among
      participating healthcare providers to evaluate the perceived barriers and facilitators to
      using 'NHGDoc'.

      Results of this study will provide insight in the ability of computerized decision support
      systems and in particular 'NHGDoc' to improve quality of primary care. Whereas the trial
      focuses on a specific NHGDoc domain - heart failure - we believe our conclusions are relevant
      to other primary care areas as well, particularly as this study also explores the factors
      that contribute to the systems' effectiveness.
