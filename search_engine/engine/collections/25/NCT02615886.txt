      nutrients (e.g. phytochemicals and prebiotics) that promote health and potentially prevent
      diseases. The investigators will determine if dietary rice bran intake can modulate the
      infant gut microbiome and metabolome to promote gut immunity for the benefit of preventing
      diarrheal diseases that increase risk for malnutrition and stunting.

      The investigators hope to learn about the feasibility of dietary supplementation of
      heat-stabilized rice bran in weaning children living in regions with increased susceptibility
      to diarrhea and malnutrition, and whether or not rice bran consumption can modulate the stool
      microbiome and metabolome.
