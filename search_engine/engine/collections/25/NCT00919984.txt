      worldwide. The recommended treatment includes primary surgery for diagnosis, staging, and
      cytoreduction, followed by chemotherapy. Epithelial ovarian cancer is more sensitive to
      cytotoxic drugs than other solid tumors, most patients with advanced ovarian cancer are
      recommended treatment with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The recommended initial
      chemotherapy is generally platinum and taxane combination given by intravenous infusion every
      3 weeks for 6 courses. This treatment resulted in complete remission in about 50% of ovarian
      cancer patients and pathologic complete response in 25~30% of patients.

      However most patients with advanced ovarian cancer suffered recurrences after primary
      treatment, median progression free survival is 15.5-22months, and median overall survival is
      about 31-44months.

      As residual ovarian cancer after surgery and initial recurrences are primarily confined to
      the abdomen, intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy was proposed several decades ago.
      In 2006, Armstrong, et al., reported improvement of overall survival in ovarian cancer
      patient with optimal surgical debulking followed intraperitoneal paclitaxel + cisplatin
      chemotherapy. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States recommended to
      consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy in optimally debulking patients.

      In Korea, however, there are few studies about postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy in optimally debulked (residual mass <1cm) advanced ovarian cancer patients.

      Therefore the investigators tend to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of postoperative
      adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy. (standard intravenous paclitaxel+carboplatin plus
      intraperitoneal paclitaxel chemotherapy)
