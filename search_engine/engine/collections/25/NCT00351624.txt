      structural and functional roles in these issues. The primary dietary source of DHA is fatty
      fish (e.g., salmon, herring, tuna). The American diet provides one of the lowest levels of
      omega-3 fatty acids of most industrialized nations. Children between the ages of 1 and 5
      years consume only 30 to 50 mg DHA per day despite high requirements for this nutrient to
      support growth and tissue turnover.

      Studies with human infants have reported visual and cognitive benefits of DHA supplementation
      in early life. Reported benefits include significant improvements on tests of visual acuity
      during infancy, psychomotor or mental development in the first two years of life, and
      problem-solving and sustained attention around 5 years of age.

      Few studies have evaluated the effect that DHA supplementation has on the cognitive function
      of older children. Studies that considered DHA supplementation in children 4-12 years of age
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other developmental disorders have
      shown improvements on several measures of attention, behavior, and executive function.

      Given the estimated high requirements of DHA to support growth and maintenance of the brain,
      the low consumption of DHA by American children, and the evidence from human and animal
      studies that DHA status affects the functional capacity of the central nervous system, there
      is a reasonable expectation that DHA supplementation administered to preschool-aged children
      will improve performance on tests of attention, memory, processing speed, and error rate.
