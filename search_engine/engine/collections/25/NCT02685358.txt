      It is associated with compromised health, early mortality, and substantial economic costs.
      PTSD is common in VA primary care patients; however, brief, effective treatments for PTSD are
      not available in the primary care setting. Instead, patients with PTSD are referred to mental
      health settings, yet many patients do not accept these referrals or do not adequately engage
      in such services. Thus, this project represents a unique opportunity to improve health care
      for Veterans by examining the effectiveness of a primary care-based treatment called
      Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach. In this treatment a primary care mental health clinician
      guides patients in using the PTSD Coach mobile app to learn about PTSD symptoms, treatment
      options, and strategies to cope with common PTSD-related concerns. This randomized clinical
      trial will enroll and treat 260 VA primary care patients (female and male) who have PTSD and
      are not currently being treated for it. Commonly used, well-established clinical interviews
      and self-report measures will be used to assess important clinical outcomes. If this direct
      treatment is found to be effective at reducing PTSD symptoms and increasing use of mental
      health care, it will provide a tremendous benefit to Veterans with PTSD seen in VA primary
      care.
