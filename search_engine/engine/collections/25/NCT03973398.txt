      described in an abstract, in which local anesthetic injection occurs at the point where the
      internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles taper off and adjoin the lateral border of
      quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle.

      Currently, the QL block is performed as one of the perioperative pain management procedures
      for all generations (pediatrics, pregnant, and adult) undergoing abdominal surgery.

      However, there is large disagreement regarding the best approach for administering the block
      because of unclear mechanisms responsible for the effects and complicated nomenclature
      system. Nephrectomy for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was first described in 1969.
      Surgical treatment varies with the pathology. Simple nephrectomy is the preferred option for
      those with non-neoplastic disease (e.g. trauma, non-functioning kidney with chronic
      infection) with radical nephrectomy being preferred in those with neoplastic disease. Radical
      nephrectomy implies resection of the whole of Gerota's fascia, including the perinephric fat,
      lymphatics, and the ipsilateral adrenal gland. Here the investigators are going to compare
      the Anterior (subcostal) approach to the Posterior approach to determine their level of
      spread and their value in controlling postoperative pain in patients scheduled for
      Nephrectomy surgery.
