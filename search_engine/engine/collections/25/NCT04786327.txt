      severe chronic periodontitis were randomly classified into 3 groups, 7 sites each. Group І
      treated by MIST alone, group ІІ treated by MIST + ethylenediamine-tetraaceticacid (EDTA) +
      PRF and group III treated by MIST + EDTA + GEM 21S. The clinical parameters including probing
      pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP), were
      recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months post-surgery. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
      was performed at baseline and 9 months post-surgery to evaluate bone level and bone density.
