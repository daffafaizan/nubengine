      and can also activate other growth factor pathways. Meningiomas are vascular tumors. Studies
      have shown that the expression of VEGF in atypical meningiomas is twice that of benign
      meningiomas, and VEGF in anaplastic meningiomas is 10 times that of benign meningiomas.
      Therefore, anti-angiogenesis therapy may be more effective for higher grade meningiomas.
      Previous clinical studies have confirmed that anti-angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab,
      sunitinib and PTK 787 can slow down tumor growth and prolong progression-free survival for
      recurrent atypical/malignant meningioma. In summary, apatinib mesylate may be an effective
      treatment for recurrent atypical/malignant meningioma. This prospective clinical study is now
      planned to verify the effectiveness and safety of apatinib mesylate in the treatment of
      relapsed atypical/malignant meningioma.
