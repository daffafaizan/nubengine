      62%) and was well tolerated in previously treated patients with CLL.

      Additionally, there is evidence that immunochemotherapy consisting of fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) is active in patients with refractory and relapsed CLL.

      Besides FCR, the combination of bendamustine with rituximab (BR) has shown to be active in
      both relapsed and previously untreated patients with CLL.

      In preclinical studies GA101, a glycoengineered, humanized type II anti-CD20 antibody, has
      shown superior activity compared with type I antibodies.

      Therefore, a combination therapy with FC + GA101 (FCG) or B + GA101 (BG) might further
      improve the therapeutic outcome in relapsed or refractory CLL. The CLLR3 trial was designed
      to investigate and to compare the efficacy and safety of induction with both
      immunochemotherapies followed additionally by a maintenance therapy with GA101 for responding
      patients.
