      syndrome (ACS) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) indication in use of double platelet
      aggregation (aspirin and inhibitor of ADP). The groups to be analyzed will be:

        1. Control group: It is composed of patients who will discontinue inhibitor of ADP for 5
           days before surgery, and must be operated on the first working day after completing the
           5 days without the drug. This group will have aggregability evaluated by platelet
           function testing (Multiplate®) immediately before the transport to the operating room.

        2. Intervention group: It is composed of patients who will be evaluated by platelet
           function testing (Multiplate®) daily until the value obtained> 46 AU, when they will be
           immediately released to CABG, to be held on the first working day after release.

      All patients included, after the explanations and signing the informed consent, will
      initially undergo preoperative examinations as institutional routine. In the immediate period
      (24 hours) after CABG will be collected on all results of tests to which the patient is
      submitted in accordance with the institutional routines, and the volume of chest tube
      bleeding and need for blood transfusions. Clinical data "MACE" will be collected throughout
      the patient's hospital stay.
