      laser treatment who presented with new dense VH. All eyes will be treated with intravitreal
      injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Complete ophthalmic examination and/or ocular
      ultrasonography will be performed at baseline and 1, 6, 12 weeks and 6, 9, 12 months after
      first injection. Re-injection will be done in non-clearing and recurrent VH.
