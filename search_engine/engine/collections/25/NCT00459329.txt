      higher rates of suicide, lower social and occupational functioning, decreased quality of life
      independent of seizure frequency, and higher non-psychiatric health care utilization. Adults
      with epilepsy are more likely to be homebound as a result of reduced function and
      restrictions in driving, opportunities to obtain enhanced quality of care for depression may
      be limited. This study tests the effectiveness of a home-based multi-modal depression
      treatment intervention called Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives (PEARL). PEARL
      consists of problem solving treatment, social and physical activation, pleasant events
      scheduling, support and education regarding antidepressant medication use as well as
      psychiatric consultation and recommendations regarding initiation or adjustment of
      antidepressant medications.

      In a sample of adults with epilepsy who have minor depression, major depression and/or
      dysthymia, we hypothesize that over a 12-month period, compared to usual care, those
      randomized to the PEARL intervention will: achieve higher levels of depression response and
      remission, achieve higher quality of life and function, and utilize less non-psychiatric
      health care.

      By providing a multi-modal, home-based stepped collaborative care intervention for adults
      with depression and epilepsy, this program will offer practical alternatives to usual care
      and will provide a program for improving depression outcomes, quality of life and
      potentially, epilepsy outcomes.
