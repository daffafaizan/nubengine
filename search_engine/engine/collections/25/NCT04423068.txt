      investigators previously developed general sexual risk reduction intervention (SexHealth II)
      to focus on patient-centered contraception counseling and initiation for hospitalized female
      adolescents. The second objective is to conduct an open trial to assess feasibility of the
      investigators SexHealth II intervention among hospitalized females aged 14-21 years (N=75).
      Among key stakeholders (i.e., adolescent participants, parents/guardians, hospitalists and
      nurses), the investigators will assess Bowen's feasibility constructs: acceptability, demand,
      implementation, practicality, integration, and limited-efficacy testing. The investigators
      hypothesize that the SexHealth II intervention will be deemed feasible by female adolescent
      participants (i.e., the median score across all feasibility items will be > 2.5.)
