      In the Phase I portion of this study, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ribavirin and low-dose ara-C. The primary objective of
      the Phase II portion of the study is to determine the overall response rate, including the
      complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi),
      partial remission (PR) or blast response (BR), to therapy with ribavirin and low dose ara-C
      at the RP2D.

      STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION

      This is a multicentre, open-label, single arm Phase I/II study of oral ribavirin and low-dose
      ara-C for patients with AML M4/M5 or AML with high expression of eIF4E, who have relapsed or
      refractory disease, or who are not suitable candidates for induction chemotherapy. This study
      will determine the recommended phase II dose and will evaluate efficacy. Correlative studies
      will be included to assess relevant molecular targets.
