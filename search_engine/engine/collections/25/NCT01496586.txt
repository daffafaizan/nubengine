    
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the behavioral-anatomical
      relationships that underlie fatigue and amotivation following mild traumatic brain injury in
      deployed military service members. The specific aims are to 1) determine the neural
      correlates of fatigue, and 2) assess how fatigue and social cognition relate to social
      outcomes including employment, community integration and participation in social activities.
      The theory we will test is that fatigue in this population is the result of subtle changes in
      frontal cortical and subcortical structures.

      Study Design: Observational, natural history study.

      Populations: 1) Individuals who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury as a service
      member deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation
      New Dawn, and who continue to experience symptoms more than 6 months after injury, and 2)
      Companions of individuals from the first group.

      Outcome Measures: We will seek statistical associations between fatigue measures and brain
      morphometric and white matter diffusion measurements obtained by MRI as well as task and
      resting state fMRI.
