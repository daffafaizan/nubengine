      heart failure patients and pre-hypertensive individuals after a long-term of ischemic
      conditioning therapy. However, there's still lack of specific clinical trials carried out to
      confirm itspotential treatment effect of lowing blood pressure.

      The investigators designed this randomized, doubleblind, controlled clinical trial to examine
      (1) whether RIC has a beneficial effect on blood pressure; (2) whether RIC exert its
      protection effect through immunological regulation. There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm
      is RIC treatment, the other one is sham RIC treatment. Blood pressure will be measured by
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before and after the treatment to evaluate its exact
      effect on BP. Also, circulatory immunological factors will be tested before and after the
      treatment to illustate whether immunological regulation involved in the process.
