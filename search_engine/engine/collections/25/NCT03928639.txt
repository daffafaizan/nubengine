      and valve disease. Despite technical advances, many shortcomings remain. This research
      protocol allows researchers to pool medical records and imaging studies to identify problems
      and seek new solutions.

      All patients considered for treatment at participating NHLBI structural heart and valve
      centers are invited to allow researchers to access their medical records repeatedly,
      including the results of medical procedures and imaging studies such as catheterization, CT,
      echocardiography, and MRI. These records, which include patient identity, will be sent to a
      central NHLBI database and kept confidential. Results will be used in medical publications
      but patient identity will be hidden.
