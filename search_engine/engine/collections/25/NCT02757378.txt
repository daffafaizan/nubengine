      focuses on the biomechanical or anatomical impact to local tissues. Recent research has shown
      that treatment effects may be more related to the understanding of the structural and
      functional changes in the brain of someone suffering from chronic low back pain. This
      research implicates that the patients understanding and interpretation of input to the brain
      may change the patient's perceived representation and interpretation of output of pain within
      the brain.
