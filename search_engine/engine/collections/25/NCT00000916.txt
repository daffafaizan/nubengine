      ZDV, 3TC) leads to prompt loss of viral suppression in the plasma. In this trial, it will be
      determined whether adding hydroxyurea (HU) to a suppressive regimen increases long term viral
      suppression. Important safety information on the tolerance of HU regimen will be
      characterized in asymptomatic patients with viral suppression.

      Patients are equally randomized to one of three arms and receive treatment as follows:Arm A:
      IDV plus ddI plus d4T plus HU placebo. Arm B: IDV plus ddI plus d4T plus HU. Arm C: IDV plus
      3TC/ZDV (or d4T plus 3TC). Patients are monitored every 8 weeks with plasma HIV RNA levels
      and CD4 cell counts.
