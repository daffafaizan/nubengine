    
      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective is to demonstrate a 20% reduction of ventricular therapies (ATP and
      Shocks) delivered for treating spontaneous arrhythmia episodes with a fast cycle length (CL ≤
      320 ms) by choosing a number of 30 out of 40 intervals to detect (NID) compared to a NID of
      18 out of 24 in subjects with either Class I or IIA indication for ICD implantation,
      regardless of cardiac resynchronization capabilities.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the percent reduction in the number of shocks delivered per subject for
           treating spontaneous episodes with a fast cycle length (CL ≤ 320 ms) and for spontaneous
           ventricular episodes.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of ATP in successfully treating spontaneous ventricular episodes
           (CL: 200ms-320ms) for subjects in primary and secondary prevention in both arms of the
           study.

        3. Evaluate acceleration rate or degeneration into VF of spontaneous episodes (CL of
           200ms-320ms) due to ATP therapy in the two study arms.

        4. Compare the likelihood of syncopal events associated with spontaneous episodes with a
           fast cycle length (CL ≤ 320 ms).

        5. Describe the economic impact and the quality of life consequences.
