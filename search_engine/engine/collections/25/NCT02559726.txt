      myocardial deformation analysis applied in animal models. Authors confirmed the existence of
      a time delay in the contraction of the apical walls before basal walls. In O-HCM, the
      outflow-tract obstruction could be explained by a mechanical hyper-synchronicity between
      apical and basal walls. This study aims to describe the possible hyper-synchronized
      contraction in O-HCM and NO-HCM patients unlike the physiological desynchrony observed in
      healthy volunteers (HV) For this purpose, three imaging tests will be used at baseline:
      echocardiography (TEE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement only in
      HCM, and 3-dimensional electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) combined with computed
      tomography-scan. No follow-up is planned for this study.
