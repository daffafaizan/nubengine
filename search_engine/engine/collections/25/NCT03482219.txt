    
      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Determine the short and longer-term effects of an intensive (8-week in-person
           occupational therapy treatment with prescribed home exercises) on improving arm function
           versus home exercise alone.

           This study's hypothesis is that immediately following treatment at 8 weeks and at 18
           weeks, participants randomized to the in-person occupational therapy will have
           significant improvements in the QuickDASH disability measure, PROMIS physical function
           measure, and total active hand function compared to the home exercise alone.

        2. Determine how adherence to home exercise in both groups influences treatment effects.

      This study's hypothesis is that adherence will independently predict improvement in outcomes
      at 8 and 18 weeks regardless of treatment group assignment and that higher adherence to the
      home exercise program will result in greater and more long-lasting improvements.
