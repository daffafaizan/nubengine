      domains of social cognition and the relationships between these different sub-domains in
      these patients, as well as the relationships between these deficits and the more global
      cognitive functioning (executive functions), and to evaluate their repercussions in daily
      life (activity limitations and participation restrictions).

      Second objective: to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a specific rehabilitation
      protocol for social cognition, adjusted to each profile, according to the disorders of the
      components of social cognition found in each patient. We make the hypothesis that not all
      patients will present homogeneous deficits and we also wish to bring elements of knowledge on
      the sub-domains of social cognition that can be "mobilized" by therapeutic means based on
      cognitive training adapted to each patient. The methodology envisaged is based on an
      experimental methodology in single repeated case studies, allowing a fine analysis of the
      architecture of the altered cognitive processes in a given patient and to adapt the
      rehabilitation protocol in an individualized way.
