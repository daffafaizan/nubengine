      treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Depending on participant's results at each
      stage, he/she might not be eligible to proceed to all 3 stages.

      Stage 1 of the study will involve surgically implanting small, thin electrodes in brain
      regions that regulate depression in order to identify personalized treatment sites. The
      researchers will test stimulation in the different brain regions and their effect on
      depression symptoms. The electrodes will be surgically removed at the end of Stage 1.

      Stage 2 will involve a second brain surgery to implant the NeuroPace RNSÂ® System. Researchers
      will use information from Stage 1 to decide where to implant the electrodes of the RNS
      System. Over the next ~4-12 months, participants will have regular study visits in the clinic
      where the researchers will determine a personalized brain activity pattern that correlates
      with depression symptoms and can be paired with stimulation to improve depression symptoms.

      Stage 3 will be 12 months long and will involve turning ON and OFF the intervention to test
      its effectiveness. Over the course of a year, the participant will have two 6-week periods
      with no stimulation and will receive the intervention for the remainder of the time.

      At the end of this stage the participant can choose to continue with long-term follow-up or
      have the RNS System surgically removed.
