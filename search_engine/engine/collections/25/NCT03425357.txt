      orthopaedic shoulder clinic in Denmark.

      The intervention will consist of an exercise program including lowload exercises with
      elastics and dumbbells, targeting the rotator cuff in a 12 weeks home-exercise program with
      two control visits at a physiotherapy department at the hospitals.

      Tissue elasticity (measured by sonoelastography) is used as the primary outcome and is
      measured 12 weeks post baseline
