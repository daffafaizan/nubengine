    
      This is a global, multi-center, open-label, randomized phase 1b, active-controlled safety and
      efficacy study of oral administration of tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone (phase 1b) versus enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone alone in
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on either abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or
      apalutamide or who are second generation anti-androgen treatment naive, and who have not
      received chemotherapy for mCRPC. This study is designed to determine the recommended phase 2
      doses (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with either enzalutamide or
      abiraterone/prednisone, based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      efficacy profiles.
