    
      This is a prospective study to evaluate pure virological response rates in
      antiretroviral-experienced HIV infected subjects initiating therapy with Atripla. Subjects
      will be switching to Atripla having already been established on the individual components of
      efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF.

      Within the Chelsea and Westminster hospital approximately 540 subjects have been identified
      who are currently receiving the individual components of Atripla and who would eventually
      switch to Atripla. The Royal Sussex County Hospital will be included to ensure that
      recruitment timelines are met.

      A minimum of 150 subjects will be switched within the first 6 months allowing initial 24 week
      data for these subjects to be available approximately 12 months post launch.
