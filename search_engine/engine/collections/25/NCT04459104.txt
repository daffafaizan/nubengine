      This study will be carried out as an experimental, cross-over study, including two pain
      populations, one control group and two assessment sessions.

      At the first session, firstly, all participants will undergo an assessment including
      pain-related outcomes, nutrition-related outcomes, and measures of physical activity, quality
      of life, body composition, and fasting blood glucose. Secondly, participants will be given a
      test beverage (with a high or low glycemic index, randomly decided), after which blood
      glucose levels will be assessed several times during the next 120 minutes.

      At the second session, two days later (washout period), only fasting blood glucose levels
      will be tested again, after which the study participants will be given the other test
      beverage, after which blood glucose levels will be monitored once more for 120 minutes. Other
      outcome measures will not be re-assessed after exposure to the beverages, as we do not expect
      a direct influence of these test beverages on the outcome variables.

      Results will be analysed and published separately for chronic low back pain patients and
      breast cancer survivors.

      Recruitment of participants:

      Participants will be recruited via posters and flyers. These posters and flyers will also be
      distributed to general practitioners, pharmacists, physiotherapists, health insurance
      companies, etc., who will be asked to alert potential participants to the possibility of
      study participation. Information and recruitment messages will also be placed on the website
      and social media platforms of the Pain in Motion research group.

      Informed consent:

      Prior to participating in the studies, each participant will be asked to read and sign a
      participant information sheet and a consent form
