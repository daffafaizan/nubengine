    
      Upper limb hemiparesis is a common consequence after brain damage.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a specific protocol of surface electromyographic
      biofeedback (sEMG-BFB) and conventional physical therapy in upper limb functionality, muscle
      recruitment changes, and glenohumeral range of motion compared to the single application of
      conventional physical therapy.

      Design: randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Sample: 40 participants from State Center of Attention to Brain Injury were recruited.

      Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups where the experimental group
      received sEMG-BFB for the upper trapezius and middle deltoid muscles of the upper limb with
      hemiparesis and the control group received a placebo of the same technique. Both treatments
      were applied for 6 weeks. The score of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity" for
      functionality and shoulder range of motion were objectified. Root mean square (RMS) value was
      assessed as a secondary measure Data were collected before and after intervention.

      A protocol of sEMG-BFB in upper limb may have an important role in the recovery of subjects
      with upper limb hemiparesis.
