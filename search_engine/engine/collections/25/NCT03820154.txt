    
      An open-label, single site bridging study. Subjects with a history of in-halation allergies
      will be tested in parallel with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT procedure using
      one forearm each.

      In each patient, a panel of 8 allergens with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT is
      applied on the two forearms one time only.

      The following SoluprickÂ® allergens and control solutions will be evaluated:

      Positive control, negative control, Phleum pratense, birch, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,
      D. farinae, dog dander, cat dander, mugwort, Alternaria sp. The allergens used for the SPT
      and the SPT Tape are identical Soluprick allergen solutions; allergens will be applied in the
      same location and order on both arms.
