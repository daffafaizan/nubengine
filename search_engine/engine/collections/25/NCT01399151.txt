    
      Specific Aim 1:

      Determine if high dose vitamin D supplements decrease the production of proinflammatory and
      increase the production of regulatory cytokines and chemokines by innate immune cells
      stimulated ex vivo.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Determine if high dose vitamin D supplements decrease serum markers of inflammation and
      increase serum and cellular levels of defensive molecules (e.g., cathelicidin).

      Specific Aim 3:

      Determine if high dose vitamin D supplements decrease blood levels of proinflammatory
      T-helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells and increase levels of anti-inflammatory T-regulatory
      (Treg) and Th2 cells.

      Specific Aim 4:

      Determine if high dose vitamin D supplements increase antigen specific T cell and B cell
      responses after tetanus vaccination.
