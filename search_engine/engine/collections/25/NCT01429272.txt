      New medication classes are needed to improve treatment effectiveness in the depressed phase
      of bipolar disorder (BD). Extant evidence suggests that BD is not only characterized by
      reduced monoaminergic signaling, but also by neural changes such as dendritic remodeling,
      demyelination, and glial and neuronal cell loss. These changes have been hypothesized to
      result from chronic inflammation, based partly on convergent evidence that proinflammatory
      cytokines are elevated in depressed patients with BD. The principal aims of the proposed
      research is to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression of minocycline, a
      drug with neuroprotective and immune-modulating properties, and of aspirin, at doses expected
      to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), within the context of a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial following a 2 x 2 design.

      Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of augmentation therapy with
      minocycline and/or aspirin for bipolar depression.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that compared with placebo, participants receiving
      minocycline and/ or aspirin will show a greater treatment response rate (defined as a >50%
      increase on the MADRS for the final two consecutive visits).

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate the relationship between the response to minocycline, aspirin
      and markers of inflammation (serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP).

      The investigators will test the hypotheses that: a) minocycline treatment will reduce
      inflammation to a greater extent than placebo; b) during minocycline treatment the change in
      inflammatory cytokine expression will correlate with the change in depression ratings; c) the
      baseline elevation of inflammatory markers will predict greater antidepressant response to
      minocycline.
