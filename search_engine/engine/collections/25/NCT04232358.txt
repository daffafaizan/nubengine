      Symptoms are pain and swelling at the calcaneal insertion of the achilles tendon during and
      after exercise. Achilles entesopathy has not been thoroughly investigated and consequently,
      very little is known regarding the effect of different treatment strategies.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate two treatment strategies for achilles enthesopathy:
      Resistance training and restricted loading + corticosteroid injection compared to resistance
      training and restricted loading + local anesthesia injection.

      It is hypothesized that treatment that includes corticosteroid injection is more effective
      than treatment that includes injection with local anaesthesia.

      50 patients with achilles enthesopathy are randomly assigned to the two treatment groups in
      this double blinded RCT.
