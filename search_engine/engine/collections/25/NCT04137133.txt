        -  Pre-inclusion: at the first visit to the CRCM (support for a positive screening
           confirmed by sweat test and genotyping CFTR)

        -  Inclusion: possible between the 2nd visit to the CRCM (about 2 months old) and the 6th
           month

        -  Follow-up: up to 24 months old. The pace of visits will be based on the usual follow-up
           rate of CF infants Clinical and paraclinical data and samples will be collected as part
           of the usual follow-up of CF children. Inclusions and follow-up visits will be carried
           out at the Roscoff CRCM as well as respiratory explorations and biological samples.
           Dermatological and odontological follow-ups will be scheduled for each patient at the
           rate of an annual visit to the CHRU in Brest in the relevant departments.
