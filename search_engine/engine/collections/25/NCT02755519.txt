      captopril challenge and fludrocortisone suppression, and to confirm a better choice of
      confirming testing for single or combined diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. Additionally,
      the investigators plan to collect blood and tissue samples of PA patients for genetic
      testing, and to proceed a long-term follow-up for further investigating the mechanism
      underlying PA and evaluating the cardio-cerebrovascular complications risk.
