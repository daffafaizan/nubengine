      were determined. However, the effectiveness of the education given to non-pharmacological
      approaches to parents was examined.

      The study was first applied to parents in Chad. Then applied to parents in Turkey. n the
      study, parents' experience of nonpharmacological approaches questionnaire was used.

      The form consisted of 8 multiple-choice questions, including a single open-ended question. If
      the parent used a nonpharmacological approach for the child, the name of the
      nonpharmacological approach (open - ended question) was written on the form.

      In addition, the form was asked to write the frequency of using a nonpharmacological approach
      (sometimes / always / not use). Parents' pre- and post-educational knowledge of
      non-pharmacological methods to reduce the pain of children with SCD was measured with a
      closed-ended questionnaire developed by the researchers in the literature (he knows/he does
      not know). Nonpharmacological approaches in sickle cell disease training book was the
      intervention of this study. Nonpharmacological approaches in sickle cell disease training
      book "Parental Education Program for Nonpharmacological Approaches Used in Pain in Children
      with Sickle Cell Disease", was prepared according to previous studies by the researchers. The
      language used for administration of the instruments and the language used in education book
