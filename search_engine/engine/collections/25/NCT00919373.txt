      recurrence of any VT in patients undergoing VT ablation (for stable VTs) and substrate
      ablation (for unstable VTs) after an initial episode of stable VT and patients not undergoing
      ablation, with both groups under the protection of an ICD.

      Prior to the ablation, the patients will undergo electrophysiologic study (EPS) with
      programmed ventricular stimulation, with the aim to reproduce the clinical VT. Most patients
      with coronary artery disease, systolic LV dysfunction, and one episode of clinical sustained
      VT have more than one inducible VT at electrophysiologic study. Since any inducible VT can
      become a potential clinical VT (24), an attempt will be made to ablate the clinical stable
      VT, as well as all inducible morphologies, stable or unstable.

      One of the following 2 ablation strategies will be possible for each VT:

        -  Substrate modification in sinus rhythm in case of unstable induced monomorphic VT which
           does not allow mapping and ablation in tachycardia, or noninducible stable clinical VT.

        -  VT ablation in tachycardia in case of stable VT

      For each procedure the number of tachycardias , the type of each tachycardia (inducible or
      noninducible, stable or unstable), the ablation strategy for each tachycardia (it is possible
      that lesions deployed for one tachycardia will render another tachycardia noninducible as
      well) and the procedural outcome for each tachycardia will be documented.
