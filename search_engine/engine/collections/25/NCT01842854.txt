      involved in the development of fibrosis and tissue rearrangement in the liver, kidney and the
      heart. Its plasmatic levels are increased on patients with acute decompensated heart failure.
      These observations suggest that measuring levels of Galectin-3 in patients with cardiac
      diseases can be useful to determine their prognosis. To investigate the role of this new
      biomarker in Chagas Disease, we will study a Chagas Disease population (including patients
      with the indeterminate and cardiac form of the disease). The assessment of the prognostic
      value of Galectin-3 will be done through the comparison between its plasmatic levels and each
      patients's clinical evaluation, disease severity, inflammatory biomarkers and cardiac
      function tests.

      The patients included in the study must at first sign the written consent. They shall be
      accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease - Hospital SÃ£o Rafael -
      Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular. They will be submitted to several tests,
      including:

        -  Collection of Blood samples for biochemical analysis;

        -  Electrocardiogram;

        -  Holter Electrocardiogram;

        -  Echocardiogram;

        -  Treadmill Test;

        -  X-Ray Imaging;

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;

        -  Evaluation of the quality of life through the application of questionnaires (SF 36 and
           the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire).
