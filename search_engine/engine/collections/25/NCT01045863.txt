      activity following a single dose of PF-03382792. Three ascending single doses of PF-03382792
      were administered in this study (0.05 mg, 0.15mg and 0.5 mg). The decision to terminate the
      study was made on June 4, 2010 due to safety findings and limitations regarding the levels of
      the metabolite projected for doses above 0.5 mg.
