    
      This is a continuous study of preliminary trial (Immunogenicity of three sequential schedules
      with Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine in Zhejiang,
      China: NCT03147560) . The investigators will follow up previous participants at age 4 years
      old with different primary sequential immunization schedules at age 2, 3 and 4 months:
      sIPV-bOPV-bOPV , sIPV-sIPV-bOPV , or sIPV-sIPV-sIPV, and give the 4th doses of polio vaccine
      with Sabin IPV or bOPV. A pre-vaccination blood sample is taken for polio antibody
      determinations. Sabin IPV will be administrated for participants in the previous Group 1
      (sIPV-bOPV-bOPV), and Sabin IPV or bOPV will be given for participants in the previous Group
      2 (sIPV-sIPV-bOPV) and Group 3 (sIPV-sIPV-sIPV) after they were randomly divided into two
      subgroups. At least two active surveillance visits, during which staff visited the
      participants s at home (on days 3 and 30) will required after vaccination to collect adverse
      reaction data. Parents or legal guardians were instructed to contact investigators if they
      observed any possible vaccine-related adverse events or important medical events (such as
      serious illness, physical disability, or death). The second blood sample will be collected
      28-60 days after the booster vaccination. The investigators will asess the immunogenicity by
      seroconversion rate and seropositivity after the booster vaccination, and evaluate the
      antibody persistence using seropositive rate and GMT in participants before the booster
      vaccination. Safety will assessed with the occurrence of adverse events reported across the
      study groups.
