      (Group 1). Another 20 consecutive patients with active disease whom have met the exclusion
      criteria, or were unwilling to start anti-TNF therapy for fear of toxicity would be recruited
      as control patients (Group 2). 20 healthy controls were recruited for comparison of the
      metabolic risk factors (Group 3). Study visits for groups 1 and 2 were conducted at baseline,
      weeks 2 and 6, and then week 12.
