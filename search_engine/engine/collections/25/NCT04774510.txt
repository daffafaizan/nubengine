    
      Design: ASO-AVC is a french academic pilot study by exploring the diagnostic confidence of
      optimized C-arm Cone Beam CT (ASO) realized directly in the neuro angio-suite (NAS).

      To compare the effectiveness and safety of ASO diagnostic, the variability of the diagnostic
      accuracy concerning the staging of the stroke, the analysis of the brain vessel, the
      relevance of artefact reduction post treatment and the amount of delivered dose, the
      investigator proposed to assess clinical usefulness of ASO in the diagnostic process of
      stroke.

      Intervention: No modification of patient care will be required by this protocol.

      All patients participating in the study will undergo standard diagnostic, procedural and
      control imagings, which consist of : diagnostic imaging studies (MRI or CT scan), usual C-arm
      Cone Beam CT in the NAS during EVT to insure no procedural complication and control imaging
      studies (MRI or CT scan) at 24 hours ; decisions concerning further diagnostics will be made
      by the physician in charge.

      Apart from theses standard imagings, patients will undergo the ASO. The ASO imagings will be
      anonymized and recorded in a centralized database called PACS (Picture Archiving and
      Communication System), in order to a centralized radiological reading by the Imaging Core
      Lab. They will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality through a
      questionnaire, and in a second time the data will be included in a comparative evaluation
      with the diagnostic and control imagings.
