      short and long term outcomes. ICU-AW is the consequence of the body's reserves being depleted
      during critical illness and results in severe skeletal muscle wasting during the first week
      of ICU admission.Therefore, measures aimed at preserving muscle mass during critical illness
      and improving recovery after ICU discharge are urgently needed.

      Retrospective observational cohort studies suggest that the administration of high protein
      nutrition is associated with improved survival and outcome. Current ICU guidelines recommend
      dietary protein delivery at 1.3 g/kg/day (ESPEN), or even up to 2.0 g/kg/day (ASPEN).
      However, strong prospective clinical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of high enteral
      protein delivery is lacking and urgently awaited. Therefore, the aim of the present study is
      to investigate the effect of high versus standard protein provision on the functional
      recovery of critically ill patients.

      The focus on functional, patient-centered outcomes rather than traditional clinical endpoints
      like mortality is an important aspect and strength of the study. Previous nutritional
      intervention studies focusing primarily on improving mortality have repeatedly shown no
      effect. Therefore, it is nowadays increasingly recognized to move primary ICU trial endpoints
      away from classical outcomes, such as survival or length of stay, towards more functional
      outcomes, in line with the underlying pathophysiology.
