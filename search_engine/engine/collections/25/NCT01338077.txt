    
      This multi-center, double blind, randomized trial aims to compared the efficacy and safety
      profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50 mg/ml) 20 ml three times daily with that of
      omeprazole (20 mg/capsule) 1 capsule once daily for the treatment of non-erosive reflux
      disease (NERD) patients in Taiwan. Patients will be included into study if they are diagnosed
      as NERD; with heartburn or regurgitation (either one) as main symptom at least 2 days a week
      and had been present for ≧1 month before screening; with heartburn or regurgitation (either
      one) during the 7 days screening period, either with frequency for ≧4 days of mild symptom,
      or ≧ 2 days of moderate to severe symptom; and have signed the informed consent. Patients
      will be excluded if they are diagnosed as erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      Barrett's esophagus or esophageal stricture; with active or healing gastroduodenal ulcer
      (except scars); with history of gastric, duodenal or esophageal surgery; with intrahepatic
      stone, gallstone, gallbladder sludge, hepatic or pancreatic carcinoma as evidenced by
      abdominal ultrasonography, with ischemic heart disease as evidenced by electrocardiogram;
      taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 14 days before screening, or a H2-blocker,
      prokinetic agent or antacid within 7 days before screening; or with clinically significant
      liver or kidney disease. The primary efficacy endpoint is percentage of patients achieving
      adequate heartburn (defined as a burning feeling or pain behind the breast bone) or
      regurgitation (defined as an acid taste in the mouth or unpleasant movement of material
      upwards from the stomach) relief at day 28 as assessed by patient diary. The secondary
      efficacy endpoints are percentage of patients achieving adequate heartburn or regurgitation
      relief at day 14; change from baseline of the reflux disease questionnaire total score at day
      14 & 28; patients' overall satisfaction at the end of study; and number of antacid used
      during the 4-week treatment period. The safety endpoints are incidence of adverse events, and
      changes in laboratory test results (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis). The study
      hypothesis is that treatment with sodium alginate is non-inferior to omeprazole in relieving
      heartburn or regurgitation symptoms of the NERD patients.
