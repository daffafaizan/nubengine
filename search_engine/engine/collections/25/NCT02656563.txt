      Radium 223 monthly for six months or (2) no treatment (usual care). All patients will have a
      physical exam, PSA, testosterone and clinical lab tests conducted monthly. Group 1 will
      receive monthly Radium 233 beginning one month after discontinuing ADT, for a maximum of 6
      months of treatment. Radium-223 will be given in accordance with the Canadian product label
      and Product Monograph at 50kBq/kg.

      If PSA reaches 5ng/ml before 7 months after discontinuing ADT, the patient will discontinue
      Radium 223 and resume ADT. Group 2 will have no further therapy until their PSA reaches
      5ng/ml, at which point they will resume ADT.
