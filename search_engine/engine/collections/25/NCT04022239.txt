      I. Evaluate the safety of substituting the standard post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY)
      given on day +3 and +4 with post-transplant bendamustine (PT-BEN) in patients undergoing
      HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate treatment-related mortality. II. To assess acute and chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). III. To assess overall survival, progression-free survival and relapse rates.
      IV. To evaluate the risk of acute cystitis. V. To evaluate immune reconstitution after
      transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bendamustine. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment schedules.

      SCHEDULE I (NON-LYMPHOMA): Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on
      days -5 to -2, melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -5 and -4, and undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) on day -1 and stem cell transplantation IV over 2-6 hours on day 0.
      Depending on when the trial was joined, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours or
      bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes or cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours and bendamustine IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 3. Patients also receive bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes on day
      4. Beginning day 5, patients receive tacrolimus IV followed by orally (PO) once daily (QD) or
      twice daily (BID) for 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) until day 100.
      Beginning day 7, patients receive filgrastim-sndz subcutaneously (SC) QD until blood cell
      levels return to normal.

      SCHEDULE II (LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES): Patients receive fludarabine IV over 1 hour,
      bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes on days -5 to -3 and undergo TBI on day -1 and stem cell
      transplantation over 2-6 hours on day 0. Depending on when the trial was joined, patients
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours or bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes or
      cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours and bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes on day 3. Patients
      also receive bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes on day 4. Beginning day 5, patients receive
      tacrolimus IV followed by PO QD or BID for 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil PO TID until
      day 100. Beginning day 7, patients receive filgrastim-sndz SC QD until blood cell levels
      return to normal. CD20+ patients receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days -13, -6, 1, and
      8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 3 months, every 3
      months in year 1, and every 6 months in year 2.
