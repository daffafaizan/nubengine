    
      We shall measure the following clinical parameters with the help of the Constant Shoulder
      Score (CSS) and Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS):

        1. Pain

        2. Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

        3. Range of Motion (ROM)

        4. Muscle strength

      We shall measure the following radiologic parameters:

        1. Healing (migration) of tuberculum majus and minus measured with use of MB-RSA

        2. Plate migration with use of MB-RSA

        3. Bone density in the proximal humerus measured with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry
           (DEXA)

        4. Correlation between bone density and prosthesis migration (and tuberculum migration)
