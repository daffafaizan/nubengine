      recurrent metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with third-line therapy comprising
      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with or without oxaliplatin. II. Compare the onset and
      duration of complete and partial responses and duration of disease stabilization in patients
      treated with these regimens. III. Compare the proportion of patients with stable disease and
      proportion of patients with tumor-related symptomatic improvement treated with these
      regimens. IV. Compare the time to disease progression and time to tumor-related symptomatic
      worsening in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil
      IV over 2-4 minutes followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.
      Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV over 2-4 minutes followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on
      day 1. On day 2, patients receive leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil as in arm I. Treatment
      in both arms repeats every 2 weeks for at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression.
      Patients are followed at day 30 and then for approximately 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
