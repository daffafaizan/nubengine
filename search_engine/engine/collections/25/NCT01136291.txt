      women and the maternal, perinatal outcomes and perception of these women about their quality

      under supervision and guidance received from home exercises (study group) and another that
      followed the standard routine prenatal care service (control group). Both groups will receive
      standardized nutritional counseling by the department of nutrition and dietetics and a
      questionnaire measuring quality of life WHOQOL-short at 14 - 24 weeks and at 36 weeks of
