      14-17 year olds (roughly high school aged youth). It is guided by Self Determination Theory
      and seeks to enhance adolescents' feelings of physical activity autonomy, competence, and
      relatedness, key psychological needs related to motivation to be physically active. The
      physical activity to be promoted is walking, which has broad appeal and can be performed as
      part of usual-day activities. Since youth are heavy users of cell phones and texting, the
      intervention will send theoretically-grounded text messages designed to enhance physical
      activity.
