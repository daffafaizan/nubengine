      related or unrelated donors were candidates for the HLA-haploidentical HSCT. Patients
      undergoing haploidentical allo-HSCT will be prospectively enrolled exploring the NK cells
      phenotype and functional reconstitution. Peripheral blood will be collected by day15, 30, 60,
      90, 180, and 1 year post transplantation.
