      follow-up,collection,management systems will be established.The process of cases
      follow-up,collection,management will be supervised by the third party.Data entry will be in
      the manner of independent parallel entry.The endpoints events are judged by third
      party.Statistical analysis are implemented by the statistics institutions of the third
      party.In order to control the bias,this study takes multicenter,random,control study design.

      Sample size assessment:Under the condition of multicenter,random,control design,
      computational formula takes the rate comparisons of two groups.The key endpoints event is
      soft tissue width of vertebral side measured by computed tomography. The incidence of the key
      endpoints event in two weeks group is 30%.The incidence of the key endpoints event in four
      weeks group is 15%.When alpha value is 0.5 and power value is 0.9,the sample size is 161
      patients.If loses visit rate is 20%,the sample size is 194 patients.

      Statistical analysis plan:The key events are analyzed by chi-squared test.The statistical
      significance factors among them are calculated by relative risk.

      Data checks and source data verification are supervised by a third-party organization
      (contract research organization，CRO).

      Standard Operating Procedures:Investigator's brochure has explained in detail about the
      standard operating procedures of everything.Data dictionary can be found in standard
      operating procedures.

      Plan for missing data: The investigators Set a 20% rate of lost to follow-up.
