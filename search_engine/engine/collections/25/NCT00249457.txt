      novel treatment designed to address the chronic, persistent nature of drug addiction. This
      treatment, called the Therapeutic Workplace, integrates abstinence reinforcement
      contingencies of proven efficacy into a model supported work program. Participants were paid
      to work or to train in the Therapeutic Workplace but had to provide drug-free urine samples
      to gain daily access. Forty participants were randomly assigned to a Therapeutic Workplace or
      usual care control group. Therapeutic Workplace participants could work for about 5 years.
      This study reports the effects of the intervention over a follow-up period of 8 years after
      treatment initiation.
