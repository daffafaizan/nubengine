        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of docetaxel and irinotecan in combination with
           celecoxib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate angiogenesis markers (intratumoral microvessel density and vascular
           endothelial growth factor [VEGF] expression and serum VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-2
           expression with response and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate UGT1A1 genotype and CYP3A4 activity with the toxic effects of this regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and irinotecan.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes
           on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 2.
           Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and irinotecan
           until the recommended phase II dose is determined. The recommended phase II dose is
           defined as the highest dose at which 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
           toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-70 patients (3-36 for phase I and 16-34 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
