    
      The study period per patient is 7 to 14 weeks: a screening period (1 to 8 weeks) will precede
      a 4-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period.

      During the screening period, patients will be asked to start or continue adequate diet and
      exercise and to stop their lipid-lowering medication (for not treatment-naïve patients). For
      patient taking any lipid-regulating medication, a minimum of 8-week wash-out from
      lipid-regulating therapies (fibrates, statins, …) is required.
