      Improvement in child diet composition. (3) Improvement in parent feeding knowledge,
      attitudes, styles and practices including. (4) Improvement in lifestyle behaviors, such as
      sleep, screen time and physical activity, associated with increased risk of obesity. (5)
      Improvement in parent diet.

      Our secondary objective is to understand the mechanisms by which changes in parent knowledge
      and behavioral factors mediate impacts of the intervention on childhood obesity. We will also
      study relationships between potential moderators and intervention impacts. The new components
      of the expanded Starting Early Program will be feasible: Families will participate in the
      preschool intervention, and pregnant women will enroll in the prenatal intervention.
