      medicines and that can be marketed once the patent has expired. These drugs are intended to
      achieve the same therapeutic benefit as biological medicinal resembles.

      Because of the similarity in both the active substance in the formulation, it is intended to
      demonstrate the equivalence between the biosimilar medicine of recombinant FSH and FSH of
      urinary origin in terms of fitness.

      The investigators' main objective is to perform a non-inferiority trial of biosimilar
      recombinant FSH product compared to a conventional ovarian stimulation protocol with urinary
      FSH in relation to the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of metaphase II oocytes.
