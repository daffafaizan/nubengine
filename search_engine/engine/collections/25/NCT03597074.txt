    
      Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of early discrimination between
      transient and persistent AKI using the color Doppler Ultrasound derived Renal Resistive Index
      (RI) and semi-quantitative evaluation of intra-renal vascularization in septic patients in an
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Additionally, the investigators aimed to identify whether these
      indexes are early predictors of the prognosis of renal function in this group of patients.
      And compare the diagnostic accuracy of those and other renal indexes for the identification
      of AKI reversibility.

      Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study with unselected, consecutive
      septic patients included. Thirty-two adult septic patients hospitalized in a general ICU were
      studied. After the determination of sepsis, patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1
      included patients without progression to AKI, Group 2 included patients with transient AKI
      and Group 3 patients with persistent AKI.
