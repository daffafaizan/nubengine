      imaging (MRI) and immune response of CGP 77116 in patients with the demyelinating autoimmune
      disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of the trial is to assess whether CGP 77116
      modifies inflammatory disease activity as measured by MRI and immunological techniques, and
      to facilitate dose selection for future pivotal trials in progressive and relapsing-remitting
      MS.

      CGP 77116 is an altered peptide ligand (APL) designed around an immunodominant epitope of
      human myelin basic protein (MBP) corresponding to amino acids 83-99, for the treatment of
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Substitution of a key T cell receptor contact residue with alanine
      results in a non-stimulatory peptide analogue. Recent evidence suggests that a T
      cell-mediated immune response against immunodominant myelin protein peptides such as MBP
      (83-99) is involved in MS pathogenesis (1). MS results when the immune system is unable to
      keep autoreactive T cells from entering the central nervous system where they initiate
      demyelination of myelin sheaths. By targeting MBP autoreactive T cells, CGP 77116 may
      downregulate the MBP-specific immune response and lead to amelioration of MS.
