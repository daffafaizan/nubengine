    
      Eligible patients will be required to take 50mg AZD2014 tablets twice daily for 15 days prior
      to radical prostatectomy.

      Immunohistochemistry will be carried out on prostate tumour biopsies taken at baseline and at
      radical prostatectomy in order to detect phosphorylated biomarkers of mTOR signalling and
      determine the amount of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling inhibition caused by AZD2014 treatment.

      On the day of radical prostatectomy, blood samples will be collected pre- and at specified
      times post- dose for pharmacokinetic analyses.

      Additional blood samples will be collected to study any genetic changes to the DNA, RNA and
      circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) which may have been caused by AZD2014 treatment.

      Refer to the "outcome measures" section for further information.
