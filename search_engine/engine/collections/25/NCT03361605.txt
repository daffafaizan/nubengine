      major surgical operations. Yet the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie loss of
      consciousness under general anesthesia remain elusive. Despite advancements in understanding
      the molecular, synaptic, and cellular effects of anesthetics, the large-scale, systems-level
      modulation of neuronal processes that support conscious cognitive functions is incompletely
      understood. While profound decreases in global and regional brain metabolism, blood flow, and
      functional connectivity have been reported, these changes often fail to correlate with the
      loss and return of consciousness. To date, there is no "consciousness meter" or "gold
      standard" to objectively assess and monitor the level of consciousness under general
      anesthesia. Several studies suggest that residual cognitive functions may not completely
      vanish under general anesthesia; however, the level and complexity of residual information
      processing in the anesthetized brain remains unknown. Finally, the neurobiological mechanisms
      that govern anesthesia induction and emergence appear to be partially different, but the
      relevance of these differences to the modulation of the state of consciousness is unclear.
