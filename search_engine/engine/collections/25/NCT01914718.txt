      with R-CHOP regimen. Recently, dose-adjusted EPOCH-R was shown to be effective in patients
      with DLBCL and relapsed/refractory Burkitt lymphoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and toxicity of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in patients with MYC positive diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma.
