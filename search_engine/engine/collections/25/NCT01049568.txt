    
      Forty participants, non-adherent to HAART at study start, will be randomly assigned to either
      a 1) "Cell Phone Adherence Facilitator" group (intervention group) or a 2) control group. In
      the intervention group, a Cell Phone Adherence Facilitator will initiate a short (typically
      five minutes or less) contact Monday through Friday (excluding major holidays) with each
      participant to enhance their adherence to HAART. Occasionally, calls may be longer if crises
      arise that can be addressed by the Adherence Facilitator. Calls from the Adherence
      Facilitator will occur once or twice a day (depending on dosing schedule) and go on for 24
      weeks in the intervention group. Calls will occur at a time soon after the prescribed dose is
      supposed to be taken, but also one convenient to the participant and the Adherence
      Facilitator.

      All participants regardless of condition will be followed for 48 weeks. This intervention
      will be examined as a tool to address participant-specific, healthcare systems and
      participant-provider relationship barriers to ARV adherence.
