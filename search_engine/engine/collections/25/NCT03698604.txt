      Is total laparoscopic hysterectomy associated with similar operative operative time as total
      abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophrectomy in women with uterine neoplasia?

      Research Hypothesis:

      In women with uterine neoplasia TLH with BSO may be similar to TAH with BSO as regard
      operative time.
