      associated with considerable disability. A recent analysis of data from the National Health
      and Nutrition Examination Survey III indicated that about 35% of women and men aged 60 years
      and above had radiographic knee OA. Although the cause of OA can be many factors, such as
      previous injury, abnormal limb development and so on, its main symptom is a complex chronic
      pain condition. Previous studies have demonstrated central sensitization in OA patients.
      Despite the high prevalence rate of OA, the treatment of OA is far from satisfactory.
      Acupuncture could be a promising treatment option for knee OA due to the effectiveness of the
      pain relief and the rarity of adverse effects. In order to get some more reliable data to
      confirm acupuncture effectiveness on KOA, a long-term follow up interventional study with
      clear design, standard criteria, control group, will be started to confirm the effects of
      long term for acupuncture treatment.
