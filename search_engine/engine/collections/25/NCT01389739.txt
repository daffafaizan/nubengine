      questionnaires at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months (or until death for
      those with a survival of less than 18months) to assess their perceived collaboration between
      their FP and the oncology team (from an adaptation of Nielsen et al.'s validated
      questionnaire (2003)), their quality of life (from the EORTC-QLQ-C30), pain and other symptom
      relief (from the EORTC-QLQ-LC13), their level of distress, anxiety and depression (from the
      HADS), their self-efficacy (from an adaptation of Lorig et al.'s validated questionnaire
      (1996)). Several processes of care will also be measured at the same intervals: number of
      exchanges of information, number of visits to FP, number of answered/unanswered calls from
      FP, delay to return patients' calls, responsibility for care by FP at the terminal phase of
      cancer, service utilization (ER visits, hospitalization, community health services). The
      investigators will also measure in patients' principal family caregivers, their perceived
      collaboration between FP and the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used for
      patients but adapted to family caregivers), their distress (from the IDPESQ), psychological
      burden (from the CBS-EOLC) and self-efficacy (same questionnaire than the one used for
      patients but adapted to family caregivers . Finally, measures related to FP will include
      their perceived collaboration with the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used
      for patients and family caregivers but adapted to FPs).
