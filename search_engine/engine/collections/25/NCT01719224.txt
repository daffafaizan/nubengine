      cross-sectional area (CSA) during daytime within 48 h after delivery. The minimum upper
      airway CSA was measured using acoustic pharyngometry (Eccovision Acoustic Pharyngometry;
      Sleep Group Solutions, Inc) in sitting, 45° elevated, and nonelevated upper body position.
      This method has been previously used and validated in pregnant women.

      In the patients who further gave consent for the sleep study, polysomnography (PSG) was
      performed throughout the entire study night. Within a crossover design, patients were
      randomly assigned to receive first either nonelevated or 45° elevated upper body position.
      Position was changed after 3.5 h by a member of the team.
