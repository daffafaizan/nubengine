        -  Determine the clinical response in women with estrogen receptor-positive ductal
           carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy comprising tamoxifen
           or letrozole, by evaluating the maximal change in tumor diameter on mammography and MRI
           following treatment.

        -  Identify those cellular antigens which are altered by hormonal therapy.

        -  Determine which cellular antigens are predictive of clinical response to hormonal
           therapy.

        -  Evaluate whether genomic changes or gene expression in DCIS are altered by hormonal
           therapy and find candidate genes which are correlated with response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients who are premenopausal receive oral tamoxifen once daily for 3 months in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are post menopausal receive oral letrozole once daily
      for 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After 3 months of hormonal therapy, patients undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
