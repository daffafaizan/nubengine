    
      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rare disorder where people act out their dreams.
      People with RBD often, but not always, develop Parkinson's Disease, dementia with Lewy
      bodies, multiple system atrophy, or other neurodegenerative diseases of the synucleinopathy
      type. The North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) Consortium was formed with the
      purpose of enrolling participants with RBD, in anticipation of a future clinical trial of a
      neuroprotective treatment against synucleinopathies. The NAPS Consortium will collect
      standardized clinical assessments, biofluids, and other data in order to develop biomarkers
      for synucleinopathies in the prodromal (presymptomatic) stage as well as a trial-ready
      registry of participants. Participants procedures will include a ~2-hour clinical assessment
      (medical history and physical exam), questionnaires, blood draw, and (at select sites)
      optional lumbar puncture.
