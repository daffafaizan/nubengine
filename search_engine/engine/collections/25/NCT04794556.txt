      examined the FF of general-fitting. The mean FF was 20.3, and the log-transformed FFs were
      assessed due to skewed data, which was 1.98 (standard deviation 1.34). We assumed that the FF
      for tight-fitting would increase by 50%, with an α value of .05, and a β error of .10 (power
      = 90%) for two-sided hypothesis testing. The estimated sample size calculation revealed a
      required sample of 24 participants. Therefore, 30 participants were enrolled to account for a
      20% dropout rate.

      Data analyses: Repeated-measures analysis of variance or generalized estimating equations
      were used to compare the FFs or passing rate of the QNFTs for the three mask types according
      to the wearing method. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the
      FFs according to the wearing method for each mask type. McNemar's test was used to compare
      the passing rate of the QNFT according to the wearing method. Bonferroni's correction was
      performed for all results of each subgroup analysis. SAS ver. 9.4 software (SAS Institute,
      Cary, NC) was used to perform all statistical analyses.
