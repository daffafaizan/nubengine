    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of AZD9291 (osimertinib) and bevacizumab
      versus AZD9291 (osimertinib) alone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic
      EGFR-mutant lung cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS). II. To evaluate best objective response rate and
      duration of objective response.

      III. To evaluate time to central nervous system (CNS) progression and CNS PFS. IV. To
      evaluate toxicity of the combination regimen.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291 (osimertinib) and AZD9291
      (osimertinib) with bevacizumab first-line therapy through post-progression circulating
      tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA).

      II. To assess for ctDNA clearance on study treatment and associate ctDNA clearance with
      clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-21 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV)
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 10 years.
