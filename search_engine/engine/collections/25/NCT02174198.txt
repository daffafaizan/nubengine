      extraction of teeth in the esthetic zone, when combined with the placement of implants into
      these fresh extraction sockets. In addition, the effect of placing a graft material, such as
      Bio-Oss Collagen® into the gap between implant and the labial plate of bone will be evaluated
      after an immediately loaded provisional restoration is placed. 32 subjects will have an
      immediate dental implant placed in the maxillary anterior region (#4-12) after extraction of
      a hopeless tooth. 16 subjects will be randomly selected to receive Bio-Oss Collagen® (Test
      group) and 16 subjects will have no graft (Control group) in the gap between the implant and
      the labial plate of bone. Hopeless maxillary anterior teeth will be extracted and implants
      will be placed in a flapless procedure. Implants will be immediately loaded with provisional
      restorations once determined that the implant is stable. Changes in vertical height and
      horizontal dimensional changes of the free gingival margins will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12
      months post-immediate implant placement.
