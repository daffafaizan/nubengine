      I. To obtain preliminary data to support the hypothesis that contrast enhanced mammography
      (CEM) can reduce benign tissue diagnosis (FP3) and therefore improve positive predictive
      value 3 (PPV3).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify specific CEM characteristics that accurately classify a finding as benign,
      high-risk or malignant.

      II. Assess the positive and negative predictive values for each digital breast tomosynthesis
      (DBT), breast ultrasound and CEM.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the outcomes/endpoints stratified by age to determine if age affects the
      ability of CEM to accurately define a lesion as benign, probably benign or suspicious.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo contrast enhanced mammography prior to scheduled standard of care core
      needle biopsy of the breast on the same day or up to 3 days later.
