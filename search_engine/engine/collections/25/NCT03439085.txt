      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA
      plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 (MEDI0457) in combination with durvalumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab in patients
      with recurrent/metastatic human papilloma virus (HPV) 16- or 18- associated cancer.

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
      with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive solid malignancies receiving the
      combination of MEDI0457and durvalumab.

      III. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) by immune-related criteria of the combination
      of MEDI0457 and durvalumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive
      solid malignancies.

      IV. To evaluate the disease control rate at 24 weeks.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cellular and humoral immune response to immunotherapy with MEDI0457 in
      combination with durvalumab,

      II. To examine the correlation between anti tumor activity and biomarkers including:

      IIa. HPV-specific cellular and humoral responses. IIb. Programmed death ligand 1 status. IIc.
      The number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, HPV 16/18 E6/E7 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      levels and HPV 16/18 E6/E7 DNA sequence in biopsy tissue and plasma.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) for durvalumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine
      INO-3112 intramuscularly (IM) and via electroporation at 1, 3, 7, and 12 weeks and durvalumab
      intravenously (IV) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Starting week 12, cycles repeat every 8 weeks for
      DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and every 4
      weeks for up to 13 doses of durvalumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, every 3 months for
      12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
