      around 5.7 million people in the United States, with a mortality rate of approximately 50%
      within 5 years. HF is characterized by an exacerbation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system (RAAS), which leads to an increase in sympathetic nerve outflow, peripheral
      vasoconstriction, and reduced functional capacity. Moreover, many clinical trials have been
      developed for the treatment of HF patients focused on inhibition of RAAS, such as enalapril.
      Nevertheless, hospitalization and mortality rates in this population are excessive. However,
      studies with new drugs, such as the combination of valsartan/sacubitril, also known as
      LCZ696, have demonstrated important clinical impact on the morbidity and mortality outcomes
      in HF population. However, the effect of LCZ696 on the pathophysiological mechanisms of HF
      such as exercise tolerance (peak VO2) and peripheral muscle blood flow is not known. Since
      LCZ696 is a new drug with promising effects on the treatment of HF, the objective of the
      present study will be to evaluate the effect of LCZ696 in patients with HF on: 1) peak VO2,
      2) 6-minute walk test, 3) peripheral muscle blood flow, 4) muscle strength, and 5) body
      composition.
