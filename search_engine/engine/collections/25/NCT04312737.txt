      selection criteria will be asked, after written informed consent, to self-collect a
      first-void urine (with the Colli-Pee device) and a vaginal sample (with the FLOQSwab device),
      prior to undergoing colposcopy. Just before colposcopic examination, a clinician will also
      take a cervical sample (with a Cervex-Brush using the same procedure normally adopted for
      cervical cytology and/or HPV testing. During colposcopy, a colposcopy-targeted biopsy may be
      taken if appropriate. When according to colposcopy and biopsy results, an excisional
      treatment of a cervical precancer lesion is needed, the histology of the excised tissue will
      complete the end point of the study. The colposcopy and histological findings will be used as
      the gold standard if biopsies are taken.

      In case of normal satisfactory colposcopic findings without biopsy taking, colposcopy will
      provide the study outcome.

      Three new PCR-based HPV 'in vitro diagnostic devices' (Papilloplex, HPV Oncopredict RNA, HPV
      Oncopredict DNA) developed as part of the SME Instrument Project 'HPV OncoPredict
      (GA-806551)' will be assessed.
