    
      DeQuervain's tendinopathy (DQT) is a musculoskeletal disorder that limits hand function of
      affected individuals. Management of DQT can include splinting, activity modification,
      medications, corticosteroid injections, Physical Therapy, and surgery. There is limited
      evidence to support the combination of manual therapy and exercise interventions within an
      Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy (OMPT) approach when managing patients with DQT. Three
      patients identified with DQT underwent a multi-modal treatment regimen including
      carpometacarpal (CMC) thrust and non-thrust manipulation, end range radiocarpal mobilization,
      mobilization with movement (MWM), strengthening exercises, and grip proprioception training.
      Outcomes were assessed using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Jamar hand dynamometer
      grip strength, and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick DASH)
      questionnaire. These measures were administered at baseline and discharge.
