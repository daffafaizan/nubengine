    
      Purpose:

      To compare refractive outcomes after combined cataract and vitreoretinal surgery.

      Methods:

      Patients with a diagnosis of vitreoretinal disorder and a coexisting significant cataract
      were randomly assigned to be treated with a microincision cataract surgery and a 23-gauge
      vitrectomy (treatment group 1) or with a smallincision cataract surgery and a 23-gauge
      vitrectomy (treatment group 2).

      Main outcome measures:

      Refractive outcomes, stability of the intraocular lens (IOL), intraocular pressure (IOP) and
      functional outcomes.
