      diagnosed with epilepsy with focal seizures with or without focal to bilateral tonic clonic
      seizures. Seizure diaries will be collected for 12 weeks to establish a rate of seizure for
      each subject prior to treatment. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive an
      active STARSTIM treatment or a sham treatment. Neither the study investigator nor subject
      shall be notified of the treatment assignment. Treatment will be done daily at the
      investigator's site for 10 days. A Seizure Diary will be maintained through the course of the
      treatment and the follow up period. Subjects will have 3 follow up visits to evaluate their
      seizure rate, adverse events, medications and quality of life. A Data Safety Monitoring Board
      will be utilized to evaluate safety events through study milestones. Seizure frequency rates
      pre, during and post treatment will be evaluated for both the active and sham treatment arms.
