    
      This study compares the efficacy and safety of a single weight-tiered based IV re-induction
      dose of approximately 6 mg/kg ustekinumab versus continuing with regular SC q8w 90 mg
      ustekinumab administration. It consists of screening (5 weeks); treatment period (Week 0 to
      24); and safety follow up visit (20 weeks after last dose). The primary hypothesis is that a
      single IV re-induction dose of ustekinumab is superior to continuing with regular SC q8w
      maintenance treatment as measured by clinical response after 16 weeks of treatment. Study
      assessments will include Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), video ileocolonoscopy,
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs), laboratory evaluations, biomarkers, review of concomitant
      medications and adverse events (AEs), and evaluation of serum concentrations of study agent
      as well as development of antibodies to study agent. All participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either ustekinumab IV re-induction or regular SC q8w 90 mg ustekinumab
      injection at baseline in a double dummy design. No participants will be treated with placebo
      only.
