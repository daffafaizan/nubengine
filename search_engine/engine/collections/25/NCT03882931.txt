      motor learning. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to be involved in
      cognitive functions such as executive function, response selection, and working memory.
      Recent Findings hint potential involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in motor
      learning. Rare studies provided supporting evidence on its involvement and functions. This
      study aims to examine the functional roles of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human motor
      learning. By applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial focused
      ultrasound (FUS), which is a technology to temporally alter brain state in the stimulation
      site, the investigators aim to find supporting evidence for the causal relationship between
      the targeted stimulation site and motor learning improvement or response selection.

      Young healthy adults will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of four experimental
      groups. If randomized into one of the TMS groups, participants will learn to adapt to two
      visual rotations (20 and 60 degrees) when reaching for a virtual target, subjects will
      receive repetitive TMS (rTMS) stimulation over the targeted location, left DLPFC, or right
      DLPFC depending on the study group. How rTMS stimulation influencing the acquisition and
      retention of motor memory will be assessed based on group comparison of behavioral measures
      such as reaching accuracy. If randomized into the FUS group, participants will complete a
      flanker task to focuses on the assessment of response selection and inhibitory control.
