      people who have erosive esophagitis. This study will look at mucosal healing of people who
      take vonoprazan versus lansoprazole.

      This study will enroll approximately 480 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet and one capsule at the same time each day
      throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record daytime and nighttime (during
      sleep) subjective symptoms in a diary on a daily basis.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 11 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 7-14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
