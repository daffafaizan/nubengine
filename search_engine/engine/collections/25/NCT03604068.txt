      therefore postoperative pain relief following a cesarean section is extremely important to
      optimize maternal and neonate well being. Multimodial analgesics are effective in reducing
      postoperative pain but analgesia is still not optimized. Opiate based analgesics are
      effective but having troubling side effects. Addition of non-drug pain therapies hold promise
      in improving postoperative recovery while potentially allowing for reduced use of drug based
      analgesics.
