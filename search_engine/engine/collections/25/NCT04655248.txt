    
      ACURATE neo2 PMCF is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, observational
      post-market surveillance study. All subjects deemed treatable with the ACURATE neo2 valve
      will be approached to participate in the study.

      A subject who provides an Informed Consent Form (ICF) approved by the Independent Ethics
      Committee (IEC) and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative
      is considered enrolled once an attempt is made to insert the commercially available ACURATE
      neo2 Transfemoral Delivery System. Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled.

      Follow-up will occur at pre-discharge, 30 days, 1 year, and then annually from 2 through 5
      years post index procedure per standard of care. Visits are in-person through 1 year and
      in-person (preferred) or via telephone interview in years 2 through 5. All subjects will
      undergo 4D computed tomography (CT) imaging at 30 days and 1 year.
