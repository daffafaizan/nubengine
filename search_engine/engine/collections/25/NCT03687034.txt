      signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and overcoming chemotherapy
      resistance. The investigators seek to demonstrate the safety profile of BRCX014, a
      cannabinoid formulation, when given to glioblastoma patients in conjunction with
      standard-of-care therapy.
