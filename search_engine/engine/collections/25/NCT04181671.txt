      REHABILITATION SCIENCES. Sample size of 40 individual was calculated using Epitool with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) and power 80%. Individual will be screened out according to
      inclusion criteria. Individuals will be allocated randomly into two groups, 20 in high
      resistance training group and 20 in low resistance training with blood flow restriction group
      by sealed envelope method.

      High resistance training will be use in control group.Low resistance with blood flow
      restriction training will be used in experimental group.

      Assessment will be done on baseline 2-4 days prior to the intervention and after 8 weeks of
      training.
