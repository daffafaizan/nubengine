      agreement, and complete baseline testing, will be randomized to one of two groups: yoga
      intervention or a waitlist control group. Before and after the 8-week intervention,
      participants will complete psychosocial questionnaires and computerized cognitive testing.
      The remote intervention will be delivered via Google Meet and will be led by a certified yoga
      instructor. During the course of the intervention, participants will be wearing a consumer
      grade accelerometer to track heart rate during yoga sessions and physical activity during the
      8 weeks.
