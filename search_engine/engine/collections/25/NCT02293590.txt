      the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Keystone, 2008) when given in
      combination with methotrexate (MTX). CZP is a PEGylated Fab' fragment of humanized anti-TNF
      antibody with a high affinity for TNF.

      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with multiple treatment strategies and
      combination therapies available including analgesia, anti-inflammatory drugs and
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Previous trials have demonstrated positive results
      from the use of CZP but have compared its use to placebo in a fixed dose concomitant
      medication regime rather than using a more realistic dynamic treatment strategy normally
      employed in the clinical outpatient care of RA.

      This trial is aimed at comparing the use of CZP in patients with moderate to severe RA when
      administered in conjunction with an intensive, adapted treatment strategy (Group A) versus a
      fixed-dosed program (Group B). CZP will be given in conjunction with MTX (a disease modifying
      anti-arthritic drug - or DMARD), steroidal therapy in the form of prednisolone and joint
      infiltrations of triamcinolone (another corticosteroid) and lidocaine (a pain therapy). Both
      treatment arms will include these concomitant medications but there will be an intensive
      adaptive approach adopted for the 'treat to target' population of Group A with a more
      fixed-dose approach set-out for Group B. Patients will be centrally randomized after
      screening to ensure a 50:50 ratio for both Groups in the study.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS

      Tight control of an adaptive concomitant treatment strategy after initiation of CZP will lead
      to an improved outcome of RA patients with an active disease despite DMARD treatment.
