      ageing population and an increase in diabetes prevalence. Diabetic foot ulcers belong to the
      most serious and costly complications. Several studies have found that the size and depth of
      the wound is one of the major etiologic factors for delayed healing. Wound measurement is
      important in monitoring the healing process of wound and in evaluating the effect of
      treatment. Three-dimensional methods for measuring wound size have made it possible to
      evaluate the process of wound healing with respect to all dimensions. The investigators have
      developed a 3D camera, which is able to measure wound size (2D area, 3D area, perimeter and
      volume) and to assess wound characteristics.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the intra- and inter-rater variability of wound
      measurements using the 3D camera and to compare with standard measurement methods (2D image
      method and gel injection). Forty-eight patients with wounds of various sizes are measured by
      four clinicians. Each wound is measured twice with the 3D camera, once by 2D image method and
      once by gel injection into wound cavity by two clinicians.
