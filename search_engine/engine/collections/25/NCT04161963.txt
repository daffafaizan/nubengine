      Little is known whether the incidence is similar between standard ultrasound
      phacoemulsification cataract surgery (phaco), femtolaser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS),
      and combined phacoemulsification cataract surgery plus micro invasive glaucoma surgery
      (phaco+MIGS) procedures.

      The investigators hypothesize that CME incidence will be in the following order: FLACS <
      phaco < phaco+MIGS due to the increase of inflammation with the different surgical
      procedures.

      The study is designed as a single centre, prospective study. The study includes patients with
      a diagnosis of cataract or cataract and glaucoma who will undergo one of the three above
      mentioned sÃ¼rgical procedures at the Department of Ophthalmology at the UniversityHospital
      Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland. CME will be assessed by optical coherence tomography of
      the macular with Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT of the Macular at: baseline (i.e.
      preoperative), 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-surgery. Furthermore, a swept
      source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) using Zeiss Plex Elite 9000 will be
      performed at: baseline (i.e. preoperative), 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-surgery to
      image the retinal vessels.
