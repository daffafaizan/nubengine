      Primary: To demonstrate that PN400 is effective in reducing the risk of gastric ulcers in
      subjects at risk for developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine if PN400 is effective in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers in subjects
           at risk for developing NSAID-associated ulcers

        -  To compare upper gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects treated with PN400 versus
           naproxen as measured by scores on the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) instrument
           and the Overall Treatment Evaluation - Dyspepsia (OTE-DP)

        -  To compare heartburn symptoms in subjects treated with PN400 versus naproxen

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PN400 and naproxen
