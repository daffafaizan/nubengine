      treatment, which is the most common treatment at this stage. Haemodialysis substitutes the
      renal function but is associated with several alterations that lead to decrease in functional
      capacity. Many studies show that functional capacity is significantly worse than their
      healthy sedentary age - matched counterparts. The purpose of the present study is to
      calculate values of absolute and relative intrarater reliability (dialysis vs non dialysis
      day) and interrater reliability of different physical function measures (Short Physical
      Performance Battery, one-leg balance, Timed Up and go, sit to stand to sit tests, triceps and
      handgrip strength, six-minute walking test).
