      illness, socioeconomic status, social support, marital stressor, social stressor, etc),
      perceived stress level, and emotional reactions (anxiety and depression) of infertile
      patients and to propose the measurement and structural models of infertile aniexty and
      depression.

      Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) will be utilized through AMOS 17 to analyze the data,
      construct the initial model, and afterward present the modified structural model of the
      psychological responses for infertile patients.
