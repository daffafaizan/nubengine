      crises has significantly decreased. Nevertheless, about 5% of patients diagnosed with chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML) will evolve into a blast phase at some point during the course of
      their disease. Furthermore, despite the advances made in CML treatment, outcome of patients
      with blast crises are still dismal. Due to the rarity of this condition clinical trials are
      challenging, and collaboration between researchers both at national and international level
      is needed to collect a meaningful number of data.
