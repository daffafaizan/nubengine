      after IOL Implantation.

      The residual refraction (myopic and hyperopic) after IOL Implantation is difficult to treat
      surgically. In addition, there are not many suitable options to offer such patients
      presenting with this condition.

      Two current common surgeries to treat residual hyperopic refraction are refractive lens
      exchange (RLE) and excimer laser ablation (LASIK or PRK).

      Laser procedures: Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK); Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis
      (LASIK); Risks of LASIK include abnormalities of the corneal flap, epithelial ingrowth,
      corneal ectasia, refractive surprises, irregular astigmatism, decentration, visual
      aberrations, a loss of BCVA, infectious keratitis, symptoms, and diffuse lamellar keratitis.

      Refractive lens exchange (RLE); The risks of RLE are similar to those of cataract surgery and
      include endophthalmitis, a loss of accommodation, vitreous loss with posterior capsular
      rupture, and retinal detachment.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of RElex-Smile to treat the residual
      refraction errors (myopia and hypermetropia) 6 months after IOL Implantation.

      At myopic residual refraction(-0.75D till -5.50D) after IOL Implantation The method used at
      the EYE Hospital Pristina by ReLex-SMILE is safe and effective method, since there is no flap
      and this prevents invasive damage to the anterior surface of the cornea contrary to the LASIK
      where flap is present posing risk for epithelial ingrowth.

      At hyperopic residual refraction this study is to investigate the effect of fresh myopic
      corneal lenticule implantation as allogenic implant(-1.50D) that will be taken from myopic
      patients to implant on Pseudophakic patients with residual hypermetropia refraction (+1.0D)
      using VisuMax Femtosecond laser - Smile module surgery
