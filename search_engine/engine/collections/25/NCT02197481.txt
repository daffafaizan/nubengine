      shown to be correlated with higher morbidity and mortality rates and with worsen prognosis.
      Various devices of liver parenchymal transection have been developed with a view to reducing
      the intraoperative blood loss. However, to the present there is no randomized controlled
      trial evaluating the technique of BiClamp forceps during the liver transection. The goal of
      the present study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BiClamp forceps transection
      in comparison to the clamp crushing technique in patients offered liver resection.

      Intervention: One hundred patients with hepatobiliary disease need undergo hepatectomy at
      Anhui medical university were selected and divided into BiClamp forceps hepatectomy group and
      clamp-crushing hepatectomy group, each group contains 50 cases.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include: blood loss during liver transection, total blood loss, blood
           transfusion, hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, biliary leakage, postoperative liver
           function, liver transection time, operation time, resection margins, need for portal
           trial clamping.

        2. Statistical method: groups t-test, univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression
           analysis, mixed linear regression and Cox survival analysis were used.
