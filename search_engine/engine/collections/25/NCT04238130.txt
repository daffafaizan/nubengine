      burden. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and our understanding of the molecular
      biology of tumours have resulted in increased interest in exploiting ctDNA as a tool to
      facilitate earlier detection of cancer and thereby improve therapeutic outcomes by enabling
      early intervention. In this study, PEAC (Personalized Analysis of Cancer) technology was
      performed to detect the driver gene mutations from plasma samples and matched tumor tissue
      samples were detected by NGS platform at baseline. Investigators aim to evaluate whether
      driver gene mutations detected by PEAC can replace tissue testing results in patients with
      stage I to â…¢ NSCLC. Investigators also applied ctDNA dynamic monitoring using PEAC technology
      in early stage NSCLC patients with driver mutations positive at baseline, to evaluate the
      feasibility and their potential clinical application.
