    
      Chemotherapy induced anemia (CIA) is a common adverse event in cancer patients reported to
      occur in 20-60% whilst the resulting low hemoglobin level is associated with impaired quality
      of life. Lactoferrin (LF) is a non-haem iron-binding protein that is part of the transferrin
      protein family, along with serum transferrin, ovotransferrin, melanotransferrin and the
      inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, whose function is to transport iron in blood serum.

      The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of LF along with standard care in the
      management of treatment-induced anemia.
