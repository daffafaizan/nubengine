      thymus, heart, and parathyroid gland. Complete DiGeorge Anomaly is usually fatal within the
      first two years of life. This trial evaluates the role of cultured thymus tissue dose in
      cultured thymus tissue implantation (CTTI) in complete (typical) DiGeorge anomaly infants,
      and continues safety assessments.

      DiGeorge infants who have successful CTTIs but remain with hypoparathyroidism must go to the
      clinic for frequent calcium levels and to the hospital for calcium infusions; these infants
      are at risk for seizures from low calcium. Approximately Â½ of infants with profound
      hypoparathyroidism will develop nephrocalcinosis. This protocol had a parental parathyroid
      transplant arm for complete DiGeorge infants with athymia and profound hypoparathyroidism.
