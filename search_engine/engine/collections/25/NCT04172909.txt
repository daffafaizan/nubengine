      modalities are routinely utilized in the care of pediatric patients. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging modality that is utilized to evaluate many conditions in
      pediatric patients. MRI is frequently favored over other imaging modalities in pediatrics
      since it allows for high-quality cross sectional imaging without the use of potentially
      harmful ionizing radiation, to which children are more sensitive than adults. However, MRI
      quality is highly dependent on patients' ability to hold still and follow instructions, which
      is often challenging in pediatric patients. Young and uncooperative children often require
      anesthesia to successfully complete MRI. Anesthesia can often be avoided with the assistance
      of Certified Child Life Specialists, who use techniques to reduce patient anxiety and improve
      children's ability to follow instructions during MRI. For example, children may visit the MRI
      unit or a simulator prior to the examination to contextualize the procedure1-3. Preparation,
      in the form of play, has been proven to reduce anxiety in children prior to scans and
      invasive medical procedures. Children who are prepared for medical procedures experience less
      fear and anxiety and will have better long term adjustment to medical challenges (Koller,
      2008).
