      and immune parameters involved in multiple myeloma disease initiation, progression and
      response to treatment. Such rich information, collected at the population level, is crucial
      to generate the evidence needed to ultimately make Precision Medicine a reality for all
      multiple myeloma patients. To this end the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is
      launching the MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative, a Direct-to-Patient Research effort aimed
      at enrolling 5,000 individuals from whom comprehensive molecular and immune analyses will be
      generated from blood specimens and the resulting data aggregated with the correlating
      clinical information. Blood will be collected from all participants after electronic online
      consenting via a mailed blood kit designed for a mobile phlebotomy appointment. Through the
      consenting process, participants will also be authorizing linkage to their electronic medical
      records information. An important deliverable of the MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative is a
      curated dataset of integrated genomic, immune and correlating clinical data that will be made
      available to support scientific investigations through the MMRF CureCloud, a cloud-based
      platform with tools and capabilities for the seamless aggregation, integration and analysis
      of large collections of myeloma datasets. Finally, in order to fulfill the vision of the MMRF
      CureCloud Research Initiative to make Precision Medicine a reality for all myeloma patients,
      thoughtful strategies truly making participants active participants in the research will be
      employed.
