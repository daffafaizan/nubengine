      a specimen bank of samples with carefully characterized clinical data. Samples from SCOPE
      will be used to examine:

        1. Virologic, immunologic, and host factors involved in the natural control of HIV-1
           infection (long term non-progression and/or virologic control of HIV-1 without
           antiretroviral therapy)

        2. Virologic and immune correlates associated with disease progression

        3. Evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance

        4. Factors associated with transmission or acquisition of HIV infection

      Enrolled subjects are seen at San Francisco General Hospital every four months for a detailed
      interview, saliva collection, and blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately one hour,
      follow up visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for
      specimen bank samples.
