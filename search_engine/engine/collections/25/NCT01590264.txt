      as playing a role in the maintenance of tinnitus; suggesting an alternative rTMS treatment
      approach that targets these structures. A growing number of studies demonstrate involvement
      of the prefrontal cortex in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. rTMS stimulation in
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in association with stimulation in the temporoparietal
      cortex has been shown to increase the durability of the TPC stimulation. The independent
      effect of rTMS stimulation to the DLPFC is not known. Studies in depression suggest that
      increasing the intensity and duration of stimulation has beneficial treatment effects.
      However, the field is new and more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of this
      treatment, predictors and correlates of response, and safety.

      Recent exciting work in schizophrenia used a bimodal (DLPFC and TPC) treatment approach in
      pharmacologically non-responsive patients. The study used high-frequency stimulation to the
      left DLPFC and low-frequency stimulation to the left TPC. Bimodal rTMS stimulation of left
      DLPFC and left TPC induced clinical improvement in pharmacologically non-responsive
      schizophrenia patients and may have improved their short-term verbal memories.57
