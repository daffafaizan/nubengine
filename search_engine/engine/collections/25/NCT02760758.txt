      dose and multiple oral dose design, incorporating fed/fasted comparisons.

      The study will include two groups: Group A - single ascending dose (SAD) including a food
      effect cohort, and multiple dose (MD) in healthy volunteers (HV), and Group B MD in Hepatitis
      C Virus (HCV) infected individuals divided in two parts.

      Five single-dose cohort are planned. For the five single-dose cohorts, a sentinel group of 2
      subjects will be dosed at least one day prior to enrolling remaining subjects.

      Six multiple-dose cohorts are planned. Three multiple dose cohorts in healthy volunteers and
      three cohorts in HCV-infected individuals.

      The dosing of Group B will be conducted following safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) review of
      Group A. The dosing of Group B, Part 2 will be conducted only if Part 1 shows acceptable
      safety and efficacy results.
