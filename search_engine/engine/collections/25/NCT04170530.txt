    
      It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOXIRI as neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone for EMVI+
      LARC.Patients of LARC with EMVI+ evaluated by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were
      enrolled in this trial. All EMVI+ LARC will receive the study regimen every 2 weeks for 6
      cycles. MRI will be performed after 3 cycles of chemotherapy to assess clinical response.MRI
      was performed to assess clinical response after chemotherapy. Patients with mesorectal
      fascia-positive or ycT4a/b after re-evaluation would receive radiation before surgery,
      whereas responders would have immediate total mesorectal excision (TME).If the tumor response
      is good enough(partial response or complete response), the patient will receive another 3
      cycles of FOLFOXIRI then surgery. On the contrary, if the tumor shows poor response(stable
      disease or progressive disease) or with mesorectal fascia-positive or ycT4a/b after
      re-evaluation, radiotherapy will be performed combined with capecitabine before operation.
      All patients will receive 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 4 cycles XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy
      after TME.
