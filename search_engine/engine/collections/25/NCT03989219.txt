      Methylation of plasma cfDNA in these patients will be performed. Evaluation of benign and
      malignant diagnostic efficacy of cfDNA methylation in pulmonary nodules with definite
      pathological findings. Pulmonary nodules that temporarily not require invasive examination
      will be performed CT follow-up and dynamically monitored methylation changes of cfDNA. And
      the methylation changes were to establish a model for the diagnosis and monitor of benign and
      malignant pulmonary nodules.
