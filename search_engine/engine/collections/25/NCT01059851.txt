      This study plans to enroll 16 participants in Part I (8 participants with severe renal
      impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants) and 32 participants in Part II (8
      participants with moderate renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants;
      and 8 participants with mild renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants).

      Part II will be conducted only if the primary hypothesis is not met in Part I and there is a
      significant difference in the PK of suvorexant between healthy participants and severe renal
      impairment participants.
