      received standard of care, 2) PPIA: received standard parental presence during induction of
      anesthesia, 3) ADVANCE: received family-centered behavioral preparation, and 4) oral
      Midazolam. We assessed the effect of group assignment on anxiety levels and postoperative
      outcomes.
