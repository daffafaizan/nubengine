    
      Patients will be randomized using a web based randomization program into two groups:
      Ultrasound guided spinal anesthesia (US) & conventional spinal anesthesia (C). In both
      groups, the level of the third or fourth lumbar inter-space (L3/4 or L4/5) will be identified
      using either ultrasound (transverse and longitudinal approach) or palpation method using
      anatomical landmarks.

      All ultrasound examinations and spinal anesthesia will be performed by 3 anesthetists with
      experience in ultrasound guided neuraxial block (between 100 and 200 cases). The ultrasound
      examination will be done using Logiq e TM ultrasound machine (GE Solingen Germany) with 4C RS
      2 - 5.5MHz Broadband multi-frequency probe.

      The predetermined point of entry for the introducer needle will be marked on the patient's
      back. The spinal anaesthesia will be administered with the patient in the sitting position,
      using a 26 gauge pencil point needle (PortexTM) with 15 mg of heavy Bupivacaine and 20
      micrograms of Fentanyl. An independent observer, who is blinded to the method used to
      identify the point of entry of the introducer needle, will be collecting the data.The spinal
      anesthesia will be labeled as successful if a bilateral block to the sixth thoracic dermatome
      (T6) , judged by loss of cold and touch discrimination, is established 5 minutes after the
      spinal injection.
