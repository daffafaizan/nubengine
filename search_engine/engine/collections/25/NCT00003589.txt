      gemcitabine/cisplatin (arm II), and paclitaxel/gemcitabine (arm III) in patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the response rate, duration of response,
      progression-free survival, toxicity, and quality of life of these patients randomized in
      these three treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0-1 vs 2) and stage of disease (locally advanced vs metastatic). Patients
      are randomized to receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 followed by cisplatin IV on day
      1 every 3 weeks (arm I), gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV
      on day 1 every 3 weeks (arm II), or paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 followed by
      gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (arm III). Patients receive
      at least 2 courses of treatment. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression, patients may receive up to 6 courses of treatment. Quality of life is assessed
      before, during, and at the end of treatment, then every 6 weeks until disease progression,
      and then every 3 months until death. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease
      progression, then every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (150 patients per arm) will be accrued into this
      study over 36 months.
