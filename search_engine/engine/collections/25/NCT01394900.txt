      those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the
      transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections. In the absence of a
      vaccine or cure for HIV infection, behavioral risk reduction represents the best public
      health tool for prevention of HIV transmission. The proposed randomized clinical trial will
      rigorously test an innovative, couples-based intervention targeting the intersection of
      stimulant use and sexual risk behavior among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, with the
      ultimate goal providing an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered in drug
      treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using,
      African American/Black MSM.
