      vascular. In the face of sequelae, particularly in the most serious aphasia, a palliative
      approach aims to increase the functional effectiveness of communication in everyday life. The
      communication book has been developed in this perspective, addressing aphasics whose language
      communication skills are greatly reduced. Early use in this trial is warranted by
      implantation prior to the onset of potentially deleterious compensatory mechanisms seen in
      the late-stage aphasic sequelae.

      This study aims to evaluate, in communication tasks, the pragmatic effectiveness of the
      communication book in the general conditions of use and its maintenance in the implementation
      of the compensatory strategies of communication in severe aphasias.
