    
      In a placebo-controlled, randomized double blind trial, the addition of evolocumab to
      standard care in NSTEMI patients (1) decreases LDL-C during hospitalization and at 30 days,
      (2) decreases vascular/plaque and myocardial inflammation as assessed by Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) scanning at 30 days, and improves (3) serum markers of endothelial function
      at hospital discharge and at 30 days, and (4) echocardiographic assessment of left
      ventricular function at 30 days and six months.

      This is the first PCSK9 inhibitor trial which examines these outcomes in the ACS patient
      population. It will provide valuable data on the extent and time course of LDL-C reduction as
      well as the impact of inhibition on inflammatory markers and on imaging assessment of
      vascular and myocardial inflammation, all of which may significantly impact important
      clinical outcomes in this high risk patient cohort.
