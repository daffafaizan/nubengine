      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month survival of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
           pancreas treated with bevacizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine median survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and
           overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on
      days 1 and 15. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days 2 and 16.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 courses of therapy beyond CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
