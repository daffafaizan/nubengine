           patients who have influenza-like illness or enterovirus infection . We will take three
           throat swabs for each patient: one for viral isolation, one for RT-PCR and the last for
           the Virosensor - based real-time diagnosis.

        2. Virosensor diagnosis： Virosensor (structural chip-based optosensing virus probing
           system), which is for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical
           samples, will be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between
           anti-influenza-virus (or anti-Enterovirus 71-virus) and its influenza virus antigen (or
           Enterovirus 71 antigen) present in patients'and normal samples.

        3. Gold standard： viral isolation and RT-PCR
