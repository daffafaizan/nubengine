    
      This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, one
      year study. It was designed to determine the effect of inhaled tiotropium treatment on
      airflow obstruction (PEFR), incidence and severity of exacerbations in patients with COPD.

      Following an initial 3-week screening period qualifying patients were randomized to either
      tiotropium or placebo at Visit 2. Patients returned to the clinic at weeks 6 (Visit 3), 12
      (Visit 4), 24 (Visit 5), 36 (Visit 6), 48 (Visit 7) and at Week 50 for the conclusion of the
      trial (Visit 8). The patients received treatment daily for 48 weeks (336 days).

      PEFR, as well as use of rescue medication and respiratory condition, were self-assessed by
      patients and recorded every morning on a graphical diary card every morning. The graphical
      presentation of these data was supposed to help investigators to detect exacerbations
      occurring between two consecutive visits.

      Details on hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbations were recorded in a special
      hospitalization booklet.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of a one-year treatment with inhaled
      tiotropium bromide 18 mcg once daily on lung function, incidence and severity of
      exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The secondary purpose was to explore possible relationships between lung function changes and
      occurrence of COPD exacerbations and to try to characterize these exacerbations.
