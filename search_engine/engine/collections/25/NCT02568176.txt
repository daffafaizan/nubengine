    
      This is a parallel group, single-center, repeat-dose, fixed-sequence, open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), study. The effects of repeated administration of
      intranasal esketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and bupropion will be evaluated in
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single oral dose
      of midazolam in the morning of Day 1 and Day 17. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a
      single oral dose of bupropion in the morning of Day 1 and Day 19. In Cohort 1 and 2
      participants will self-administer 5 doses of intranasal esketamine over a 15-day period. The
      duration of study, from the Screening Phase through Follow-up, is up to 51 days and 54 days
      for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Blood samples for participants in Cohort 1 will be
      collected for up to 24 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 17 (midazolam) and for up to 24 hours
      on Days 2 and 16 (esketamine); For participants in Cohort 2, blood and urine samples for
      assessment of bupropion pharmacokinetics will be collected for up to 72 hours after dosing on
      Day 1 and Day 19. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
