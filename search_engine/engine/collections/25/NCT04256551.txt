      to the study recruitment questionnaire advertised through online flyers, social media
      platforms (i.e., facebook and instagram), list serves, and recruitment services across all
      Arizona State University (ASU) campuses. This 6-week randomized controlled experimental study
      consists of a 4-week intervention period that immediately follows a 2-week baseline symptom
      monitoring period. The trial is conducted completely online. Data analyses will begin
      immediately once the trial is initiated and is expected to occur for up to one year after
      study completion. Following a 2-week monitoring period, participants will be randomized (via
      a number draw randomization method) into one of three groups: Machine Learning (ML) App +
      Registered Dietitian (RD) facilitator (ML-RD), ML mobile application (ML-App), or Standard
      Dietary Education (CON). The ML-RD group will be provided access to the Heali mobile
      application as well as a personal RD to provide nutrition support and answer any questions
      through a real-time messaging system within the mobile app. The ML-APP group receives access
      to the Heali mobile dietary application only. All groups will receive a link to resources
      regarding the LFD including an educational guide to the implementation of the elimination and
      reintroduction phases of the diet, a suitable/unsuitable food guide, 19 substitutes for
      unsuitable foods, a guide of example meals (i.e., breakfast-6 recipes, lunch-8 recipes,
      dinner-12 recipes, and snacks/beverages-13 recipes), and tips for reading labels and eating a
      balanced diet while following the LFD. The website is located at
      http://www.myginutrition.com/news.html and operated by the University of Michigan Health
      System.
