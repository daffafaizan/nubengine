      I. To determine whether binary changes (increase versus [vs.] decrease) in rCBV within
      enhancing tumor from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is
      associated with overall survival (OS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the baseline pre-treatment rCBV measure alone is associated with OS.

      II. To determine whether binary changes (increase vs. decrease) in rCBV within enhancing
      tumor from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is associated with
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      III. To determine whether changes in rCBV as a continuous variable within enhancing tumor
      from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is associated with OS or
      PFS.

      IV. To determine the association between rCBV and OS when adjusting for the changes in
      enhancing tumor volume.

      V. To determine whether baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) or change in CBF is associated
      with OS or PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DSC-MRI within 3 days before bevacizumab initiation and at day 15.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 6 months for up to 4 years.
