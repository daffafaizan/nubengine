      The combination of these two drugs can achieve the rapid loss of consciousness and
      analgesia,as the onset and recovery time of these two drugs are very fast within one to three
      minutes. However, the problem of intraoperative awareness necessitate the monitoring of
      anesthetic depth, which is commonly performed with Bispectral index (BIS). BIS is a display
      of number from zero to one hundred which quantify the degree of sedation and hypnosis by
      anesthetics by analyzing the electroencephalogram. However, it is limited in neurosurgery in
      which the surgical field is near the forehead where the BIS probe is attached. Furthermore,
      it is also limited in surgery with prone position. The BIS is influenced by multiple
      parameters, such as age,gender, body weight, height, muscle relaxants, hepatic function,
      co-administered drugs, surgical stimulation, but is thought to be influenced mainly by
      propofol and remifentanil infusion dose. As such, we postulate that the BIS value could be
      predicted by the estimated effects-site concentration of propofol and remifentanil, and try
      to establish a multiple linear regression model for predicting BIS value.
