      construct, there is a need to investigate it. In the proposed study, the investigators will
      compare the rate of proximal junctional kyphosis in patients treated with a stainless steel
      rod (REVERE Stabilization System) versus those treated with TRANSITION Stabilization System.

      Patient outcome measures (Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22), SF12 and ODI) and radiographic
      measurements (including lumbar lordosis (L1-S1), adjacent segment kyphosis, thoracolumbar
      kyphosis (T10-L2), sagittal balance, sacral slope, and pelvic incidence) will be analyzed.
