    
      Each patient will undergo a thorough preoperative examination for the presence of
      abnormalities in calcium, phosphate or magnesium metabolism as a consequence of a primary or
      a secondary disease.

      Blood samples will be taken right before the beginning of the thyroidectomy, and 20 minutes
      after the end, to measure the PTH levels and to evaluate the variation rate.

      On the third postoperative day and before the patient's exit from the hospital, the patient
      will undergo an intravenous infusion test with 35ml/m2 dilution of 8.4%(w/v) sodium
      bicarbonate in two minutes. Blood samples will be collected from a different vein at 0, 3, 5,
      10, 30 and 60 minutes after infusion to measure PTH, calcium, phosphate and magnesium.

      Three months after the operation, if the study conditions are still met, the patient will
      undergo an additional PTH measurement and sodium bicarbonate infusion test and the
      parathyroid function will be evaluated again.

      In addition, the test will be performed on 50 healthy volunteers, in order to assess the
      response to the test of normal individuals.
