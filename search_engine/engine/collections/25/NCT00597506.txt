    
      This open-label, non-randomized expanded cohort trial of bevacizumab and RAD001 for patients
      with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer is designed to assess preliminary efficacy as
      well as the safety and tolerability of this combination. Patients will be accrued to this
      study at Duke University Medical Center and The Duke Oncology Outreach Network (DON)

      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 28 day
      cycles.

        -  The treatment regimen is as follows:

           10 mg/kg Bevacizumab intravenous on days 1 and 15 and 10mg everolimus (RAD001) daily by
           mouth

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every visit, and as clinically indicated.

        -  Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated.

        -  Patients may remain on treatment as long as they are deemed to be clinically benefiting
           from treatment, do not have progressive disease on restaging imaging (Section 6.0), or
           do not have any other reason for discontinuation of treatment as outlined in Section
           3.4.

        -  Patients will undergo correlative studies as outlined in the study protocol
