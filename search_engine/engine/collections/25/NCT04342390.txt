      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and on markers of health (for example, liver,
      heart, and overall health) and how the body uses energy in teenagers. The exercise we are
      studying is called high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. Some participants in this study
      will receive a 4-week exercise program, and the others will not.
