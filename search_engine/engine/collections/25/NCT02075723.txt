    
      General hypothesis :

      In overfeeding condition, the stress response generated by partial sleep restriction of six
      days will induce an accumulation of fat in the liver and a decreased insulin sensitivity of
      adipose tissue , liver and muscle, more pronounced that in overfeeding condition only,
      provoked by a deregulation of the nocturnal lipolysis .

      Specific goals :

      Purpose 1 : To measure the accumulation of fat in the liver (measured by nuclear magnetic
      resonance ) and the tissue insulin sensitivity ( measured by a test meal ) in response to a
      sleep restriction in overfeeding condition .

      Hypothesis 1: In overfeeding condition (130 % of energy requirements ) , hepatic lipid
      accumulation will be higher after 6 days of sleep restriction (4 hours per night) compared to
      a control condition (8 hours of sleep per night ) . Decreased sensitivity to insulin in the
      liver, adipose tissue and the associated muscle will be associated at this ectopic fat
      accumulation.

      Purpose 2 : To determine the alteration of lipolysis in response to sleep restriction in
      overfeeding condition.

      Hypothesis 2: In overfeeding condition, sleep restriction will increase the concentrations of
      circulating fatty acids and glycerol in relation to condition of normal sleep.
