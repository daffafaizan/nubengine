      common cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) as well as a major contributor to mixed
      dementia, potentially interacting with Alzheimer's disease. Remote ischemic pre-conditioning
      (RIC) is a technique to induce brief periods of limb ischemia-reperfusion that is
      hypothesized to increase tolerance of the brain to hypoperfusion. This is a prospective,
      open-label randomized controlled clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE).
      Participants that complete a 14-day run-in period will be randomized to 30 days of either: a)
      RIC performed once per day on one arm, or b) RIC performed twice per day on one arm. Each RIC
      session will consist of 4 cycles of unilateral upper arm ischemia for 5 minutes followed by
      reperfusion for another 5 minutes, administered by modified blood pressure monitor (under an
      Investigational Trail Authorization from Health Canada). The primary outcome is tolerability,
      defined as the proportion in each trial arm that complete 80% or more of the assigned RIC
      sessions. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores, cognition, and MRI markers of cerebral
      blood flow and white matter integrity.
