      telephone counseling for smoking cessation to reach diverse audiences needs evaluation. In
      addition, different approaches to counseling have not been systematically examined, and may
      differentially affect reach, retention, and success.

      PURPOSE To describe employee participation and outcomes in a trial of two counseling styles
      for telephone-based smoking cessation support.

      APPROACH Employees and spouses of two large organizations are invited to participate in a
      trial of a telephone quitline. Participants are randomized to one of two coaching styles. A
      protocol-driven (Directive) coaching approach follows a script for each of seven calls over 9
      weeks. A participant-centered (Nondirective) coaching approach allowed smokers to select
      topics of interest, with prompting by the coach as needed. A computer assisted telephone
      interview program and database provide topics in correct sequence for directive coaching,
      allow coaches to indicate topics during nondirective coaching, and track time spent on topics
      in both conditions.

      PREDICTOR VARIABLES Demographics, smoking history and conventional self-reported measures of
      nicotine dependence, smoking urges, preference for patient-centric care, and depression are
      collected at baseline.

      OUTCOMES The primary outcome measure is self-reported abstinence from smoking for 7 days at
      the time of last follow up, 6 or 12 months after baseline assessment.

      ANALYSES Interactions of Race and Income with coaching approach are analyzed. Based on
      results with asthma patients, a positive interaction of low income with nondirective coaching
      is tested.
