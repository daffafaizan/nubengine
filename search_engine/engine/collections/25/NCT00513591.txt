    
      Women with a systemic autoimmune disease that would be followed by a rheumatologist will be
      included in this study.

      All women will be seen every 4-6 weeks throughout pregnancy. At each visit, women will
      complete a questionnaire, the physician will determine the current level of disease activity,
      and a blood sample will be taken. For women with lupus and healthy women, and additional
      visit will occur at the start of the 3rd trimester for a closer evaluation of predictors of
      preterm birth.

      This is not an intervention study. Women will not be given experimental medication. All
      recommendations for treatment and monitoring will be made based on the best available data
      with input from the treating obstetrician.

      Women in this Registry are not required to be seen by Duke Obstetrics nor to deliver at a
      Duke Hospital.
