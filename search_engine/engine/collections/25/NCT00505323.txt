      Grenoble)

      Study progress :

        -  3 months to 1 month before chirurgical intervention : selection of patient that could be
           included in the protocol.

        -  15 days to 8 days before chirurgical intervention : inclusion visit.

        -  Operating phase : under anaesthesia, implantation of the neurostimulator and its
           components, and adjustment of stimulation parameters.

        -  1 month after chirurgical intervention : checking that all is fine (detection of
           undesirable events)

        -  2 months to 5 months after chirurgical intervention: randomization (double blind): the
           stimulator is put on position On or OFF

        -  5 months after chirurgical intervention : Stimulators of all patients are stopped for
           one month whatever the group they belong.

        -  6 months to 9 months after chirurgical intervention: Stimulatiors are put on position On
           or OFF (cross over with the first period).

        -  9 months to 13 months after chirurgical intervention: Stimulators of all patients are
           started for four months whatever the group they belong.

        -  13 months after chirurgical intervention : study end
