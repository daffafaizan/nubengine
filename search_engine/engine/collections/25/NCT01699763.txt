      System (BGMS) and two additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      companies. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a reference
      laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the three systems was
      evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All testing and
      lancing was performed by study staff and some samples were tested from subject fingertips.
      Additionally, some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels
      and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels.
