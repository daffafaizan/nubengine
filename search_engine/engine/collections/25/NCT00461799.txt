      phototherapy and/or phenobarbital. Life-long daily phototherapy has considerable
      disadvantages. Main problems are a decreasing efficacy with age and a profound impact of the
      intensive phototherapy regimen on the quality of (social) life. An alternative treatment
      option for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is based on intestinal capture of UCB by oral
      treatment. Particularly when plasma UCB concentrations are high as in CN disease, UCB can
      diffuse from the blood into the intestinal lumen across the mucosa. Intestinal capture of UCB
      followed by fecal excretion reduces the enterohepatic circulation of UCB and subsequently
      decreases plasma UCB concentration. We demonstrated in Gunn rats, the animal model for CN
      disease, that orlistat treatment decreases plasma UCB concentrations parallel with increased
      fecal fat excretion, and induces net transmucosal excretion of UCB from the blood into the
      intestinal lumen. In human adults, orlistat has been widely applied for treatment of obesity,
      without serious side effects. Recent studies in obese adolescents and prepubertal children
      indicate that short-term orlistat treatment is well-tolerated by children and generally has
      only mild side effects. In the present randomized, placebo-controlled trial we determined in
      patients with CN disease the effects of orlistat treatment on plasma UCB concentrations, and
      on fecal excretion of fat and UCB.
