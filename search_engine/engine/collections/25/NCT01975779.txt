    
      The study will be conducted in two parts.

      Part A consists of two cohorts (named cohort A1 and A2), which are randomised, double-blind,
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple dose regimens investigating the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Lu AE58054 in healthy young men.

      Part B consists of one cohort, B1, which is a randomised, open-label, two-way cross-over,
      single dose investigation of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of Lu AE58054 in
      healthy young Japanese men.
