    
      At least 1 month after starting DAT (clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg), patients will
      receive randomly atorvastatin (20 mg day, N=50) or rosuvastatin (10 mg bid, N=50) for 30 days
      (until T-1).

      At this time-point, there will be a wash-out period of 15 days after the first treatment with
      atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in order to avoid any carry-over effect.

      Afterwards, a cross-over will be performed, and patients will be switched to the other drug
      which will be continued for further 30 days (until T-2).
