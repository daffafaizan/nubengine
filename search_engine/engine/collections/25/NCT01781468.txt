      Cancer-related fatigue is a very common symptom in patients with cancer. Patients will
      receive armodafinil or placebo. Please see the "Arms" section for more details regarding the
      treatment assignments. The primary objective of this study is to determine preliminary
      efficacy measured by patient reported fatigue Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) at 8 weeks of two
      doses (150 mg and 250 mg) of armodafinil in treating moderate fatigue compared to placebo in
      patients with high grade glioma.

      The secondary objectives of the study are listed below.

        1. To evaluate the tolerability at 8 weeks of 150 mg and 250 mg armodafinil in this patient
           population.

        2. To assess the effect of armodafinil at 8 weeks on cognitive function in patients with
           high grade glioma.

        3. To assess the impact of armodafinil on global quality of life and other fatigue
           endpoints in this patient population with high grade glioma.

        4. Explore the correlation between the BFI, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
           Information System (PROMIS), and Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) measures, as well as, the
           relationship of fatigue and cognitive difficulties.

      Patients will receive armodafinil or placebo for a total of 8 weeks.
