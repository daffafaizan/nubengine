      cholangiopancreatography. Patients with large bile duct stones were randomly assigned to
      EST+LBD+ENBD group and EST+LBD group. A descriptive analysis will be performed on primary
      endpoint, containing frequency of number and percentage of patients. A two proportion
      equality test will be conducted to explore whether incidence rates are different. Descriptive
      statistics including number (N), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, will
      be produced for all continuous variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and percentage of
      subjects will be produced for all categorical variables.
