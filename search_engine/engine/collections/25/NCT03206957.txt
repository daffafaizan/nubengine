      factors in Down syndrome children versus control group 1 constituted by the patient mothers.

      Investigator will also perform renal and low urinary tract Doppler ultrasound with
      measurement of renal dimension in order to determine if the kidneys of patients with high
      level of serum of endostatin are smaller than those of patients with normal level of
      endostatin. Data observed in Down syndrome children will be compared to control group 2age
      constituted by sex and age matched healthy children Urine microalbuminuria and urine
      microalbuminuria/creatinuria from the first urine in the morning will be evaluated.
