      perioperative surgical prophylaxis, are insufficient to achieve adequate antibiotic
      concentrations in blood and tissues of morbidly obese patients (defined as a BMI greater than
      40 kg/m2) and that these patients are therefore placed at high risk of surgical wound
      infections and poor clinical outcomes. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin commonly
      used for perioperative surgical prophylaxis in colorectal, abdominal, bariatric, gynecologic
      and obstetric, or orthopedic total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures. Previous cefazolin
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis in obese patients led to conflicting results and
      recommendations. It is not clearly know to what extent the pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in
      morbidly obese patients differ from those of non-obese patients. Specific dosing guidelines
      are then lacking. The main objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      cefazolin in morbidly obese after administrations of a standard recommended 2-3 g dose or a
      weight-base 30-mg/kg dose
