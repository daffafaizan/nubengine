      immunization of Sabin-IPV and DTaP be implemented soon and the immunogenicity and safety
      studies should be conducted. In China according to the current vaccination schedule, the
      arrangement of Sabin-IPV and DTaP falls on the same date -- at infants' 3rd and 4th months of
      age. In order to avoid the vaccination time conflict and explore the feasibility of
      simultaneous immunization, we design this phase 4 clinical trial of simultaneous vaccination
      of the two vaccines.

      To be specific, the subjects were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 : Sabin-IPV (1st, 2nd, and
      3rd doses) and DTaP (1st, 2nd, and 3rd doses) are simultaneously administrated at 3,4,5
      months old ; Group 2 : subjects receive 1 dose of sIPV only at 3,4,5 months old ; Group 3 :
      subjects receive 1 dose of DTaP only at 3,4,5 months old .

      Blood samples would be collected both before vaccination and 28-40 days after the 3rd dose of
      vaccination. Neutralization antibody will be detected to evaluate the seroprotection rates
      and antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of both immunization schedules will be
      monitored too.
