      patients have superficial tumour and 30% have invasive tumour at diagnosis. Patients with
      superficial tumour are treated by surgery, which is the only curative treatment. However,
      about 50% of these patients will relapse, and cannot be cured by local treatment in the
      majority of cases. The survival of untreated metastatic patients does not exceed 3 to 6
      months, and systemic chemotherapy increases overall survival of patients with unresectable
      disease.

      However, the overall survival of patients with advanced disease treated with chemotherapy
      remains short (14 months), which reflects a substantial unmet medical need for more effective
      therapy in this very poor prognosis disease.

      Cabazitaxel is a new taxane, taxanes have demonstrated activity in advanced bladder cancer,
      and are among the most active new cytotoxic agents to be assessed in transitional cell
      carcinoma.

      Cabazitaxel has demonstrated activity in cell lines with acquired resistance to doxorubicin,
      vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.

      This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 study of cabazitaxel versus best
      supportive care (including chemotherapy).

      The study is divided into three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. The treatment
      phase comprises a maximum of six three-weekly cycles of therapy, with a post treatment
      discontinuation visit taking place 3 weeks after last dose of treatment before the follow-up
      phase begins.

      This phase 2 study will initially recruit 25 patients and after interim analysis will to
      increase to recruit 96 patients randomised between the two treatment options and the study is
      expected to last about 2 years.
