      points. For dosimetry estimates, there will be a 20-24 hr time point post-administration of
      99mTc-GP for the first 3 patients. If the biodistribution and dosimetry can be adequately
      quantified without the 20-24 hr scan in 3 patients, then we will eliminate that 4th scan for
      all other patients. Urine and blood samples will be collected at 5 time points, and an
      additional blood and urine sample will be collected for dosimetry analysis at 30~60 min.
