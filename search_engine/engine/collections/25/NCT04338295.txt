      stimulating scalp hair growth in patients with AA refractory to combination JAK inhibitor and
      oral minoxidil treatment. Ten healthy subjects who are at least eighteen years of age who
      have experienced no or partial scalp hair regrowth after â‰¥three months of JAK inhibitor plus
      oral minoxidil treatment will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo a treatment session once
      every thirty days for a total of six sessions over six months and will complete a total of
      eight visits over eight months. Procedures and visits are not standard of care but conducted
      for research. Each visit will last about an hour. Approximately 30 minutes will be spent on
      consenting and time for patient to ask questions during the first visit. The remaining 30
      minutes will be allotted for the investigator to determine if the patient meets criteria for
      trial enrollment. During the remaining visits, 20 minutes will be allotted for photography,
      15-20 minutes for the procedure and 10-15 minutes for post-procedure patient assessment.
      Remaining 10 minutes on visits 2 and 8 will be used for biopsy.
