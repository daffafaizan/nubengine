      of human myometrium and their functional roles according to their clinical profile divided
      into three contractile pathological situations - threat of premature delivery, dynamic
      dystocia, prolonged pregnancy - and two groups of patients at term: a group before work and
      group work.

      The sampling method. After birth, a biopsy will be perform from the lower segment of the
      uterus. After caesarean sections of membrane and placenta are collected.

      The substances studied during isometric tension tests are part of the three degradation
      pathways of the AA.

        1. new eicosanoids in cumulative dose (8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 20-HETE), and in
           combination

        2. enzyme inhibitors of the eicosanoids pathway (AUDA, MS-PPOH, DDMS), and the COX and LOX
           pathways (indomethacin), alone or in combination.
