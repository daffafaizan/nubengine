      humidity, 26 - 30oC and 40-50% respectively, to ensure no difference in body temperature were
      due to the external thermal stress. The participants were instructed to refrain from intense
      exercise as well as alcohol and caffeine consumption for 24 hours prior to experimental trial
      and to had a light meal 2h before their arrival.

      Upon arrival, participants would have to wear running shoes, light and short running shorts
      and light cotton socks. Participants received comprehensive instructions about the shuttle
      run test and the whole process of measurements. Firstly participants answered the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Thereafter, anthropometrics data
      (weight and height) were evaluated as well as the body temperature in external ear canal and
      axillary. All participants followed five minutes warming up and then performed to 20 m
      shuttle run test until their volitional limit. Once the participants could no longer run, the
      test was over and the number of laps was recorded. After the end of the shuttle run, were
      evaluated the body temperature and the weight of each participants. No fluids consumptions
      were permitted until the second weighing. They were weighed twice, at baseline and at the end
      of the running test with a precision weight scale (Kern DE 150K2D, KERN & SOHN GmbH,
      Balingen, Germany).

      Environmental data including air temperature and relative humidity were measured continuously
      using a portable weather station (LCD Digital Temperature & Humidity Meter HTC-1). The
      weather station was placed 1 meter above the ground according to the manufacturer's
      guidelines.
