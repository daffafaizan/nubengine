      patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Acute GVHD is
      characterized by complex deficiencies of the mucosal antimicrobial barrier and intestinal
      dysbiosis, which contribute to disease pathogenesis. Defensins are endogenous epithelial
      cell-derived antimicrobial peptides, which can protect epithelial barrier integrity, shape
      the intestinal microbiota composition and contribute to host immunoregulation. Deregulated
      expression of defensins has been reported in patients with colitis, including Chron's Disease
      and ulcerative colitis.

      In this study, the investigators aim to analyze the expression of defensins in the intestine
      of patients with acute GVHD to study whether it is deregulated. The results will be valuable
      to study the role of defensins during acute GVHD pathogenesis or as potential biomarkers for
      disease activity.
