      function wrist compared to a single degree of freedom wrist. This will be accomplished
      through in laboratory testing and an 8-week home trial. The first aim will involve
      in-laboratory functional performance testing with a 1-DOF or a 2-DOF wrist and a one degree
      of freedom hand.

      Changes in performance will be assessed with multiple outcome measures that include both
      quantitative and qualitative testing of prosthesis control and functional performance. The
      second aim will determine how a 2-DOF wrist impacts control and home use of a one degree of
      freedom hand. Subjects will compete an 8 week home based trial. Participants will be
      instructed to complete a written home log of activities and electronic logging usage data
      will also be collected for each experimental condition. The investigators hypothesize that
      adding a wrist flexion/extension module to a wrist rotation module and a single-DOF terminal
      device will provide significant improvements in function for transradial amputees.
