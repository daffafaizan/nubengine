      especially for breast and gynecologic cancers. Moreover, it has high impact on cancer
      survivors and healthcare systems. Lymphedema management still remains challenging. The better
      understanding of lymphedema physiopathology as well as the development of sophisticated
      surgical and diagnostic techniques have led to effective strategies to address lymphedema
      patients but, despite the considerable interest in international literature, no consensus
      exist.

      The authors present a retrospective analysis of 24 consecutive patients affected by
      cancer-related lymphedema treated by the combination of LVA and liposuction in the same
      surgical session. Patients data regarding limb volume, lymphangitis rate and quality of life
      index were assessed before surgery and 1 year after surgery.

      One year after surgery an average volume reduction of 37,9% was registered. Lymphangitis rate
      significantly decreased after surgery to 0.95 per year. Quality of life score improved.

      CONCLUSIONS The combination of LVA and liposuction represents an effective strategy in
      treating patients with cancer-related lymphedema, ensuring a significant decrease in volume
      and reduction of lymphangitis rate as well as stable results in time. In addition, it appears
      to be minimally invasive and well tolerated by patients, since it can be performed under
      local anesthesia with low risk of complications.
