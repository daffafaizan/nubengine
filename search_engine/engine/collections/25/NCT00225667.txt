      those with hypertension, sinus node dysfunction, and those with short episodes of atrial
      arrhythmias, known as atrial high-rate episodes (AHRE). AHRE are felt to be a precursor to
      AF, and may be both the result and a cause of changs in the atrial electrophysiology, and
      structure (known as cardiac remodeling)that are associated with the development of AF.

      Evaluating this process in human AF has been limited by the cumbersome nature of performing
      serial, invasive electrophysiologic studies. However, modern pacemakers now permit rapid,
      non-invasive electrophysiologic testing and can also accurately document AHRE, which allows
      the convenient study of therapy aimed at preventing the progression from AHRE to overt AF. In
      addition, this group of patients also affords the ability to evaluate the recurrence of AHRE
      on the progression of structural and electrical remodeling.
