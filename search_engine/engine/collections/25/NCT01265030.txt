      is active in desmoid tumor in children and young adults. Activity will be assessed by
      clinical and histological studies following a course of pre-operative chemotherapy using
      sirolimus. Clinical response will be measured using validated pain assessment scales because
      desmoid tumor size is unlikely to change during the course of pre-operative chemotherapy in
      this study. Histological response will be based on quantifying the phosphorylation of
      following mTOR targets: thr389p-p70S6K, p-4E-BP1, and ser473p-AKT.
