      This study is to collect and describe real-world data for Taiwanese GIST on:

        -  Prevalence and demographic characteristics of Taiwanese GIST

        -  Treatment pattern of GIST therapies

        -  Bio-marker and/or gene expression characteristics of Taiwanese GIST

      investigator-established data bank Study size: Data from up to 3,000 eligible subjects will
      be collected Data analysis: Descriptive statistics for longitudinally assess nationwide
      trends on current and evolving diagnostic, treatment, and outcome measures in the GIST
      population and estimate the prevalence of GIST in Taiwan.
