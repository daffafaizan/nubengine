      with tailored feedback on sedentary behavior and physical activity among adolescents and to
      investigate the engagement in the exergame. One intervention group will receive a version of
      the exergame that tailors feedback. This means tailored feedback will be based on data from a
      sensor which is integrated in a T-shirt and paired to the game. The active control group will
      receive a different version of the game, that does not provide tailored feedback.

      Both groups will be compared to investigate their level of engagement in the game. A passive
      control group will be included that will be asked to continue their daily routines as usual.
      All three groups will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the 'SmartLife'
      intervention on physical activity and sedentary behavior.
