    
      A prospective randomized control trial was performed from October 2015 to April 2019 at the
      Department of Ophthalmology, Thammasat Hospital, Thailand and Panyananthaphikkhu Chonprathan
      Medical Center, Thailand.

      Subjects Patients who had pterygium excision with amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and
      who had impending recurrent pterygium stage 3 defined as fibrovascular tissue not invading
      the cornea were included.

      Then the participants were randomized into 2 groups. Both groups received subconjunctival
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) injection 5mg/0.1 mL with 27-gauge needle in the area of fibrovascular
      tissue, and then the eyes were irrigated with 30 mL of normal saline. 0.2% loteprednol
      etabonate was prescribed in group 1, and 0.1% dexamethasone (CD-oph) was prescribed in group
      2 every 4-6 hours for 4 weeks. After that, the regimen was gradually decreased until
      cessation at 3 months. 5-FU was repeatedly injected monthly in the presence of marked
      inflammation and not more than 3 times to prevent complications.

      All patients were followed-up at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months to assess the impending recurrent
      pterygium severity score, intraocular pressure, complications, detection of true recurrent
      pterygium, and time to recurrence.
