        -  To determine whether there is a sustained difference in the level of respiratory support
           during the first 3 days of life in extremely premature infants treated with Curosurf
           versus Survanta

        -  To determine whether Curosurf is associated with a higher incidence of hemodynamically
           significant PDA, compared with Survanta

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in the cerebral blood flow response to
           Curosurf versus Survanta

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in morbidity in very premature infants
           treated with Curosurf versus Survanta

      We reasoned that if Curosurf was primarily responsible for improved survival rates, compared
      with Survanta, then there should be a sustained improvement in respiratory function in the
      first three days of life, when the direct pulmonary effects of the surfactant preparations
      would be most easily detected. It was also possible that Curosurf and Survanta could have
      effects on other systems that could secondarily affect long-term survival of the infant.
      These other organ systems would include, but not be limited to, the development of a
      hemodynamically significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Intraventricular Hemorrhage or
      Periventricular Leukomalacia, or Necrotizing Enterocolitis. We propose to examine how
      surfactant administration affected the hemodynamic precursors of these common morbidities of
      very premature infants.
