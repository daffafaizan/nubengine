      the retro-nasal olfactory function.

      A decrease in taste and smell abilities can result in loss of appetite, inadequate dietary
      intake and malnutrition. Several diseases and conditions have been associated with taste
      disorders and a decline in gustatory function is very common in the elderly.

      The flavor test was previously developed, validated and patented by our group. It consists of
      a series of 20 aromatic extracts, corresponding to routine dietary use flavors for Italian
      people.

      Each tastant, originally stored in a 30 mL amber bottle, is diluted in distilled water and
      stored at 4 Â°C, then it is kept at room temperature for 20 min before administration.

      An aliquot of approximately 0,5 mL of each tastant is administered in the oral cavity using a
      3mL Transfer Pipet and left for approximately 5 seconds; the mouth is then rinsed twice with
      distilled water before the administration of the following tastant.

      At each administration, participants are invited to identify the aromatic by making a choice
      from 5 proposed items. A total of 21 aromatics (including one blank) are administered
      sequentially. The flavor score (FS) is calculated as the sum of correctly identified
      aromatics and ranged from 0 to 21.
