    
      The study will explore the nurses' pediatric postoperative pain management knowledge and
      clinical practice, and evaluate if a tailored educational intervention will improve
      postoperative pain management practice. This will be achieved by first exploring the
      pediatric postoperative pain management practice using different approaches (study 1). Then,
      an intervention will be developed based on the results from the first study and available
      research in the area (study 2). Finally, the investigators will investigate if the tailored
      interventions with nurses at postoperative units improve the nurses' knowledge of pediatric
      pain management (study 3).
