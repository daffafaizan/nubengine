      Written Disclosure Protocol reach on effect size of 0.89 on psychosocial outcomes (Gidron et
      al., 2002; Mogk et al., 2006). Power analysis showed that with an alpha of 0.05 and a power
      of 0.80, we needed a sample of 34 participants to detect effect sizes of 0.89 and higher.

      Plan for missing data: Occasional missing values were imputed by calculating, for each
      participant, the average score for each subscale and then replaced.

      Statistical analysis plan: We conducted a 2 (group) X 2 (time [pre-treatment vs.
      post-treatment]) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for a set of
      variables.
