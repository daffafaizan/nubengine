      treated, the long-term sequelae of hypercortisolism and its treatment are unknown. This study
      addresses the following questions: 1) What is the recurrence rate after successful treatment
      of Cushing's syndrome? 2) Do any factors in the immediate postoperative period predict
      recurrence of Cushing's syndrome? 3) What are the long-term complications of hypercortisolism
      in terms of mortality, morbidity, return of endocrine function and bone density? and 4) What
      is the quality of life for patients after surgical treatment of Cushing's syndrome? While
      most of these questions relate specifically to the care of patients with Cushing syndrome,
      the final question has relevance to the many patients rendered Cushingoid by the therapeutic
      use of glucocorticoids. These questions will be addressed by blood and urine sampling in the
      post-operative period, and by outpatient follow-up and periodic questionnaires in the first
      20 years after curative surgery for Cushing syndrome performed at the NIH.
