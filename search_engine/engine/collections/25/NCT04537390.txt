      estimate the ability of a female to have her own children. It is widely used in adult female
      cancer patients to predict the onset of menopause and/or the inability to have children that
      can be associated with chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. Normal blood levels of AMH
      are better understood in adults than in children and adolescents. The purpose of this study
      is to have a better understanding of the normal blood levels of AMH in females from 0-18
      years of age and how the blood AMH levels correspond to a female's reproductive development.
      With a better understanding of normal AMH levels in children, we may be able to better assess
      a girl's risk of not being able to have children if she is a cancer patient, and may be able
      to offer her and her family options to increase the chances of having her own children.
