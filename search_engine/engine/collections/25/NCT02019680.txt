      acids in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective properties may be
      attributed to the bioactive compounds found in fruits and vegetables called flavonoids. High
      concentrations of flavonoids with antioxidant activity are found in blackcurrant extract.
      Flavonoids like omega-3 fatty acids may improve vascular function by increasing the
      bioavailability of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. PCSO-524 (Pernacanaliculus
      supercritical oil) is of particular interest as a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids derived
      from the green-lipped mussel. The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of
      blackcurrant extract, PCSO-524 or the combination of blackcurrant extract & PCSO-524 on
      endothelial function (flow-mediated brachial artery dilation) and arterial stiffness
      (cardioankle vascular index) as indicators of cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis. These
      indices also provide an assessment of structure and function of the artery. The effects of
      the supplements on biomarkers of vascular health (endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,
      injury, oxidative stress, nitric oxide status), lipids and fatty acid profile, and flavonoid
      profiles will also be determined. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
      122 healthy older adults (ages 55-75) will be given either blackcurrant extract (1000 mg),
      PCSO-524 (400 mg), or blackcurrant extract (1000 mg) & PCSO-524 (400 mg) daily for 8 weeks
      while consuming their usual diet. The study will include 4 visits at 8 week intervals
      consisting of treatment, washout and placebo phases.
