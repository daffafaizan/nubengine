      Aim 1: To determine whether pretreatment brain activation on fMRI while performing a Go-Nogo
      task predicts response to pharmacotherapy in cocaine dependent subjects.

      Hypothesis related to Aim 1:

      Pretreatment fMRI BOLD activation in cocaine dependent subjects during impulsive responding
      on the Go-Nogo task predicts 8-week outcome from medication known to enhance serotonin
      function (citalopram). The regression coefficient of TES on pretreatment mean BOLD activation
      on the Go-Nogo task will be significantly greater for the citalopram group than the placebo
      group.

      Aim 2: To determine whether pretreatment brain activation on fMRI while performing an
      attentional bias (cocaine Stroop) task predicts response to pharmacotherapy in cocaine
      dependent subjects.

      Hypothesis related to Aim 2:

      Pretreatment fMRI BOLD activation in cocaine dependent subjects during cocaine related words
      on the cocaine Stroop task predicts 8-week outcome from medication known to enhance serotonin
      function (citalopram). The regression coefficient of TES on pretreatment mean BOLD activation
      from the cocaine Stroop task will be significantly greater for the citalopram group than the
      placebo group.
