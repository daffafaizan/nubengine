      prescription is finished. Leftover prescription opioids serve as a reservoir of products for
      misuse, given 90% of people who misuse prescription opioids report obtaining the opioids from
      a friend, family member, or a legitimate prescription. The best way to increase the rate of
      safe disposal of leftover opioids is unclear. The present study will generate evidence
      comparing how well a drug disposal system compares with providing an informational handout on
      properly disposing of leftover prescription opioids. Participants will be randomized by day
      to one of two disposal interventions or no disposal intervention. Disposal interventions
      include a drug disposal kit or an informational sheet describing how to safely dispose of
      leftover prescription opioids. Storage and disposal characteristics for leftover prescription
      opioids will be measured using standardized telephone calls with participants at 3 weeks
      after filling the opioid prescription. If therapy is not concluded at 3 weeks or participants
      are not available, then a second standardized telephone call with participants will take
      place at 6 weeks after filling the opioid prescription.
