      obtained from developed population in east of China, however, such information was not
      available for the remote population. Moreover, people in the western region have significant
      difference with developed population in lifestyle, diet, ethnic and so on. Therefore, the aim
      of our study was to evaluate epidemiological features of risk factors for AD in Chinese
      remote patients. We anticipated that this analysis would provide helpful information
      preventing and controlling AD in Chinese XinJiang Province.
