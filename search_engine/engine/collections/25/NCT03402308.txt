      to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy. Therefore, the investigators conduct a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of the SCE on muscle
      strength, muscle mass, and muscle function in healthy adults; the safety of the compound are
      also evaluate. The Investigators examine the peak torque/body weight at 60Â°/s knee extension,
      handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass, physical performance, and metabolic parameters at
      baseline, as well as after 4 and 12 weeks of intervention. Fifty-four healthy adults were
      administered either 1,000 mg of SCE or a placebo each day for 12 weeks;
