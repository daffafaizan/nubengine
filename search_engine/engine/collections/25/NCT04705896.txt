      severe kidney failure that necessitates treatment with dialysis. Dialysis is a blood-cleaning
      treatment that replaces kidney function but does not actually help the kidneys to heal. While
      dialysis is life-saving, the treatments themselves may actually prevent the kidneys from
      recovering. This is because many patients experience low blood pressure (hypotension) during
      dialysis treatments. Hypotension can cause further damage to these patients' already-injured
      kidneys.

      Some studies show that patients with higher blood levels of a protein called albumin may be
      protected from having hypotension during dialysis. Whether or not giving patients intravenous
      albumin can prevent hypotension during dialysis and lead to faster kidney recovery is
      unknown.

      This study will determine if increasing ICU patients' blood albumin levels by giving them
      intravenous albumin fluid during dialysis treatments can prevent hypotension. The findings of
      this study could lead to faster kidney recovery and less need for ongoing dialysis treatments
      for patients who get severe kidney failure in ICU.
