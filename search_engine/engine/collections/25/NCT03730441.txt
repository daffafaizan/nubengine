    
      ADR (adenoma detection rate) is generally accepted quality indicator and it is calculated
      from screening colonoscopies in patients over 50 years of age. For possible gaming with ADR
      for screening colonoscopies, monitoring of ADR for all colonoscopies is discussed
      nowadays.The aim of the study is to compare ADR for colonoscopies from various indications
      and to find correlations between ADR of screening and all examinations.

      We want to retrospectively assess the quality indicators of all colonoscopies performed from
      January 2013 to December 2017. We want to calculate ADR for all colonoscopies in patients
      over 50 years of age excluding therapeutic, IBD, management of complications and
      sigmoidoscopies (screening, surveillance, diagnostic) and separately only for screening
      colonoscopies. Correlation analysis will be performed using PearsonÂ´s correlation
      coefficient.
