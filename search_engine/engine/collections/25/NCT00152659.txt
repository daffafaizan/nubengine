      the brain. During surgery small pieces of abnormal (unusual) brain tissue may be removed. We
      analyze these specimens using more advanced microscopic and electrophysiologic techniques
      than are usually applied to such tissue specimens. In addition, some tissues can be
      maintained in laboratory conditions to allow analysis over the longer term. No extra brain
      tissue is taken to perform these studies. The tissue analysis is performed by the research
      team and are compared to the routine (normal) electrical recordings that are taken during
      this type of brain surgery. Currently there are no instructions telling a doctor how much
      brain tissue should be cut out to prevent the spread of tumors or epilepsy. We are hoping
      that the results of this study help us to better know how much brain tissue needs to be
      removed to prevent the spread of tumors or epilepsy.
