      increasing prevalence (range 0.05-3%).The investigators previous study showed that lower
      serum ferritin and iron levels in children with Tourette syndrome than in healthy children.
      The exact mechanism explaining how iron deficiency contributes to the pathophysiology of TS
      is unclear.One question is whether or not peripheral iron deficiency in children with
      Tourette syndrome can inflence the brain extrapyramid structure and resting state brain
      function？Another question is how well peripheral iron indices correlate with central iron
      content？ The third question is for TS children with peripheral iron deficiency, oral iron
      supplement (5mg/Kg/d) at least 8 weeks, the peripheral iron indicies return to normal levels,
      how the brain iron contents and the relative structure and brain function change?, To test
      the above-metioned hypothesis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) , diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) are applied to investigate the
      volume change of extrapyramid structure such as caudate nucleus and putamen, resting-state
      brain function and brain iron content before and after oral iron supplementation in TS
      children with peripheral iron deficiency, TS children with peripheral normal iron levels and
      normal healthy controls. The investigators hope to confirm that iron deficiency may play a
      causal role in the dopamine metabolism and it helps to further explore the pathophysiology of
      Tourette syndrome and also would contribute to significant advance in the therapeutic option
      for TS children with peripheral iron deficiency.
