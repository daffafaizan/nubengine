      (≥38.5°C), hypothermia (≤36°C), chills or shock. For the first blood culture, 40 mL of blood
      will be obtained aseptically by a single phlebotomy and equally distributed into two
      BacT/Alert FA aerobic bottles and two BacT/Alert FN anaerobic bottles (bioMérieux,
      La-Balme-les-Grottes, France). The four bottles will be labelled from one to four in the
      following order: aerobic-anaerobic-aerobic-anaerobic. Within the next 24 h, one to three
      other 20-mL blood cultures consisting of a single pair of aerobic and anaerobic bottles will
      have to be performed, spaced by a minimum of 30 minutes. Bottles will be incubated for 5 days
      or until positivity reported by the BacT/Alert 3D instrument.
