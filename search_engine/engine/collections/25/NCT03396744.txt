      episodes. Patients presenting with BD spend more time with depressive symptoms than with
      manic ones, which have a major impact on the quality of life and is associated with poorer
      outcomes including recurrences and suicide. In addition depressive phases in BD are
      frequently refractory and clinicians have few treatment options. Bright light therapy (BLT,
      also named phototherapy) is the first line treatment for depression with seasonal patterns
      and show promising results in the treatment of non-seasonal depressions. More evidence in
      non-seasonal depressions is expected, especially in BD. Moreover, some specificities linked
      to BD, such as the manic switch, warrant evidence-based therapeutic guidelines and so deserve
      more studies in BD. Preliminary reports suggest that morning exposure may induce manic
      switches, and that mid-day exposures may be associated with a decreased risk of manic switch.
      Different dose-titration protocols have also not been compared, and data are lacking. In this
      context, this study aimed to evaluate modalities of the BLT dosage (time of exposure)
      escalation depending on the tolerance (manic symptoms) in two groups exposed either during
      the morning or at mid-day.
