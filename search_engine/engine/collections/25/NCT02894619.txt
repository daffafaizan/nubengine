      during efforts or laugh like in other people, but also when coughing or sneezing, which are
      amplified during periods of exacerbation and with the degradation of the pulmonary condition.
      In addition, fear of leakage can disrupt medical care: discomfort during physiotherapy,
      pulmonary function test. Urinary and anorectal functional disorders are therefore not only a
      factor degrading the quality of life but also a risk factor for worsening bronchial
      obstruction, patients limiting their cough and / or their care to avoid episodes of leakage.
      Given the lack literature data, investigators wanted to explore these areas.

      Validated and specific questionnaires will be self and anonymously administered to adult
      patients (n=175). The time requested to fill the forms is estimated to 1H. Questionnaires
      about sexual health are optional.

      Prospects considered, depending on the results, are:

        -  Extension to the adolescent population (14 and over);

        -  National extension;

        -  Systematic proposal of a screening and an appropriate management of pelvic floor
           functional disorders, depending on influent characteristics (age, gender ...):
           multidisciplinary working group to develop guidelines and specific tools for
           professional training and / or patient education;

        -  Implementation of a comparative study of interventions.
