      can prevent or delay the progression of prostate cancer, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
      significant, or low-risk smoldering myeloma into a more aggressive cancer which requires
      treatment. The investigator will be evaluating a marker in patients blood called MIC-1 to
      determine whether it could be a useful predictor of whether the disease is improving or
      progressing.
