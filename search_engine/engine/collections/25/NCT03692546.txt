      associated with significant postoperative pain. As rotator cuff repair procedures become
      increasingly more common, these procedures and the narcotic prescriptions which accompany
      them may contribute to the rising opioid epidemic. The use of intraoperative local and
      regional anesthesia or field blocks, in conjunction with multimodal pharmacological
      strategies, is a widely accepted approach for managing surgical pain and reducing opiate use.
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether using a field block of liposomal
      bupivacaine (LB) in addition to an interscalene block (ISB) would provide greater pain relief
      and reduction in opiate consumption when compared to ISB alone.

      The study enrolled 50 patients undergoing primary ARCR surgery. Patients were randomized to
      receiving intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine or not and provided with postoperative "Pain
      Journals" to document their daily pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and to track their
      daily opioid consumption during the first five post-operative days.
