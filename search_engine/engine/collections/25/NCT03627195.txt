    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient, single
      ascending dose (SAD) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      lurasidone injectable suspension in subjects with schizophrenia. This study will determine
      the minimum intolerable dose (MID), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lurasidone injectable
      suspension, and characterize the PK profiles of lurasidone and its metabolites in serum
      (ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-11614, ID-20219, and ID-20220) and urine (ID-14283, ID-14326, and
      ID-11614) in this subject population. The potential effects of gender on the PK of lurasidone
      injectable suspension and its metabolites will also be evaluated when applicable.
