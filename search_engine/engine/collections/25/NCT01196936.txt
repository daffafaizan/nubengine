      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose tamoxifen (tamoxifen citrate)
      administered at 5 mg per day on surrogate endpoint biomarkers of breast cancer (BC) risk,
      including: mammographic breast density (MBD), an established radiographic biomarker of BC
      risk; cytomorphology and proliferative index, tissue biomarkers closely linked to BC risk;
      and sex steroid hormones and insulin growth factors, circulating biomarkers of BC risk.

      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this low-dose tamoxifen regimen, assessing both
      objective measures (lipid profiles, clotting factors and bone metabolism markers) and
      patient-reported outcomes.

      III. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year low dose tamoxifen intervention.

      IV. To explore the relationship between this low-dose tamoxifen regimen and clinical measures
      of efficacy (new breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] diagnoses) and toxicity
      (thromboembolic events, reports of hot flashes and gynecological symptoms, liver function
      abnormalities, and other cancer diagnoses).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate orally (PO) once daily for 24 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO once daily for 24 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10
      years.
