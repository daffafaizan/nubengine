      stay and the cosmetic result. Although reduced, however, pain is still substantial and
      constitutes the main clinical problem after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in particular for
      future daily planned procedures.

      Recently, a new technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been developed, in which all
      instruments are inserted through the same port placed in the umbilical incision. This
      technique for cholecystectomy has been proved to be feasible and safe by several studies.

      The purpose of the study is to compare postoperative pain, operating time, cosmetic result,
      between one port and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
