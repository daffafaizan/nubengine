      supplementation, 4,000 international units per day versus 600 international units per day,
      for one year to determine the effects on markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease in
      African Americans with type 2 diabetes and vitamin D deficiency. Outcome assessment will
      focus on changes in carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT - ultrasound of the thickness of
      blood vessels in the neck), as well as markers of systemic inflammation.
