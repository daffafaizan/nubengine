      volumetric CT scans and cardiac MRI, to non-invasively identify early pathologic changes in
      pulmonary and cardiac function resulting from thoracic radiation. The ability to identify
      these changes during the course of treatment offers a powerful tool to optimize radiation
      dose distributions within uninvolved normal tissue by adapting treatment to the individual
      patient response. In addition it may lead to other therapeutic interventions designed to
      reduce long term cardiopulmonary toxicity.

      The cardiac MRI will be performed using Aminophylline, Gadopentetate Dimeglumine and
      Regadenoson. These are not FDA approved for this purpose, but are being used off label and
      are IND exempt. Additionally, patients will be consented with an optional choice to retain
      research blood samples for 15 years after the completion of the study. This will allow
      cutting edge analysis for biomarkers that may be discovered in the future.
