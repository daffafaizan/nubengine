      for some surgical procedures. However, recently some surgical specialties such as orthopedics
      have been implemented in their routine a potentially modifiable conduct of the emotional
      trauma of a surgery, is the use of the preoperative advice and orientation, in order to
      attain an ability to increase the client's satisfaction, to facilitate the recovery, decrease
      the rate of complications without increasing reintegration, decrease hospitalization time and
      health costs without additional patient risk. There is a belief among surgeons that
      preoperative counseling and counseling is vitally important for a post-operative outcome.
      Despite this, there is a paucity of well-conducted studies that examine the importance of the
      need for preoperative counseling with detailed information to analyze the yearnings and needs
      as well as the emotional impact. In addition, there are few studies evaluating the emotional
      impact and impact in the postoperative period in general of detailed preoperative counseling
      in patients with gynecological tumors submitted to laparotomy and minimally invasive surgery.
      For these reasons, this study aims to evaluate whether the application of detailed and clear
      preoperative counseling and education about the surgical procedure to be performed, as well
      as all the perioperative guidelines that involve the procedure versus the usual preoperative
      orientation and preoperative, can have an impact on the level of anxiety of the patient and
      the companion, as well as assess the degree of satisfaction of the companion.
