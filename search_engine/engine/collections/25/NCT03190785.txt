      signaling pathway resulting in lower metabolic rate and hence a propensity to weight loss
      non-responsiveness.

      This hypothesis will be addressed in this pilot project via the following Specific Aims:

      Aim 1. Determine if dietary benzoate attenuates leptin levels and metabolic rate in human
      subjects. Twenty heathy adolescents and young adults (age 18-25 yrs.) who are either
      overweight (BMI 25-29.9) or obese (BMI â‰¥ 30) will be studied. Following a 14 day period of
      avoiding benzoate containing beverages (washout period) subjects will then consume 36 oz./day
      of benzoate containing beverages (~ 3.9 - 4.5 mg benzoate/kg body weight per day exposure)
      for 7 days (exposure period). Fasting plasma samples will be collected pre and post-exposure
      and leptin, adiponectin, insulin and glucose levels will be compared. Indirect calorimetry
      will be used to compare resting energy expenditure pre-and post-exposure.

      Aim 2. Validate the use of urinary hippurate and glycine to assess benzoate exposure. An
      early morning void urine samples will be collected pre-and post-exposure. Non-targeted
      NMR-based metabolomics analysis will be used to compare changes in individual subject's
      urinary metabolome using pre- and post-exposure as the "phenotypic" anchors.
