      per day. The study treatment with cabozantinib will be divided into 28 day cycles. A member
      of the study staff will give the subject a drug diary and explain to the subject how to use
      it to record doses of cabozantinib. This diary will also contain specific instructions about
      how the subject take cabozantinib.

      Every 28 days the subject will undergo the following procedures: Physical examination,
      questions about any side effects the subject may have, blood samples for routine laboratory
      tests and research tests, urine sample, electrocardiogram (EKG), and questionnaires to
      measure quality of life and level of pain. Every two months the subject will undergo a CT
      scan or MRI to evaluate the subjects disease.

      The investigators would like the subject to return to the study clinic for follow-up
      procedures about 4-5 weeks after the last dose of cabozantinib.

      The subject can continue to receive the study drug for as long as their disease does not
      worsen and the subject do not experience unacceptable side effects.
