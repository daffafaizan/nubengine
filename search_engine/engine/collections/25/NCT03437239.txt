      tourniquet, leads to beneficial changes in muscle strength at low resistance and minimal
      stress on the nearby joint. Early research further indicates that it improves systemic bone
      mineral density with change in bone turnover markers. This novel resistance training has the
      potential to improve muscle strength and bone density in individuals who are medically unable
      to perform high resistance exercises typically required to improve these attributes. Our
      study will examine the effect of occlusion training on bone density and function of the upper
      extremity following a bicep tenodesis. The primary objective of the intervention is to
      achieve improved bone density and accelerated recovery of upper extremity function as
      assessed using measures such as validated questionnaires, functional outcome testing,
      strength testing, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.
