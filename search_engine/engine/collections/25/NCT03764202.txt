      chromatography mass spectrometry).The separation was carried on Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus
      C18 column(2.1×50 mm, 3.5 μm)with a mobile phase of 10 mmol ammonium formate(A)and
      methanol(B), and the elution conditions were optimized as follows：linear gradient 0→0.30 min,
      A:B=50:50; 0.30→0.31 min, A:B=50:50→10:90; 3.00→3.10 min, A:B=10:90→50:50; 3.1→6.5min,
      A:B=50:50; The flowing rate was 0.2 mL•min-1, column temperature was 30 ℃, injection volume
      was 5 μL. ESI source was applied and operated in positive ion mode. Quantitative
      determination was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of m/z 387.2 → m/z 238.2
      for sufentanil, and m/z 337.2 → m/z 158.2 for fentanyl.
