      Primary

        -  Determine time to disease progression in patients with previously untreated metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of the proportion of patients with â‰¥ a
           50% decline in the CA19-9 biomarker, in these patients.

        -  Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate serum markers of angiogenesis and circulating tumor micrometastases with
           clinical outcome of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes, cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, and
      bevacizumab* IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may
      receive additional study treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

      NOTE: *Patients may continue to receive other components of therapy if bevacizumab is
      discontinued due to toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then monthly
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
