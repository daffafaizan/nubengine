      abdominal incision. Gastrointestinal surgery may be performed to treat an abdominal aortic
      aneurysm, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, gallbladder disease, bile duct disease and
      morbid obesity. Although less invasive laparoscopic procedures are performed when warranted,
      open abdominal surgery is required for certain indications and for more complicated or
      advanced cases.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes for cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.

      This study will compare the amount of narcotic pain medication required after surgery in
      patients who receive the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant or a plain collagen sponge.
