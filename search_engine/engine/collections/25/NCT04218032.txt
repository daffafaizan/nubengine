      technology for assessing haemodynamic status measured from the fingertip using oscillometry.
      . As the finger pressing pressure is ramped up and then slowly down, an oscillometric
      response is recorded. From this signal the mean arterial pressure is found from which
      systolic and diastolic pressure is computed along with the full pressure waveform.
