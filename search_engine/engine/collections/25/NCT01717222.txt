      stones. For pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy both intraperitoneal and
      intravenous administration of lignocaine has been used. But it is not clear from the existing
      literature which form of administration is more effective for pain relief. Hence this study
      has been undertaken with the following hypothesis : Intravenous lignocaine is superior to
      intraperitoneal lignocaine for postoperative pain relief and minimizing the stress response
      in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      In this study the effect of intraperitoneal and intravenous lignocaine will be assessed based
      on the postoperative pain scores, total analgesic requirement, stress response in the form of
      total leukocyte count, c-reactive protein levels,return of bowel activity.
