    
      This is a phase II, single-center, open-label, trial to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
      PSMA-targeted 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in a
      screening population. 150 biopsy-na√Øve patients with an elevated PSA (2-10 ng/mL) will be
      enrolled in this study.

      Within 28 days of informed consent, patients will undergo an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. All scans
      will be read by a single experienced radiologist who will identify regions of interest (ROI)
      with discrete radiotracer uptake. The maximum SUV value (SUVmax) of each ROI will be
      recorded. For patients without a detectable ROI, the mean SUV (SUVmean) of a 1-2 cm volume of
      the prostate will instead be recorded.

      One to 28 days following PET/CT imaging, a systematic 12 to 14 core TRUS-guided prostate
      biopsy will be performed. Immediately following completion of systematic TRUS biopsies,
      fusion-targeted biopsies of all PET and/or MRI visible lesions will be performed, taking an
      additional 2 to 3 cores from each radiographic ROI. All biopsy cores will be assessed for
      Gleason score and percent cancer involvement.
