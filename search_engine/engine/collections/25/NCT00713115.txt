      in smaller incisions than conventional 5- to 12-mm instruments, and thus better cosmesis. It
      may further reduce postoperative pain, hospital stay, and recovery time.

      All operations were performed with the lateral transperitoneal approach. A 12-mm port was
      created near the umbilicus for a 30-degree telescope, and another two(for left lesions) or
      three (for right lesions) 2-mm working ports (Tyco Healthcare, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA)
      were created along the ipsilateral subcostal region. Careful dissection was done with the use
      of a 2-mm hook or scissors electrocoagulator. The adrenal vein of the lesion side was
      isolated and controlled with a 2-mm mini-bipolar coagulation apparatus (Tyco Healthcare) for
      a long segment. The vein was then transected closer to the adrenal gland, leaving the
      coagulated stump at the renal vein or vena cava as long as possible, even when a short right
      adrenal vein was encountered. Then the adrenal gland with the tumor was dissected from its
      surrounding tissues after several tiny vessels were transected with the needlescopic
      instruments mentioned above. The specimen was put into a retrieval bag and removed through
      the umbilical port.
