      neurocognitive measures and a quality of life instrument following radiotherapy in patients
      with brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life and
      neurocognitive function is assessed before study, at completion of radiotherapy, and at 1
      month after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 months.
