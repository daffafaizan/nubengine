      stimulated to initiate the growth of T-lymphocytes, transduced with retrovirus L2SN
      containing iduronate-2-sulfatase, and reinfused into the patient.

      Patients receive 12 monthly infusions of these retroviral-mediated gene transduced
      lymphocytes with the first three infusions in a dose escalation format.

      Patients are monitored for at least 2 hours after completion of each infusion. Patients are
      followed at 1 year after treatment, and then until death.
