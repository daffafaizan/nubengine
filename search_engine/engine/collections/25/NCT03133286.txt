      developed during the previous pilot study, the study will collect pre-, during, and
      post-irradiation blood samples and associated clinical and self-reported information from up
      to five hundred (500) subjects for analysis. Patients with a diagnosis of primary
      gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), or gynecological (GYN) cancer requiring radiation
      treatment to the primary disease site will be included in the study. Combining chemotherapy
      is allowed.

      Blood samples for this study will be collected from cancer patients scheduled to undergo
      radiation therapy prior to, during, and after treatment. Approximately 150μL of blood per
      time point will be obtained via fingerstick remotely, from the participant's home or doctor's
      office; participation in this study will not affect any aspect of patient treatment. Samples
      will be collected using DxTerity's proprietary DxCollect® MCD Fingerstick Kit (MCD).
