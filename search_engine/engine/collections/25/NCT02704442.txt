      postoperative maladaptive behaviors such as nightmares, separation anxiety, eating problems,
      and increased fear of doctors. There is a significant amount of research looking at day of
      surgery anxiety and pain in children and possible modifiers. Very little work has explored
      the effect of maladaptive behaviors with follow up physician visits. Strabismus surgery is
      particularly important as children require early and regular follow up assessments after
      surgery for optimal outcome. These assessments are meticulous and require good patient
      cooperation in order to obtain useful information for the pediatric ophthalmologist.

      The study hypothesis is that pediatric patients with increased levels of anxiety on the day
      of surgery, in particular at point of anesthetic induction, will demonstrate decreased
      compliance with assessment in ophthalmology clinic postoperatively. The investigators expect
      this decrease in compliance will be evident based on changes seen on the ophthalmology clinic
      compliance scores generated pre and postoperatively.

      The proposed study will be a prospective cross sectional study. Investigators will be
      measuring compliance in the ophthalmology clinic pre and postoperative and relating any
      changes in compliance with anxiety levels on the day of surgery.
