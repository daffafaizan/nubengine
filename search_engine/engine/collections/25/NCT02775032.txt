      1) to conduct the Phase II trial with GPs who will facilitate a structured ACP session with
      patients with a serious or life-threatening illness versus usual care and 2) to evaluate and
      validate the ACP intervention in terms of feasibility, acceptance to GPs and patients with a
      serious or life-threatening illness, and preliminary proof of effectiveness

      Method

      The implementation and preliminary evaluation of this intervention will be done by following
      the steps of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework on complex intervention designs.
      This framework proposes a stepwise approach going from phase 0 to phase IV.

      Phase 0-I were previously conducted by the research team and comprised the development of the
      intervention. This project proposal comprises phase II (exploratory trial) in which the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated.
