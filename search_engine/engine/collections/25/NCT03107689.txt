      intravenous lipid emulsion therapy. A secondary objective is to determine the mortality in
      this critically ill population of individuals.

      Previous literature to date has focused on animal studies or has been primarily limited to
      case reports or small case series. This prospectively collected data set will permit a much
      more detailed description of the use of lipid, its potential benefits, and potential harms.
