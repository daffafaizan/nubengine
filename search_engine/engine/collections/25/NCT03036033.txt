      after a neurological injury. It assists the hand to open, which is crucial for people to
      grasp, and release everyday objects. It may improve function by doing this but may also help
      people with severe weakness take part more fully in therapy sessions. This glove is already
      marketed and is being used in some NHS sites. This trial will assess how it could be used in
      NHS practice in acute stroke patients and will develop a plan to implement this.
