      children and 6% adults in the USA , . AD is characterized by skin barrier disruption, an
      aberrant adaptive immune response (i.e., Th2 polarized) to environmental allergens,
      susceptibility to cutaneous bacterial infections and intractable itch , . The intense
      pruritus and cutaneous infections contribute to the morbidity of AD and are major drivers of
      the reduced quality-of-life associated with this disease , . In the World Health Organization
      2010 Global Burden of Disease survey, AD has ranked first among common skin diseases . So
      far, AD treatments have targeted inflammation with the widespread use of topical and more
      intermittent use of systemic corticosteroids. In summary, despite its high prevalence,
      effects on quality-of-life and economic burden - there are few effective treatments for AD.

      Doxycycline are tetracycline antibiotics broadly used systemically to treat
      inflammatory-dermatologic conditions. Several studies in human and animal models have shown
      doxycycline have anti-inflammatory and pro-healing properties, mainly by blocking tissue
      proteolytic activity. Doxycycline have been reported to nonselectively inhibit members of the
      metalloproteinases (MMP) superfamily [reviewed in , ]. In addition to this direct inhibitory
      activity, doxycycline indirectly prevents tryptic kallikreins activation by MMPs . Growing
      body of evidence suggests that the tetracycline might also directly downregulate Protease
      Activator receptor (PAR)-2 expression and function, which was also found to play a role in
      induction of local inflammatory mediators . Importantly, the doxycycline antimicrobial
      activity could lead to reduced Staphylococcus infection/colonization in AD skin, a known
      trigger of AD flares
