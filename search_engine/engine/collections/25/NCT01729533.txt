      as suffering from unexplained infertility. These couples present normal semen analysis.

      It has been reported that even infertile patients with normozoospermic parameters can have
      higher values of DNA damage than fertile controls.

      It has been proposed that the use of ''invisible damaged'' spermatozoa could result in
      fertilization failure, impaired normal embryo development, reduced implantation and pregnancy
      rates.

      The motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) allows the detection of sperm
      vacuoles that seems to be related to sperm DNA damage.

      The investigators hypothesized that couples with unexplained infertility could benefit from
      the injection of spermatozoa selected under high-magnification (x6600)
