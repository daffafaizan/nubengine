    
      Participants with sickle cell disease (SCD) will be divided into three study groups depending
      on their history of parvovirus B19 infection. Each will have blood drawn and/or
      nasopharyngeal wash which will provide the biological material for evaluation by assay.

        -  Group A participants will have a documented prior history of parvovirus B19 infection
           (aplastic crisis).

        -  Group B participants will have no documented history of parvovirus B19 infection
           (aplastic crisis) and will serve as the negative controls for the investigation of the
           relationship between the VP1u ELISA and the gold standard neutralization assay for
           parvovirus B19 infection.

        -  Group C participants will have suspected and/or confirmed acute parvovirus B19 infection
           (febrile illness with anemia without adequate compensatory reticulocytosis).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To estimate the correlation between the VP1u enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
           and the gold standard neutralization assay for parvovirus B19 infection in subjects with
           SCD who have had a documented infection from parvovirus B19 causing aplastic crisis.

        -  To identify a cut-off for negativity in the VP1u ELISA and in the neutralization assay
           in subjects with SCD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To characterize the performance characteristics of the VP1u ELISA, including sensitivity
           and specificity.

        -  To describe the kinetics of antibody responses generated following an acute parvovirus
           B19 infection in the serum and in the nasal mucosa of patients with SCD.
