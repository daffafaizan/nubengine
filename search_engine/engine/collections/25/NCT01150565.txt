      multiple centers in Canada. LiRIS is being developed to provide drug therapy directly into
      the urinary bladder. LiRIS contains Lidocaine, a marketed drug (approved by Health Canada)
      which is commonly used for local (skin or oral)anaesthesia. LiRIS is designed to release a
      controlled amount of lidocaine while in the bladder over a 2 week period.

      Two dose groups of approximately 10 patients per group will be enrolled into the study; the
      first group of patients will receive low dose LiRIS, and the second group will receive high
      dose LiRIS. All patients receive LiRIS treatment for 14 days, and clinic follow-up at 7 and
      14 days after treatment. Additional telephone follow-up occurs at approximately 6 and 10
      weeks after LiRIS treatment. The maximum duration of participation, including a screening
      period of up to 14 days, will be 104 days.
