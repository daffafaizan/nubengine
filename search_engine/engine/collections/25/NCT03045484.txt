      of the intensity of pain. CRO is effective for 12 h, so that the patient takes it only twice
      a day.The minimum oral unit of CRO is a 10 mg tablet, so the minimum daily dose was 20 mg.
      Thus, we began at a dose of 20 mg by default. When the pain worsened, the dose was quickly
      titrated.When a patient who was suffering from moderate pain in the mouth, pharynx, or larynx
      consented to take oxycodone, oxycodone was begun at the level of moderate pain. We called
      this the mild group. In contrast, those patients who did not ask for oxycodone until the pain
      reached a severe level were called the severe group. Because all patients agreed to use an
      opioid at some point, the patients were classified into two groups, moderate and severe,
      according to when the opioid was introduced.

      Total dose of oxycodone was defined as the total dose of oxycodone taking during the
      treatment of chemoradiotherapy. Pain Remission Rate was defined as pain remission after 24h
      from the start of opioid administration.Evaluating quality of life were conducted once every
      two weeks.We also evaluated the weight loss as parameters for food intake once a week,until
      the radiotherapy.All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software.
