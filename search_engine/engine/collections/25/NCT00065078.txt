      inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight infants, infant mortality, and maternal morbidity
      and mortality. Children born as a result of unplanned pregnancies are at greater risk for
      poor outcomes such as poor mental health and developmental disabilities. This research
      project will determine whether providing contraception in the home can reduce the incidence
      of unintended pregnancy in low income and minority women. The project will also determine
      whether delaying a pelvic exam encourages or discourages the utilization of clinic-based
      preventive services to screen for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and cervical cancer.

      Participants will be randomized to either an experimental group or a comparison group. Each
      participant will receive family planning counseling during a home visit by a community health
      nurse. Participants in the experimental group will be offered a three-month supply of oral
      contraceptives or a depo-provera shot; both forms of contraceptives will be delivered during
      home visits. Each participant will complete a survey during the initial visit and during a
      1-year follow-up. The study will last approximately three years.
