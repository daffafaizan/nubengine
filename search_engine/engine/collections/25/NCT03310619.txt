    
      During Phase 1, different arms may be opened to test JCAR017 in combination with combination
      agent(s) in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL. Within each arm, different doses
      and schedules of JCAR017 and the combination agent(s) may be tested in several cohorts and
      subcohorts per arm. During Phase 2 of the study, the expansion of any dose level and schedule
      for any arm that has been shown to be safe may occur.

      Arm A will test JCAR017 in combination with Durvalumab Arm B will test JCAR017 in combination
      with CC-122 Arm C will test JCAR017 in combination with CC-220 (iberdomide ) Arm D will test
      JCAR017 in combination with ibrutinib.

      All subjects from Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be followed for 24 months following JCAR017
      infusion. Post-study follow-up for survival, relapse, long-term toxicity (including new
      malignancies), and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term follow-up
      (LTFU) protocol for up to 15 years after the JCAR017 dose as per health authority regulatory
      guidelines.
