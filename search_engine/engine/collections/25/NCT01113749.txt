      decision-making about feeding options for patients with advanced dementia. Surrogate
      decision-makers in the nursing homes randomized to the intervention will review the decision
      aid and be prompted to discuss it with the primary health care provider, while those in the
      control sites receive usual care. We measure the immediate, 1 and 3 month effects of the
      decision aid on the quality of surrogate decision-making for nursing home residents with
      advanced dementia.
