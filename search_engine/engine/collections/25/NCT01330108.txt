      development and subsequent instruction of oral endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA). The
      first approved ERA, bosentan (Tracleer, Actelion, Inc.) is an effective drug widely used
      throughout the world in the therapy of PAH. Newer ERA's, with purported advantages over the
      first approved drug have since been tested and subsequently been approved for the therapy of
      PAH in the USA and other countries including ambrisentan (Letairis, Gilead Sciences, Inc.).
      However, there is little data available on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the
      elective change from oral bosentan to oral ambrisentan in PAH.
