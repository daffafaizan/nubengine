      in cardiovascular and metabolic function leading to substantial individual burden (increased
      health care cost, loss of work productivity). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), two common mental health disorders, can cause increase
      cardiovascular disease risk due to chronic increases or fluctuations in heart rate, blood
      pressure, stress hormones, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) is a disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive
      reaction resulting from exposure to severe psychological stress. It has been revealed that
      individuals with PTSD, in addition to adverse mental health symptoms, also possess higher
      prevalence rates for physical comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and
      metabolic syndrome. Taken together, these PTSD-induced comorbidities result in a significant
      increase in the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) when compared to
      individuals without PTSD. Anxiety disorders, the most prevalent mental health issue in the
      United States, is associated an increased incidence of hypertension and heart disease. This
      increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is thought to derive from an overactivation of
      the sympathetic nervous system that results in a predominately pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory
      cardiovascular environment. Peripheral vascular dysfunction, or the inability of the blood
      vessels to adequately respond to specific stimuli, is a factor closely related to CVD.
      Therefore, this study will focus on a younger population with PTSD or GAD in an attempt to
      ascertain the presence of peripheral vascular dysfunction and the magnitude to which two
      potential primary contributors (autonomic dysfunction, oxidative stress) are involved in this
      dysfunction.
