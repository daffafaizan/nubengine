      leading malignancy both in incidence and mortality.

      In the light of existing knowledge, the investigators propose a phase II open label, two arm
      study in patients presenting with K-Ras wild-type metastatic colorectal tumours in the first
      line setting. The standard combination of irinotecan plus infusional 5-FU/LV (FOLFIRI) and
      cetuximab will be given to all patients entering the study. As the investigators hypothesize
      that increasing the dose of cetuximab might increase the intensity of skin reactions that
      directly correlates with outcome, in patients experiencing no skin toxicity, the dose of
      cetuximab will be escalated from 250 mg/m2 to 350 mg/m2 and then up to 500 mg/m2, in order to
      better define the effect of dose escalation in the first-line setting in a K-Ras wild type
      tumour population and in an attempt to increase efficacy.

      Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed to document PK parameters of cetuximab in patients
      from both arms in selected centers.

      Translational research studies are planned for all patients. Some more in depth molecular
      testing will be performed in a subset of patients from whom three serial tissue samples from
      accessible metastases by biopsy are available.
