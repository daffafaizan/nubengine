      control examinations with CMG (urodynamic examination). The manipulation may cause urinary
      tract infections which have to be treated. Patients often noticed an infection after a CMG
      examination. Aim of this study is the determination of the infection rate and germs. Also
      should be noticed the pre-interventional infections and differences between the causing
      germs. Simultaneously the investigators test the reliability of the quicktest for urinary
      infection. Additionally the investigators will examine the Quality of Life in patients with
      neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
