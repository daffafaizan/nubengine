      measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). It needs injection of 99mTc labeled
      albumin or red cells and unfortunately injected activities must be relatively considerable (â‰ˆ
      900 MBq) for image recording times shorter than 10 minutes. This examination is thus quite
      irradiant (10 mSv) but this inconvenient could be eliminated with new semiconductor cameras.

      These new cameras allow a better image quality than conventional Anger cameras (better
      spatial resolution and energy) and their detection sensitivity is almost 10 times higher.
      However, these new cameras can record only 3D images whereas with conventional cameras
      angioscintigraphy is usually performed in bidimensional way with a possible higher precision
      and reproducibility of LVEF measurement.

      In this study, patients needing the routine examination for LVEF measurements will undergo
      the conventional examination followed by examination with semiconductor camera (without
      supplementary injection).

      If LVEF measurement with semiconductor camera will be as precise and reproducible as with
      conventional camera, angioscintigraphy could be performed with these new cameras with a lower
      body irradiation of patients.
