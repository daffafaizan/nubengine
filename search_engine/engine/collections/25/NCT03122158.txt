      disorder since March 2009. Although Wagner and colleagues reported that escitalopram has a
      tendency toward positive findings for the treatment of pediatric patients with major
      depressive disorder in their study it was found that this effect has not reached a
      statistical significance. Noteworthy the authors reported statistical significance for
      escitalopram when they only included adolescent subgroup into further analysis. However,
      there are also clinical trials in the literature reporting the effectiveness of escitalopram
      on adolescence major depressive disorder (Emslie, Findling). It was indicated that no serious
      adverse effect of escitalopram was reported in these studies comparing escitalopram with
      placebo. In this study the authors aimed to investigate the effect and reliability of the
      drug in the treatment of adolescents with major depressive disorder and/or anxiety disorders.
      Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs are indicated for the first-line
      treatment of anxiety disorders. The authors included escitalopram for the treatment of
      pediatric anxiety disorders.
