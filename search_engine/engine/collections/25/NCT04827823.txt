      posterior multi-surface amalgam (AM) and resin composite (RC) restorations placed by dental
      students over a five-year period. Materials and Methods: A total of 119 multi-surface Class
      II restorations (three or more surfaces) placed by third and fourth year students will be
      evaluated (AM: n = 69 and RC: n = 50). Restorations were assessed clinically according to the
      USPHS criteria by two independent evaluators using mirrors and probes. Data will be analyzed
      using Chisquare, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests at a 0.05 level of significance.
