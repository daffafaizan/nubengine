      vital. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, patients with HF are at high risk for death &
      hospitalization. Over 25% of patients with systolic HF have dyssynchronous ventricular
      contraction that results in paradoxical septal motion, further impairing left ventricular
      (LV) function & HF progression. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) synchronizes
      ventricular mechanical activity, improves cardiac output & reduces HF symptoms. However, ~50%
      of patients do not clearly respond to CRT. Sub-optimal placement of the LV pacing lead
      appears to be an important reason for non-response.

      Screening. Mechanical synchrony is vitally important in optimizing CRT response. Patients
      will be pre-screened with echocardiograms (echo) & CRT provided to only those with
      dyssynchrony. The predicted rate of CRT response in patients pre-screened for dyssynchrony is
      estimated at 65%.

      CRT response. The combined use of a valid & simple measure of functional capacity with a
      reproducible measure of LV volume is optimal in identifying CRT responders. These outcomes
      will be assessed using the Specific Activity Scale & radionuclide angiography (RNA),
      respectively.

      Primary hypothesis. Targeted LV lead placement will result in an increased probability of CRT
      response at 52 weeks vs. usual (lateral wall) lead placement. CRT response will be defined as
      ≥ 10% relative reduction in LV end systolic volume & ≥ 1 Specific Activity Scale class
      improvement.
