        -  Compare local and distant recurrences in patients with mid-rectal cancer treated with
           wide mesorectal surgical excision with straight colorectal anastomosis versus total
           mesorectal surgical excision with colonic J pouch coloanal anastomosis.

        -  Compare the functional, physiological, and anatomical outcomes in these patients treated
           with these two surgical procedures.

        -  Compare disease-free survival and overall survival in these patients treated with these
           two surgical procedures.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection with a wide mesorectal excision followed by a
           straight colorectal anastomosis.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgical resection with a total mesorectal excision followed by
           a colonic J pouch coloanal anastomosis. Patients then receive a temporary ileostomy
           which is closed 6 weeks later.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 4-6 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 800 patients (400 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
