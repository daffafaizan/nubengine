      I. Determine whether the objective response rate is â‰¥ 20% in patients with advanced
      anaplastic thyroid cancer treated with sorafenib.

      II. Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety
      profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic predictors of
      response to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed for survival.
