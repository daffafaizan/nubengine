    
      This research is a random, opening and parallel-controlled clinical test. Tested device
      model: The EG-UR5 ultrasonic endoscope manufactured by SonoSscope Medical Crop. That used
      with the HD-500 image processor, HDL-500X light source and S50Exp ultrasonic color doppler
      instrument .

      Compared device model: The GF-UE260-ME2 ultrasonic endoscope manufactured by Olympus and its
      compatible light source, image processor and ultrasonic instrument.

      To scientifically compare the clinical performances of the test model and the compared model,
      the enrolled objects would be randomly distributed to the tested group and the compared group
      to conducted the examination with the tested model and the compared model respectively.

      EUS will be performed in the standard fashion by one of the experienced endosonographers in
      the unit. Once the EUS is complete, the procedure will be stopped and the echoendoscope
      withdrawn from the patient.

        1. Check Points Providing optical images of the human upper gestrointesinal tract
           (including esophagus, stomach and duodenum) for observing, diagnosis and treatment, and
           for the ultrasonic check and diagnosis for the upper gastrointestinal tract and
           surrounding organs.

        2. Test Items 1. Ultrasonic and endoscopic image quality assessment 2. Device
           controllability assessment 3. System safety assessment 4. System stability assessment

      The data are recorded in the CRF, including patient information, clinical assessment for the
      usage of the endoscope and device operation, thus to perform a comprehensive assessment
      whether the safety and validity of this product can meet the clinical requirements.
