      prostate cancer and kidney cancer. Systemic chemotherapy may weaken the immune system
      reducing the potential for response to LDN. Therefore, patients must either have not had
      previous chemotherapy or patients must not have received more than 1 prior chemotherapy
      regimen which must have been completed at least 6 months prior to LDN. Systemic chemotherapy
      has at best modest activity in melanoma, CRPC and renal cancer.

        -  Melanoma will be evaluated since the responding patient at the Miriam Hospital had
           melanoma. Immunomodulatory agents such as ipilimumab have already demonstrated a
           survival advantage in melanoma.

        -  Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC): It is common in CRPC for patients to have
           rising PSA after failure of androgen deprivation. These patients may be asymptomatic or
           minimally symptomatic and there is reluctance to initiate treatment with systemic
           chemotherapy with standard docetaxel since this agent has substantial toxicity and will
           impair quality of life. Waiting until symptomatic disease progression in patients with
           CRPC and rising PSA is a commonly utilized strategy. These patients are excellent
           candidates for a treatment with minimal toxicity such as LDA. The immunomodulatory agent
           Sipuleucel also improves survival in prostate cancer suggesting that an agent such as
           LDN could also be helpful.

        -  Renal cancer will also be studied since this is a disease that has activity with
           immunomodulants such as IL-2 and interferon. Targeted therapies are generally used for
           renal cancer. Chemotherapy has minimal activity so most patients are chemotherapy-naive.
