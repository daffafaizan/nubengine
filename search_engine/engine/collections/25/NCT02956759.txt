      only 10% of Chinese rural-dwellers with DR receive therapy. The current standard approach to
      treatment of DR often requires patients to return for multiple examinations over years,
      before they reach trial-proven criteria for treatment. This long process is ill-suited to
      support good compliance with care in low-resource settings. Our recent published review
      suggests that earlier PRP treatment, which could reduce the burden of compliance, may be
      clinically effective and cost effective, but the current evidence base is insufficient to
      make a firm recommendation.
