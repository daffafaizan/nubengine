      HCL (OROS MPH) is safe and effective in improving Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) symptoms in adults with ADHD when compared to placebo as demonstrated using specific
      study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor investigator knows the name
      of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROS MPH using the optimal dose for each adult
      patient in the study with ADHD. The primary efficacy variable in this study is the change
      from baseline to final evaluation using the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale
      (AISRS) to measure patient ADHD symptoms. Participants will also be assessed for adverse
      events throughout the study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral OROS MPH 18 mg or
      matching placebo at baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every week until an
      optimal dose is achieved, up to the maximum of 72 mg/day of OROS MPH or matching placebo.
      Eligible patients will remain in the study for a maximum of 6 weeks.
