    
      Radiographic images of patients who have been indicated for cone-beam computed tomography for
      the upper jaw for various reasons (such as impacted teeth, sinusitis, skeletal anomalies)
      will be reviewed retrospectively. Facial measurements (lower face height, midface height,
      inter-zygomatic distance, inter-pupillary distance, interalar distance, epicanthus distance,
      the distance between commissures) of the patients who received cone beam computed tomography
      will be measured in the clinic. Mesiodistal distance, buccal palatal distance, root length,
      pulp volume of maxillary sixth tooth will be measured using cone beam computed tomography.
      The data obtained will be compared.
