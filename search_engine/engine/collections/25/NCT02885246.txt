      established in Panama dedicated to health research and disease prevention. It has been
      performing virological isolations of influenza and is a part of the World Health Organisation
      (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and a direct collaborator of
      the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

      From 2010 a sentinel surveillance program is being conducted in Panama within the ICGES to
      collect data on influenza and other respiratory viruses using CDC guidance for Respiratory
      Disease Surveillance. This study aims to utilize this data source for analyzing the burden of
      influenza within the region.
