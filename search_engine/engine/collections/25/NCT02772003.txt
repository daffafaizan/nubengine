    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of the HCV DNA vaccine, consisting of INO-8000 (HCV
      antigen DNA) alone or co-administered with INO-9012 (interleukin [IL]-12 adjuvant DNA) (DNA
      plasmid encoding interleukin-12 INO-9012).

      II. To identify a dose of INO-9012 (IL-12 adjuvant DNA) for co-administration with INO-8000
      (HCV antigen DNA) based on induction of HCV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production by
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 26 weeks compared to baseline in HCV-infected
      participants.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces a > 1 log
      decrease (or undetectable) in HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level at weeks 14 and 26.

      II. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces an
      end-of-treatment undetectable HCV RNA (end-of-treatment virologic response - EVR) at 26 weeks
      and a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 36 weeks.

      III. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces other
      parameters of cluster of differentiation (CD)8 and CD4 T lymphocyte responses as measured by
      flow cytometry, and antibody responses to HCV antigen at weeks 14 and 26.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of INO-9012.

      Patients receive INO-8000 intramuscularly (IM) and DNA plasmid encoding interleukin-12
      INO-9012 IM (dose levels 2-4) followed by electroporation (EP) at day 0 and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 24.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 48 and 76.
