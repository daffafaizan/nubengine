      and liver stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) scheduled for oligometastatic breast cancer
      patients unsuitable for surgery with age major than 18 years old and with adequate
      performance status (ECOG), using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of this
      technique is the ability to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumour's target while
      reducing doses to normal tissue, optimizing the therapeutic window.
