      block. Patients of Group N received local anesthetics received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine 1 ml
      hyaluronidase (75 IU), and 4mg of Nalbuphine in 1 ml of saline (total 8 ml) and patients of
      Group C received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU) and1 ml saline (total 8
      ml).

      Addition of nalbuphine to bupivacaine in peribulbar block is associated with reduced the time
      of onset of globe akinesia, increased the duration of globe akinesia and analgesia with
      better postoperative pain relief
