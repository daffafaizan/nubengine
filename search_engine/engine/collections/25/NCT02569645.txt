      therapy (CRT) followed by surgery and further adjuvant chemotherapy. The pathologic complete
      responses associated with neoadjuvant CRT are 10-20%. The prognosis of patients undergoing
      neoadjuvant CRT is associated to the extent of post-treatment tumour regression, the final
      primary tumour stage and presence of involved lymph nodes in the surgical specimen. This data
      suggests that treatments that enhance the pathological response may result in improvements in
      survival.

      Overwhelming preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that statins demonstrate anticancer
      properties and sensitize cancer tissues and protects normal tissues to the effects of
      radiation. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of rosuvastatin to standard
      CRT for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer may improve the pathological response
      rate. This protocol describes an open-label single-arm phase 2 study designed to test this
      hypothesis. Moreover, this study will also identify genetic, serological, and pathological
      biomarkers that may be both prognostic and predictive of response and toxicity to treatment.
