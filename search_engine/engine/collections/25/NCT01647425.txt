      of a first lung or head and neck cancer significantly improves the risk of experiencing a
      second cancer, and largely affects the long term survival. Addiction intervention programs
      should be personalized according to the patient's profile, with the aim to develop more
      sustained intervention and monitoring in patients identified at higher risk of not
      spontaneously stopping harmful substance use. As of today, the trajectories of smoking and
      drinking habits and the risk factors for persisting smoking or drinking habits have been
      insufficiently explored among patients with a first lung or head and neck cancer.

      The ALTAK study aims to depict the rate of tobacco smokers 12 months after the initial
      diagnosis of a first lung or head and neck cancer. The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to depict the rate of alcohol users 12 months after the initial diagnosis of a H&N
           cancer

        -  to depict the rate of tobacco smokers at cancer diagnosis

        -  to depict the rate of alcohol users at cancer diagnosis

        -  to determine the social, motivational, psychiatric, tobacco-related, alcohol-related,
           and cannabis-related features associated with stopping tobacco in the year following the
           diagnosis of a first TARC.
