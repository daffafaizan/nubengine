      central events in ALS. ALS is characterized by the presence of misfolded proteins prone to
      oligomerize into aggregates, which exert a toxic effect by affecting several intracellular
      functions. Heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8) recognizes and promotes the autophagy-mediated
      removal of misfolded mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 fragments from ALS motor neurons (MNs). Moreover,
      HSPB8-BAG3-HSP70 maintains the so called "granulostasis", a surveillance mechanism that
      avoids the conversion of dynamic stress granules (SGs) into aggregation-prone assemblies,
      which are a hallmark of ALS.

      Colchicine enhances the expression of HSPB8 and of several autophagy players while blocking
      TDP-43 accumulation in neurons. Moreover, given the cross-talk between infalmmation and
      autophagy, the well-known antinflammatory action of Cochicine may contribute to cell
      homeostasis.

      Based on these premises, this is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter (9 MND Centres in Italy: 2 centres in Milan, Pavia, Turin, Modena, Padua, Rome,
      Naples, Bari), clinical trial to test efficacy of Colchicine in ALS.
