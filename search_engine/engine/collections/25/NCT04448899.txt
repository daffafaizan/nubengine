        -  A 3 months, prospective interventional study.

        -  Sixty ambulatory, clinically stable symptomatic patients with systolic chronic HF (≥ 4
           weeks), on optimized standard medical therapy were consecutively included and randomly
           allocated to the ivabradine group (n=30) and non-ivabradine group (n=30).

        -  The baseline evaluation comprised physical examination, NYHA class, 12-lead
           electrocardi¬ography (ECG), Echocardiography, blood sampling for laboratory
           measurements, including NT-Pro BNP and Neopterin.

        -  Patients in the Ivabradine group were administered Ivabradine 5 mg twice daily and doses
           (2.5, 5, 7.5 mg) were to be adjusted upwards or downwards at every visit according to HR
           at rest and tolerability.

        -  Patients were followed up after 1 week of initiation of ivabradine therapy then monthly
           till the end of the study.

        -  Peripheral venous blood samples were drawn between 8 and 9 am after a 30-min rest in the
           supine position. Serum samples were frozen at -80°C until assay.

        -  Levels of NT-Pro BNP and Neopterin were detected using ELISA kits as prescribed by
           manufacturer.

        -  Statistical tests appropriate to the study will be conducted to evaluate significance of
           results
