      treatment which has not been fully proven to be superior to each other. Before considering
      surgical approaches, trying conservative approaches is emphasized. While literature showed us
      that nighttime pain is an important musculoskeletal symptom, may be associated with local
      inflammation, it is an important feature during the treatment planning. TP-DNT had positive
      effects on night pain and SIR in SPS. It was seen that the treatment satisfaction level of
      participants was high. Despite these positive findings, there is need for further studies in
      which sample size is increased, control group is added, and long-term follow-up is planned.
