    
      PXT3003 is a fixed dose combination of (RS)-baclofen, naltrexone hydrochloride and D-sorbitol
      selected via a Systems Biology approach and developed by Pharnext, with the aim to limit the
      production of PMP22 and protect/improve axonal function in patients with CMT1A. On September
      18th 2017, PXT3003 dose 2 was prematurely discontinued, due to an unexpected investigational
      medicinal product quality event (failed month 18 stability testing). This resulted in a large
      proportion of missing data that led us to reconsider the efficacy analysis that was initially
      planned in the protocol.The independent data safety monitoring committee did not identify any
      safety concern on September 5th 2017. All patients randomised to dose 2 were requested to
      undergo the end of study visit, and were offered to enter the extension study
      (CLN-PXT3003-03).
