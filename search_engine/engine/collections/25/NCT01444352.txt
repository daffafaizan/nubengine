      pneumococcal vaccine. After safety assessment of this cohort during a 24-hour in-unit
      observation period, additional cohorts will receive two injections of the study vaccine 30
      days apart, at three dose levels, in ascending doses by cohort, pending safety review at each
      dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each vaccination.
