      Androgenetic alopecia which are minoxidil, and finasteride. Both medications must be taken
      indefinitely for benefits to persist. Hair transplantation is the only current successful
      permanent option. Nowadays, the majority of surgeons use 2 techniques, the classic strip
      technique, and the follicular unit extraction technique. Advantages of follicular unit
      extraction over the strip technique are the lesser incidence of donor zone post-procedural
      discomfort and the barely visible scarring.

      Platelet rich plasma is an autologous concentration of platelets in small volume of plasma
      and is an exciting therapeutic option for hair growth. Combining platelet rich plasma with
      follicular unit extraction surgery for the treatment of Androgenetic alopecia demonstrated
      that PRP is able to minimize the postsurgical follicle loss and potentiate the performance of
      grafted hairs.

      Adipose derived stem cells are an effective mesenchymal stem cell population with enormous
      potential in different fields of regenerative medicine.

      Adipose stem cells are needed to induce the proliferation of bulge stem cells of hair
      follicle. Furthermore, they can help in wound healing and vascular neogenesis.

      Zanzottera et al. 2014 investigated the effect of adipose derived stem cells on wound healing
      and engraftment of the transplanted hair applied during hair restoration surgery for three
      patients with androgenetic alopecia. Despite their promising results, further clinical trials
      including larger number of patients are still needed to confirm their preliminary findings.
