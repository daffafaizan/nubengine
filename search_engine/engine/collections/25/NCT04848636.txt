    
      This is a single center observational pilot study involving patients from the prevalent
      maintenance hemodialysis and CKD stage 1-5 populations of London, Ontario, compared to
      healthy controls. Once recruited, participants will undergo one study visit (on a
      non-dialysis day for hemodialysis patients). Each study visit will include, blood pressure
      and heart rate measurements, measurement of advanced glycation end products using the AGE
      Reader, blood work, a spot urine test, a sodium intake questionnaire, a single time to
      recovery question, a proton MRI scan, and an MRI scan of the cardiac tissue detecting sodium
      content.
