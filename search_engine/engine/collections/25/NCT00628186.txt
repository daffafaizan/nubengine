      external stent after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy
      are important to affect the postoperative course, and, a stent tube often places across
      pancreaticojejunostomy to reduce complications. However, there is no report that demonstrates
      the postoperative course between pancreatic stent types. We conducted a prospective
      randomized trial on 100 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy comparing external
      stent and lost stent.

      The primary endpoint was defined as postoperative hospital stay. The secondary endpoints were
      mortality and morbidity, including pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying,
      intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and intra-abdominal abscess. Patients were recruited into this
      study before surgery, on the basis of whether pancreatic head resection was anticipated at
      WMUH for pancreatic head and periampullary disease, and appropriate informed consent was
      obtained. Exclusion criteria was 1) patients with severe complications which were possible to
      prolong hospital stay, 2) patients who were diagnosed inadequacy for this study by a
      physician, 3) patients who could not be placed a pancreatic stent tube, and 4) patients
      without an informed consent.
