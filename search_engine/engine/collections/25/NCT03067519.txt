      surgery, thereby improving outcomes and decreasing length of hospital stay. The core elements
      of FTS include: epidural or regional anesthesia, peri-operative fluid management, minimally
      invasive techniques, optimal pain control, early initiation of oral feeding and early
      mobilization. The combination of these approaches has led to a significant reduction in
      complication rates, morbidity and mortality rates, duration of hospital stay and costs of
      hospitalization, and greatly improved postoperative recovery The main aim of this study was
      to explore the efficacy of FTS in the Rwandan surgical setting and to demonstrate the
      benefits of FTS.

      This randomized control trial was conducted in CHUK over a period of three months (October -
      December, 2015). For patients in the FTS arm, the study investigator would assess patients on
      a daily basis and work with the primary surgical team. The study investigator would prompt
      the primary surgical team for early feeding, mobilization, pain control and fluid management
      recommendations.

      Data were collected on variables including postoperative analgesia, mobilisation, resuming
      oral feeding, hospital stay and complications. The primary outcome was duration of
      postoperative hospital stay and secondary outcome was major complications.
