      Ammonia and sponsored by Ionetix. Each site with access to N-13 produced under an
      investigational new drug (IND) application will be eligible to participate. Once the site is
      activated, the site will enroll patients into the database that are scheduled for clinically
      indicated PET-MPI with N-13 (as determined by their treating physicians). PET-MPI perfusion,
      MBF, percent ischemia, pharmacologic stress agent, and gated left ventricular ejection
      fraction/function values will be collected when available, in an anonymous fashion and
      uploaded into the database. All patient health identifiers (PHI) will be removed prior to
      upload. No procedures additional to those clinically indicated will be performed for the
      purposes of this study.
