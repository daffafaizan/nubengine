    
      This is single-center, open-label, prospective study of telmisartan for the prevention of
      acute GVHD in approximately 60 subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT for treatment of a
      hematologic malignancy. Subjects will receive 160 mg Micardis brand telmisartan once daily,
      starting 2 days prior to HCT (day -2). Once the patient is discharged post-HCT, treatment
      will continue through Day +98 post-HCT for a total of 101 days. After treatment
      discontinuation on or before day +98 post-HCT, subjects will be followed for up to 6 months
      for primary and secondary endpoints.
