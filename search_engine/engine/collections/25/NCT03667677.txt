      anxiety. It has been report that the incidence of hypertension with anxiety is 25%-54%. The
      studies have confirmed that anxiety can significantly reduce the antihypertensive effect.
      Therefore, anxiolytics can increase the antihypertensive effect in patients with hypertension
      and anxiety. However, there is currently no standard treatment for patients with hypertension
      and anxiety, and few clinical studies have focused on the treatment of these neglected
      patients. Improvement on hypertension through relieving anxiety and relief of anxiety through
      lowering hypertension are lack of clinical studies to prove. This study compares the
      antihypertensive effects between different treatment groups including antihypertensive drug,
      anxiolytic, and both, which provide a new clinical evidence for controlling blood pressure in
      patients with hypertension and anxiety.
