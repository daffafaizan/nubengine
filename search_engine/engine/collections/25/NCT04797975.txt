      early innate response system, in the management of viral infections like COVID-19. Clinical
      data has shown that COVID-19 disease severity is correlated with a reduction in the number of
      NK cells, exhaustion of NK cells and the lack of certain mature, potent NK cell phenotypes.
      The power of NK cells to fight various other viral infections, such as caused by CMV, HBV and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been
      well described, with a durable change in the NK cell profile towards those more mature and
      potent phenotypes in recovered patients. In view of the lack of (functional) NK cells in
      patients with COVID-19, adoptive NK cell therapy with KDS-1000 cells may improve survival and
      reduce rates of disease progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adoptive transfer of expanded
      NK cells (KDS-1000) early in the course of disease may augment innate immunity, thereby
      limiting disease progression and could confer a survival benefit to patients infected with
      SARS-CoV-2.
