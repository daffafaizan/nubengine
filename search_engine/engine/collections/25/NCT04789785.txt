      pulmonary aspiration hazard and discomfort of prolonged fasting. Although stomach
      scintigraphy has been accepted as a gold standard for imaging method of evaluating gastric
      content; recently, ultrasound is being a simple, efficient, available and non invasive
      alternative. Preoperative fasting is especially difficult in elderly because of
      comorbidities, dehydration, drug therapies. Therefore, in this study gastric emptying time
      will be identified after a standard Turkish breakfast in over 65 years old Turkish population
      to clarify fasting time, measuring antral cross section area (CSA) by using non invasive
      ultrasound for the first time. Ultrasound assessments on volunteers will be made both in the
      supine position and right lateral decubitus (RLD) from the epigastric area by using a convex
      probe. After visualization of gastric antrum according to landmarks such as abdominal aorta,
      superior mesenteric artery and the left lobe of liver; antrum will measured in two sagittal
      planes: craniocaudal (CC) and anteroposterior(AP) diameters. Gastric emptying time will be
      identify by real time usg done by 1 hour intervals.This is the first study with ultrasound
      evaluation of gastric emptying time in Turkish population after a traditional Turkish
      breakfast.
