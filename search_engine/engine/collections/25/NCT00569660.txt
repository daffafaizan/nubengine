      stop the function of the tumor-fighting genes. By blocking the "bad" genes, the
      tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be able to begin
      treatment with azacitidine. You will receive azacitidine as an injection under the skin once
      a day for 7 days in a row. This will be repeated every 4 weeks (4 weeks equals 1 cycle). The
      first cycle of azacitidine will be given at M. D. Anderson, in an outpatient setting. Later
      cycles of treatment courses may be given at M. D. Anderson or by a cancer doctor in your
      community.

      You may receive up to 12 cycles of treatment if you are responding well to treatment. You
      will be taken off study if your disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. Once
      you go off study, you will receive follow-up as is standard of care for your disease.

      This is an investigational study. Azacitidine is FDA approved for the treatment of
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Its use in this study is experimental. A total of up to 34 patients
      will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
