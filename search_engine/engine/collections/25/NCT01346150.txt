      who have received their treatments (BMT, gene therapy, enzyme replacement) many years ago are
      asked to come back to the hospital where they were treated. During this visit, additional
      research bloodwork is drawn, and information is gathered regarding long-term transplant
      outcomes such as infections, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune diseases, and quality of
      life. This will allow PIDTC researchers to better understand long-term outcomes from
      procedures that occurred many years ago (sometimes over 30 years ago). This will help
      researchers to best design new treatments and clinical trials in the future for children with
      SCID.
