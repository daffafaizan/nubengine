      resulting from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during deployment. Although that
      population has seen a sharp increase in these posttraumatic headaches (PTHA), the condition
      is extraordinarily difficult to treat. There is very little evidence guiding its management.

      Complicating things is the fact that those who have suffered a traumatic injury during
      deployment often have co-occurring symptoms of posttraumatic stress, which may worsen their
      headaches or make them more difficult to treat.

      To better inform our understanding of how to help our suffering war veterans, we developed a
      study for the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) addressing posttraumatic headache in war
      veterans with co-occurring symptoms of posttraumatic stress.

      A key aim of the study will be to evaluate whether a leading psychological therapy for
      migraine headaches is effective with posttraumatic headaches. Investigators also seek to
      determine if treatment for PTHA likewise improves problems with PTSD, and whether treatment
      for PTSD simultaneously alleviates headaches.

      To accomplish these aims, the study will have three arms, with participants placed randomly
      into one of three treatment conditions:

        1. Treatment as usual (e.g., receiving standard care for PTHA through the South Texas
           Veterans Health Care System's Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio);

        2. A gold standard, manualized cognitive-behavioral intervention for headache; or

        3. A gold-standard treatment for PTSD, called Cognitive Processing Therapy.
