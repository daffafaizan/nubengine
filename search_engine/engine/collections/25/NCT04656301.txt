      responded to at least one adequate trial of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor will be treated
      openly with a single oral dose of psilocybin. Procedures will follow those previously
      established in depression studies of psilocybin. Patients will receive intensive preparation
      and support from two therapists, including 8-9 hours accompanying the patient on the day of
      medication administration in the Biological Studies Unit of New York State Psychiatric
      Institute. Followup visits to monitor safety and clinical outcome will be conducted at day 1,
      week1, and months 1,2, and 3 post-administration. Resting state function magnetic resonance
      imaging will be conducted prior to and one day after psilocybin administration to assess the
      effect of medication on brain circuits.
