      coronary heart disease (CHD), and a large number of clinical studies have reported an
      association between markers of inflammation and CHD. Consequently, infectious agents have
      been proposed as promoters of atherosclerosis and/or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Many
      studies have suggested a relation between Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection and
      CHD, and C. pneumoniae has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic tissue.

      Macrolide antibiotics are effective in eradication of C. pneumoniae from atherosclerotic
      plaques. Two small trials showed significant beneficial effects of macrolides on
      cardiovascular morbidity in patients with ACS. To corroborate and extend these findings, we
      undertook a randomised, placebo-controlled trial with clarithromycin in patients with stable
      CHD in order to test the hypothesis that intervention with a macrolide would reduce
      cardiovascular risk with regard to mortality and morbidity.
