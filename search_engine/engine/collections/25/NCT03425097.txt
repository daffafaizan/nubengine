      Of those patients up to 60% may have an inadequate response to proton pump inhibitors and
      have persistent symptoms. One possible explanation is that this group of patients has nerve
      related pain. It is thought that H1 receptor activation may sensitize the gastrointestinal
      tract and esophagus to pain. H1 blockers such as anti-histamines may play a role in treatment
      of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms that are refractory to proton pump inhibitors by reducing
      pain perception. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized control trial to test this
      hypothesis. The investigators will do this by giving participants both Fexofenadine (an H1
      blocker) for 2 weeks and placebo (sugar pill) for 2 weeks. The participants will not know
      which drug they are getting at a particular time. This will help the investigators better
      assess the true effectiveness of Fexofenadine.
