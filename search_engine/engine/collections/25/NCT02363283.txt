    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the clinical anti-tumor activity of CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin) as a
      single-agent in the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Description of the clinical safety and benefit of CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin) and
      pharmacodynamics changes in glycoprotein NMB (glycoprotein [transmembrane] NMB) (GPNMB)
      expression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterization of the anti-tumor immunophenotype of patients receiving treatment.

      II. Post hoc, correlation of rash with clinical benefit, or lack of rash with lack of
      benefit, will also be explored.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
