    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, Phase II study. Participants eligible for
      this study have metastatic urothelial cancer and bone metastases and are planned to receive
      4-6 cycles of a standard of care platinum-doublet regimen. In a double blind manner, 50
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive denosumab 120 mg or matching
      placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks with their first dose coinciding with the first cycle of
      chemotherapy. Patients will continue on denosumab/placebo even after all planned chemotherapy
      cycles have been delivered and until the end of the study at 18 months after the last dose of
      chemotherapy. Patients with symptomatic progression in the bone may be unblinded and crossed
      over to denosumab (if on placebo). All participants will be provided with 1000 mg of calcium
      and 400 IU of vitamin D to be taken daily. Participants who discontinue the investigational
      product early will be followed for disease status and survival.
