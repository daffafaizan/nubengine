    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of MANTA in achieving
      hemostasis in femoral arterial access sites in patients undergoing percutaneous transcatheter
      interventional procedures using a 10-18F procedure sheath (such as Transcather Aortic Valve
      Replacement (TAVR), Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty (BAV) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair
      (EVAR)) for purposes of obtaining a CE Mark in the European Union.

      The study will evaluate hemostasis success, time to hemostasis and ambulation, treatment
      success, and the rate of access-site-related complications in comparison to published
      literature on other hemostasis techniques for closing these large bore punctures (primarily,
      surgical closure and suture-mediated percutaneous closure.
