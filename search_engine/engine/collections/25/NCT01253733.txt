      2-year randomized controlled trial to develop and test a text message and Internet based
      intervention among adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, or
      inflammatory bowel disease. Adolescents and young adults have been a difficult population to
      engage in healthcare. It is estimated that 1 in 5 adolescents do not get the healthcare they
      need. Interventions must address how the healthcare system can engage adolescents with
      chronic disease and provide opportunities to discuss health-related matters and improve
      disease outcomes.

      This study will help fill multiple gaps in the literature by exploring the utility of a push
      AND pull SMS texting-based application for chronic disease management among youth. Based on
      social cognitive theory, the intervention will use accessible technology to promote disease
      management among adolescents with chronic disease as they transition to adult care. The
      popularity and usage of SMS already demonstrated by adolescents suggests notable promise for
      the SMS-based TAHLC program to promote chronic disease self-management and healthcare
      engagement with substantial positive impacts on health among youth with chronic disease.
