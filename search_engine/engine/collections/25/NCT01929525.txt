      granulation tissue using a chemical agent, which would eventually induce healing with
      fibrosis and closure of the tract without any surgical intervention. Aiming to reduce the
      surgery related complications; we investigated the effectiveness of silver nitrate solution
      as a chemical agent in the treatment of anal fistula.
