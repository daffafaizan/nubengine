      brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases. II. Compare the efficacy and toxicity
      of whole brain radiotherapy with or without gadolinium texaphyrin in these patients. III.
      Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, two stage, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to RTOG recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA class 1 vs class 2) and tumor
      type (breast vs lung vs other). Stage 1 (lead-in): All patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin
      IV over 5-10 minutes on the 10 days that they receive radiotherapy. Approximately 2-5 hours
      later, patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy. Stage 2 (randomization): Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients in arm I undergo whole brain radiotherapy
      for 10 days. Patients in arm II receive gadolinium texaphyrin and radiotherapy as in stage 1.
      Quality of life is assessed on days 10 and 28, then monthly for 5 months, and then every 3
      months thereafter. Patients are followed at day 28, then monthly for 5 months, and then every
      3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The lead-in phase will accrue at least 25-30 patients and the
      randomization phase will accrue 400 patients (200/arm) over a 12 month period.
