    
      Multicentre, randomised, controlled, 2-arm open-label prospective pilot study to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of FCM in the treatment of anaemia in LPD subjects with functional iron
      deficiency (FID), undergoing chemotherapy. The subjects will be screened for eligibility
      within 4 weeks prior to inclusion to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of FCM or no FCM
      infusions (the subjects may be treated according to the local institutional practice if
      requiring symptomatic management of anaemia). After randomisation, the visits are scheduled
      weekly until Week 8.
