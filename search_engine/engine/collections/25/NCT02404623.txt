    
      The rational of this trial is that a daily supplementation of a double dose of Vitamin D (800
      IU instead of 400 IU) to late premature infants during the first year of life will result in
      elevated Vitamin D serum levels and in an improvement in respiratory morbidity.

      This randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation is planned to determine the optimal dose
      of daily vitamin D supplementation required to achieve sufficient vitamin D levels in preterm
      infants and to assess whether doubling the daily intake of vitamin D may serve as primary
      prevention of respiratory infections and asthma in premature infants.
