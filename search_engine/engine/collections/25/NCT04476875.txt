    
      A two-year randomized controlled trial with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. At baseline,
      patients were randomized electronically with stratification according to biologic and
      non-biologic treatment to the open outpatient clinic programme, or usual care. Patients were
      evaluated at baseline, year 1 and 2, including assessment of disease activity (DAS-28), blood
      tests, bone erosions on plain radiographs of hands and feet, and patient reported outcome
      measures.

      The objective of the study was to compare an outpatient system for Danish RA patients based
      on patient self-controlled outpatient follow up on demand, Open Outpatient Clinic Programme
      with traditional scheduled routine follow-up regarding patient satisfaction and effect on
      traditional disease markers.

      The Danish National Patient Registry (DANBIO) was used to identify eligible patients with RA.
      At pre-planned routine visits with the rheumatologist, identified patients were screened
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The intervention group had no scheduled appointments at the outpatient clinic, but they could
      book acute appointments with their contact rheumatologist within 5 days or less whenever they
      deemed it necessary. They also had access to nurse-led consultations without pre-booked
      appointments and to a nurse-led telephone helpline
