      years old with established keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration or post-LASIK ectasia
      determined by keratography. A solution of transepithelial riboflavin .25% will be applied
      every three minutes for 30 minutes or until complete corneal penetration is observed. Then
      the cornea will be irradiated with UV light at fluence rates of 9mw/cm2 for 10 minutes or 18
      mw/cm2 for 5 minutes. Post procedural evaluation will take place at day one, day 7 day 30,
      day 90, day 180 and day 365. Pretreatment keratography, uncorrected acuity, best corrected
      acuity will be compared at follow up days beginning on day 30.
