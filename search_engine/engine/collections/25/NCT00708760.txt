      concepts with animations, audio, scenarios, and quizzes. Interactive feedback will be
      incorporated to guide the clinician during the course. The course will be offered
      commercially over the World Wide Web, with successful completion providing continuing medical
      education (CME) credit. It will fulfill JCAHO recommended guidelines. In a controlled
      simulated environment, the hypothesis that the web based training protocol will provide the
      practitioner the knowledge base necessary to manage the four scenarios as well or better than
      practitioners completing the standard moderate sedation certification course will be tested.

      1) Evaluate the effectiveness of the course. The University of Utah Center for Patient
      Simulation is an ideal environment to evaluate the efficacy of a web-based training course.
      The new web-based course will be compared to standard course material and lessons. We will
      recruit 40 nurses who administer moderate sedation at the University of Utah Health Sciences
      Center. Half of the nurses will receive traditional training (typical course and guidelines
      published from the literature), and half will receive the web-based course. Users will be
      tested on their knowledge of moderate sedation with four moderate sedation scenarios, in
      which the simulated patient experiences over-sedation, apnea, and excessive pain.
