      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel via intraperitoneal route in
      subjects with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of escalating doses of intraperitoneal paclitaxel in subjects with
      gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      II. To make a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel in subjects
      with stage IV gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intraperitoneally (IP) over 1 hour once weekly during weeks 1-3
      and 5-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
