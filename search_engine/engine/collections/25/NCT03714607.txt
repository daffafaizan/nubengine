    
      Postmenopausal women with symptomatic cystocele and/or rectocele stage 2 or 3 will be 1:1
      randomly allocated to Er:YAG laser or watchful waiting group. Participants in the Er:YAG
      laser group will receive laser therapies at monthly intervals, while participants in the
      watchful waiting group will receive no treatment. All outcomes in both groups will be
      evaluated at baseline, 4-months and 6-months from baseline.
