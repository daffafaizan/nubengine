      trial evaluating the effects of 28 days of digitoxin on IL-8 and neutrophil concentrations in
      induced sputum in subjects with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis lung disease. Twenty-four
      total patients will be randomized into 3 groups of 8 subjects each (0.05 mg or 0.1 mg
      digitoxin or a placebo).
