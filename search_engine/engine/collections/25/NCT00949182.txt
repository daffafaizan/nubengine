    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tosylate therapy when administered
           before and after doxorubicin hydrochloride-based hepatic arterial chemoembolization
           (HACE) as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0 in patients with localized unresectable
           hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if sorafenib tosylate decreases the number of HACE treatments required to
           achieve radiologic tumor kill.

        -  To assess improvement in progression-free survival.

        -  To assess changes in monthly AFP levels in patients with AFP-producing tumors.

        -  To measure VEGF levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14. Beginning ≥ 3
      days later, patients undergo hepatic arterial chemoembolization (HACE)* with doxorubicin
      hydrochloride and mitomycin C. Beginning ≥ 3 days after the completion of HACE and/or once
      liver function returns to baseline, patients resume sorafenib tosylate twice daily for up to
      6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may undergo more than one HACE treatment.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for further laboratory analysis.
