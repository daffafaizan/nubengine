      informed consent is obtained. Patients will be required to attend regular clinic visits to
      receive study medication and have their status monitored. They will also be required to have
      radiologic tumor assessments performed at multiple times throughout the study. A detailed
      explanation can be provided by the Investigator conducting this study. Trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2
      will be given every 21 days to patients intravenously (i.v). over a 3-hour period via a
      central venous catheter (referred to as a "central line") which is a tube (ie, catheter)
      placed into a large vein that is used to administer medications. Dexamethasone 4 mg will be
      given orally (p.o.) the day before trabectedin and dexamethasone 20 mg will be given i.v. 30
      minutes before trabectedin. Dexamethasone 4 mg p.o. will be given for 2 days following
      trabectedin administration.
