      associated with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Anal fistulas seldom heal
      spontaneously and may require surgical intervention. The main purpose of the operation will
      be to close the fistula and preserve anal continence. The traditional surgical fistula
      closing techniques often show disappointing results. Today, a collagen plug for fistula
      treatment is commercially available. The mounting of this plug is technically easy and less
      invasive than the traditional closure of the fistula by making a lid of anal mucosa
      (advancement flap). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the outcome of anal
      fistula repair with a collagen plug is comparable to that of repair by a mucosal advancement
      flap, with regard to healing of fistula, anal continence and pain. Plug treatment has so far
      shown promising results, but prospective, randomised controlled trials are needed.
