    
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a manualized form of brief psychodynamic
      psychotherapy in comparison with applied relaxation training, a less active form of treatment
      in other studies, for adults with primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) panic disorder.

      Forty nine patients who have signed written consent who have primary DSM-IV panic disorder
      have been entered into the study. Randomization has been stratified by presence of major
      depression and use of psychoactive, anti-panic medications. Medications, if present, have
      been held constant. All patients have received 24 sessions of either psychodynamic
      psychotherapy, or applied relaxation training for panic disorder. This study is currently
      closed for recruitment, although final follow-up assessments have yet to be completed.
