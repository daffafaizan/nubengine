      viruses (in particular Epstein-Barr Virus) are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple
      sclerosis. People with active MS have higher levels of HERVs than people either without MS or
      who have other neurological conditions. It has been shown that HERVs may produce neurotoxic
      proteins/antigens associated with MS activity and disease progression. This is the first
      clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that the antiretroviral drug raltegravir may
      suppress HERV activity and ameliorate progression of relapsing remitting MS. Raltegravir is
      an integrase inhibitor which blocks retroviral replication. A recent experimental study
      suggests that raltegravir may also be active against herpes viruses.

      Eligible participants (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be observed for 3 months having
      monthly brain Gadolinium enhanced MRIs and blood/urine/saliva sampling (baseline). Then they
      will be treated with raltegravir (one 400mg pill taken twice a day) for 3 months. During
      treatment period participants will continue to have monthly MRIs and blood/saliva/urine
      sampling. Participants will have monthly clinical and neurological examinations and they will
      complete questionnaires assessing response to treatment. Participants will have screening and
      study visits at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel. Monthly MRIs will be performed at the
      Institute of Neurology at Queens Square, London.
