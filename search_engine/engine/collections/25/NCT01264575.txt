      bupivacaine dose group (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 mg). Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia would be
      performed. The dose would be considered as successful if no epidural supplement was required
      during surgery. A probit analysis will be performed to calculate the ED50 and ED95 of
      intrathecal bupivacaine with or without epinephrine for total knee replacement arthroplasty.

      After these measurements, ED50 and ED95 of bupivacaine with epinephrine would be compared
      with those without epinephrine.
