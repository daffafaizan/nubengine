      from mouth or stomach (if you have a feeding tube) to the end of the large intestine using a
      special instrument that measures hydrogen gas in your breath. Data collection will start
      after you sign this consent form. The only procedures that would be above and beyond routine
      care are indicated below:

      In order to prepare for the study you will be asked to be off all medications that affects
      the GI motility for 24 hours. You will also be asked to fast overnight (starting midnight)
      the day before the test.

      After fasting overnight, the test will be performed in the morning (at the Neurology
      Outpatient Clinic or at your home). Before eating or drinking anything a baseline measurement
      will be taken by breathing into the hydrogen meter. This will be just normal breathing. You
      will then drink a test meal consisting of 250 ml (approximately 1 cup) of a lactose (type of
      sugar) free supplement (For example Ensure) that has 20 grams of Lactulose added. If you have
      a peg tube then the supplement will be given through the tube. After 10 minutes you will
      again be asked to breath into the machine to measure the hydrogen gas levels. This will be
      repeated every 10 minutes until the hydrogen levels rise to a certain level or until 4 hours
      have passed.
