      brain tumors and other CNS conditions in the pediatric and adult populations using
      ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle that is approved for
      the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. The
      investigators will correlate the MR signal of ferumoxytol uptake with the number of
      macrophages in surgical specimen at histopathology. This information may potentially offer
      clinicians a new means for risk stratification and monitoring treatment efficacy.
