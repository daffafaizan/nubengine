      process. Massage therapy for post-operative pain has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety
      levels in various surgical patients however no study has assessed massage therapy effect on
      post-operative pain in patients who have gone through urological procedures.

      This study will investigate the effects of hand massage interventions during the
      post-operative period of Urology patients. Perception of pain and anxiety levels will be
      assessed, as well as vital signs before and after massage therapy will be measured. These
      findings may lead to both subjective and objective improvements in patients undergoing
      urological surgeries and procedures.
