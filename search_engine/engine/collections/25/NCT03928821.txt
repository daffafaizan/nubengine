      of combinations of monoclonal antibodies PGT121, PGDM1400, 10-1074, and VRC07-523LS
      administered via intravenous infusion in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will initially be enrolled into one of three groups. At Day 0, Groups 1, 2, and
      3 will receive dual combinations of mAbs administered sequentially via IV. Group 1 will
      receive a combination of PGT121 and VRC07-523LS, Group 2 will receive PGDM1400 and
      VRC07-523LS, and Group 3 will receive 10-1074 and VRC07-523LS.

      Study staff will review study data from Groups 1, 2, and 3 and determine if Group 4 may begin
      to enroll. Participants in Group 4 will receive PGDM1400, PGT121, and VRC07-523LS
      administered in sequence via IV on Day 0 and at Month 4.

      Study duration will be 12 months for participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 16 months for
      participants in Group 4. Participants will attend several study visits, which may include
      physical examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing and pretest counseling, risk
      reduction counseling, and questionnaires.
