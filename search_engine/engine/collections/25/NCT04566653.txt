    
      This non-interventional, Phase IV, exploratory, cross-over, randomised, single-blind, active
      comparator-controlled study has been designed to measure the palatability and preference of
      sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (hereafter referred to as Lokelma®) versus calcium patiromer
      sorbitex (hereafter referred to as Veltassa®) versus sodium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS) or
      calcium polystyrene sulphonate (CPS) (hereafter referred to as S/CPS) in patients with
      dialysis and non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperkalaemia (HK). The sponsor
      hypothesizes that palatability, in terms of taste, texture, smell, and mouthfeel, will score
      higher (better) for Lokelma when compared with Veltassa and S/CPS. Each objective will be
      analysed per country. In addition, the difference in results per regions and overall may be
      explored.
