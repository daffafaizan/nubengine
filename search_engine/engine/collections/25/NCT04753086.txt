      clinical settings, and a paper PROM is part of standard of care treatment for prostate cancer
      patients at the University of North Carolina clinic. However, PROM are not routinely
      collected for gynecological cancer patients at UNC, and fewer studies have specifically
      focused on PROM for gynecological cancer patients receiving radiation. The primary objective
      of this study is to determine the feasibility of PRO monitoring of gynecologic symptoms
      before, during (at weekly intervals), and after radiation (external beam radiotherapy and
      brachytherapy) for gynecologic cancer patients at a high volume center.
