      survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Determine the rate of measurable
      clinical response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients treated with this
      drug. III. Determine the unexpected toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (glioblastoma multiforme (closed to accrual as of 05/31/2001) and gliosarcoma (closed to
      accrual as of 05/31/2001) vs anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and mixed
      malignant glioma). Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily during weeks 1 and 4.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then before each course of
      chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41-85 patients (21-45 with anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma, and mixed malignant glioma and 20-40 with glioblastoma multiforme (closed
      to accrual as of 05/31/2001) and gliosarcoma (closed to accrual as of 05/31/2001)) will be
      accrued for this study.
