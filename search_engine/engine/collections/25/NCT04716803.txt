      in patient's with moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee who will undergo total knee
      replacement. Several weeks prior to total knee replacement, patients will have a sample of
      bone marrow taken from their pelvic region and concentrated using an investigational device
      called the Arthrex Angel Concentrated Platelet Rich Plasma (cPRP) System also known as the
      Angel System. The concentrated bone marrow will be immediately delivered back to the patient
      arthroscopically to the knee of interest. Blood and tissues samples will be collected at
      scheduled visits for molecular and histological analysis. Adverse events will be monitored
      throughout the trial. Assessment of healing will be performed by physical exam and
      standardized questionnaires related to the health of the patient.
