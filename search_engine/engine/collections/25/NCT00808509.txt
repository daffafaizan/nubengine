      therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are usually continued indefinitely. Information
      concerning the possibility of discontinuing anti-TNF therapy in RA patients who are in
      remission is limited. This is a pilot study in one country to study the effect of adalimumab
      discontinuation. The objective is to assess the proportion of patients with established RA in
      stable remission (Disease Activity Score [DAS]28 <2.6) after treatment with adalimumab in
      combination with methotrexate, in whom it is possible to discontinue adalimumab and to
      compare the remission rates among patients on sustained therapy with adalimumab +
      methotrexate with remission rates among patients who discontinued adalimumab.

      Rheumatoid arthritis patients in stable remission (DAS28 < 2.6) treated with adalimumab +
      methotrexate were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue with adalimumab treatment or
      discontinue adalimumab treatment for the following 52 weeks. Subsequently an observational
      extension was conducted to observe patients treated at the discretion of the investigator.
      The observational extension period lasted until Weeks 105 - 156 (average Week 125) and
      consisted of one follow-up visit. Participants randomized to discontinue adalimumab therapy
      will be reinstituted to adalimumab if DAS28-score increases by >1.2 units from baseline
      and/or is scored â‰¥2.6 at any visit during the study and will be followed for an additional 12
      weeks.
