      recurrent and severe infections, and inflammatory dysregulation. For almost 50% of patients
      with CGD, this inflammation causes severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However,
      treatment is long term and challenging as CGD-IBD is prone to relapse, and use of immune
      modulators must be balanced with increased risk of infectious complications. Conventional IBD
      (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is likely caused by an inappropriate inflammatory
      response to intestinal microbes, which is influenced by the environment in a genetically
      susceptible host. While it is not yet clear if intestinal dysbiosis is a result or cause of
      intestinal inflammation, studies suggest that correcting intestinal dysbiosis may improve
      intestinal inflammation. Studies in patients with conventional IBD suggest that strict
      dietary restrictions can resolve symptoms of IBD and induce remission as effectively as
      glucocorticoids but without the side effects of those drugs. Because these diets alter the
      gut microbiome, they may serve as effective treatment for CGD-IBD.

      In this study, we propose to treat 5 patients >= 8 years old who have CGD and IBD with 4
      weeks of an elemental diet. Participants will stay as inpatients for up to 2 weeks and will
      return for follow-up at the end of the diet to begin tapering off and be reintroduced to
      normal food. The primary objective of this study is the evaluation of changes in the
      microbiome before and after the elemental diet. Secondary objectives are evaluations of
      tolerability and safety of the diet, along with changes in local and systemic markers of
      inflammation, and improvement of IBD symptoms as determined by reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index score.
