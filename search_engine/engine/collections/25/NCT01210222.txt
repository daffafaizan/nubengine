      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer,
      who survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have
      objective tumor response (complete or partial), treated with AMG 386 (trebananib).

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of AMG 386 in this cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with AMG 386.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 21.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
