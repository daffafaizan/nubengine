      surgical procedure itself or in comparison of conservative or operative treatment. Less
      information is available about long-term outcome and exercise programs for operated patients.
      Therefore the investigators have developed "Spine fusion register", which include data on
      surgery procedure and outcome (pain, disability, back muscle function, quality of life,
      working capacity, reoperations and complications etc.) before and after surgery up to 5 years
      (started in January 1st, 2008). The main purpose of the present study is to analyze the
      significance of 12-month strength and aerobic training for outcome of the lumbar fusion
      patients compared to usual care. Patients (N=100) with lumbar fusion because of isthmic or
      degenerative olisthesis will be will be stratified by catchments area and randomized into
      combined strength and aerobic training group or into the control group.
