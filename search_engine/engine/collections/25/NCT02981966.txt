      dapagliflozin administration to determine the site of increase in EGP, liver versus kidney.
      Researchers will measure the rate of whole body glucose production with 3-3H-glucose (a form
      of radioactive glucose) and renal glucose production by renal vein catheterization in T2DM
      (type 2 diabetes mellitus) and in lean healthy NGT (normal glucose tolerance) individuals.
      Because the increase in EGP is associated with an increase in plasma glucagon concentration
      and renal glucose production is stated to be unresponsive to glucagon, the investigators
      anticipate that the liver will be responsible, in part, for the increase in EGP.
