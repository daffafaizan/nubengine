    
      Following parental consent, preterm infants with an estimated gestational age < 36 6/7 weeks
      at delivery who have been in an incubator in the newborn ICU for at least 24 hours in
      settings where an incubator is available, or who are in the newborn ICU in a setting where an
      incubator is not available, will be randomized to to transfer either standard protocol of
      open crib or mylar-lined cardboard cot when their temperatures are stable for transfer. The
      infants will remain in the cot or crib for the duration of the hospital stay. Axillary
      temperatures will be taken 1 hr, 6 hrs, and 24 hours after being placed in the cot or crib,
      and then once every 24 hours. All other care is provided as standard of care, including WHO
      warm chain thermoregulation guidelines of early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate
      bundling and Kangaroo Mother Care as continuously as possible.

      If at any point a babies becomes moderately (32.0-35.9° C) or severely hypothermic (< 32.0°
      C), an extra blanket will be added to their bodies and a hat placed on their heads.
