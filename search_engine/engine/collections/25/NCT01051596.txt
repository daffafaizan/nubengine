      ABT-888 and temozolomide in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Treatment will continue weekly with restaging scans to be performed every 8 weeks. The trial
      will follow a Simon's two-stage optimal design. For the first stage, 21 patients will be
      accrued. If two (9.5%) or fewer of the 21 patients exhibit a partial or complete response
      with ABT-888 plus temozolomide, the agent will be rejected and the trial stopped. However, if
      at least 3 patients of the 21 (14%) exhibit a response in the first stage, then an additional
      29 patients will be entered into the second stage, for a total of 50 patients in this phase
      II study. If 8 (16%) or more patients exhibit a response, then the treatment will be
      considered for further investigation. The sample sizes of 21 and 50 patients and the decision
      rules, in stages 1 and 2 respectively, are designed to differentiate a 25% overall response
      rate from a 10% overall response rate.
