      complex tasks such as language, understanding, learning, and reasoning. Working memory
      deficits are worse in people with advanced age and low education. In addition, working memory
      is impaired in children with traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The aim of this study is to determine the Turkish
      version, validity, and reliability of ''The Working Memory Questionnaire''. 300 health people
      will include in the study. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, the intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to determine the level of the relationship between
      the results of the first and second measurements. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be used
      for the homogeneity of the questions in the scale. For construct validity, the correlation
      coefficient will be used to determine the agreement between the Turkish Version of Cognitive
      Failures Questionnaire and The Working Memory Questionnaire.
