      that secondhand smoke contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, little is known about
      the dose-dependent vascular effects of brief secondhand smoke exposure at low doses commonly
      encountered in the community. This study will investigate the acute vascular effects and
      dose-dependent biological mechanisms of secondhand smoke on endothelial function and
      oxidative stress.
