      patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Post-vitrectomy macular edema may occur in
      these diabetic patients. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents or corticosteroid are
      required for treating diabetic macular edema (DME) in vitrectomized eyes. Intraocular levels
      of various cytokines may alter in the diabetic eyes following vitrectomy. Pharmacokinetics
      may be different between various intraocular agents in vitrectomized eyes. Herein our study
      will prospectively randomize to compare the clinical behavior between intravitreal
      ranibizumab (IVR) and intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI) in vitrectomized patients with
      DME. To our knowledge, it is the first study involving such subject.

      Pseudophakic vitrectomized eyes with treatment-na√Øve center-involved DME will be enrolled
      with one eye in each patient. They are randomized into one group receiving IDI every 3 to 4
      months, and the other group undergoing IVR using 3 monthly plus treat-and-extend injections
      all with monthly follow-up for 6 months. Switch of intravitreal drugs or deferred macular
      laser is not allowed. Primary outcome measures include change in central foveal thickness
      (CFT) in 1 mm by spectral-domain optic coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) at Month 6. Primary outcome measures include change in CFT and BCVA at Month 6.
      Injection number, BCVA, CFT, post-injection complications, and IOP are recorded and compared
      with Wilcoxon signed rank test within the group and Wilcoxon rank sum test between groups.
      Fisher's exact test is used for categorical comparison between groups. P value less than 0.05
      is considered significant.
