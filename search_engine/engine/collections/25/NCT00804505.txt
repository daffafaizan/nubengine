      SynergEyes A Hybrid Contact lens (Control) when used in a daily wear regimen on non-diseased
      eyes for the correction of myopia (-0.25 to -6.00Diopters) with up to -2.50 Diopters of
      astigmatism. The population will be randomized into a 2/1 ratio of the Test/Control for 90
      days. The study objective is to complete at least 40 subjects in the Test material and 20
      subjects in the Control material.

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens
      clinical performance is substantially equivalent to that of the SynergEyes A Hybrid Lens when
      studied within the corresponding range of powers in a population randomized within
      investigational sites to produce a 2/1 ratio of Test vs. Control lenses.
