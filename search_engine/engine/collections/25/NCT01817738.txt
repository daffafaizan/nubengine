      vaccine is composed of 6RNActive®-based compounds, each encoding for an antigen that is
      overexpressed in prostate cancer compared to healthy tissues. RNActive®-based vaccines are a
      novel class of vaccines based on messenger RNA.

      The study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II trial in men with
      asymptomatic- minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-refractory prostate cancer.

      The phase 1 (safety lead- in) part of the trial has the primary objective to assess the
      safety of CV9104 and to determine the dose for the randomized phase II part.

      The primary objective of the phase II part is to compare overall survival in patients treated
      with CV9104 compared to patients treated with placebo.
