      follow-up assessments (Waves 1-3). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 2 months, 5
      months, and 8 months after the baseline assessment. The objective of the study was to test a
      culturally-tailored online program designed to help PI young adults quit smoking cigarettes.
      The online program contained (1) personalized, automated text messages, (2) interactive,
      online educational modules, and (3) an online forum.

      Hypotheses for this study include:

        1. Participants in the intervention program tailored to PIs would have significantly higher
           rates of abstinence, lower rates of relapse, and lower smoking frequency and intensity
           at each follow-up time point than those in the standard intervention program.

        2. Participants with impaired affective decision capacity (low scores on Iowa Gambling Task
           (IGT)) would benefit more from the tailored intervention program than participants with
           normal affective decision capacity (high IGT scores).

        3. Effects from the tailored intervention program would be more pronounced among
           participants with particular dispositional phenotypes (depression, hostility,
           impulsivity) and baseline severity of tobacco addiction (nicotine dependence).

        4. High-intensity users of the tailored intervention program would be more successful than
           low intensity users in reducing the frequency and intensity of cigarettes smoked.

        5. The tailored intervention program would have greater success at engaging and retaining
           participants than the standard intervention program.
