      testing (rPFT) conducted in the home through the use of connected mobile health devices and
      the Penn State Hershey ALS Telemanagement program. The central hypothesis is that guided home
      assessment of respiratory function is a valid method for detecting respiratory insufficiency
      leading to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) recommendation. This study has the potential to
      transform the current practice of conducting breathing assessments every three months,
      resulting in timelier detection of respiratory insufficiency, thereby staining quality of
      life and lengthening survival. This protocol has the potential to demonstrate telemanagement
      exceeding the standards of ALS care.

      This is a self-controlled study which will enroll 40 patients from the ALS clinic. On the day
      of their clinical visit, study participants will perform both a standard PFT as well as a
      simulated rPFT, both generating three valid repetitions of forced vital capacity (FVC) and
      maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) procedures. The simulated rPFT will mimic the practice of
      home telemonitoring by having patients be instructed by a respiratory therapist over the
      telemanagement portal while in a research room within the ALS clinic. The primary hypothesis
      is that there is no difference in the results of PFT and rPFT for respiratory assessment of
      FVC and MIP.
