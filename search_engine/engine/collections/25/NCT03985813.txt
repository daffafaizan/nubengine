      beginning with screening occurring within the waiting room which will yield decision support
      guidance delivered and followed by the PCP at that same visit.

      This study utilized an open trial design. A stepped wedge design was originally proposed and
      efforts were made to adhere to this study design, however after a year of low recruitment and
      resultant recruitment sites pulling out the of the study, the overall study design was
      changed to an open trial. Additional recruitment sites were onboarded to the study and
      provided with the intervention arm in order to obtain feasibility data on the intervention
      components of the study. For reference a stepped wedge design involves the sequential random
      rollout of an intervention over two time periods. Following a baseline period in which no
      clusters (=practices) are exposed to the intervention, the crossover is typically in one
      direction, from control to intervention and continues until both of the clusters have
      crossed-over to receive the intervention, with observations taken from each cluster and at
      each time period.

      Hypothesis: The use of Screening Wizard will increase the rate of personalized referrals
      experts in specialty mental health would provide, compared to Treatment as usual (TAU).
