    
      Patients will be treated as standard of care, no randomization schedule, no blinded
      investigational product (IP).

      The decision which DOAC will be given is made before the subject will enter the trial. The
      DOAC has to be taken at least for seven days.

      The registry is non-interventional (NIS) with routine blood draw at baseline and at month 4
      after inclusion. The prospective follow up will be up to four months. Three consecutive
      menstrual bleeding cycles will be documented by the participating patients at home. One
      baseline data reporting and one follow up reporting after four months are planned in the
      participating coagulation centers.

      The primary aim is the comparison of the frequency of heavy menstrual bleeding in female
      patients of reproductive age anticoagulated with DOACs using a modified pictorial blood loss
      assessment chart.

      Secondary aims are the prevalence of von Willebrand disease in young anticoagulated female
      patients and correlation of HMB with age, International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis
      bleeding assessment tool at inclusion, Blood group, anatomical reasons i.e. underlying
      uterine pathologies, i. e. presence of uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps and/or
      adenomyosis, occurrence of iron deficiency, hemoglobin level and intermittent use of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
