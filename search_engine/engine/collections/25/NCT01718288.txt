      walking distance (PFWD) less than 100 meters is a major clinical problem, in view of the
      significant cooling of the quality of life and evolution often severe that characterizes the
      clinical course of these patients. Revascularization Surgery is the treatment of choice, but
      about half of patients with severe PAD IIb is not eligible for surgery or endovascular
      treatment. The usefulness of use of vasodilators or hemorheological is controversial, and
      medical treatment of these patients is therefore heterogeneous understanding the various
      pharmacologic options (for the correction of risk factors, prevention of cardiovascular
      events, improvement of claudication), and rehabilitative programs. Iloprost, a synthetic
      analogue of prostacyclin, is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic critical
      ischemia, and its pharmacological profile (effective vasodilator, anti-platelet, and
      leukocyte activation) is particularly suitable to modulate multiple components pathogenesis
      of peripheral arterial disease. Specifically, in the treatment of patients with PAD IIb
      severe, the current state is available only a retrospective study that compared the use of
      iloprost with that of vasodilators. Aim of the study FADOI-2bPILOT is to evaluate
      prospectively and for an observation period of 13 months, if you can get a benefit on the
      pain-free walking distance and on clinical outcome from "anticipated" and additional use of
      iloprost, in patients with severe IIb stage PAD treated according to current "best medical
      practice".
