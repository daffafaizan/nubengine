      of administration. Each vaccine uses the same RSV proteins to stimulate immune responses.
      These proteins are the F (Fusion), N (Nucleocapsid) and M2-1 (Matrix) proteins. The F protein
      sits on the surface of the virus and is needed to infect human cells. Antibodies to this
      protein are an important mechanism to prevent infection. The N and M2-1 proteins are needed
      for viral replication and are targets of immune recognition.

      The two vaccines in this study contain all three of these proteins. However, they are
      delivered into the body using different 'vectors', which are harmless carrier viruses. In
      this study, we have employed two different vectors:a simian adenoviruses (PanAd3) and
      Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA).

      We administer these vaccines using a 'prime-boost' strategy, in which one of these vaccines
      is used to 'prime' the immune system, which is then 'boosted' 4 or 8 weeks later, depending
      on the groups, by administration of an alternative vaccine or the same vaccine given by a
      different route.
