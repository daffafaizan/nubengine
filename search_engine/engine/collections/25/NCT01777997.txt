    
      AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5308 was a single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the
      effect of initiating fixed-dose combination (FDC) FTC/RPV/TDF on CD8+ T-cell activation and
      other immunologic and virologic biomarkers among treatment-na√Øve HIV-1 controllers with any
      absolute CD4+ T-cell count. At study entry, these participants were followed off ART for a
      12-week lead-in period, and then at week 12, participants initiated FDC FTC/RPV/TDF and had
      48 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the primary endpoint.

      All participants who completed Step 1 (48 weeks of ART) had the option to register to Step 2,
      for an additional 48 weeks of follow-up, and had the choice of either continuing FDC
      FTC/RPV/TDF or follow-up with no study treatment.

      Participants underwent safety and tolerability evaluations throughout the study, including
      physical examinations and clinical assessments. Pregnancy tests were performed on women of
      childbearing potential. Collection of stored blood plasma/peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC) samples occurred at entry and weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 96 on ART.

      Only participants who were on intervention (ART) for at least 24 weeks had samples sent for
      testing of immunologic and virologic biomarkers.
