      patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. High tidal volume was
      also reported to be associated with increased mortality in adult patients without acute lung
      injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the influence of high tidal volume on
      clinical outcome in pediatric patients who underwent surgery for congenital heart disease has
      not been evaluated yet. The investigators attempted to evaluate the effect of tidal volume on
      clinical outcome in both cyanotic and non-cyanotic congenital heart disease.
