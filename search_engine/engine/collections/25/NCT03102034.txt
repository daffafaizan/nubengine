    
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII, a recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative
      infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants could be enrolled in the study outside of RSV season (between April 1 and
      October 14 for most sites or-for sites with local RSV seasons that start earlier-as specified
      on a site-by-site basis in the Manual Of Procedures). All participants remained on study
      until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar
      year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration was between 6 and 13 months,
      depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants attended several study visits
      throughout the study, which included physical examinations, blood collection, and nasal
      washes. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by study staff at various times
      during the study to monitor participants' health.
