      transversus abdominis in particular. They will then have real time ultrasound measurements of
      the resting and contracted thickness of their left transversus abdominis muscle. After this,
      they will receive actual or sham needling to their left multifidus muscle by another
      researchers blinded to the real time ultrasound measurements. After needling or sham
      intervention is complete, the original researchers will return to re-measure transversus
      abdominis. They will be blind to intervention allocation.
