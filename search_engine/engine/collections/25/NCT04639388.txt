    
      22q11.2DS is one of the most common microdeletion syndromes (1 / 2000-1 / 4000 births) and
      one of the most robust genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (1 to 2% of cases).
      Reciprocally, approximately 30% of patients with 22q11.2DS will develop psychotic symptoms in
      adolescence or early adulthood. It is now well established that children and adults with
      22q11.2DS have lower social skills than developing youth. These social dysfunctions could be
      partly underpinned by alterations in social cognitive processes, and could also be linked to
      the emergence of psychotic signs or even schizophrenia. However, to our knowledge, no study
      has investigated the existence of behavioral prodromal signs during the onset of psychotic
      signs in children with 22q11.2DS. In addition, the origin of social cognitive processes
      remains to this day little explored.
