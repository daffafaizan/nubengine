      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of donepezil hydrochloride vs placebo, in terms of improving
           neurocognitive symptom cluster (i.e., cognitive impairment, subjective confusion, and
           fatigue), in patients who have undergone partial- or whole-brain irradiation for brain
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on mood and quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified according to prior brain irradiation type (whole-brain vs
      partial-brain) and study site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral donepezil hydrochloride once or twice daily for up to 24
           weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once or twice daily for up to 24 weeks in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete self-reported questionnaires (quality of life, fatigue, subjective
      confusion, neurocognitive battery, and mood) at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
