      anxiety. Written disclosure therapy (WDT) reduces stress in patients with a variety of
      chronic illnesses. We sought to determine if written disclosure therapy benefits patients
      with chronic lung diseases when it is added as a component to the pulmonary rehabilitation
      program.
