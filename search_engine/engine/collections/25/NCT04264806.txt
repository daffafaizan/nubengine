      camelid origin that binds with high affinity to human Cluster of Differentiation 70 (CD70).
      Azacitidine (an Hypomethylating agent [HMA]) is approved for the treatment of higher-risk MDS
      in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). Both approvals are based on data
      showing decreased transfusion burden, delayed progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      improved quality of life, and extended survival. It is hypothesized that the addition of
      cusatuzumab to azacitidine will result in an improvement in overall response rate (ORR)
      compared with azacitidine alone in participants with higher-risk MDS or CMML.
