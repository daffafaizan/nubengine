      Alzheimer's disease. Attempts to compensate for the reduced cerebral metabolic rates in AD
      have met with some success. Treatment of AD patients with high doses of glucose and insulin
      will raise cognitive scores. However, this effect is slight, and high doses of insulin can
      have adverse consequences. Administration of ketone bodies or their metabolic precursors such
      as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) presents an attractive alternative to glucose and
      insulin. In a preliminary study, tricaprilin, an MCT, demonstrated pharmacological activity
      and statistically significant efficacy in improving short-term memory and attention
      performance after a single dose.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either tricaprilin or a matching placebo,
      administered once a day by mixing powder in a glass of liquid. The treatment period will last
      90 days, followed by a 2-week washout period. Each patient will be seen 5 times: at
      screening, baseline, and post-baseline days 45, 90, and 104. The visits will include physical
      and/or neuropsychological examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory tests.
