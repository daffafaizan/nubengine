      involve primary care practitioners (PCP), (2) the additional effect of PCP involvement over
      and beyond Algos alone in unknown, and (3) little research on suicide behaviours has been
      conducted in the FOD, this proposal has the following main aim: to assess the effectiveness
      and the efficacy of the intervention, in supplement and downstream to Algos, of a healthcare
      professional, on the recurrence of suicide attempts in the FOD; the healthcare professional
      will be the patient's general practitioner, whenever possible.
