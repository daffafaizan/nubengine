    
      The MANUS Trial is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients
      with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and digital ischemia with intractable ischemic digital ulcers
      refractory to conventional treatments are eligible to participate.

      20 participants will be randomised (1:1) to undergo intramuscular injection (8 sites) of
      allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) (45-50*10^6) or placebo in
      the most affected limb.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the toxicity of the treatment at 12
      weeks after MSC administration, defined as

        1. Local toxicity, including signs of local inflammation (swelling, warmth, impairment of
           function), worsening of ulcers or new ulcers or hematomas after MSC administration

        2. Other adverse events, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
           Events version 4.0, expressed as maximum grade toxicity per organ system.

      Secondary outcome measures are: number of serious adverse events, pain and disability
      parameters; healing, time to healing and reduction of new ischemic digital ulcers; modified
      Rodnan skin score; Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (S-HAQ) including visual
      analogue scales (VAS) for scleroderma-specific symptoms; Quality-of-life (SF-36, EuroQol
      (EQ-5D); Cochin hand function score. We will also evaluate changes in capillary morphology
      and architecture using capillaroscopy; biochemical parameters; markers for endothelial
      activation and injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, circulating cells including
      endothelial cells, hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, cytokines and growth
      factors, immunological responses. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 48 hours and 2, 4, 8,
      12, 24 and 52 weeks post-treatment.
