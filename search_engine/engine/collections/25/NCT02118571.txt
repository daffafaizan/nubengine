      predictor of functional impairment among people with schizophrenia because it is associated
      with poor response to psychosocial interventions, employment status, and social functioning.
      Because the subjective experience of CIAS is likely to be associated with patient burden,
      distress, and motivation for treatment, it is important that this experience be assessed in a
      reliable and valid manner and from the perspective of the patient's self report. No existing
      instrument to assess CIAS has been developed with patient input directly about their
      qualitative experience of impaired cognition during the item generation stage, in accordance
      with FDA guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.
