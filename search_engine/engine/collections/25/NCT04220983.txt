      provides superior soft-tissue differentiation with excellent visualization of the prostate.
      This ViewRay platform offers the ideal setting for this study, that aims at precisely
      delivering prostate SBRT with a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated) to visible
      nodules.

      In this study, we hope to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using 36.25 Gy in 5
      fractions, plus a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated), in patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer.
