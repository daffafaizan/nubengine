      the body surface may result in heating, especially in small children during magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Investigators applied two different intravenous anesthetics as
      propofol and ketamine and studied the effect of these drugs on core body temperature.

      All patients aged between 6 months-10 years were administered midazolam and atropine. After
      that 1 mg/ kg of propofol was applied in group I, and 0,1 ml/kg of propofol ketamine mixture
      ( 10 mg/ml each) was applied in group II. Core body temperatures were taken before and after
      MRI and compared.
