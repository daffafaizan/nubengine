    
      Forty-two patients with 42 severe horizontal bone atrophy sites in the maxilla or mandible
      will be randomly assigned to two groups: ABG or GBR.

      In the ABG group, a combination of ABG with particulate xenograft, covered with collagen
      membrane, will be used, while only a combination of particulate xenograft and collagen
      membrane alone will be in the GBR group. After 6-9 months of healing, implants were inserted.
      All implants will be definitively restored 6 months after implant placement. Radiographic
      examination (cone beam computed tomograms, CBCT) will be performed to evaluate the amount of
      horizontal bone width (HBW) gain immediately after bone grafting procedure (T0), at 6 months
      (T6), and at 18 months (T18). Patient demographic information, amount of width augmentation,
      implant survival, complications, and contributing factors will be gathered and analyzed.
