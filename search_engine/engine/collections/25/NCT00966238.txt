      four dose groups. Following vaccination, each subject will remain at the study site for at
      least 30 minutes to be observed for any immediate reactogenicity complaints associated with
      the Day 0 vaccination. Subjects will also be evaluated during clinic visits on Study Days 1,
      7, 14, and 28 following vaccination. In addition, a safety follow-up telephone contact will
      occur on post vaccination Day 3.

      There will be 20 subjects per dose group. Up to 3 study sites will enroll 6-10 subjects per
      dose group over a two-day enrollment period. Progression to the next higher dose group will
      take place only if the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) assessment of the 30 (+15) minutes,
      Day 0, and Day 1 post vaccination safety data; Day 3 telephone report: and the Day 0 and Day
      1 serum C-reactive protein (CRP) results concludes that the lower dose was well tolerated.
