      image)-guided regional anesthesia (local numbing medicine) to the hip area given in addition
      to general anesthesia just prior to same day elective hip arthroscopy, is effective in
      reducing acute postoperative pain, and time to discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.
      In addition, the study aims to examine whether this regional anesthesia medication has any
      effect on the study subjects' use of pain medication both during and after the procedure,
      return to function, and quality of life in the 6 month period after the surgical procedure.
      Although hip arthroscopy is a routine procedure, the best method for pain control is not well
      established, and is the purpose of this study.
