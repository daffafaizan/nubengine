      Center. The eligible women will be randomized to use of a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)
      cloth with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate vaginal scrub (including standard preoperative care
      prior to cesarean section) or standard preoperative care. Participants will not be blinded to
      the arm in which they have been assigned.

      Researchers will have access to all patients scheduled for delivery at Mount Sinai Medical
      Center. About 1800 deliveries by cesarean section occur each year at Mount Sinai. Of these,
      approximately 800 are cesarean sections after failed labor. Assuming a primary outcome rate
      of 20% in the control arm, a sample size of 329 in each group would give 80% power to detect
      a 40% reduction in surgical site infection between the active group and control. The aim is
      to recruit 400 patients per group (for a total of 800 patients) to account for patient drop
      out or non-compliance.

      Sage Products, Inc will be providing the CHG cloths.

      This study intends to show that simultaneous use of 2% CHG cloths and 4% CHG vaginal scrub
      prior to cesarean section will reduce the rate of SSI in women who have previously been
      laboring.
