      Alprostadil on digital perfusion by laser Doppler capillary velocimetry and digital
      temperature recovery with thermography following standardized cold challenge and to assess
      the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of Alprostadil topical cream and placebo cream in
      adult subjects with a diagnosis of Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
      (SSc).
