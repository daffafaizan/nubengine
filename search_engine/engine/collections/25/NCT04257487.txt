    
      This prospective cohort study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of the extended
      treatment with Sulodexide (Vessel®) in the secondary prevention of DVT / PE recurrence in
      elderly outpatients (≥ 75 years old at the time of inclusion) ), with at least one of the
      known bleeding risk factor, who had a first episode of lower extremity proximal DVT and / or
      PE, idiopathic or associated with weak or removed risk factors, and who have received
      standard treatment with any oral anticoagulant drug lasting at least 3 months. The study
      seeks to verify the safety of the Sulodexide therapy, demonstrating non-inferiority compared
      to placebo, with an incidence of major bleeding around 1% (upper confidence limit not > 3%).
