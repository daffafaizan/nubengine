      precluding patients from participating in a satisfying life. Traditional drug and
      psychosocial therapy and available specific treatment strategies that directly target single
      key determinants of functional outcome like neurocognition, social cognition, and social
      behavioral skills have produced only moderate effects leaving an urgent need for further
      optimization. The present trial aims to more efficaciously improve functional outcome by
      integrating social behavioral and social cognitive treatment strategies. Six months of
      "Integrated Social Cognitive and Behavioral Skills Therapy (ISST)" will be compared with
      "Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy (NCRT)" as active control condition in a randomized
      multicenter clinical trial using a two group pre-post design with 2x90 patients in the
      remitted early phase of schizophrenia. Beyond "all-cause-discontinuation" as common primary
      outcome of all clinical trials of the ESPRIT-consortium, measures of functional outcome and
      subjective quality of life, patient experience as well as neurocognitive, social-cognitive
      and social behavioral measures will be assessed at baseline (V0), after completion of
      treatment (V6), and after 6 months follow-up (V12). ISST is expected to reduce the one-year
      discontinuation rate by 20% compared with NCRT, and to be superior in functional outcome
      measures by an effect size of at least d=0.42.
