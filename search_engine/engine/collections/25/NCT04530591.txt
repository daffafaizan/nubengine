      This study is a one-time, preliminary survey of participants with opioid use disorder to
      assess the need for, and community attitudes towards, a wearable device capable of
      autonomously detecting and responding to an opioid overdose. The results of this survey will
      be used to guide ongoing development of a de novo device. This study will be conducted over a
      3 month period and survey participants from the Kensington Neighborhood in North
      Philadelphia.
