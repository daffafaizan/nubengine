      dialysis, pre-dialysis and the control group; with about 25 patients planned to be involved
      in each group. The laboratory parameters to be measured are Pentraxin-3, C-reactive protein
      (CRP), high sensitive CRP, fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Concomitantly, carotis intima media
      thickness will be measured in the radiology clinic. Statistical analysis will be carried on
      by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 13.0. The variables acting on
      the inflammatory parameters and the correlation between them and carotis intima media
      thickness will be studied.
