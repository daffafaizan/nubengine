    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy, as determined by progression-free survival, of FOLFOX6 and
      bevacizumab with versus without gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical benefit of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6 and
      bevacizumab, as measured by objective response rate.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RO4929097 in
      combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab.

      IV. To investigate PD response of RO4929097 in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and
      bevacizumab, as assessed by direct measurement of gamma-secretase enzyme activity, in tumor
      samples.

      V. (Exploratory) To investigate the Notch signaling pathway genes targeted by RO4929097 in
      combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical outcome.

      VI. (Exploratory) To investigate the Ras signaling pathway genes targeted by RO4929097 in
      combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical outcome.

      VII. (Exploratory) To investigate putative colorectal cancer stem cells targeted by RO4929097
      in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and bevacizumab and correlate with clinical
      outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, prior therapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant vs none), and number of organs* involved by
      metastases (1 vs > 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      NOTE: *Lesions all in the liver would be considered as 1 organ involved.

      ARM I: Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen comprising oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2
      hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1-2. Patients also receive oral gamma-secretase
      inhibitor RO4929097 on days 1-3 and 8-10.

      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      (RO4929097 is given for up to 12 courses).

      ARM II: Patients receive FOLFOX6 regimen and bevacizumab as in arm I.

      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 12 months.
