      crossover design, where 120 women between 18 of age and older who report insertional
      dyspareunia, pain with tampon insertion, and tenderness localized to the vulvar vestibule
      will be enrolled in the study. Electronically entered daily diaries will be used to determine
      if pain is lower in PVD subjects when treated with gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/d) compared to
      when treated with placebo. Biological measurements will include assessment of allodynia and
      hyperalgesia from capsaicin administration, muscle tension using a vaginal pressure
      algometer, number of tender points by clinical examination, and changes in blood pressure,
      pulse and heart rate variability. . The Long-range goals of this project are to explicate the
      underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of PVD, and to use this knowledge to create
      evidence-based differential diagnoses of subtypes of PVD and to individualize treatments for
      each subtype. The immediate goal is to conduct a multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) of gabapentin treatment for PVD, and which will also provide critical data on a new
      PVD-testing and response paradigm, as well as on characteristics that may define subtypes of
      PVD. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with analgesic, anxiolytic, and antispasmotic effects, was
      selected because of its efficacy in treating other neuropathic pain conditions.
