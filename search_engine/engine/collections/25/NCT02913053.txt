    
      This randomised controlled clinical intervention study will take place across three European
      sites; the German Sport University Cologne, Germany, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands
      and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Seventy-five previously sedentary patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of MCI will be recruited at each site. Participants will be randomised to
      one of three intervention arms. One group will receive a standardised one-year extensive
      aerobic exercise intervention (3 units of 45min / week). The second group will complete
      stretching and toning (non-aerobic) exercise (3 units of 45min / week) and the third group
      will receive usual care. Change in all outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after six
      months (T1) and after 12 months (T2).
