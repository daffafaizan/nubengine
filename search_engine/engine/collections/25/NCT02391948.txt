      balance, range of motion limitations, and strength) on 5 occasions (6-months apart over 2
      years). Parents will complete questionnaires to track changes in the child's endurance,
      health conditions, and participation in self-care and recreation activities, at the same data
      collection points. The researchers will use these 5 data collection points to develop
      reference percentiles and will present the data so that therapists can assist families to
      determine if children with CP are developing as expected, better than expected, or more
      poorly than expected, depending on their functional ability levels.

      The researchers will create longitudinal developmental curves for impairments, health
      conditions, and participation variables by estimating the average pattern of change,
      important individual variations in the pattern of change between children, and the degree of
      consistency over time within children. Establishment of longitudinal developmental curves
      will provide easily understood and useful tools for families and service providers to discuss
      questions about how well their children are doing in relationship to other children with CP
      of similar functional ability levels. The researchers will then utilize service data
      collected from parents and children's progress on the longitudinal developmental curves to
      develop recommendations for rehabilitation service provision for children with CP across
      functional ability levels. Having this information should assist with collaborative
      decision-making among family members and service providers that efficiently utilizes
      rehabilitation services to meet families' goals.

      An additional sub-study is to collect direct physical activity measurements from a sub-set of
      the children in the larger study. These data will be examined in relationship to other
      measures of endurance and participation.
