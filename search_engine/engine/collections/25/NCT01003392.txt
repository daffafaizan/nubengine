      they will be submitted to treadmill test, MAPA, Holter-ECG and vascular reactivity study,
      biochemical and inflammatory plasma dosages, as basal. Then they will start a period of
      coffee drinking over 4 weeks; and all exams will be repeated. We will study two types of
      coffee, arabica and robusta; with two types of toasted beans(regular and soft). Also regular
      and decaffeinated coffee. A total of 300 (100 normal people, 100 diabetics, 100 coronary
      disease) individuals will be tested.
