    
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-centre study to determine safety of a fixed dose of
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500 mg) monotherapy in participants with unresectable Stage III NSCLC
      who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT. Approximately, 150
      participants will be treated with the study drug in Europe and North America. Participants
      will be in complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or have stable disease (SD)
      following definitive, platinum-based sCRT, as assessed by the Investigator and further
      supported by the screening imaging radiological assessment. Participants must not have
      progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT; radiation therapy must be completed
      within 42 days prior to first Investigational product (IP) dose administration. Participants
      must have histologically- or cytologically-documented NSCLC and locally-advanced,
      unresectable Stage III disease. Participants will be treated with the study drug in 2
      cohorts: approximately 100-120 participants in the World Health Organization/Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (WHO/ECOG PS) 0 to 1 Cohort and up to 30
      participants in the WHO/ECOG PS 2 Cohort.
