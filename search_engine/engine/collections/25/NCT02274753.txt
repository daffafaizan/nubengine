      (i) to combine at time of diagnosis the immunoscore with parameters related to the patient,
      its tumor and the associated microenvironment (ii) to detect events occurring during the
      follow up period that could modify the initial prognosis and lead to a repositioning of the
      patient, to move towards a dynamic personalized medicine.

      (iii) to explore the Theranostic aspect of the parameters monitored at the time of diagnosis
      for patients with colonic cancers treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

      To this end we will investigate:

        -  Tumor's features:

           - We will determine the microsatellite instability status and search for mutations of 46
           genes (ABL1, AKT1, ALK, APC, ATM, BRAF, CCDH1, CDKN2A, CSF1R, CTNNB, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4,
           EZH2, FBXW7, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HNF1A, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2,
           JAK2, JAK3, KDR, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11,
           RB1, RET, SMAD4, SMARCB1, SMO, STK11, TP53, VHL) by next generation sequencing (NGS).

        -  Tumor immune microenvironment features:

           - 24 immune related genes, 24 miRNA and co-inihibitory molecules (PD1, PD1-L, LAG-3,
           TIM3, CTLA-4) will be explored on tumor samples.

        -  Systemic disorders:

             -  Autoimmunity, allergy or inflammatory diseases will be sought with a dedicated
                questionnaire filled out by the patient and a serum examination for the screening
                of immune disorders at the time of diagnosis and during the survey.

             -  The nutritional status (% of weight loss) and the deficiencies in vitamins, folic
                acid, trace elements and thyroid hormones that synergise with immune cells will be
                determined at the time of diagnosis.

        -  Psychological status:

           - The impact of the psychological profile of the patient will be investigated with a
           dedicated questionnaire, given at the time of diagnosis and every six months.

        -  Data mining to achieve a dynamic personalized medicine:

      The integration and statistical analysis of heterogeneous data types (clinical and different
      experimental data) will be performed using with tranSMART, an open source platform and with
      bioinformatic tools (TMEdb, ClueGO, CluePedia, Genesis) developed by participant teams.
