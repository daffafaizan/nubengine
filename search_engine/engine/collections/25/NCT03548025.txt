      be invited for two follow-up visits - 3 and 6 months after the last therapy. They will be
      again photographed.

      Three blinded evaluators will be scoring the full face photos according to the Fitzpatrick
      Wrinkle Severity Scale. The improvement of the scores will be evaluated. Every subject will
      serve as its own control.

      In addition, the occurence of an AE during the whole study, as well as the therapy discomfort
      during the treatment phase, will be followed.
