      local treatment for the management of polyps with T1 CRC in relation to disease-free survival
      and morbi-mortality of the therapeutic procedure. We will also validate molecular signatures
      in endoscopic samples for the prediction of lymph node metastasis and survival. Methodology:
      Clinical Study: Retrospective population-based cohort study that will include baseline
      clinical and follow up data of more than 1400 T1 CRCs in at least 10 Spanish autonomous
      communities from 2007 to 2017. A centralized pathological review will be carried out by a
      group of expert pathologists. Inter and intraobserver variability for histological staging
      will be assessed. A predictive model will be created to discriminate individuals with high
      probability of receiving surgical and local treatment. For those patients who have a similar
      probability range, the results in progression-free survival and adverse events will be
      compared. Translational phase: A 5miRNAs and 8mRNA signature predictive of lymph node
      metastasis will be assessed in 200 endoscopic samples and related with prognosis.
