      And then the patients will be divided into early group and delayed group randomly. In the
      early group, CRRT was started immediately after randomization. In the delay group, CRRT was
      initiated if at least one of the following criteria was met: KDIGO 3, severe hyperkalemia,
      pulmonary edema, blood urea nitrogen level higher than 112 mg per deciliter after
      randomization. Overall survival at day 90 will be observed in order to understand whether
      different CRRT strategy would affect the outcomes of SAKI.
