      multifactorial origin, a factor related to both the progression and outcomes of CKD, being
      involved in all causes of mortality in these patients, such as cardiovascular disease. In
      this context, some nutritional strategies have been proposed as an adjuvant therapeutic
      alternative to modulate inflammation, starting from the consolidated knowledge of the role of
      nutrients and bioactive compounds on the expression of genes related to inflammation and
      oxidative stress, factors that feed on each other. In view of this scenario, propolis, a
      substance made up of a combination of several chemical components with broad potential
      biological activity, appears as a promising alternative to modulate inflammation in patients
      with CKD. However, clinical evidence to assess the effects of propolis in patients with CKD
      is scarce, and there are no studies that have investigated its effects on gene expression and
      markers related to inflammation in these patients. Thus, the present project proposes a
      longitudinal study of the clinical trial type that aims to evaluate the effects of propolis
      alcoholic extract on transcription factors and inflammatory markers in patients with CKD.
