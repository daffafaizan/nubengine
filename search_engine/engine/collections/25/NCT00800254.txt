      over the age of 60 and compromises the quality of life of more than 20 million Americans. To
      alleviate pain and disability associated with knee OA, over 400,000 total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) are performed each year in the United States, and future projections indicate that by
      the year 2030, more than 750,000 TKAs will be performed per year. While TKA reliably reduces
      pain and improves function, the recovery of force and function to normal levels is rare,
      which predisposes patients to future disability with increasing age. A month after TKA,
      impairments in quadriceps force are predominantly due to reflex inhibition, but are also
      influenced, to a lesser degree, by muscle atrophy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (NMES) may offer a promising alternative approach to override quadriceps reflex inhibition
      and prevent muscle atrophy to restore normal quadriceps muscle function more effectively than
      voluntary exercise alone, especially when applied within the first days after surgery.

      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of NMES initiated 48hrs after TKA
      as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation. NMES is expected to more effectively restore normal
      quadriceps muscle function to produce greater quadriceps force by decreasing reflex
      inhibition. Patients will be randomized into one of two rehabilitation groups: 1) the
      standard rehabilitation group or 2) standard rehabilitation + NMES.
