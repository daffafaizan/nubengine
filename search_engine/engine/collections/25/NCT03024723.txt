      during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients are more vulnerable to develop
      airway obstruction either during sleep1 or under anesthesia, and the segment of obese
      individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway management under
      anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event related to
      difficult airway management under anesthesia is "cannot intubate, cannot ventilate".

      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Obese patients are a
      high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and prone to develop progressively
      narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue volume surrounding the
      pharyngeal airway. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the
      upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near
      100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep
      apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the
      investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients
      under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the
      efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general
      anesthesia.
