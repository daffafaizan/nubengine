      alba) extract (Belinal; 2% cream) on the skin parameters and functions in comparison to the
      placebo cream. 10 healthy female subjects will use the test cream on one half and placebo
      cream on the other half of the face and of the gluteal area (split-face and split-gluteal
      area ) twice a day for 12 weeks. Face skin parameters will be evaluated before the cream use
      (the baseline), after 6 and after 12 weeks of the cream use. The photoprotective potential of
      Belinal will be evaluated with a determination of the minimal erythema dose (MED) at the
      gluteal area before (the baseline) and after 12 weeks of the cream use. Comparison will be
      done as the mean of the individual ratios. The differences between the before-after condition
      will be analyzed with the statistical test of analysis of variance. In case of failure to
      find homogeneity in the variances the nonparametric ANOVA, the Willcoxon test, will be used.
      The results will be expressed as mean Â± standard error for each group with a significance
      level of 0.05 for all the statistical tests.
