      of lentils (small green Eston and red split) within food products (muffins and chilies) on
      satiety and food intake in healthy adults, for a total of 6 study treatments. A total of 3 to
      6 study visits (corresponding to consuming all muffins and/or all chilies) will take place
      where participants will consume one of the study treatments and subsequently complete satiety
      questionnaires over 180 minutes to measure satiety as subjective appetite sensations (hunger,
      fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption). At 180 minutes, participants will
      receive ad libitum pizza and bottled water to consume until they are comfortably full for a
      measure of weighed food intake. At the end of each study visit, participants will be given a
      food scale and instructed to weigh and record all food and drink consumed for the remainder
      of the day for a measure of 24-hour energy intake.
