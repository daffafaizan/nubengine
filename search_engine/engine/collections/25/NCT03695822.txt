      include antimuscarinics and beta-agonist. Similar efficacy has been reported between
      antimuscarinics and beta-agonist. Antimuscarinics has been found to be beneficial for
      patients with psychological distress. However, the impact of mirabegron on psychological
      distress in female OAB remains unknown. In addition, some animal studies found that beta-3
      agonist can improve arterial blood flow, bladder ischemia and might improve bladder function;
      however, there is still lack of human study. Besides, c reactive protein was found to be
      elevated in female OAB. Nonetheless there is no study mentioning about the impact of
      mirabegron on c reactive protein. Thus, the aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of
      mirabegron on psychological distress, bladder blood flow and c reactive protein.
