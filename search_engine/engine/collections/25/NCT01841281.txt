      L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care
      medications. We hypothesize that these patients will have lower exhaled NO concentrations
      (<20 ppb) and lower nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2)/ arginase I (Arg1) mRNA ratios in their
      airway epithelial cells than "non-responders." The aim is to test the hypothesis that adult
      severe asthma subjects with exhaled breath NO concentrations < 20 ppb will have fewer
      American Thoracic Society (ATS)-defined asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with
      L-arginine compared to subjects with exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) > 25 ppb. The
      major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will
      benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy to define the underlying mechanisms of arginine
      benefit in asthma. This follows our initial 20 subject trial of L-arginine in asthma subjects
      (Kenyon et al., Pharmaceuticals 2011) that was designed to determine how L-arginine was
      metabolized (by testing serum markers) and whether certain participants had clinical benefit.

      To do this, we will recruit a total of 50 ATS-defined severe asthmatic subjects with ongoing
      asthma exacerbations in past two months and enroll them in a randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over designed trial of L-arginine and placebo. We will compare 25
      subjects with "low" FeNO < 20 with 25 subjects that have "high" FeNO > 25 ppb.
