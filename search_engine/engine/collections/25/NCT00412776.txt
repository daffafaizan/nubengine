    
      Head and neck cancer is a general description of a disease that includes several types of
      soft tissue carcinomas that develop in the head and neck regions.

      Proxinium is a recombinant fusion protein that binds to the epithelial cell adhesion molecule
      (Ep-CAM) that is highly expressed on squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN).
      Proxinium is administered via intratumoural injection.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the overall survival time for patients
      treated with intratumourally injected Proxinium plus BSC versus BSC alone. Secondary
      objectives of the study include comparison of locoregional tumour control, local
      progression-free survival, symptomatic benefit and safety profile in patients who receive
      Proxinium plus BSC versus patients who receive BSC
