    
      Target controlled infusion (TCI) is a technique to administer intravenous drugs that allows
      rapid achievement and maintenance of predetermined drug concentrations, either in plasma (Cp)
      or at the site of effect (Ce).

      To characterize the time profile of propofol effect an additional parameter, the
      equilibration half time between plasma and effect site (T1/2keo) needs to be incorporated in
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) model.
