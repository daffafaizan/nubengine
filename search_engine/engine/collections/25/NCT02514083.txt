      cells that often affect elderly patients. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies
      have indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and
      survive because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL cells
      benefit from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.

      The stimulation through the BCR can be reduced with ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that
      selectively inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib
      demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease. Ibrutinib has
      gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL patients with 17p deletion and for those who had
      at least one prior therapy. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does
      not eliminate all the tumor cells, and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant.
      Therefore, a combination of ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial. Here we chose
      fludarabine because it is a well-tolerated drug that has been used widely to treat CLL. Also,
      fludarabine can kill both malignant B cells and T cells that support the growth of leukemia
      cells. With this approach, we hope to restore a healthier immune system.

      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib combined with fludarabine.
      This protocol is intended for previously untreated CLL patients. Ibrutinib will be given
      daily until disease progression or intolerable side effects occur. Fludarabine will be given
      only in cycles 3 and 4.
