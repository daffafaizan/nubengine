      stress magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) is an established clinical method with high
      diagnostic and prognostic value for the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease
      (CAD). However, the assessment of cine images relies on the visual interpretation of regional
      wall motion, which is subjective, and objective approaches for the detection of inducible
      ischemia with DS-MRI are still lacking.

      In our study Strain-Encoded-MRI (SENC) is used for the objective color-coded evaluation of
      regional myocardial strain during DS-MRI in patients with intermediate to high pretest
      probability for CAD. We anticipated that this technique would exhibit enhanced sensitivity
      for the detection of anatomically significant CAD compared to conventional wall motion
      reading, with invasive coronary angiography used as the standard reference.
