    
      Study is a Phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of
      AA4500 for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. To be eligible for
      treatment, a subject must have unilateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder with
      restricted range of motion in the affected shoulder for at least 3 months but not more than
      12 months. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 28 days before injection of
      study drug.

      Approximately 300 adult women and men are to be enrolled in this study. Following screening
      and determination of study eligibility, subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive 0.58 mg of
      AA4500 or placebo. Subjects will receive up to 3 injections of study drug. Each injection
      will be separated by a minimum of 21 days. Subjects will also be instructed in home shoulder
      exercises after the first injection.
