      randomized in 2:1 fashion into either intensive statin group or standard care group. Patients
      in intensive statin group is further randomized into two subgroups: administrated with either
      atorvastatin 80mg 12h prior PCI, then 40mg 2h prior PCI, followed by 40 mg/d for 30 days
      after PCI; or rosuvastatin 20mg 12h prior PCI, then 10mg 2h prior PCI; followed by 10 mg/d
      for 30 days after PCI, while the standard care group receives atorvastatin 20 mg/d. After
      angiography, patients who are not undergoing PCI procedure will be excluded from the study as
      selection failure. The last visit will be at 6 months after PCI. Clinical data such as
      troponin, CK-MB, Scr, CCR, ALT, AST before and 24h to 48h after procedure will be recorded.
      1000 eligible patients will be finally enrolled.The study will be conducted at 12 centers in
      China.
