    
      This phase III randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the impact of the addition of
      ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to zoledronic acid the multiple myeloma progression
      rate at 5 years. A dynamic allocation procedure will be used to allocate an equal number of
      patients to each of the treatment arms. This procedure will balance the number of patients
      which falls into each of the following categories between the two treatment arms:

        1. % of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow: 5-9%

        2. age < 60; % of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow < 5%; and monoclonal
           protein/clonal light chains present in the blood or urine

        3. age < 60; % of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow < 5% and no monoclonal
           protein/clonal light chains present in the blood or urine, (MRD+) minimal residual
           disease

        4. age ≥ 60; % of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow < 5%; and monoclonal
           protein/clonal light chains present in the blood or urine

        5. age ≥ 60; % of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow < 5% and no monoclonal
           protein/clonal light chains present in the blood or urine, (MRD+) minimal residual
           disease

      The primary and secondary objectives are described below.

      Primary objective

      To assess whether ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone with zoledronic acid is more
      promising than zoledronic acid alone in increasing the time before progression to multiple
      myeloma.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To assess changes in minimal residual disease [MRD] by flow cytometry from study entry,
           at the completion of treatment, and at 1 year post registration.

        2. To assess whether ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone with zoledronic acid is more
           promising than zoledronic acid alone in extending overall survival.

        3. To examine the pharmacodynamics effects of treatment on biochemical markers of bone
           formation (osteocalcin bone-specific alkaline phosphatase), resorption (serum CTX), and
           metabolism (OPG).

      Follow-up requirements after documentation of progression to multiple myeloma includes a
      maximum of five years following registration.
