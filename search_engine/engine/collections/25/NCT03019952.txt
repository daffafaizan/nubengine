      are extremely infrequent, costly, and occur most often when providers are intimately involved
      as part of a multidisciplinary team in a single setting such as at a school. Often, little
      information is transmitted between providers and/or school personnel in determining treatment
      goals and interventions. Furthermore, the transmission of information is often provider to
      provider or school personnel to provider, which excludes direct patient-input and lessens
      transparency in decision making. In an effort to improve current care and therefore improve
      successful adult transitions for adolescents with ASD, t-CARE is designed to mimic
      multidisciplinary team meetings. These meetings are incredibly impactful as they include
      direct individual and family involvement through facilitated information-sharing, while also
      maintaining patient-centered care across multiple providers and complex systems of care.
