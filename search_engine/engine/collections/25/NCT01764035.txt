      in bipolar disorder. It distills the findings from previous mindfulness-based interventions
      for other disorders that documented beneficial effects for sleep, by concentrating on the
      most active mindfulness ingredient for treating sleep (the Body Scan). To date, mindfulness
      based studies have focused on either subjective sleep reports or laboratory-based measures of
      sleep, both of which have long been called into question because of their lack of ecological
      validity. This study takes advantage of recent developments in ambulatory sleep monitoring by
      using the new, FDA approved M1 device, which assesses sleep objectively in a patient's home
      environment. The M1 device is also the only ambulatory sleep-monitoring device to date that
      simultaneously assesses both sleep quantity and quality. Finally, this study broadens the
      view above and beyond sleep and mood and investigates the impact on cognitive and
      sleep-related psychosocial functioning, both at the end of treatment as well as at a 3-month
      follow-up. Overall, this work could result in a brief, easy to administer, and easy to
      disseminate intervention for patients with bipolar disorder with insomnia.
