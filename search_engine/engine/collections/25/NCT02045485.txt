      Patients having systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of ischemic heart disease,
      significant valvular heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypo or
      hyper-thyroidism, renal failure or any associated systemic disease were excluded. Diagnosis
      of psoriasis was confirmed by dermatological examination and/or punch biopsy. Severity of the
      psoriasis was evaluated by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Patients were evaluated
      by physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography.
