      patients scheduled to receive FEC100 (3 cycles)/docetaxel (3 cycles) myelosuppressive
      chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study after they meet all the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. Four (4) Cohorts of 12 patients each will be studied; they will be randomized
      either in the ANF-RHO™ treatment arm at different doses (10 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, or 30 μg/kg, for
      the cohorts 1-3, respectively) or Neulasta® (6 mg / 0.6 ml SC injection, for cohort 4). For
      the cohorts 1-3, 12 patients from each of the respective ANF-RHO™ cohorts will be randomized
      with four patients from cohort 4 (Neulasta®). Patients in the ANF-RHO™ cohorts will receive
      study drug on Day 1 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Patients in the Neulasta® cohort will receive
      study drug on Day 2 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Doses of ANF-RHO™/Neulasta® will be provided
      for a total of 6 cycles (21 days each). The total duration of the study 129 ± 2 days (126
      Days of treatment period followed by end of study visit)
