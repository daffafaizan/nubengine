      pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in female patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast
      cancer. This design will be used for two independent, race-based cohorts: 18 African
      American/Black patients and 18 Non-Hispanic White patients. Women are eligible if they are
      older than 18, have HR+/HER2- mBC and are candidates for treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor
      and endocrine therapy. Patients are ineligible if currently prescribed a medication that
      inhibits or induces the CYP3A isoenzymes, have baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities, or
      are otherwise considered to be ineligible for ribociclib. Participants will provide serial
      blood samples during the first cycle (collected immediately prior to the ribociclib dose, and
      0.5hr ± 5min, 1hr ± 5min, 2hr ± 15min, 4hr ± 15min, 6hr ± 15min after the daily dose of
      ribociclib). Plasma samples will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (e.g., AUC0-24, Cmax). Pharmacogenetic testing will be performed using the
      PharmacoScanTM microarray, which tests 4,627 markers in 1,191 genes, including variants in
      CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
