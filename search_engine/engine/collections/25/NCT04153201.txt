    
      Patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (either thrombotic or obstetric) on regular
      follow-up at our outpatient rheumatology department and being treated with standard care
      (systemic anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents), are randomized to receive either
      hydroxychloroquine plus standard care, or standard care alone, on a 1:1 ratio using block
      size 2 randomization, after exclusion of patients with contraindications to
      hydroxychloroquine or prior hydroxychloroquine use within 12 months of consideration for
      enrollment. Patients are monitored clinically every 3 months and the development of
      thrombosis and/or adverse effects attributable to hydroxychloroquine is recorded.
      Antiphospholipid antibody titers (anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G (IgG)/Immunoglobulin M
      (IgM) and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I IgG/IgM isotypes) are measured semi-annually.
      Intention-to-treat survival analysis is applied for assessing the effect of
      hydroxychloroquine on the incidence of thrombosis. Longitudinal mixed linear models are
      applied for assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine on longitudinal titers of
      antiphospholipid antibodies.
