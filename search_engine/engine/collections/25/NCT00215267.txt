      place along all large water bodies (rivers and lakes).

      Morbidity control should aim at increasing the length of time before morbidity reappears and
      decrease the time during which morbidity regresses in a situation with continued transmission
      and re-infection. It is proposed to test this by comparing the standard treatment with a
      double treatment (2 x 40 mg/kg) two weeks apart.

      The overall objective of the project is to contribute to an increased knowledge about the
      effect of praziquantel on schistosomiasis related morbidity and re-infection level among
      communities living along Lake Victoria in Mayuge district, Uganda with the overall aim of
      improving the strategies for morbidity control.

      The study will be carried out in a high transmission area along Lake Victoria, in Mayuge
      district. It will be a randomised intervention study, comparing a single praziquantel
      treatment (40mg/kg) with two standard doses administered two weeks apart. Two groups of
      participants, with 270 people in each, will be randomly selected and randomly assigned to the
      two treatment regimens. Three consecutive stool samples will be from the cohort and blood
      samples for malaria will be examined. Clinical and ultrasonographic examinations will be
      performed. After all the examinations, the whole cohort will be treated with a single
      standard dose of praziquantel and albendazole. Two weeks later all members of one of the
      groups will receive another standard dose of praziquantel. Follow-up examinations will be
      performed 8 weeks, 6 months and two years later.
