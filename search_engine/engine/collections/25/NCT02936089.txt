      entailing different prognoses.There were significant differences in the therapeutic effect
      between different subgroups of AE AML. For example, patients with c-kit mutation had higher
      relapse rate and lower overall survival, compared with those without c-kit mutation.
      Therefore, risk stratification-directed therapy is very necessary for AE AML. The purpose of
      this study is to establish risk stratification-directed therapy for AE AML.
