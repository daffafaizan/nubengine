      Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive flibanserin for an
      8-week run-in period to differentiate between responders and non-responders. Responders will
      be determined by a score of 1-3 on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 8
      weeks from baseline, and will be randomized 1:1 to receive study medication alone vs. study
      medication and sex therapy for an additional 12 weeks.
