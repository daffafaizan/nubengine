      Treatment options include observation, corticosteroid injection and surgery. Sometimes the
      risk of surgery is comparable to the likelihood of fracture without treatment. In orthopedic
      surgery, bone chips , various types of ceramics, natural and synthetized bone mineral
      hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate, as well as numerous polymers and co-polymers of
      alfa-hydroxy acids are used to perform as an osteoconductive and rarely osteoinductive factor
      to help bone formation.Some evidence demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
      deposited on the surface of this constructs enhance its osteogenic differentiation. In this
      study the investigators seeds cultured bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on bone
      matrix, to evaluate its therapeutic potential in repairing unicameral or aneurysmal bone
      cyst.This composite is placed in the bone cyst after its curettage during a
      surgery.Post-operation assessment is done by X-Ray examination and MRI at 1, 2, 6, and 12
      months after treatment.
