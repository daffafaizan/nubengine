    
      This study will be an open-label, randomised, 3 period, 3-treatment, crossover study in
      healthy subjects (males and females), performed at a single clinical unit.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the morning (fasting
           conditions) of the day before dosing with AZD7594 (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after
           dosing; discharged on the morning of Day 3;

        -  Two ambulatory visits (Day 4 and Day 5) within each treatment period; and

        -  A final visit 10 to 14 days after the last administration of AZD7594.

        -  There will be a minimum washout period of 10 days between each dose administration.

      A total of 24 subjects will be randomised to receive single doses of AZD7594 on 3 occasions,
      under fasted conditions (overnight fast of at least 10 hours):

        -  Treatment A: 0.7 mg (delivered dose) AZD7594 via nebulizer, test

        -  Treatment B: 1.6 mg (delivered dose) AZD7594 via nebulizer, test

        -  Treatment C: 720 Î¼g (delivered dose) AZD7594 via dry powder inhaler (DPI), reference

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 10 to 12 weeks.
