      little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective
      treatments. The investigators preliminary data and other published studies suggest that
      abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory
      may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This
      proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in
      PD using magnetoencephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of bifrontal
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of
      modulating this brain activity.
