    
      The following techniques will be applied:

        -  Neurophysiological testing will be performed with navigated transcranial magnetic
           stimulation (nTMS) incorporating an individual MRI of each subject's brain performed on
           1,5 MRI scanner using a series of neuropsychological protocols;

        -  Electromyoneurography (EMNG) assessment of lower and upper extremities for motor and
           sensory nerves;

        -  Neuropsychological assessment will include the general questionnaire and battery of
           cognitive and psychological tests;

        -  Immunoassays on blood samples include testing with four antibodies to monocyte markers;

        -  Clinical examinations include neurological, biochemical, neuroradiological and
           neuropsychological testing.

      The participants with relapsing-remitting MS will be tested in 3 phases: before the intake of
      steroids, 5 weeks after taking the steroids and 6 months after taking the steroids. In each
      phase, the overall testings will be accomplished in three days.
