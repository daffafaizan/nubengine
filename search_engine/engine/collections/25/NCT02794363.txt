      specializing in vulvar disorders. This study consists of a 2 week screening period. A 4mm
      vulvar punch biopsy will be obtained at the initiation of the screening period to confirm
      that the participant have active lichen sclerosus. 12 weeks after the biopsy, the
      participants will receive an injection of 5cc of autologous platelet rich plasma into the
      affected vulvar skin. Six weeks later, participants will receive an additional injection of
      5cc of autologous platelet rich plasma. A repeat biopsy will be performed 6 weeks after the
      second autologous platelet rich plasma injection. The inflammation on both biopsy specimens
      will be determined by a dermatopathologist.
