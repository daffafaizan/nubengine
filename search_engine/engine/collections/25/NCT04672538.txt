      to begin with either low Vt or high Vt ventilation. After achieving steady state, initial
      cardiac output measurements will be made using a measured oxygen consumption (VO2) and the
      Fick principle, per routine clinical protocol. Following baseline assessment of cardiac
      output and hemodynamics (which is standard of care for all catheterization procedures),
      participants will be transitioned to the alternative ventilation modality (high Vt or low
      Vt). After a 5-minute equilibration period, oxygen saturations and VO2 measurements will be
      re-acquired, to determine cardiac output and hemodynamics in this second state.
