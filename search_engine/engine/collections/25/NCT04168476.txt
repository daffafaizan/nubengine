      consultations. It can be considered as a pluripatology as it covers somatic, functional,
      psychological and social aspects. This ailment is suffered by between 45 and 70% of the
      general population during some period of life and is one of the most frequent justifications
      of work leave and the main cause of permanent disability. Mechanical cervicalgia
      significantly decreases the quality of life of those who suffer from it: it frequently
      produces a significant disability when generating pain, functional deficit, headaches,
      movement restriction, vertiginous syndromes, nausea and / or vomiting, etc. This leads to
      reduced work time and increased health system costs, causing a strong economic and social
      impact. For example, Borghouts JA and Cols point out that in the Netherlands in 1996 these
      costs were approximately 686 million dollars, which constituted 1% of total health
      expenditure and 0.1% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) . In Spain, referrals to the
      cervicalgia physiotherapy service represent 10% of the total of all health demands; in
      Britain this percentage reaches 15% and in Canada 30%. Likewise, it should be considered that
      the direct cost caused by cervicalgia to the health system in our country, specifically to
      the Primary Care consultation, constitutes 2% of the total, and in some centers this figure
      reaches up to 12% if they are considered diagnostic tests, pharmaceutical expenses and visits
      to the specialist.
