    
      Study Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Eligibility: Women older than 18 years who
      are currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment for BC.

      Intervention: The intervention group includes an 8-session multi-component intervention with
      a structured aerobic exercise program plus SM supervised by a physiotherapist.

      Setting: Outpatient-Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton, ON. Control: Usual care.
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly allocated using a 1:1 allocation ratio to
      receive the intervention of structured exercise plus SM program or usual care.

      Sample size: The study will recruit n=12 number of participants/group for a total of 24 in
      both groups.

      Analysis: A blinded assessor will assess outcomes at baseline, post intervention, at 2- and
      4-month follow up. Intervention feasibility and effectiveness will be assessed using
      descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance for continuous outcomes.

      Anticipated Impact: This study aims to assess the feasibility of a larger trial to determine
      effective ways to close the current KT gap and increase exercise awareness for women with BC.
      This project will assess process and resource variables before implementation of a larger
      scale intervention. Together, the overall project goal is to promote sustainable exercise
      behaviour to help manage the burden of BC.
