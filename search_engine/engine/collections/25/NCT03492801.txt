      I. To evaluate the ability of next generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor the evolution of
      cancer-specific mutations in patients undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung carcinoma
      and for whom the molecular profile of the tumor cells prior to treatment is known.

      II. Compare the sensitivity of digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to that of
      NGS for detecting the appearance of EGFR T790M mutations in patients treated with an EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and every 12 weeks for up to 6
      times.
