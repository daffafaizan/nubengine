      study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of monochromatic near infrared photoenergy
      therapy (MIRE) in the treatment of pain in axonal peripheral neuropathy. This will be
      compared with a placebo (sham) device.

      The MIRE is a FDA approved, drug-free, non-invasive, medical therapeutic device that uses
      near-infrared light emitting diodes to deliver monochromatic near infrared photoenergy (MIRE)
      through contact with the skin. The effect of MIRE is believed to increase local blood
      circulation by dilating vessels and to reduce pain by decreasing local swelling and
      inflammation. MIRE is also thought to increase local levels of nitric oxide (NO) which may
      decrease pain levels.

      Study subjects will receive treatment with the device or the placebo device 3 times per week
      for 4 weeks. Response will be measured during and after the treatment period.
