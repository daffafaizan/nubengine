    
      Our main objective is to measure the in vitro impact of irradiation treatment on sperm
      nuclear quality such as DNA fragmentation and oxidation, chromatin condensation and
      organisation, nucleus morphology and notably sperm telomere length (STL).

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  to measure RAT impact on sperm parameters (vitality, motility and morphology)

        -  to measure the impact of cryopreservation on chromatin organisation and nucleus
           morphology

        -  to evaluate RAT impact on human sperm cells in comparison with cryopreservation

        -  to evaluate the impact of different doses and types of irradiation on human sperm cells

        -  to establish relations between potential alterations of standards sperm parameters
           (vitality, motility and morphology) and nuclear sperm parameters (DNA fragmentation and
           oxidation, chromatin condensation and organisation, nucleus morphology and STL.

      Our final goal is to provide a significant improvement of men fertility diagnosis and
      optimize our fertility preservation practices.

      To this end, we will expose ejaculated human spermatozoa (n = 90) at different (low and
      moderate) doses of gamma or X photons to mimic gonads irradiation. Absorbed doses by the
      samples were calculated using the GATE Monte Carlo platform (version 8.2). Experiment
      geometry settings were modelled as three dimension voxelized volumes inside the software by
      assigning a shape, size, distance and density for all the volumes created. All measurements
      will be made on surplus samples from men undergoing routine semen analysis at the Center for
      Reproductive Medicine, after receiving their written informed consent. Semen samples are
      collected and subdivided into 3 arms to analyse sperm quality after:

        -  irradiation exposure (3 conditions);

        -  a freezing- thawing cycle;

        -  fresh state: negative control without treatment.

      Before (fresh state) and after each treatment we will analyse:

        -  standard semen parameters (vitality, motility and morphology) in accordance with WHO,
           2010;

        -  STL using Flow FISH, q-PCR and q-FISH;

        -  chromatin condensation (chromomycin A3);

        -  DNA oxidization (8-OHdG residues);

        -  DNA fragmentation (TUNEL);

        -  3D nucleus structure using 3D bio-imaging.
