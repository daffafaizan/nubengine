    
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of intraperitoneally
      administered lentiviral transduced MOv19-BBz CAR T cells in 4 cohorts with or without
      cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in a 3+3 dose escalation design.

      The DLT observation period is 28 days post CAR T cell infusion. The Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0 or 1 DLT occurs in 6 evaluable subjects tested within
      the dose range of this study.

      Cohort 1: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x107 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 without lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

      Cohort 2: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x107 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 beginning 3 days (+/- 1 day) after lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine.

      Cohort 3: (n=3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x108 lentivirally transduced MOv19-BBz
      CAR T cells on day 0 beginning 3 days (+/- 1 day) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide + fludarabine.

      Cohort -1: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single Infusion of 1-3x106 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Up to 6 subjects will be
      infused in Cohort -1 with â‰¤ 1 DLT/6 subjects to establish the MTD.
