    
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DRibble
      vaccine, cyclophosphamide, imiquimod, and Ceravix in castrate resistant prostate cancer.

      This study will also assess:

        -  the immune profile of tumor biopsy specimens if sites amenable to biopsy are present

        -  humoral and cellular responses to cancer antigens after DRibble vaccination

        -  the response to a reporter antigen vaccine (Ceravix) after DRibble vaccination

      An exploratory objective is to characterize the microbiome before and after study drugs
      administration and correlate prostate cancer responses.
