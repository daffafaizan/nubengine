    
      This study will be a Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, parallel group, sham surgery/placebo
      control, multi-center trial. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either the
      treatment or control group respectively. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will
      receive transplantation with 200,000 MA09-hRPE (human embryonic stem cell derived retinal
      pigmented epithelial)cells in one eye. Subjects randomized to the control group will have a
      sham surgery without transplantation of MA09-hRPE cells. The study eye must meet all
      eligibility criteria. If both eyes meet all eligibility criteria, then the study eye will be
      the eye with the worst Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score at screening. If both eyes
      have identical BCVA scores, then the study eye will be chosen by the Investigator and the
      subject. There will be 3 cohorts, each with a different regimen of low-dose IMT [tacrolimus
      and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)]. Subjects will be randomized to treatment or control within
      cohorts, defined by severity of BCVA in the study eye at Screening. Enrollment in Cohort 1
      and 2 will be concurrent. Enrollment into Cohort 3 will begin once Cohort 2 is fully
      enrolled.
