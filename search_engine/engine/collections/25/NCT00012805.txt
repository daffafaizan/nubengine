      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common chronic illnesses
      among veterans in the adult population, and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality
      in this population. Interventions that enhance symptom self-monitoring and increase
      understanding of COPD therapy may lead to earlier detection of clinical deterioration
      permitting more timely intervention by health care providers. However, such interventions are
      labor-intensive and expensive, and typically require patients to go to a medical facility on
      a regular basis. A novel means of providing such interventions is a Telephone-Linked Computer
      (TLC) system, a computer-based telecommunications system that can monitor, educate, and
      counsel patients through regular automated conversations in patientsï¿½ homes. In previous
      studies, we have demonstrated the applicability of TLC technology in the clinical monitoring
      of adults with chronic disease conditions such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of the study were to determine whether a telecommunications system for COPD
      care (TLC-COPD) leads to improvements in functional status and quality of life (QOL) as well
      as to reductions in health care utilization and costs exceeding the TLC intervention.

      Methods:

      The study was designed in the form of a randomized controlled trial involving subjects with
      COPD who receive care at two Boston-area VA hospitals. Subjects were assigned to either
      TLC-COPD or a usual care control group.

      Status:

      Complete.
