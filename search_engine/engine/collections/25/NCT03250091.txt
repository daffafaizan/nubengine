      Latvia is a high incidence country of gastric cancer. Unfortunately most of the gastric
      cancer cases in Latvia are diagnosed at late stages when the treatment is substantially less
      effective.

      Ideally, gastric cancer could be prevented by detecting gastric precancerous
      conditions/lesions and identifying those individuals at high-risk of progressing to cancer to
      the follow-up.

      Population based endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is not recommended for the early
      detection of gastric cancer generally deemed not to be cost-effective.

      However, in the absence of screening, patients present with advanced disease, and prognosis
      is poor.

      Targeted endoscopic surveillance strategies for gastric cancer should be introduced following
      the principles of the recent European guidelines: Management of precancerous conditions and
      lesions in the stomach (MAPS) (Dinis-Ribeiro, Areia et al. 2012).

      The project will aim to identify and determine subgroups of patients with different risks of
      progression to gastric cancer and to assess appropriate follow-up intervals. Implementing
      risk stratification only high risk individuals will be offered endoscopic surveillance.
