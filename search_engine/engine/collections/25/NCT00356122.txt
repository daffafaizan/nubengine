      combination therapy; non-progressing participants will continue on bevacizumab monotherapy
      until progression. After discontinuation or after completion of all study treatments, all
      participants will be contacted every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years from first treatment
      to document overall survival and record new anticancer treatment (chemotherapy or biologic).
