      tumors. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug and study
      the predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility and dose relationship of the
      toxic effects in this patient population. III. Propose a safe dose for phase II study. IV.
      Study the pharmacokinetics of this drug at different dose levels in this patient population.
      V. Document any possible antitumor activity of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive MEN-10755 IV over 15 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks, or upon recovery of toxicity, whichever
      comes later. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      MEN-10755 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are
      followed for at least 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
