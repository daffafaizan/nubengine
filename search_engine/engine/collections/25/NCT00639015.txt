      pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation will be enrolled in the
      study. Patients will be randomly allocated to be treated with either a) titrated
      phenylephrine, b) titrated norepinephrine (control; each n = 16), to achieve a mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart catheterization,
      thermo-dye dilution catheter, gastric tonometry as well as data from organ function, will be
      obtained at baseline and after 12 hours.
