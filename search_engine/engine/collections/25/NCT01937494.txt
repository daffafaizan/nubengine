      stimuli.Bronchial challenge test is used to confirm/exclude asthma.BHR is also present in
      other diseases such as allergic rhinitis, Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease,heart
      failure..

      Thes test is performed with metacholine or histamine with spirometric documented response to
      incremental doses.Protection are used to avoid passive exposure of the technicians performing
      the test, despite the absence of evidence that they could develop a bronchoconstriction if
      they suffer from BHR.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if patients, newly diagnosed with a high level of
      bronchial hyperreactivity and exposed passively to histamine during a bronchial challenge,
      are reacting to histamine when placed in the same conditions that the technicians performing
      these tests.
