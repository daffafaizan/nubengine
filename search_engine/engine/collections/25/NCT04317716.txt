      be developed and evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods, and evaluation of both
      process (including feasibility) and outcome will occur. The program will be developed in a
      co-design process with people with multiple sclerosis and health professionals and evaluated
      via a randomised controlled trial. The Swedish MS-registry will be used to identify potential
      participants. MS specific representatives from the patient organisation Neuro Sweden will be
      involved in program design and implementation. The intervention group will receive the fall
      prevention program and the control group will receive group-based brief advice about fall
      risk factors.
