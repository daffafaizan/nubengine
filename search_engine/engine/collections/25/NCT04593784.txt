    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ciraparantag for reversal of anticoagulation induced by different anticoagulant
      drugs (apixaban or rivaroxaban) in generally healthy adults. Throughout the study,
      coagulation status will be determined by whole blood clotting time (WBCT), which will be
      measured primarily by the Perosphere Technologies' PoC Coagulometer and at selected
      timepoints using a manual testing method.

      The study will be conducted in separate cohorts; each cohort will evaluate the reversal of a
      different anticoagulant drug. Within each cohort, an initial group of subjects (Group 1) will
      be enrolled for evaluation of a target dose of ciraparantag. Depending on the efficacy and
      safety results from Group 1, a second group (Group 2) may be enrolled to evaluate a different
      dose of ciraparantag for that cohort.
