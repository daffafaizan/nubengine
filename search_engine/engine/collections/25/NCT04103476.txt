      therapy on the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy postmenopausal women. A
      total of 360 postmenopausal women with a uterus who are within 6 years of menopause and 45-59
      years of age and without clinical cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus will be
      randomized to Bazedoxifene/Conjugated Equine Estrogen (BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg) or placebo.
      Recruitment will occur over 3 years and the treatment period will be up to 3 years depending
      on when an individual is randomized. Rate of change in carotid artery intima-media thickness
      (CIMT) determined from the distal common carotid artery (CCA) far wall intima-media thickness
      (IMT) in computer image processed B mode ultrasonograms will be the primary trial endpoint.
      Arterial stiffness measured from the CCA (same location as CIMT) in computer image processed
      B mode ultrasonograms will be the secondary trial endpoint. Three composite cognitive
      measures will be used to test for randomized treatment group differences in cognition; each
      composite will be considered as co-endpoints.
