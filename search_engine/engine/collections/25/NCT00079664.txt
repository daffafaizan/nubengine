      significant medical, psychological, and social disruptions. Although many sleep-related
      studies exist, few studies have focused on improving quality of sleep. Tai Chi, an exercise
      that incorporates meditation and breathing with whole body movements, may improve the quality
      of sleep and health status of elderly individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi group or a conventional exercise
      control group. Participants in each group will exercise for 60 minutes, 3 times per week, for
      6 months. Assessment of sleep quality and health status will be done at study start, 3
      months, 6 months, at the end of the study, and at a 3-month follow-up visit.
