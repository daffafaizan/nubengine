      vascular function of the leg in old individuals. The objective of this randomized, controlled
      study is to evaluate the benefits of participating for 8 weeks in a home-based daily
      treatment with heat therapy (HT) or a thermoneutral control intervention, as assessed by
      vascular function, walking tolerance and quality of life. The central hypothesis of this
      study, based on preliminary data, is that exposure to HT will enhance the oxygenation of calf
      muscles during exercise and as a result, the onset of pain will be delayed and walking
      performance will be enhanced. The duration (8 weeks) was chosen based on the recent report of
      Brunt and co-workers that the improvement in endothelial function promoted by repeat HT in
      sedentary individuals peaks at 8 weeks following the onset of treatment. Heat Therapy will be
      applied daily for 90 minutes using water-circulating 'pants' connected to a water pump.
      Outcomes will be assessed at the halfway point (end of week 4), at the completion of the
      intervention (end of week 8) and 4 weeks after the end of the intervention (week 12).
