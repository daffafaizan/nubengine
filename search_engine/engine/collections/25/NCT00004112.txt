      vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) increases the failure-free survival of patients with newly
      diagnosed, previously untreated, aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine
      whether the addition of rituximab changes the toxicity profile attributed to CHOP
      chemotherapy in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center,
      histology (diffuse small cleaved cell, diffuse mixed, and diffuse large cell vs immunoblastic
      large cell, mantle cell, and marginal zone), and risk group (low vs intermediate vs high).
      Patients enter one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1,
      followed by cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, vincristine IV, and oral prednisone for 5
      consecutive days beginning on day 3. Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV,
      doxorubicin IV, vincristine IV, and oral prednisone daily for 5 consecutive days beginning on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 270 patients (135 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
