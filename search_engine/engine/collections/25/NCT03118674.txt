      In this study all patients with PCT will be given a standard dose of Harvoni and monitored
      for two years. Currently there are two standard therapies for PCT, phlebotomies (removing
      certain amounts of blood at specific intervals), or low dose hydroxychloroquine (an oral
      pill). These treatments are used for patients with PCT whether or not they also have HCV. For
      patients with HCV however, we do not know whether treating the HCV first will also resolve
      the PCT symptoms. There will be an initial visit to determine whether participants are
      eligible to be in the study. If a participant is found to be eligible, he/she will be asked
      come to the study site once every month over the course of one year, and then once every 3
      months for an additional year. There will be approximately 17 visits over the course of the
      whole study. At these visits the study doctors will check in with the participant and some
      blood and urine samples will be taken. Participants will not be charged for any of the lab
      tests that are being done as a part of this study alone. All participants in this study will
      receive the Harvoni pills at no cost to them.
