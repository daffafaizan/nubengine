      cluster of differentiation (CD) CD8 T lymphocytes, localized under the basal membrane and
      associated with apoptosis of basal keratinocytes, suggesting a reactivity of T lymphocytes
      toward keratinocyte antigen(s), so far unidentified. In a recent study, the research team at
      Institut Pasteur has demonstrated in a peculiar clinical form of lichen planus (erosive
      lichen planus), that the immunogenic target of CD8 T lymphocytes could be the immunodominant
      peptide of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 16.

      In line with this recent work which shows for the first time a link between HPV-16 and an
      autoimmune disease, erosive lichen planus, the aim of te study is to to test the hypothesis
      that HPV could be also involved in the pathogenesis of other clinical forms of lichen, such
      as non erosive lichen planus or lichen sclerosus.

      Regarding erosive lichen planus, the aim is to test the cytotoxic function of the previously
      identified CD8 T lymphocytes specific for HPV16 E711-20.
