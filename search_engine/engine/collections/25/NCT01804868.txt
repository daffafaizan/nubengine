      Qualitatives variables will be presented with the number and percentage of participants and
      of missing data for each outcome. Quantitative variables will be presented with the number
      and percentage of participants, mean, standard deviation and range. Assymetrical variables
      will be presented with the median and the interquartile range.

      Quantitative outcomes will be compared between groups with a Fisher test in a linear mixed
      model. (the fixed effect will be the allocation group and the random effect will be the
      nursing institute so as to take into account the similarity of the students for each
      institute).

      Qualitative outcomes will be compared using a mixed effect logistic regression model (the
      fixed effect will be the allocation group and the random effect will be the nursing institute
      so as to take into account the similarity of the students for each institute).

      The data analysis will be carried out as an 'intention-to treat analysis' in all randomized
      participants.

      For the primary outcome, missing data will be dealt with the multiple imputation method.
      Sensibility analysis will be used to confirm the results for the primary outcome.

      Two-tailed tests will be applied at a standard level of 5%. The statistical analysis will be
      performed with SAS 9.3 statistical software.
