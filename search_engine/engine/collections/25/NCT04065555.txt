    
      CIVO is a research tool composed of a hand-held single-use sterile injector coupled with
      fluorescent tracking microspheres called CIVO GLO that mark the sites of drug microdose
      injection, enabling rapid assessment of multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations
      simultaneously within a patient's tumor. In this Phase 0 intratumoral microdosing study in
      human patients with localized or metastatic primary tumors of the head and neck (who will be
      undergoing previously planned tumor and regional nodes dissection), we will evaluate
      TAK-981's ability to activate innate immune effector cells within the local tumor
      microenvironment. Additionally, this study will examine TAK-981 in combination with cetuximab
      or avelumab to study whether TAK-981 enhances the localized immune responses compared to
      those of either immunotherapy alone. TAK-981 singly and in combination with cetuximab or
      avelumab will be delivered intratumorally in subtherapeutic microdose quantities via CIVO.

      The CIVO device penetrates solid tumors and delivers subtherapeutic microdoses of up to eight
      anti-cancer agents or combinations of anti-cancer agents co-injected with CIVO GLO into
      discrete regions of the tumor. At the time of the planned surgical intervention (one or three
      days after the CIVO microdose injection), the injected tumor tissue is then excised and tumor
      responses are assessed via histological staining of tumor cross-sections sampled
      perpendicular to each injection column. Co-injection with CIVO GLO enables identification of
      each injection site during resection as well as in tissues stained for analysis. Because the
      platform delivers microdose amounts of each test agent or combination directly into the
      patient's tumor tissue, hypotheses can be tested earlier in the drug development process,
      consistent with the goals of the 2006 FDA Exploratory IND Guidance for Industry.
