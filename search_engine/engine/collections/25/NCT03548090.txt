      This study has three phases. The first phase is performed in a cross-over fashion.
      Participants will stand on two different incline angles on the paretic LE and simultaneously
      move a small skateboard forward with the non-paretic LE. The testing order for the two
      different incline angles will be randomized, and all participants will be required to
      complete both incline angle conditions within a single test session.

      The second phase will also be performed in a cross-over fashion. Participants will stand with
      three different percentages of body weight on their paretic LE while moving the skateboard
      forward with the non-paretic LE. The testing order for the three body weight percentages will
      be randomized. All participants will be required to complete all three body weight conditions
      within a single test session.

      In the third phase, participants will be randomized to either a control 4-week exercise
      intervention (conventional physical therapy) or a 4-week experimental exercise intervention
      (plantar flexion training). Both the control and exerimental arms will complete over-ground
      multi-directional gait training and home exercise.
