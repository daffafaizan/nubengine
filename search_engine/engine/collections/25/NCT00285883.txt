    
      30 patients with poor antiretroviral therapy compliance will be identified from our pool of
      patients at Saint Michael's Medical Center. Consent will be obtained, their regimens will be
      switched to QD based on previous therapies and resistance patterns if available. Patients
      will be placed on direct observed therapy.Each patient will be placed on Fortovase/Ritonavir
      (1600mg/100mg)QD plus two or three NRTIs based on a phenotypic baseline testing to a protease
      inhibitor. Patients will visit the office at baseline, weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and
      48. Patients will also be visited daily by the social worker (or designee) to observe
      patients taking their antiretroviral therapy for 6 months. After six months of direct
      observed therapy patients will be given a diary card to record administration of medications
      and the social worker ( or designee) will visit the home twice weekly. If the patient
      experiences a change in therapy secondary to virologic failure, the patient will return to
      baseline visit for the new once a day regimen. Virologic failure will be defined as < .5 log
      drop between each visit or > 400 copies/mL at week 24 on two separate occasions at least 14
      days apart
