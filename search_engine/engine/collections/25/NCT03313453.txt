      exposure to the causative antigen. Causative agents that induce allergic diseases or
      exacerbate symptoms are classified into indoor and outdoor allergens. House dust mites and
      pet's hair are typical indoor antigens. Air pollution as well as allergens are important
      deterioration factors, and environmental management is essential for alleviating symptoms of
      allergic diseases. Therefore, we are about to evaluate the impact of the air cleaner to the
      allergic rhinitis patients.

      A total of 45 patients will be enrolled in the study and a real air cleaner and a mock-up air
      cleaner will be randomly installed at ratio of 1: 1 to measure rhinitis symptoms and the
      changes in indoor air quality after 6 weeks of operation.
