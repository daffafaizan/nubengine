      hypertension has been associated with reduction in the risk of stroke and myocardial
      infarction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), ramipril, showed a 32 % in
      relative risk of reduction in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial.
      Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan, also showed a 25 % in relative risk of
      reduction in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE).

      Elderly people, especially hypertensive patients, with silent brain infarction have an
      increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. However, no reports are seen on comparison of
      the effects of ARBs and ACEIs on progression of silent brain infarction and cognitive decline
      in patients with essential hypertension in the elderly.

      The researchers therefore longitudinally evaluate silent brain infarction using magnetic
      resonance imaging and cognitive decline by Mini-Mental State Examination twice at an interval
      of 2 years in patients with essential hypertension in the elderly who are received
      antihypertensive therapy by ARB or ACEI.
