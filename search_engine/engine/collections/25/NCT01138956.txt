      visceral leishmaniasis N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjuvant to standard treatment with
      pentavalent antimony, compared to treatment with antimonial only through a blind randomized
      clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that patients treated with NAC associated with pentavalent
      atimonial have a rapid changing of the immune responses, towards TH1, and clinical
      improvement when compared to patients who will use only the standard treatment
