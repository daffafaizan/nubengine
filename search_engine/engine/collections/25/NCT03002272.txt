      observational study, the investigators will enroll subjects who underwent TAVR or SAVR more
      than 3 years ago. Clinical and procedural data from the implant/surgery will be collected,
      alongside clinical and echocardiographic data from subsequent follow-up visits. Up-to-date
      echocardiography will be performed and analyzed in a Core Lab to assess valve function
      yearly.
