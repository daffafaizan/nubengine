      efficacy of LTRA. Logistic regression model was adopted for statistical analysis. In this
      model, pre-treatment PD20FEV1-LTD4 represented anticipated efficacy. The median of
      PD20FEV1-LTD4 was used for classification of asthmatics, with a lower figure representing a
      better anticipated outcome. Various variables, including the difference in pre- and post-
      treatment FENO, PEFmax, PEFmin, PEFR, PD20FEV1 and asthma scores, were introduced in the
      model representing the actual efficacy of LTRA. We aimed to test whether there would be
      certain parameters that assist prediction of anticipated outcome.
