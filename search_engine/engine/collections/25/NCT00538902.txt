      controlled, safety and efficacy study in adult Chinese RA subjects. The duration of the study
      was approximately 116 weeks. This included a 4-week (28 days) Screening period, a 12-week
      Double-Blind (DB) period, a 90-week Open-Label (OL) Period, and a 10-week (70 days) Follow-up
      period. The 70-day Safety Follow-up period was initiated after the last dose of study
      medication.

      During the DB period, 302 Chinese subjects with RA and concomitantly treated with MTX were
      enrolled at 11 clinical sites located throughout China. Subjects were randomly assigned to
      one of the three treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio: 80 mg adalimumab, 40 mg adalimumab, or
      placebo. From Week 0 to Week 10, subjects received blinded study drug. Subjects who
      successfully participated and completed Week 12 of the DB portion of the study participated
      in the OL period. All subjects in the OL period received adalimumab 40 mg. Throughout the
      study, the study drug was administered subcutaneously (SC) every other week (eow).

      Subjects that completed the Week 24 visit, prior to the approval of Protocol Amendment 1, had
      70 days from the last dose of study drug to re-enter the study. The Investigator confirmed
      that the subject did not develop any of the exclusion criteria and completed the procedures
      defined by the OL Screening visit.

      Results through Week 24 of this study were presented in the regulatory dossier for the
      marketing authorization application of Humira in China, fulfilling the requirement for
      clinical data in Chinese patients. However, in order to continue to provide treatment to
      patients who responded well to adalimumab, subjects had the option to continue in the OL
      extension of this study until Week 92.
