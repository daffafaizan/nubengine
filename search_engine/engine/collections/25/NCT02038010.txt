    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety, tolerability, feasibility, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of
      dose-escalating BYL719 in combination with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after progression on trastuzumab and
      taxane-based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of BYL719 administered in combination with T-DM1.

      II. Assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy of BYL719 and T-DM1 in combination in
      patients with HER2-positive MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore efficacy in patients whose tumors have an alteration (mutation or amplification)
      of the PIK3CA gene and decrease of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) expression.
      (Optional) II. Examine other v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream markers by immunohistochemistry. (Optional)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BYL719.

      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BYL719 orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and ado-trastuzumab
      emtansine (T-DM1) intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
