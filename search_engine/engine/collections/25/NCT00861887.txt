      prolonged course of Vancomycin. It will be disclosed that this is not the standard of care,
      but that a prolonged course might decrease the relapse rate. After the initial treatment with
      Vancomycin 125 mg four times daily, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive either
      2 weeks of Vancomycin 125 mg four times daily or 2 weeks of placebo. The placebo solution
      will be prepared by our pharmacy to match the color and taste of the Vancomycin solution. The
      initial 2 weeks of therapy for both groups will be dispensed at patients' pharmacy. Patients
      will be called back at the end of 2 weeks and the blinded-phase drugs will be dispensed by
      our pharmacy staff.

      We will ask permission for a follow-up phone call at the end of treatment (1 month) and at a
      3-month interval. The patients will be followed longitudinally for a 3-month period. At the
      end of the follow-up interval, a review of any new medical records of the patient will be
      made and the patient will be contacted by phone for further details.
