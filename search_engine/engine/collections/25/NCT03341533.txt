      States, with approximately 600,000 performed annually. The use of postoperative cooling as an
      adjuvant for post-operative pain control has previously been shown to be effective and safe
      in a variety of procedures, but has yet to be described for laparoscopic surgery. In contrast
      to laparotomy where the wound is a significant pain generator and direct application of ice
      is intuitive, in laparoscopic surgery much of the pain-generating tissue trauma is
      intraperitoneal and pelvic in nature, away from the abdominal wall. Ice pack use on the
      abdominal wall likely inhibits visceral afferent pain fibers via somatic afferent nerve
      cross-talk. Accordingly, applying ice to the abdominal wall and its somatic afferents may
      improve laparoscopic pain control, despite the lack of a significant abdominal wound. Our
      goal is to quantify narcotic use after hospital discharge following hysterectomy, and
      evaluate the effectiveness of abdominal ice packs as low cost adjuncts for pain control.
