    
      The inclusion criteria were: (1) age between 18 and 32 years; (2) good general health; (3)
      the presence of two asymptomatic mandibular third molars with Class II position, type B
      impaction (Pell and Gregory, 1933), with similar root formation characteristics and position
      between the two sides; (4) absence of pericoronitis or signs of inflammation during the last
      30 days. Orthopantomography (OPT) was used to determine tooth position. The exclusion
      criteria were (1) any systemic condition which might affect the study; (2) taking
      medications; (3) use of hormonal contraceptives; (4) medication by anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive drugs; (5) status of pregnancy or lactation; (6) previous history of
      excessive drinking; (7) allergy to local anesthetic; (8) smoking.

      The study was performed according to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials)
      guidelines. Patients who did not attend the second surgery or were unable to follow the study
      protocol were excluded, as were those whose surgical time exceeded 40 minutes.

      Patients were scheduled for surgery in two separate clinical sessions (one side at a time),
      with a 1-month interval. Subjects were allocated to one of two groups according to the
      medication received 1 h and 12 h after surgery: group 1, LenidaseÂ® (Enfarma SRL,
      Misterbianco, Italy); group 2, placebo (Sugar pill, Sucratol - Placebo Capsules). All
      patients in the study routinely received a prophylactic preoperative dose of oral antibiotic
      (1 g amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1 hour before surgery) (Augmentin; GlaxoSmithKline, Verona,
      Italy).
