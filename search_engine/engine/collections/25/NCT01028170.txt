      North America, with the chance of a person experiencing it during their lifetime around 20%.
      In patients with CHF, acute decompensation requiring hospitalizations are common. Patients
      with renal insufficiency are more susceptible to worsening of renal function or overt renal
      failure in relation to an episode of decompensated heart failure. Thus, there is a great need
      for treatment to help patients with renal dysfunction that can simultaneously protect them
      from further renal deterioration. Preliminary evidence indicates that hypertonic saline
      solution (HSS) combined with high dose loop diuretics may improve the prognosis for patients
      with CHF. In two separate studies, this treatment was found to alleviate symptoms of CHF, and
      significantly reduce hospital length of stay, as well as reduce morbidity and mortality
      subsequent to hospital stay. So far, available studies have demonstrated that renal function
      is not compromised when using HSS and high dose furosemide as a treatment for CHF.
      Preliminary data from our institution suggests that low volume HSS combined with high dose
      furosemide may be beneficial for patients with renal insufficiency.

      Hypothesis:

      High dose furosemide in combination with low volume HSS provides effective diuretic response
      and has a beneficial effect on preservation of renal function while in hospital as compared
      to pulse furosemide in patients with pre-treatment renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).
