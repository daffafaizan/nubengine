    
      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety of single-agent and combined checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab
           and ipilimumab in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome
           who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk for
           post-transplant recurrence.

        -  Safety endpoint: The composite endpoint consisting of the occurrence of at least one
           treatment-related limiting toxicity (after checkpoint inhibitor treatment is initiated)
           defined as a â‰¥ grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity as specified by the CTCAE. Exceptions
           listed in section 5.9 apply to this endpoint as well. If 3 of 7 patients in a single
           cohort experience a treatment-related limiting toxicity, that single cohort will be
           terminated.
