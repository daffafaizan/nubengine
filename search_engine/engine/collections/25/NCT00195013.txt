           peripheral neuropathy.

        2. Determine whether alterations in the symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy are
           correlated with an alteration of circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like growth
           factor levels.

        3. Assess whether oral glutamine affects circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like
           growth factor levels.

        4. Assess whether glutamine interferes with paclitaxel pharmacokinetics
