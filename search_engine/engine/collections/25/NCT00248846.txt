    
      Among coronary artery disease patients who have just had either angioplasty or stents, the
      objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate whether a novel behavioral intervention
      that employs induced positive affect and self-affirmation is more effective than an
      intervention without positive affect in increasing the maintenance of newly initiated
      physical activity post-procedure.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine whether more patients who receive the positive affect and self-affirmation
           intervention initiate more multiple behavior changes (e.g., changes in more health
           behaviors directed to their risk-factor profile) than those in the control group at one
           year.

        -  To determine whether the positive affect and self-affirmation intervention increases
           physical activity among patients who have depressive symptoms.

        -  To determine whether patients who are successful in increasing physical activity are
           more successful at changing other health behaviors.
