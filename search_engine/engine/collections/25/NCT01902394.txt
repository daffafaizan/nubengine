      a 2 week run-in period. Healthy volunteers will be randomized to two groups (n=40/group), and
      consume either a diet rich in whole grains or a diet rich in refined grains provided at
      estimated energy requirements for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be measured during the run-in period
      and at week 6 of the intervention. To control for variation in microbiota an additional 10
      volunteers will serve as "negative controls" and not undergo any diet intervention.
