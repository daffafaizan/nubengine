      will reduce risk of relapse while preventing usual toxicities related to stem cell
      transplants (e.g., graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)). GVHD is a complication of
      transplantation where the T cells (a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body
      from relapse by killing cancer cells) in the donor graft attack and damage some of the host
      tissues. Patients who receive an allogeneic (using another person as the donor) hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) may develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) toxicity and are
      also at risk of disease relapse.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive the study intervention Treg-enriched donor cells and will then be
      followed for 1 year after transplantation.

      It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.

      Dana-Farber Cancer Institute research funds along with charitable donations are supporting
      this research study. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a pharmaceutical company) is also
      supporting this research study by providing funding and support for correlative laboratory
      tests.
