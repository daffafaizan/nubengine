      glass ionomer cement (GIC) of high viscosity powder-liquid type, the use of encapsulated
      ionomer has been recommended for final restorations. However, the initial cost of the
      encapsulated MIC is higher when compared to the material handled manually. The objective of
      this randomized study is to (1) reveal cost-effective in the long run, the encapsulated CIV
      Riva Self Cure and Equia used as a restorative material in atraumatic restorations
      (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment), (2) assess whether the type of cavity (occlusal and
      occlusal-proximal) influences the longevity of atraumatic restorations using encapsulated IC,
      (3) assess whether the child's caries experience influences the longevity of atraumatic
      restorations with GIC encapsulated. Children, ages 3 and 7, will be selected in the TietÃª-SP
      municipality. Randomization will be performed in a stratified manner by the conditions: type
      of cavity and caries experience. 122 ART restorations are performed using encapsulated CIV -
      Riva Self Cure - SDI and Equia -CG Corp. The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and
      18 months by two trained examiners blind to the groups (intra- and inter-rater agreement
      above 0.7).
