      kidney disease, are the major challenge facing health care systems worldwide. Although
      medications and lifestyle changes can improve the health of these patients, many do not
      benefit from these treatments due to barriers at the level of the patient, provider and/or
      health system, resulting in a care gap. Multiple barriers may contribute to the observed care
      gap for patients with these chronic diseases-but prior research has identified that 1)
      out-of-pocket costs for medications (including co-payments); and 2) lack of patient knowledge
      about the potential benefits of treatment are particularly important. Although these barriers
      clearly compromise outcomes among people with chronic diseases, the best way to overcome them
      and close the care gap is uncertain.

      In the ACCESS trial, the investigators will study the effect of two novel interventions in
      4764 participants with chronic disease. The investigators hypothesize that (1) eliminating
      copayments for high value cardioprotective medications and (2) a comprehensive patient
      education program on optimal medication use, combined with relay of information on optimal
      medication use by the patient to their health care provider, will decrease the risk of
      adverse clinical outcomes during the follow-up period.

      Methods and study design: Parallel, open label, factorial randomized controlled trial with
      blinded endpoint evaluation assessing the impact of two interventions: 1) elimination of
      patient copayment for selected medications, and 2) patient education with relay of
      information to the participant's health care provider.
