    
      Prepubertal boys with significant short stature (height SDS â‰¤-2.0) diagnosed with either GH
      deficiency or idiopathic short stature (ISS) who are identified as candidates for GH
      treatment will recruited. Subjects will have a battery of studies to assess skeletal muscle
      strength, agility, power and endurance, as well as assessment of body composition and energy
      expenditure before and after GH administration. GH (Somatropin) treatment at standard doses
      will be given as daily injections at bedtime. Subjects will be followed at three-month
      intervals per the clinical routine, when anthropometric measurements will be obtained.
      Baseline studies will be repeated at 6 and 12 months from initiation of treatment, each
      patient will serve as his own control pre and post GH.

      A group of normally statured healthy boys will have the same testing as the study patients
      but without GH treatment to assess the impact of natural growth on the muscle measures above.
