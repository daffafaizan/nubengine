      transfusion of 10-15 mL/kg during the first few minutes of life. This additional blood
      improves hemodynamic stability and may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)
      and the vulnerability of infants to inflammatory processes. This blood also contains stem
      cells that are important in repairing tissue and building immunocompetence.

      The current randomized controlled trial prospectively tested the effects of DCC for 30-45
      seconds followed by 1 cord milking with the aim of confirming our prior work and providing
      long-term follow-up. Our a priori hypotheses were that DCC would reduce the incidence of IVH,
      LOS, and result in better motor function at 18-22 months.
