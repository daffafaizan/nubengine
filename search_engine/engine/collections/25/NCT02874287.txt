      hydroxychloroquine could improve the high sensitivity C-reaction protein, blood lipid, blood
      glucose and blood pressure, also whether hydroxychloroquine could affect the secretion of
      inflammatory cytokines and the M1/M2 phenotype polarization of macrophages in patients with
      high-risk coronary artery disease.
