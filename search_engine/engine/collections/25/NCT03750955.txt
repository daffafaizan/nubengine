      induction phase with stent lasting up to 2 weeks; and 3) Resolution phase of 2 weeks.

      The intervention will consist of cessation of oral hygiene versus an active control of oral
      hygiene with a fluoridated toothpaste. This study is a modification of classical experimental
      gingivitis model. The study will prospectively enroll subjects and assign a maxillary sextant
      to the intervention, while the other sextant will serve as control in a split-mouth design of
      localized experimental gingivitis, utilizing localized stent-induced biofilm overgrowth model
      (SIBO). The intervention, i.e. oral hygiene cessation will manipulate the participants' oral
      environment by leading to reversible inflammation of the gingival tissues. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the effects of oral hygiene cessation in the gingival tissues by an
      innovative non-invasive microimaging technique, i.e. Optical coherence tomography (OCT).
