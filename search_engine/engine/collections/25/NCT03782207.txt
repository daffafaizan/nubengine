      atezolizumab treatment, excluding cisplatin ineligible participants receiving atezolizumab as
      first line of therapy (LOT1) for locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer (locally
      advanced/metastatic UC). The study may be amended for inclusion of new cohorts as these are
      approved in the participating countries. Participants will be included into each cohort based
      on their indication for receiving atezolizumab.
