    
      This study is an open-label, fixed-dose, multicenter study of MDX-060 in patients with ALCL
      who have relapsed or refractory disease. There will be 3 phases of this study: Induction,
      Maintenance, and Follow-up. Patients will be required to attend all protocol-required visits
      in the 4-week Induction Phase, in which administration of MDX-060 will occur, as well as
      other testing. Patients who complete the Induction Phase may be eligible for additional
      MDX-060 treatment ever 2 months for 1 year in the Maintenance Phase. Patients who complete
      the Maintenance Phase with a response of stable disease or better will be followed every 2
      months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) at Day
      50 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma
      (csALCL) or primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL) treated with MDX-060. The ORR will be based on an
      adaption of the NCI Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) for patients with
      csALCL and will be based on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) for patient with pcALCL.

      Secondary objectives include 1) characterizing progression-free survival (PFS); 2)
      determining response duration (RD); 3) characterizing the effect of MDX-060 on health-related
      Quality of Life (QoL); 4) evaluating patients with pcALCL using an adaption of the NCI
      Response Criteria for NHL; 5) characterizing the immunogenicity of MDX-060; 6) characterizing
      the safety of MDX-060; and 7) determining the best objective response rate (BORR) during the
      Maintenance Phase of the study.
