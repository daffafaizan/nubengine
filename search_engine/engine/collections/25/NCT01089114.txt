      significantly improved life expectancies. Patients with HIV also have an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. Thus, cardiovascular disease is an important potential co-morbidity
      for patients living with HIV. The current proposal will perform a detailed cardiovascular
      assessment using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to evaluate intramyocardial lipid as
      well as coronary artery disease and myocardial function in a cohort of 100 HIV infected
      patients and 30 healthy volunteers as controls. This is an early exploratory cross-sectional
      study designed to both assess the burden of disease and apply novel techniques in this unique
      population.
