      before using the parenteral route; however, there is no gold standard universally accepted
      for this purpose. Determination of the correct position of freshly inserted peripheral
      intravenous catheters and already established intravenous lines depends largely on subjective
      clinical signs such as visual evidence of swelling around the insertion site, low resistance
      to infusion and free back-flow of blood. Ultrasound-guided cannulation of peripheral veins
      has gained popularity in recent years and is standard of practice in some institutions.
      Primarily used in guiding central line placement, the applications of ultrasound for vascular
      access continue to expand in the perioperative setting, thanks to its easy use,
      non-invasiveness and safety profile. On the other hand, utilization of color Doppler
      technology with flow injection test has been shown to be a valuable tool for early
      recognition of malfunctioning intravenous catheters. The color Doppler flow technique is both
      safe and reliable, and aids in identification of correct intravascular position of venous
      catheters in children.

      This study aims to test the hypothesis that the color Doppler flow technique is superior to
      standard clinical techniques (free flow from a hanging intravenous fluid bag, aspiration of
      venous blood with syringe, and non-obstructed hand injection of 2 mL of normal saline) to
      detect the correct position of peripheral intravenous catheters in adult surgical patients.
