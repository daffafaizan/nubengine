      neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. The identification of KIT+ tumor has become more
      important after introduction of target treatment with KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib
      mesylate (Gleevec). Despite this progress, GIST patients presenting a tumor larger than 5 cm
      have a 10 year survival between 10% and 30%. Indeed, the risk of microscopic spreading of the
      tumor during surgery is very high since intra-abdominal organs are in close relation to each
      others. To improve survival, it seemed logical to use preoperative Gleevec to reduce tumor
      size and improve efficacy of the surgical procedure.
