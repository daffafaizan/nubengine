    
      After the screening procedures confirm that eligibility:

        -  The participant will receive a dose of 300mg of omalizumab under the skin every four
           weeks at three separate visits representing a treatment period of 12 weeks.

        -  During the entire course of the study, the participant will continue receiving their
           chemotherapy per their oncologist's prescribed schedule via desensitization supervised
           by an Allergy specialist from the BWH/DFCI Desensitization Team. The participant cannot
           receive omalizumab on the same day as their desensitization however.

        -  A careful review of the participant's symptoms will be done with each desensitization
           while on the study by filling out a questionnaire detailing what reactions, if any, the
           participant experienced with each desensitization during the study period. Additionally,
           the Allergy specialist will be documenting what complications, if any, were experienced
           in the participant's medical record, and this note will also be collected as part of
           their monitoring during the study period.

        -  The participant may have had skin testing to the agent they are being desensitized to in
           the course of the study. This would have been part of the initial allergy consultation
           prior to the participant's enrollment in the Desensitization Program. If the skin
           testing was positive, the participant will have to undergo repeat skin testing to that
           agent at the conclusion of the treatment period (week 12) to see if omalizumab is
           effective in changing skin test outcomes in participant's chemotherapy allergy.
