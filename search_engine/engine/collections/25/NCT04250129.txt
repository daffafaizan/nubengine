    
      All patients with clinically positive axilla will undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Axillary
      fine needle aspiration biopsy or Trucut biopsy is mandatory.

      All patients with clinically node negativity (physical exam, USG, and/or MRI, PET-CT) after
      Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) will be considered for SLNB with any technique (blue dye
      alone, radionuclide alone or both combined) and any breast surgery (mastectomy or breast
      conservation). PET-CT and MRI are not mandatory. PE and USG and/or MRI are preferred. At
      least, 2 sentinel lymph nodes will be obtained. Intraoperative evaluation of SLNs is
      recommended.

      All patients with clinally-negative axilla and underwent SLNB will be included into the
      study:

        1. SLNB (-) & RT

        2. SLNB (+) & RT

        3. SLNB (+) & ALND & RT Radiotherapy details will be announced as supplementary
