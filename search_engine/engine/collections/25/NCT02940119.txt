    
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Seventy-two
      patients with chronic pain in neck and shoulder were recruited and randomized into two groups
      (n = 36 each group), one group received active PBMT and another group received placebo PBMT
      (with a device with same appearance of the actual laser, including any visible light).
      Patients were treated at 9 different sites of 3 zones in the neck and shoulders area, twice a
      week during 3 consecutive weeks with a PBMT device manufactured by Multi Radiance Medicalâ„¢
      (Solon - OH, USA). Primary outcome was intensity of pain using the Visual Analog Pain Scale
      (VAS), secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM) of the neck and shoulders and patient
      satisfaction with therapy employed.

      Sample Size calculation: The success criterion was defined as a 30% or greater reduction in
      VAS from baseline to the final evaluation and overall efficacy of the PBMT/sMF therapy was
      considered successful if a minimal difference of 35% is found between the active and placebo
      group. It was anticipated that about 55% of subjects in the active group and about 20% of
      subjects in the placebo group would meet the individual success criteria and intended
      application of a two-tailored test with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8.

      A sample size of 33 eligible subjects per group was calculation31 and a subject
      loss-to-follow-up of 10% was anticipated to bring the sample size to 36 subjects in each
      group. To ensure statistically valid and representative data of the general population
      sampled, a total of 72 subjects were enrolled in this study and stratified by Fitzpatrick
      skin type as following: Lighter skinned individuals were into Fitzpatrick skin types I, II
      and III, while darker skinned individuals were into Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V and VI.
