      open hip reduction followed by hip spica casting may be indicated if conservative treatment
      fails. Although closed or open reduction and casting is largely successful for relocating a
      hip, iatrogenic avascular necrosis remains a major source of morbidity as a result of the
      surgical procedure.

      Although recent evidence has demonstrated that postoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
      resonance (MR) studies may be useful in assessing perfusion of the hip after surgery, these
      studies are not performed until after the cast is placed and they do not elucidate the
      specific intraoperative steps that increase risk for osteonecrosis. Contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) may be a reliable and effective alternative.
