    
      Treatment of patients suffering from vascular ulcers or amputation's wound from at least 6
      months after or without possibility for surgical treatment. A cryopreserved amniotic
      membrane, obtained after caesarean from consenting women without any disease, is applied on
      the ulcer after serological checking and changed once a week.

      Main criterias:

      Tolerance will be evaluated on clinical criterias. Efficiency will be evaluated by measuring
      reduction of ulcer's area (reduction of at least 50 % at 6 months).

      Secondary criterias:

      Reduction of pain will be evaluated by analogic visual scale and evaluation of analgesic
      consumption.

      Evaluation of infections, amputations, complete healing, improvement of quality of life by
      SF36 questionnaire and recurrence at one year for patients with complete healing.
