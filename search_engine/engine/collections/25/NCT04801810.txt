      determinants of energy balance, and measure modulators of energy intake and expenditure,
      following 8 wk of calorie restriction (CR, -500 kcal/d) in combination with either overnight
      exposure to normobaric hypoxia (NH) or normoxia (NN). Participants will be instructed to
      follow their normal diet but with a 500 kcal/day deficit as advised by a Registered
      Dietitian. Participants will spend 8 hours/night in a tent, set-up around their bed, in their
      home, for 8 weeks. Participants sleeping in the hypoxic tent (Hypoxico Inc., New York, NY,
      commercially available tents: https://hypoxico.com/) will breath ~15% oxygen (achieved with
      nitrogen dilution, equivalent to ~8500 ft elevation), whereas those in the control tent
      (Hypoxico Inc.) will breath ~21% oxygen (achieved with nitrogen dilution, equivalent to sea
      level elevation). Trained research staff will set-up the hypoxic or control tent system in
      each participant's home on day 0 and will visit the participant's home on days 1, 2, and 3 to
      check and/or adjust the tent settings. After day 3, research staff will visit the
      participant's home weekly to check and/or adjust the tent settings. participants will be
      weighed each morning following an overnight fast and morning void. Participants will come to
      the laboratory on two separate days for baseline testing (days -1 and 0) and again on two
      separate days at the end of the study (days 55 and 56) for endpoint testing.
