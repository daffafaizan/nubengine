      should be performed. This ophthalmologic examination has been conducted as part of the usual
      follow up for such PXE patients or for the needs of a treatment of complications of angioid
      streaks such as CNV complications.

      As we studied the age of poor vision occurrence, we propose to take in account the first
      examination when a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) under 20/50 was observed. All past
      medical events obtains from the data of the patients will be recorded, especially
      ophthalmologic ones.
