      dependent upon the host's ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction;
      however, the DTH response may be impaired or absent in patients with impaired cell-mediated
      immunity, a classic characteristic of HIV infection. Patients in whom immunity is diminished,
      but not absent, may test negative the first time a purified protein derivative skin test for
      MTb is administered, but if the same skin test is repeated, a positive DTH response may then
      be elicited. This occurrence is known as the "booster" phenomenon.

      Patients who have had a negative purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test for M.
      tuberculosis within 7-28 days prior to study entry will receive a second PPD test by the
      Mantoux method (5 TU intradermally to the volar aspect of the forearm). Skin tests will be
      read 48-72 hours after application. Patients with a positive skin test (defined as an
      induration, or small hard knot, of 5 mm or greater forming beneath the skin) will be referred
      to their primary physicians for further evaluation.
