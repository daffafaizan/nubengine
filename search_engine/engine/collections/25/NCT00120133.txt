      that would be conducted in the Metabolic Bone Clinic of The Children's Mercy Hospital. This
      is a pilot study and a more comprehensive study will be designed only if the results from
      this pilot study are significant. In our proposed double blind cross-over placebo controlled
      pilot study we will have a total of 12 children who will receive either placebo or
      Atorvastatin in a randomized cross-over design. The pilot study with a sample of 12 in a
      cross-over trial will provide reasonably stable estimates even though it is unlikely to
      provide statistical significance on its own but will help plan further large scale studies.
