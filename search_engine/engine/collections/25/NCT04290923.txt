      designed to interact with epithelial tumor cells. Aim of this study is to see if circulating
      tumor cells (EpCAM as marker)can be removed out of the blood with the help of these
      particles. Patients suffering from prostate, colon, lung or pancreatic cancer will be asked
      to test their blood.

      Similarly, magnetic nanoparticles will be coated with antibodies, directed against non-solid
      tumors in the blood such as lymphoma or leukemia (CD52 as marker).
