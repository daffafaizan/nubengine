    
      This study is designed to assess the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in
      systemic sclerosis as well as to evaluate the correlation between NETs production and NETs
      composition and the different complications and phenotypes observed in SSC.

      30 SSC patients, 30 SLE patients and 60 healthy subjects will be recruited. Blood samples
      will be collected to obtain plasma, serum and polynuclear neutrophils by negative selection.

        1. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the quantity of NETs induced by serum from SSc
           patients on neutrophils from either healthy or SSC patients in vitro. The quantity of
           NETs produced by different populations of neutrophils in contact with sera from SSC will
           be compared with those produced by the same different populations of neutrophils in
           contact with sera from SLE, and healthy subjects (two control populations).

        2. Other objectives:

             -  To assess the composition of the NETs produced by different populations of
                neutrophils exposed to serum from SSC, SLE and healthy subjects.

             -  To correlate the quantity and the composition of NETS with clinical phenotype in
                SSc

             -  To assess the role of serum cytokines in Nets production in SSC.
