    
      The aim of this study is to assess the influence of kind of allergic disease, allergic
      profile, allergen exposure, treatment method on lung function parameters, fractional exhaled
      nitric oxide (FeNO) level in children suspected and being diagnosed due to allergic diseases.

      Study will be retrospective, conducted in all children diagnosed in the years of 2005-20012
      in Laboratory of lung function tests of Department of Pediatrics and Allergy, Medical
      University of Lodz, N. Copernicus Hospital, Lodz, Poland. The investigators will analyse 5500
      male an female children 5-18 year old suspected and being diagnosed due to allergic diseases.
      In these children nearly 3000 FeNO measurements, 65000 spirometry measurements, 22000
      whole-body plethysmography measurements and 48000 occlusion resistance measurements were
      performed between the years of 2005-2012.

      The investigators will retrospectively evaluate following data from medical documentation of
      patients:

        1. FeNO levels.

        2. Allergic disease diagnosis.

        3. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific levels.

        4. Treatment (drugs and dosages).

        5. Lung function parameters (spirometry, whole-body plethysmography, occlusion resistance,
           bronchial reversibility test).
