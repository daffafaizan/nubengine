      material) for the study of the genetic basis of diabetes. The study population will include
      individuals with known diabetes and controls without diabetes. Additionally, this protocol
      will recruit individuals from the following locations: the Qatar Diabetes Association, the
      governmental ministries of Qatar, and subjects who have participated in Dr. Bener's HMC
      protocol #231 entitled "A preliminary study of genetic pre-disposition to diabetic mellitus
      in the state of Qatar." Individuals with diabetes may also be recruited from the Hamad
      Hospital outpatient adult diabetes clinics (there are eight diabetes clinics each week)
      and/or from the population of subjects who previously participated in Dr. Mushlin's IRB
      approved protocol #0608008703 entitled "Comparing the Clinical Management and Genetic Markers
      of Diabetes in Qatar to International Standards" at Hamad Medical Corporation or IRB approved
      protocol #0602008388 entitled "The Impact of Cardiac and Genetic Risk Factors on Acute
      Myocardial Infarction and Cerebrovascular Stroke in Qatar: A Case-Control Study". In this
      protocol, researchers will survey medical records of patients with diabetes, in order to
      study the clinical characteristics of these individuals, and the researchers will collect
      blood to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with diabetes. The researchers
      will also collect blood samples of individuals without diabetes to serve as control.
