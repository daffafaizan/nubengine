      strongly suspected risks from treating infertility with assisted reproductive technologies
      such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). During IVF, when more embryos are transferred to the
      uterus, the risk of pregnancy with multiple fetuses increases. In addition, single infants
      conceived with IVF are at greater risk for low birth weight. This study will promote
      behaviors that may reduce these risks. One in 3 women who completes a pregnancy conceived
      with assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF delivers multiples, and these treatments
      produce over 12,000 multiple birth deliveries annually in the United States. This study will
      lead to a better understanding of the most effective ways to counsel IVF patients about the
      embryo transfer decision. This study will also help define how to prepare IVF patients to
      work most effectively with their prenatal care team to manage IVF-related obstetrical risks.
