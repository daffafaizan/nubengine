      With the advent of quasi-likelihood, generalized estimating equations, and new ways to handle
      missing data, has come a striking increase in applicable models, perhaps more than after the
      1972 introduction of the Cox model for survival data. TI provided a way to analyze the data.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      TIl provided graphics for data exploration and model validation. TI ran under most current
      version of Windows, used Civilized Software's MLAB as its programming language, offered
      context-sensitive help, a dictionary of relevant terms, identification of file entries from
      their screen position, and simple animation. TI permitted the user to analyze time-varying
      data from the two perspectives of repeated measured using a variety of models and time series
      where both time and frequency domain tools were provided.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
