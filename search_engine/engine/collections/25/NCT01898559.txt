      smoking behaviors and toxin exposure in fast and slow nicotine metabolizing smokers. We will
      recruit current smokers (split between slow and rapid nicotine metabolizing smokers) for a
      20-day protocol. Participants will smoke their own brand cigarettes during a baseline 5 day
      period, followed by 15 days smoking little cigars. This study will use a validated,
      phenotypic marker of nicotine metabolism rate that may identify those individuals at greatest
      risk of harm exposure when using little cigars. This study will examine the compensatory
      effects of little cigars on smoking behaviors and toxin exposure among slow and rapid
      nicotine metabolizers.
