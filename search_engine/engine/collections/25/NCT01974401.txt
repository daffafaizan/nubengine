      increased risk of bleeding and infection due to severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia we
      want to access whether a none invasive method ( water jet systems containing chlorhexidine )
      Can help this patients to get better oral health indexes in comparison with routine oral
      health measures in these type of patients.
