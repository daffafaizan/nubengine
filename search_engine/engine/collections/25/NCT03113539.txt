      first scan that detects calcifications is using parameters with low-dose current, non
      EKG-gated and without contrast. The second scan uses iodine-contrast, EKG-gating and higher
      current dose to obtain higher image quality of diagnostic value.

      The study will optimize the first scan parameters and compare the measures of the aorta
      diameters from the standard protocol.

      By modifying the first scan parameters, we would demonstrate that the follow-up of an aortic
      aneurysm can safely be made with lower radiation exposure.
