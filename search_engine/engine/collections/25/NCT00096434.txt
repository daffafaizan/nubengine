      I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
      treated with an anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing regimen receiving sorafenib.

      II. Assess the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine time to
      disease progression and survival time of patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate pre-treatment levels of activated ERK1/2 with tumor response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression and then every 3 months for up
      to 5 years.
