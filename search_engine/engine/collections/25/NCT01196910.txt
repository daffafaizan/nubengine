      brain. Increasing the activity of these areas may help improve symptoms in many of these
      patients. In addition there is evidence as to dysfunction in both hemispheres of the brain,
      but it is difficult to determine the contribution of each hemisphere's pattern of activity to
      behavioral impairment. The purpose of this study is to use high-frequency DTMS to stimulate
      activity either on the left side of the prefrontal cortex (one arm), or on the right side (a
      second arm), to see if such stimulation improves attention, comparing to sham DTMS simulation
      (a third arm).
