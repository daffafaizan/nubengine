      injury (SRILR) is the most common complications. In view of the important role of endostatin
      in inhibiting angiogenesis and pro-inflammatory factors, Combined with randomized controlled
      clinical study and small sample clinical exploration, the investigators concluded that
      endostatin is a new clinical technique for the treatment of radiation pneumonia（RP） and
      radiation fibrosis（RF）, which can reduce the recurrence rate of RP. In order to verify the
      efficacy and safety of endostatin in the treatment of SRILI and fibrosis, the investigators
      intend to use a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to classify unresectable
      phase III-IV Non-small cell lung cancer（NSCLC） patients with SRILI above grade 2 into the
      control group (standard SRILI treatment) and observation group (Endostar® plus standard
      treatment) on a 1:1 randomized basis. The results of this study are expected to be a new
      clinical strategy for the treatment of radiation pneumonia and fibrosis.
