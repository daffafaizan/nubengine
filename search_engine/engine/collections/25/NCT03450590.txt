      decrease in lung compliance when the microcatheter is in the ICA or ophthalmic artery.
      However, underlying pathophysiology of the respiratory complication is unknown. In this
      study, the investigators are going to investigate the relation between underlying balance of
      parasympathetic and sympathetic tone and the respiratory complications by analyzing heart
      rate beat-to-beat variability. Also, the investigators are going to investigate whether
      baseline heart rate variability can predict respiratory complications during the procedures.
