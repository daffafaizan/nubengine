      patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and without any co-morbidities that would confound data
      or contraindications for NMES use. All participants will be enrolled at a single site
      (Developmental Motor Lab at the University of Texas), and all of a single participant's
      testing will be complete within a single day with no requirement for follow-up or long-term
      participation. Participants will have their gait and quadriceps muscle activation patterns
      evaluated through four six-minute walk tests (6MWT). The first 6MWT will be without a device,
      second with a device worn but not activated, third with a device activated and stimulating
      quadriceps musculature, and the fourth without a device.

      Primary Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether electrical stimulation
      of the vastus medalis (VM) and/or vastus lateralis (VL) to establish coactivation of these
      muscles during terminal swing phase impacts severity of PFPS symptoms

      Secondary Objectives: Secondary purposes for this study include evaluating KneeStim and
      seeing if there is any evidence of proof of concept in two main areas:

      KneeStim as a therapeutic device that may assist individuals with joint rehabilitation
      KneeStim's on-board operating system and motion tracking system as an effective way to
      monitor joint kinematics.

      This pilot study has a prospective, controlled, single-center design. Participants and
      investigators will not be blinded to the treatment. Individuals who evaluate the
      motion-tracking data between VICON and KneeStim will not be informed which data set aligns
      with which treatment.
