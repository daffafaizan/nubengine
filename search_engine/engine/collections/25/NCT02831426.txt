      Expander (TE) pre-pectoral reconstructions.

      The trial will comprise two arms:

      PRE-PECTORAL technique with a biological Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) prosthesis coverage
      and support + FAT GRAFTING VS PRE-PECTORAL technique with a synthetic Titanium Coated
      Polypropylene Mesh (TCPM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT GRAFTING
