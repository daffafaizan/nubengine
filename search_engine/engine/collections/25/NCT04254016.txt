      after design, carried out from November 2016 and May 2017.

      Intervention consisted of the administration of a Hibiscus-Stevia drink at a dose of 4 mg /
      kg / day for Stevia and 4 g / day for Hibiscus for a period of 8 weeks. Before and after
      intervention, the following were done by the participants: bioelectrical impedance analysis
      (BIA), blood pressure measurements, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver
      function tests, kidney function tests, urinary excretion of albumin tests and full blood
      counts. These were followed by morphological workup including Electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      transthoracic heart ultrasounds and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements (ABPM), also done
      before and after intervention.

      Clinical evaluation with fasting blood sugar control, blood pressure controls and urinary
      excretion albumin tests were done at the 30th and 60th days for safety purposes.
