      result in measurable physiologic (body structure and body function) changes not observed with
      normal saline injections, in children with spastic diplegic CP who walk with a flexed-knee
      gait pattern; (2) to assess whether physiologic changes translate into functional (activity
      and participation) improvements; (3) to evaluate family's perception of change in function,
      activity, participation, and quality of life.

      This study will demonstrate if BTX-A injected into overactive hamstring muscles of children
      with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) and a flexed-knee walking pattern has measurable effects
      across the spectrum of dimensions of disablement of the International Classification of
      Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). It is a multi-center, prospective, randomized,
      double-blind trial comparing results of injection of BTX- A and placebo saline in controls,
      into overactive hamstring muscles, using multiple outcomes measures. Temporal-spatial gait
      parameters, instrumented 3DGA kinematics, passive ROM, spasticity measurement with both
      Ashworth and Tardieu scales, muscle strength/control, Gross Motor Function Measurement
      (GMFM), Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), Gillette Functional Assessment
      Questionnaire (FAQ), 6-Minute Walk Test, and Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), assessing all ICF
      domains, will be collected at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-injection.
      Power analysis demonstrates the need to randomize 250 children (125 with BTX-A, 125 with
      saline), allowing for attrition. Nine participating hospitals will contribute patients.
