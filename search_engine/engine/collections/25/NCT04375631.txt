      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days -9 to -4, cladribine
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours daily on days -8 to -4, cytarabine IV over 2-4 hours daily on
      days -8 to -4, and mitoxantrone IV daily on days -8 to -6. If white blood cell (WBC) >
      20,000/uL, filgrastim on days -9 and -8 may be omitted at physician discretion. Patients
      undergo TBI and HCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours daily on days 3-4,
      cyclosporine IV over 1-2 hours twice daily (BID) on days 5-60, and mycophenolate mofetil IV
      or orally (PO) BID on days 5-28 (transplant with related donors) or three times daily (TID)
      on days 5-35 (transplant with unrelated donors). After day 60, patients continue to receive
      cyclosporine tapered through day 180 at the discretion of the treating physician in the
      absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days, at 6, 12, and 24
      months post-transplant, then annually thereafter.
