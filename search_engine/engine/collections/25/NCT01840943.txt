    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), comparative bridging study (a supplemental study
      which performs to provide data of effectiveness, safety, and dosage to compare two study
      medications in a new region). The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (30 days before
      administration of study medication), treatment phase, and follow up phase (every 8 weeks for
      tumor assessment until disease progression or death, or until the study completion, whichever
      is earlier and every 3 months after disease progression for overall survival and for
      anti-tumor therapy for a minimum of 1 year). In the treatment phase, approximately 120
      eligible participants will be categorized prospectively for platinum-sensitivity (sensitive
      versus refractory) and bulky disease (presence versus absence). Later on participants will be
      randomly assigned either to experimental arm (CAELYX: administer on Day 1 of each cycle) or
      control arm (topotecan HCl: administer on Day 1 to Day 5 of each cycle). Treatment will
      continue until disease progression occurs and may continue for at least 2 cycles after
      confirmed complete response (disappearance of all target lesions). On average, it is expected
      that participants will continue treatment for approximately 3 to 6 cycles in experimental arm
      (CAELYX) or 4 to 8 cycles in Control arm (topotecan HCl). Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram
      (or multiple gated acquisition scans), vital signs, and physical examination which will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 23
      months.
