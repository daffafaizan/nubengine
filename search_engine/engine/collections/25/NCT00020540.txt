      fixed-dose flt3 ligand in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD40-ligand. Patients receive fixed-dose flt3
      ligand subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14 and CD40-ligand SC daily on days 12-16.
      Treatment continues every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of
      CD40-ligand until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients with
      progressive disease after 2 courses may be eligible to receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      standard therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5 patients were accrued for this study.
