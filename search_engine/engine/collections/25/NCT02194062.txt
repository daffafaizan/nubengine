      sinuses that lasts 12 weeks or longer with objective evidence of mucosal inflammation (1).
      CRSwNP is characterized by the presence of bilateral nasal polyps in the middle meatus.
      Patients with CRSwNP for whom medical therapy has failed, often have functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery.

      Nasal steroids are important post-operatively to prevent polyps from recurring. Many studies
      have shown that nasal steroids are superior to placebo in maintaining improvement in symptom
      scores, such as SNOT-22, post-operatively by preventing polyps from returning (2). Nasal
      steroids can reduce inflammation locally and can prevent disease relapse without the systemic
      effects of oral steroids. However, there is no consensus as to which nasal steroid and which
      delivery method is most effective in treating these patients. Traditional nasal sprays, such
      as fluticasone spray, may not deliver the medication widely in the nasal cavity. Budesonide
      is available in a respule form that can be used to instill the medication in the nose. In an
      attempt to more effectively deliver the medication, changes in patient's head position has
      been prescribed to achieve better delivery (3). The safety of intranasal budesonide, a more
      potent steroid than fluticasone, has been established (4, 5). However, any improved efficacy
      over fluticasone nasal spray remains anecdotal as head to head comparisons have not
      previously been performed.

      Practice patterns among rhinologists in the post-operative prescription of nasal steroids
      vary widely. Determining which medication/delivery method is more effective will help
      rhinologists better treat their patients and prevent symptoms, for which the surgery was
      performed, from returning.
