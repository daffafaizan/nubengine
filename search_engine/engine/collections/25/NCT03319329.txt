      energy and protein requirements. This can be done in a quick and inexpensive manner via the
      use of predictive equations. Some of the most popularly used predictive equations such as the
      Harris-Benedict equation and the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation have been widely applied within
      the clinical setting to estimate energy requirements among mechanically ventilated critically
      ill patients. However, these existing equations were not specially developed for a population
      with disease, as the equations were derived from a pool of healthy Caucasian adults. In
      addition, most of the equations for critically ill patients such as the Penn State equation,
      Faisy equation and Raurich Equation developed and validated among Caucasian in western
      country and not among Asian population. Therefore, their accuracy in predicting energy
      requirement is questionable when applied within Malaysian mechanically ventilated critically
      ill patients with its racial mix.
