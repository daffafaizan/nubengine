      characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads
      to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a
      process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis
      of this pilot trial is that administration of LY3023414 and prexasertib will inhibit NHEJ in
      metastatic TNBC.
