      outcome (extent of recovery) of patients who have moderate to severe brain injury. This study
      may show that MRI can provide a clearer picture on the extent of the brain injury and help
      medical physicians decide how to best treat these patients with a more accurate idea of the
      brain function of the recovering patient.
