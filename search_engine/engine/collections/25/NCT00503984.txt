    
      Study design A phase I/II clinical trial in patients with hormone refractory metastatic
      prostate cancer.

      Primary objective phase I component of study:

      To determine a safe and potentially efficacious phase II dose of azacitidine in combination
      with docetaxel and prednisone that can be used for the treatment of hormone refractory
      metastatic prostate cancer.

      Primary objective phase II component of study:

      To determine the therapeutic efficacy of combined therapy of azacitidine, docetaxel, and
      prednisone, in the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. The primary
      measure of therapeutic efficacy is response, defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      response, complete response (CR), or partial response (PR).

      Secondary endpoints are toxicity, duration of response, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival.
