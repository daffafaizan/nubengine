      microvascular response to ionizing radiation (IR) therapy are applicable to human tumors in
      order to begin to establish that the engagement of the endothelial response is a valid target
      for IR in human tumors. A portion of tumor will be isolated from individuals who have signed
      informed consent for this protocol and are undergoing surgery on the Neurosurgery,
      Colorectal, and Gynecology, Head and Neck, Urology, and Hepatobiliary Services at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Tumor tissue will be obtained from the surgical sample in
      pathology after adequate specimens have been obtained for diagnostic purposes. Tumor tissue
      will be irradiated ex vivo and the microvascular endothelial response will be determined.
      From specimens of adequate size, a pure tumor endothelial cell population will be isolated
      and the response to IR will be determined.

      Primary Outcomes:

        -  To determine if human tumor microvascular endothelium displays similar dose parameters
           as mouse tumor endothelium.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  To determine if tumor endothelium isolated to near homogeneity demonstrates dose
           parameters similar to those used in single dose radiotherapy of brain tumors.

        -  To determine if the microvascular endothelium of tumors of different types behaves in a
           similar fashion in its response to IR.
