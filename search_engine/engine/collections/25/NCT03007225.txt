      Clinic, Ain Shams University Hospitals (Cairo, Egypt), The patients were divided according to
      the line of treatment into 2 groups:

        1. Group (I): Twenty-five patients underwent Chemoembolization with Drug eluting beads.

        2. Group (II): Twenty-five patients underwent conventional Chemoembolization (cTACE)

      The total number of procedures was 77 sessions (37 sessions of TACE with beads and 40
      sessions of conventional TACE).Post-procedure follow up:

      Schedule of follow up:

      All included patients were checked at:

        1. One week after the procedure to detect early post chemoembolization complications and
           Patients were subjected to Liver function tests, Kidney function tests, complete blood
           count and Abdominal Ultrasound.

        2. One and four months after the maneuver.

      Patients were subjected to the following in each visit:

        1. Complete History taking

        2. Thorough clinical examination

        3. Laboratory Investigations including:

             1. Liver function tests

             2. Kidney function tests

             3. CBC

             4. Serum alpha-fetoprotein.

        4. Triphasic pelvi-abdominal CT Follow up imaging was performed at the first and fourth
           months after embolization and every 3 months thereafter. Repeated embolization was
           scheduled "on demand" basis, if there was residual viable tumor deemed unsuitable for
           radiofrequency ablation or surgery.
