    
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel group PK and safety
      study of a single oral dose of cenobamate in male and female subjects with normal hepatic
      function (Group 1, n = 8) and those with severe hepatic impairment (Group 2, n = 8).

      The study consists of a 28-day screening period, followed by single dose administration of
      cenobamate (200mg) on Day 1, an assessment period of 35 days and follow-up visit. All
      subjects will be confined to the clinical site from Day -1 (the day before dosing) until Day
      5. Outpatient visits will be performed regularly until Day 35. The follow-up visit will occur
      on Day 40 (Â±1 day).
