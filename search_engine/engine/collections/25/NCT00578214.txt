      patients with skin cancer undergoing outpatient Mohs micrographic surgery. Patients were
      randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of a single-dose midazolam syrup for
      efficacy in producing safe anxiolysis of short duration. A parallel prospective arm of the
      study involved administration of midazolam in an unblinded fashion. Based on available
      studies of orally administered midazolam, the expectation was that the only observed adverse
      events will be minor and the major adverse event rate for midazolam would be similar to
      placebo. Data was collected on vital signs, anxiety, adverse events, and overall satisfaction
      with the anxiolytic agent.
