      observed in this retrospective study. The study will look to identify the local barriers in
      prescribing anti-TNF therapy, treatment patterns and indicators of sub-optimal response to
      anti-TNF therapy in UC and CD participants in real-world clinical practice in the EM
      countries, along with the associated incidence of sub-optimal response and impact on health
      care resource utilization (HCRU). The will enroll approximately 2000 participants.

      The study consists of two periods, eligibility period followed by a data abstraction period.
      During the eligibility period participants who had initiated first anti-TNF therapy during 01
      March 2010 up to 01 March 2015 will be recruited and observed. Participants will be followed
      up for a period of minimum 2 years (other than death) and a maximum of 5 years from the date
      of first treatment of anti-TNF therapy for CD and UC (Index date). During the data
      abstraction period participants who have eligible medical charts will be identified and all
      retrospective data will be collected.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, China, Colombia, Mexico, Russia,
      Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The overall time to abstract data
      during the data extraction period from the web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system
      will be approximately 1 year from March 2017 to February 2018.
