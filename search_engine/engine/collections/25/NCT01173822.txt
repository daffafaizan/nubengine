      residual cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) volume via ultrafiltration may improve hemostasis and
      reduce transfusion through clearing activated complement, activated coagulation components,
      and proinflammatory cytokines. Unlike cell saver technology, ultrafiltration has the
      advantage of maintaining plasma proteins, platelets, and coagulation factors. We sought to
      establish if the processing of residual CPB volume with ultrafiltration reduces homologous
      blood transfusion and bleeding.
