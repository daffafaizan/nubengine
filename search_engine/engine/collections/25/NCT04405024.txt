      the results of a 2014 study. Screening efforts have been set up in groups of people said to
      be at high viral risk: drug users, prisoners, precarious persons or migrants from highly
      endemic countries. Nevertheless, the concept of universal screening has not yet been adopted
      by the guardians and the Ministry.

      It is in this context that "hepatitis free hospital" projects have been carried out in
      several French cities such as Nice, Nancy and Marseille.

      The aim of the HOSPI-VHC study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of systematic
      HCV screening in all medical and surgical departments of 4 National Association of
      Hepato-Gastroenterologists of General Hospitals (ANGH) hospitals. This pilot project is part
      of a public health screening program. It will evaluate the interest and usefulness of
      implementing universal screening in hospitalized patients without taking into account the
      existence of viral risk factors. This study will also make it possible to evaluate the
      implementation of a dedicated care pathway: number of patients screened, number of patients
      referred for consultation and number of patients accepting the consultation.
