      inflammation and glycemic variations is not well defined, although different carbohydrates
      are known to vary in their abilities to induce plasma glucose and insulin responses.
      Epidemiologic work suggests that high dietary glycemic load (GL) is associated with increased
      concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction markers, and increased risk
      of T2D and coronary heart disease (CHD). We are examining using randomized control trials low
      vs. high-GL diet to determine if low-GL diets induce improvements in endothelial function or
      monocyte inflammation. Furthermore, resistance training is an alternate form of exercise from
      conventional aerobic training. Resistance Training has the potential to improve endothelial
      function or monocyte phenotype, but there is very little data in this area. We hypothesize
      that resistance training may augment the beneficial effects of a low-GL diet in improving
      metabolic health.
