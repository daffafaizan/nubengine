      perceived social support from members of their social network and determine its influence on
      self-care and clinical outcomes. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with older
      rural-dwelling adults to map their social network structure, determine the types of social
      support provided by members of their SN, and identify key players within the older adults'
      personal network. For this aim, key players are those who can facilitate and promote T2DM
      self-care on an individual level. These older adults will form a dyad with their alter to
      participate in a multilevel intervention which includes: gauging the feasibility of using
      community health workers identified via social network analysis to conduct self-care sessions
      in rural communities, and the feasibility of seed-alter dyads to provide social support that
      improves self-care in older adults.

      In addition, the seed-alter dyad will participate in 6 weekly sessions of a diabetes
      education program, led by the community health workers identified previously. Participants
      will be asked to complete surveys at baseline, 6, and 12 months to assess social support,
      participants' knowledge about diabetes, and how participants are managing their diabetes.

      The preliminary data used for this K01 application was collected from the BRFSS where data is
      self-reported and its accuracy cannot be confirmed, and a dataset where social support was
      not the primary objective of the study and there was a small sample size all older adults.
      Yet, there remains a body of literature that substantiates the influence of social support on
      T2DM self-care and the disproportionate burden of T2DM in older adults. The proposed research
      will provide a comprehensive overview of the role of social support and how to leverage this
      support in a rural community.
