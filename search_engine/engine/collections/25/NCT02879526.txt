      Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma.Cyclophosphamide,Prednisone,Thalidomide(CPT) is
      an oral combination regimen for lymphoma patients who can not stand the standard

      to investigate the efficacy of Chidamide Combined With CPT in treatment of fragile Patients
      With Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
