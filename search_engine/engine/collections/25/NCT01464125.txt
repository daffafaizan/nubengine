      parasite to synthesise isoprenoids, as precursors of many essential compounds including
      sterols, carotenoids and ubiquinones. This is effected through blockade of the non-mevalonate
      pathway by fosmidomycin as a potent inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
      reductoisomerase coupled with targeting of protein biosynthesis by azithromycin through
      binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This mode of action contrasts with the ability of the
      human host to utilise the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis and accounts for the
      safety profiles of both drugs through the mechanism of selective toxicity. Moreover it
      affords protection against cross resistance with existing chemotherapeutic agents.

      The dose of fosmidomycin, equivalent to 30mg/kg twice daily for three days, selected for
      evaluation in this proof of concept study is derived from the highest dose that was
      administered in the Phase I safety tolerance studies. While the recommended dose of
      azithromycin for the treatment of bacterial infections is 250mg daily for three days, higher
      doses of up to 1500mg daily for three days have been evaluated for the treatment of malaria,
      in combination with artesunate or quinine.
