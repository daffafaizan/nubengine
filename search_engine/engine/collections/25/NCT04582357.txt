      physical activity program feasibility assessment for patients with diabetic foot wounds. The
      muscular mass stabilization and the physical activity is almost never used to heal diabetic
      feet wounds. With this study, we evaluate the compliance of patients to follow a physical
      activity program, which could lead to a further study, with more patients and multicentric,
      and it could measure the impact of this program on metabolical balance, wound size and
      quality of life.

      The study will last 6 months, the inclusion will last 3 months, and each patient will have a
      3 months follow-up time. The patient have several medical appointments in the diabetic foot
      unit, where the compliance will be evaluated, wound size and security will also be evaluated.

      The activity program is a suite of exercises, 4 times in a week, it lasts 30 minutes?

      The first day, follow-up book is given to the patient. During the follow-up, the patient will
      still have his usual medical appointments, which will occur at the 30th, 60th and 90th days.
