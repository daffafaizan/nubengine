      hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) - and HIV in the setting of mono-infection. However the
      role of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of HIV-hepatitis co-infection in both natural and
      therapy-associated viral clearance remains unclear. The data from this study may reveal
      patterns which could predict how and when patients spontaneously, and with therapy, resolve
      HBV or HCV in the setting of co-infection.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the activity of innate immunity in different subsets of
      HIV-infected populations co-infected with chronic hepatitis B and/or C. Our hypothesis is
      that innate immunity is altered in HIV and hepatitis co-infection and that this differs from
      both hepatitis and HIV mono-infection.

      The study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal pilot study of individuals infected with HIV
      and either HBV or HCV.
