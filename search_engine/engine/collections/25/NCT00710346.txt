      (leiomyoma) tissues in order to gather information that will lead to improved understanding
      of uterine fibroid growth and pathogenesis. It is expected that this initiative will
      eventually improve fertility and reproductive health of the millions of women who suffer from
      fibroids.

      To address the need for increased research in this field, the NICHD in collaboration with the
      Office of Research on Women s Health (ORWH) will establish a national fibroid tissue bank.
      This initiative will strengthen the science base, improve our understanding of how uterine
      fibroids develop and grow, and provide clues to more effective conservative management of
      fibroids. The rationale for this protocol is that a repository of well-characterized,
      well-preserved leiomyoma tissues will provide investigators interested in basic and
      translational research on fibroids the opportunity to study the condition. This will
      facilitate research because experiments conducted on the samples may be expected to improve
      understanding of the mechanism and pathophysiology of this disease.
