      study, multiple specimens will be collected from each subject and tested using various
      pre-analytical techniques. Current BioFire FilmArray test panels will be used to assay each
      specimen and evaluate the multiple variables: repeat sampling, native specimen stability, or
      other post-collection variables. In the second phase of the study only two specimens will be
      collected from each subject: one for testing with the new test (using handling procedures
      identified in Phase 1) and another for testing with the reference method. Up to 2,000
      subjects will be enrolled across all sites in each phase (up to 4,000 subjects total).
      Enrollment is expected to last approximately 18 months to cover both phases of the study. All
      specimens and subject data will be de-identified and coded. Prior to study initiation, each
      participating site will have the necessary Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews.
      Specimens in both phases will be tested at the study site using various BioFire test
      platforms and cartridges.
