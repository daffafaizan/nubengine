      eliminating or minimizing the use of fentanyl in the post-operative period.

      Children undergoing SDR for spastic cerebral palsy have significant post-operative pain. The
      procedure requires dissection of the lumbar back musculature and removal of the L1 lamina
      (the bony posterior part of the vertebra). The majority of the operation is intradural, and a
      water-tight dural closure at the termination of the operation is critical in order to prevent
      leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the wound. In fact, these children must remain flat
      on their back for 48 hours to allow the dural incision to heal prior to mobilization. Thus,
      adequate pain control is essential not only for patient comfort, but also to prevent
      agitation and additional stress on the dural closure.

      Currently, the investigators' patients undergoing SDR are treated for 48 hours with scheduled
      intravenous (IV) narcotic (continuous fentanyl infusion at 0.5-2.0 Î¼g/kg/hour) in addition to
      the sedative/muscle relaxant Valium (0.2 mg/kg IV every 4 hours for 24 hours, then every 6
      hours for 24 hours). The IV fentanyl, and to a lesser degree Valium, carries a real risk of
      hypotension and respiratory depression and requires frequent dose adjustments to achieve
      adequate analgesia.

      By improving the current SDR analgesia protocol, the investigators hope to maximize patient
      safety and comfort while maintaining the effectiveness of the operation by minimizing the
      risk of CSF leak.
