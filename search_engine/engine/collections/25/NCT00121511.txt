      keratoses (AKs) since the 1950's. Through many years of use, Efudex has been deemed to be a
      safe and effective therapy. It requires, however, a high level of patient compliance and is
      known to cause a vigorous inflammatory reaction when actinic keratoses are treated. It has
      the distinct advantage of identifying precancerous skin lesions not apparent on clinical
      inspection or palpation. Following a course of Efudex to the face, patients have been noted
      to have fewer signs of dermatoheliosis.

      The investigators propose to determine if Efudex is associated with improvement of aging skin
      in the setting of treating actinic keratoses. The researchers hope to demonstrate less p53
      staining following Efudex treatment. It is proposed that the skin improvements seen following
      a course of Efudex are due to both reduction of actinic keratoses and impact on photoaging.
      The researchers propose to quantify the effects of Efudex therapy on the immunohistochemical
      staining properties of facial skin with respect to p53 and procollagen. The hypothesis is
      that Efudex therapy will decrease p53 immunostaining thus providing biochemical evidence to
      support this treatment in the reduction of actinic keratoses with concomitant improvement of
      aging skin.
