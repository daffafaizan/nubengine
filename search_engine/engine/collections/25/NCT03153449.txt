      patients with high BMIs, advanced preoperative deformities and ligamentous laxity. Such cases
      may require the surgeon to treat using ancillary components, such as stems and/or augments
      and/or additional constraint.

      This post-market study will evaluate the short/medium term clinical performance and medium
      term survivorship of the ATTUNE Revision system system, which includes instrumentation, in
      complex primary TKA. The study is designed as a worldwide non-comparative, multi-center study
      with each site initially having a cohort of approximately 20 Subjects to recruit. The study
      will enroll approximately 200 fixed bearing and approximately 200 rotating platform
      configurations.

      The 2-year KOOS-ADL (activities of daily living) was selected as the primary endpoint because
      it will evaluate the post-operative period during which outcomes typically plateau and will
      therefore provide a good indication of longer term outcomes

      Male and female Subjects, age 22-80 years, inclusive, who require a primary knee arthroplasty
      in a joint that, due to deformity, instability, bone loss etc., necessitates the use of
      implants found within the ATTUNE Revision knee system and are suitable candidates for TKA
      using the ATTUNEÂ® Revision system are eligible for enrollment in this study.
