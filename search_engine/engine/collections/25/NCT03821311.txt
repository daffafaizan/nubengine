      heated and humidified air at flow rates that exceed peak inspiratory flow, via a
      large-caliber nasal cannula. It delivers a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 21% to
      100%, with a flow rate up to 60 LÂ·min-1.

      The therapy is used for a variety of disease conditions including chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD frequently manifest flow limitation during
      resting tidal breathing, through dynamic compression of the airways, which is attributed to a
      loss of parenchymal tethering of the airways. In patients with severe COPD and respiratory
      failure, improved oxygenation and ventilation may reduce mortality. There are limited
      clinical data available in adult applications of NHF and on the effectiveness of NHF in
      patients with stable moderate or severe COPD.

      The mechanisms through which NHF affects the respiratory system are still being investigated.
      Two of the proposed mechanisms of action of NHF therapy are the generation of 3-5 cmH20
      positive airway pressure during expiration and washout of the nasopharyngeal dead space.
      Positive airway pressure has been shown to improve oxygenation, ventilation-perfusion
      matching and respiratory rates, while nasopharyngeal washout reduces the anatomical dead
      space and thereby improves alveolar ventilation.

      Our working hypothesis is that positive nasopharyngeal pressure generated by NHF particularly
      during expiration can help maintain small peripheral airways patent, thereby reducing the
      amount of gas trapping.

      Gas trapping can be quantified based on densitometric analysis of registered computerized
      tomography images obtained at high and low lung volumes.
