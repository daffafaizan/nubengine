      ischemia-reperfusion injury. In animal studies, the signalling pathway of this (impressive)
      protective phenomenon is very similar to ischemic preconditioning. It opens a new avenue of
      post-reperfusion interventions with drugs that have been shown to mimic ischemic
      preconditioning. Before we can study this phenomenon in our forearm ischemia-reperfusion
      model, we need additional validating experiments. The purpose of this study proposal is to
      provide these data.
