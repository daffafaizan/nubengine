      occur on sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute
      stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in MT on functionality can persist
      for six months after treatment finished; and (3) the MT could result in cortical/movement
      reorganization as well as the changes in physiological markers.
