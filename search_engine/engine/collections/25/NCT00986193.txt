    
      The purpose of the study is to compare the new established apical stent valve treatment with
      conventional surgical intervention using biological valve prostheses in patients with severe
      aortic valve stenosis.

      The Edwards-SAPIENTM Transcatheter Heart Valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) will be
      used in the stent valve group. The Carpentier-Edwards-Perimount Heart Valve (Edwards
      Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) will be recommended for the conventional surgery group.(Edwards
      Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).

      Heart centres in the Nordic region with experience (>10 cases) in apical stent valve
      treatment and in conventional surgical treatment of high risk patients with aortic valve
      stenosis. The study will be initiated at Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.

      Study hypothesis:

      As compared to conventional aortic valve substitution in patients aged >75 years, apical
      stent valve treatment reduces the rates of death, cerebrovascular insult (CVI) and need of
      dialysis for renal failure 1 month after the treatment.

      Primary clinical end-point:

      Combined end-point consisting of death, CVI and/or renal failure with need for haemodialysis,
      1 month after index treatment.
