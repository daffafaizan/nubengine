    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group , placebo-controlled, multicenter US-based
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 dose levels of NG101 (Metopimazine) compared
      with placebo in participants with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis.

      The study will enroll approximately 280 participants. Following the Screening Period, there
      is a 2-week Pretreatment Period during which participants will complete an electronic daily
      diary. Participants eligible for the clinical study will be randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1
      ratio) to receive either NG101 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg, or matching placebo during a 12-week
      Treatment Period. All participants will be asked to take one capsule 30 minutes before a meal
      3 times a day and 30 minutes before bedtime for a total of 4 capsules daily (QID). The total
      duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 20 weeks.
