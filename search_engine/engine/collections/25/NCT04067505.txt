      caused by chronic friction and compression of the left iliac vein by the right common iliac
      artery and lumbar vertebra. It is also called Cockett syndrome or May-Thurner syndrome.
      Recently, left iliac vein balloon dilatation with stent implantation have been used to treat
      patients with LIVCS, and have achieved good results. However, no matter the iliac vein
      stenosis or occlusion, interventional therapy can directly cause local trauma and intimal
      injury, which is a clear inducement of local thrombosis. Therefore, high intensity
      anticoagulation therapy is still needed to prevent secondary thrombosis in stent after left
      iliac vein balloon dilatation with stent implantation. At present, the postoperative
      anticoagulation regimen of these patients is early heparin anticoagulant therapy, and later
      warfarin anticoagulant therapy. However, due to the narrow therapeutic window of the drug,
      patients need to adjust the dosage according to coagulation function under the guidance of
      doctors. Rivaroxaban can simplify treatment, and is safe. Previous studies have shown that
      rivaroxaban is effective in preventing deep venous thrombosis after orthopaedic surgery.
      Rivaroxaban has also been shown to be safe and effective in anticoagulation therapy for
      patients with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. However, Rivaroxaban lacks
      sufficient clinical data for adjuvant anticoagulation therapy after balloon dilatation with
      stent implantation. Therefore, this study should be carried out to provide the basis for
      LIVCS treatment guidelines and explore the clinical indications of rivaroxaban.
