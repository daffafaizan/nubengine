      about concepts of pain neuroscience, in the management of migraine, compared to routine
      medical interventions, in primary care health centres of Alava.

      After recruitment, patients were interviewed by the research team members in charge of the
      assessments. In these interviews, data were collected on the following: demographic
      characteristics, beliefs regarding migraine, coping strategies for migraine attacks, the
      MIDAS questionnaire (16), medication taken, work leave, emergency department attendances and
      limitation of daily activities due to migraine, during the previous 3 months.

      Subsequently, we carried out further assessments over the telephone after 3, 6 and 12 months.
      Very few studies assessing preventive treatments for migraine have performed assessments 12
      months after initiating prophylactic treatment, most having followed-up patients for 6 months
      at most. We believe, however, it is necessary to continue assessments for at least 1 year to
      properly test the efficacy of treatment for chronic illnesses like migraine. The individuals
      carrying out the assessment were blinded to group allocation. The clinical follow-up was the
      same for both groups, the only difference in their management being the educational
      intervention itself.
