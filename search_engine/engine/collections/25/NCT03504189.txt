    
      PregSense™ is a maternal-fetal monitor that non-invasively measures and displays fetal heart
      rate, maternal hear rate and uterine contractions. This study will be performed to collect
      and digitally record data from PregSense™ and the standard of care (CTG) in order to provide
      evidence of safety and agreement between PregSense™ and the gold standard NST device.
