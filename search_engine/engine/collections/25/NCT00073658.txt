      increased caregiver burden, and premature institutionalization. Pharmacotherapy is often
      necessary to treat these disturbances. This study will use citalopram and risperidone to
      treat people with dementia-related behavior problems.

      Participants in this study will begin a psychotropic medication washout period for up to 3
      days at study start. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either citalopram
      or risperidone for up to 12 weeks. Limited doses of the sedative lorazepam may be
      administered as needed throughout the study. During the first 2 weeks of the study,
      participants will be admitted to a hospital to have their dementia-related behavioral
      disturbances stabilized. Following hospital discharge, participants will move to a long-term
      care facility or a residential home and will continue medication treatment for up to 10
      weeks. Side effects and improvements in behavioral status will be assessed every week until
      Week 6 and every 2 weeks thereafter. Experimental laboratory measures will be collected at
      study start, Week 1, Week 2, and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 12. Upon study
      completion, patients may continue to receive citalopram or risperidone under the supervision
      of their current physicians. Three months after study completion, participants may be
      contacted for a follow-up report of their psychiatric and medical status.
