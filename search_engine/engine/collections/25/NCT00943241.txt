    
      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been scheduled to
      have a scan of your heart. The radioactive dye used to image your heart is also taken up by
      many types of breast cancer. The investigators have developed a new method for detecting
      breast cancer, called Molecular Breast Imaging that uses this dye.

      The purpose of this study is to see how well this new method works in normal subjects with no
      known breast cancer and to see if we can detect breast cancer at an earlier stage than
      mammography. As you read this form describing the study, ask any questions you have. Take
