      we need to employ two settings of recruitment.

      Early part:

      The PEP in ART (PEP-A) will enroll participants referred for fertility treatment at
      Rigshospitalet and North Zealand Hospital. Participants all have cryopreserved embryos
      suitable for frozen embryo transfer in a natural menstrual cycle. No type of ovulation
      trigger will be employed, as the LH peak is monitored via home urine-LH test.

      For a thorough examination of the luteal phase, participants are recalled for blood samples
      on day 7, 11, 14 and 16 after positive urine-LH test. Hereafter positive serum human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) denotes a pregnancy and these participants are offered to
      continue in the later part of the PEP-cohort.

      Late part:

      PEP in Spontaneous conceptions (PEP-S) represents the sampling of expected normal pregnancies
      from the local community. Enrolled at the time of the first positive pregnancy test,
      participants are expected to be included from approximately 5 weeks of gestation. Hereafter
      participants are recalled every two weeks for blood sampling and transvaginal
      ultrasonographys of endometrial thickness until a gestational sac and yolk sac are visible
      for mean sac diameter measuring and eventually the crown-rump-length.

      Research biobank All collected data: questionnaires of medical history before enrollment,
      ultrasonographys and blood samples of progesterone, 17-OH-progesterone, estradiol,
      alpha-feto-protein (AFP), pregnancy associated placental protein A (PAPP-A), hCG and PIF are
      stored in a research biobank.
