    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of an app-based mindfulness
      meditation intervention for PA students.

      The investigators will measure feasibility of using the Calm app for 10-minutes a day for
      four weeks in PA students. Feasibility will be measured with acceptability (i.e. satisfaction
      survey), demand (participation in the app as prescribed), and practicality (i.e., survey).
      Secondly, the investigators will determine the preliminary effects of a 4-week meditation
      intervention on burnout levels in PA students when compared to a wait list control group.
      Burnout symptoms (primary outcome), mindfulness, stress levels, and depressive symptoms
      (secondary outcomes) will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (4-weeks). Data
      gathered from this study will inform a future randomized controlled trial to determine the
      effects of a mindfulness meditation app on burnout in PA students. The information could also
      be used to design other studies assessing burnout in the workplace.

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility (acceptability, demand, practicality) of using the Calm app
      10-minutes per day for four weeks in PA students. For the intervention group, our benchmarks
      will be as follows: 1) Acceptability (i.e., satisfaction) ≥70%, 2) Demand (i.e.,
      participation in the app as prescribed, intention to use) ≥70%, 3) Practicality (i.e.,
      survey) ≥70%.

      Aim 2: Determine the preliminary effects of using the Calm app 10-minutes per day for four
      weeks on burnout (primary outcome) mindfulness, stress levels, and depressive symptoms
      (secondary outcomes) in PA students as compared to a wait-list control group.
