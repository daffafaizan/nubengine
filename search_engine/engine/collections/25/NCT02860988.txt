      supervision) and substance use issues will have the opportunity to enroll in services
      provided by the Mountain Comprehensive Care Center to focus on enhancing fatherhood and
      family situations.

      The primary research questions focus on gauging the intervention's effectiveness in improving
      healthy relationship and responsible fatherhood outcomes. The intervention has several
      components targeting parenting skills, job training, relationship education, and case
      management/reentry support. Primary research questions include:

        1. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on
           parenting and co-parenting skills/behaviors, as measured by parental role satisfaction
           and confidence in parenting skills six months after release from incarceration?

        2. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on the
           likelihood that the participant will be employed six months after release from
           incarceration?

        3. Compared to the counterfactual condition, what is the impact of the intervention on the
           likelihood that the participant will be in a relationship six months after release from
           incarceration?
