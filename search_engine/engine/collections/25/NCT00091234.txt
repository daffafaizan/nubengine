        -  Compare the feasibility, toxicity, and antileukemic activity of two different dosing
           regimens of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) vs standard supportive care in older patients
           with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia who are not candidates for intensive
           chemotherapy. (phase II)

        -  Compare the efficacy and toxicity of the best dosing regimen of GO selected from phase
           II vs standard supportive care, in terms of overall survival, in these patients. (phase
           III)

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase II study followed by a phase III
      study. Patients are stratified according to age (61 to 75 vs 76 to 80 vs 81 and over),
      CD33-positivity of bone marrow blasts (< 20% vs 20-80% vs > 80% vs unknown), initial WBC
      before hydroxyurea administration (< 30,000/mm^3 vs â‰¥ 30,000/mm^3), WHO performance status
      (0-1 vs 2 vs 3-4), and participating center.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8.
                Patients with stable or responding disease at day 36 receive GO IV over 2 hours
                every 4 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive GO IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with
                stable or responding disease at day 36 receive GO IV over 2 hours every 4 weeks for
                up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive standard supportive care.

        -  Phase III: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive the selected treatment (arm I or arm II) from phase II.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care. Patients who receive GO
                treatment are followed monthly for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.
                Patients who receive standard supportive care are followed at least every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 259 patients (75 for phase II [25 per treatment arm] and 184
      for phase III [92 per treatment arm]) will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
