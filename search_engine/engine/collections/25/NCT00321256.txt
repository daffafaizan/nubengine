      patients with brittle type 1 diabetes with no endogenous insulin secretion, for whom the risk
      of the spontaneous course of the disease is judged to be worse than the
      transplantation-related risk. The specific objective is to establish reference data for islet
      transplantation in non-uremic patients with brittle diabetes, in a multicentric network
      setting, using the Edmonton protocol.
