      improvement in survival among women living with HIV in the United States, many of whom have
      entered or will soon enter the menopause transition. Significant changes are seen across the
      menopause transition among women without HIV including increased abdominal fat and waist
      circumference, reduced muscle mass, and changes in lipids, glucose metabolism and bone
      density. HIV and potentially ART use have been associated with similar manifestations such as
      reduced bone density, changes in lipid and glucose metabolism, and body composition, though
      little is known regarding how the virus may influence or exacerbate such changes across the
      menopause transition. In addition to metabolic factors, menopause has been associated with
      changes in mood state, decreased quality of life, and presence of vasomotor symptoms among
      women without HIV. Psychosocial indices, such as depression and decreased quality of life are
      common among women with HIV, and may manifest or worsen during the menopause transition.
      However, research investigating the presence and acuity of these symptoms among women with
      HIV during menopause is limited.
