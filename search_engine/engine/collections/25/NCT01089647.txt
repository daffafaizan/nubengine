      combination of two medicines that decrease nasal congestion-montelukast and nasal
      budesonide-or a placebo pill and nasal spray. After 3 months of therapy, a repeat sleep study
      will be done to determine the differences, if any, in the frequency of sleep disordered
      breathing in the two groups.
