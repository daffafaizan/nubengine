    
      The MASS COMM trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled two-arm trial of
      PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals (non-SOS-PCI arm) versus PCI performed at SOS hospitals
      (SOS-PCI arm). The trial is designed to reject the null-hypothesis of inferiority, and
      thereby show the non-inferiority of the non-SOS-PCI arm to the SOS-PCI arm.

      Specifically, 3690 subjects will be enrolled in a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial
      (RCT), in which eligible subjects will be consented and randomized in a 3:1 ratio at the
      non-SOS hospitals for PCI to be performed at either the enrolling non-SOS hospital (3 chances
      out of 4) or a corresponding SOS hospital (1 chance out of 4).
