    
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterised by chronic or recurrent
      abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. This trial aims to
      evaluate the efficacy of Ibodutant in improvement of IBS symptoms through a daily oral
      administration, testing three dosages or placebo in IBS patients for 4-weeks. In each
      patient, the experimental clinical phase encompasses a screening/ 2-week run-in period (no
      study medication), followed by a 4-weeks treatment period and a 2-weeks treatment withdrawal
      period, for total study duration of 8 weeks in each patient.
