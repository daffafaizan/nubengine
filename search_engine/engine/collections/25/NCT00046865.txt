        -  Compare nausea experience and intensity in women with breast cancer receiving one of
           three combination therapy regimens when treated with standard nausea care plus
           acupressure vs standard nausea care alone.

        -  Compare the quality of life, presence of anxiety, and functional status of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide vs doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and
      fluorouracil vs doxorubicin with paclitaxel or docetaxel vs fluorouracil, epirubicin, and
      cyclophosphamide) and treatment setting. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive active acupressure plus usual nausea care during the second or
           third course of chemotherapy. Acupressure is applied to a specific site each morning and
           again whenever nausea is experienced for 3-6 minutes.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo acupressure plus usual nausea care during the second or
           third course of chemotherapy. Acupressure is applied as in arm I except at a
           non-specific site.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive usual nausea care during the second or third course of
           chemotherapy.

      All patients complete a daily log during the second or third course of chemotherapy. Quality
      of life is assessed at baseline and after the last treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 244 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
