      detection of SIRS will lead to early treatment. Serum cytokines levels are reliable markers
      for SIRS detection but with high cost and inconvenience. Clinical Scoring Systems are
      commonly used for assessment of patients with SIRS. If they have good correlation with
      cytokine levels, they might be used to predict peri-operative clinical outcomes.
