      females were obese, according to Polynesian BMI cut offs (BMI â‰¥32.0 kg/m2).1,2 Interventions
      designed to increase physical activity or facilitate weight loss often include a
      self-monitoring component, but these intervention programs have not yet been tested in the
      Samoan setting. The goal of this project is to pilot test such an approach.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To investigate the acceptability and feasibility of self-monitoring of physical activity
           and weight through the introduction of step counting devices (FitBit Zips) and scales
           (BodyTrace).

        2. To measure any changes that occur in participants' health, health behaviors related to
           diet and physical activity, or conceptions of health (including self-efficacy and
           perceptions of weight) over the study period.
