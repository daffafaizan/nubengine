      sham Tymbion iontophoresis in providing anesthesia to the tympanic membrane. In addition,
      safety will be evaluated by review of the occurrence of adverse events.

      The iontophoresis system (IPS) will be used to facilitate anesthetic delivery to the tympanic
      membrane (TM). The lidocaine-based solution used for local anesthesia of the TM is Tymbion
      (2% lidocaine HCl/ 1:100,000 epinephrine).

      Group A will consist of 40 evaluable healthy adult subjects randomized (1:1) to receive
      unilateral treatment (1 ear) with either active Tymbion iontophoresis or sham Tymbion
      iontophoresis. The sham iontophoresis procedure will be identical to the active Tymbion
      iontophoresis, with the exception that the iontophoresis current will not be activated (ie,
      the same drug solution will be applied to ears in both arms). After the completion of the
      iontophoresis procedure, the tympanic membrane will be tapped with a dull otologic probe to
      test the level of anesthesia. The subject will rate the level of pain using the Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) immediately after the tap. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to
      treatment assignment.

      Safety assessments will be done post procedure and at follow as applicable.
