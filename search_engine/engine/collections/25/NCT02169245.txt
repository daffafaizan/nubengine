      intake at breakfast on neural activation in brain regions associated with appetitive drive
      and reward-driven eating, measures of subjective appetite, and ingestive behavior in
      overweight adults. Additional outcomes of interest include the effects of the breakfast
      intervention on 24-hour glucose profile as well as fasting and postprandial glycemic and
      lipemic regulation. The investigators will test the effects of consuming breakfasts with
      normal protein/normal fiber (NPNF), normal protein/high fiber (NPHF), high protein/normal
      fiber (HPNF), and high protein/high fiber (HPHF) for two weeks in a randomized cross-over
      study.
