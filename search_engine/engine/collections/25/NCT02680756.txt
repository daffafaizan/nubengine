    
      A phase 3b, randomized, controlled, multicentre study with oral ferric maltol or intravenous
      iron (FCM), for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in subjects with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      Approximately 242 eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive one of the following
      treatments for the duration of the study treatment period (52 weeks):

        -  Oral ferric maltol, 30 mg capsule bid.

        -  Intravenous iron (ferric carboxy maltose) as per SPC

      In the FCM arm IV iron treatment will be repeated if the subject is iron deficient at any of
      the study visits.

      Subject participation in the study will consist of 3 periods:

        -  Screening: Up to 14 days

        -  Randomised Treatment: 52 weeks

        -  Post-treatment safety follow-up: 14 days after study medication discontinuation

      Primary efficacy and safety of ferric maltol and Intravenous iron (ferric carboxy maltose)
      will be evaluated after the first 12 weeks.

      End of study evaluations will occur at Week 52 or premature discontinuation.
