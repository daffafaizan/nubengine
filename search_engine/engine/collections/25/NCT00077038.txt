      The hypothesis of this study is that the parieto-frontal network is activated by visuomotor
      behavior in humans.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To detect frontal and parietal cortical activity during a visuomotor task with frequency
      modulated visual stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG).

      To reveal how the parieto-frontal activities change according to different conditions of
      attention, gaze, and motor output.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Right handed normal volunteers with no known history of neurological or ophthalmological
      diseases will be recruited to participate in this study.

      DESIGN:

      This study is a combination of a frequency tagging method and an MEG. Visual stimuli are
      presented, flickering in specific (tagged) frequencies. The cortical distribution of the
      visual information is estimated from the tagged frequency response of the MEG signal. We will
      use a visuomotor tracking task with a multifactorial task design (attention, target motion,
      position in retinal coordinate, and manual tracking) to evaluate the effect of each factor
      separately.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      We will use the adaptive linear-filter technique known as synthetic aperture magnetometry
      (SAM) to estimate the source location and strength of the tagged frequencies. The estimated
      cortical source activity power at the frontal and parietal cortices will be group analyzed
      with multiple logistic models and by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with correction for
      multiple comparisons.
