      90% effective at preventing pregnancy following unprotected intercourse. Both ulipristal
      acetate (UPA) and levonorgestrel (LNG) delay or inhibit ovulation when used for EC. For
      individual women, use of EC provides a critical backup to prevent unintended pregnancy.

      However, obesity may severely impair EC effectiveness. Data from two large randomized control
      trials to identify risk factors for EC failure. A woman of obese body mass index (BMI)
      (â‰¥30mg/kg2) using LNG-based EC had more than a 4 times greater risk of pregnancy compared to
      her normal BMI counterpart and a woman of overweight BMI (25-29.9) was at twice the risk of
      pregnancy. Failure was also associated with a high body weight. LNG-based EC appears to have
      a ceiling of efficacy at 70 kg and no efficacy for women 80 kg and above. It is believed that
      by doubling the dose to LNG 3.0 mg, serum levels of LNG are corrected to a therapeutic range.
