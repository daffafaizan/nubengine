      lung protective ventilatory strategies when intubation is required in order to minimize
      ventilator induced lung injury.

      In our institution a new ventilatory protocol including less invasive surfactant
      administration, Synchronized nasal positive pressure ventilation and early rescue High
      frequency ventilation has been implemented during 2013-14.

      Hypothesis: New less invasive and lung protective strategies to prevent lung injury had been
      effective in reducing intubation rates.
