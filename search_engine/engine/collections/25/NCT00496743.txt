      for the long-term control therefore essential. Electron beam therapy is generally applied to
      the skin in total doses of 30-36 Gy over a 8-10 week period.Due to the potential risk of
      toxicity including bone marrow supression, no more than 2-3 courses in a life time are
      generally recommended. In the current study we explored the possibility of using lower
      radiation doses for total skin electron beam therapy for long-term disease control.
