      disability. It is revised from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire It contains 10 items
      mentioning various activities (personal care, lifting, driving, work, sleeping,
      concentration, reading, recreation) and pain (pain intensity, headache) with 6 conceivable
      answers for each item. Patients are educated to choose only one answer which most closely
      suits their condition at the current time. The score of each item ranges between 0 (no pain
      and no functional limitation) and 5 (worst pain and maximal limitation) that lead to the
      total score of 0 (no disability) to 50 (totally disabled), as 0-4 points (no disability),
      5-14 points (10-28% disability), 15-24 points (30-48% disability), 25-34 points (50-64%
      disability) and 35-50 points (70-100% disability). The meantime to fill the questionnaire is
      3-7.8 minutes. The NDI showed high validity and reliability for patients with neck pain.

      By this study, the accuracy and reproducibility of the translated versions of NDI
      questionnaires will be enhanced and thus can create a useful measure to obtain data from
      culturally/linguistically diverse people belonging to different ethnic background as in
      Pakistan. It will create trustworthiness among clinicians and researchers to utilize the tool
      as a measure of what it is supposed to measure.
