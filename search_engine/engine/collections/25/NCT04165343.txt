      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on organs other than the liver. One of the most
      common organs affected in patients with NAFLD is the heart. We expect to have about 88 people
      participate in this study at University of California (UC), Davis. About three-fourths (66)
      of the participants will be patients who have been diagnosed with NAFLD. The other one-fourth
      (22) will be healthy individuals with no known liver disease. These healthy subjects will
      allow researchers to compare healthy organs or body functions with those of persons with
      NAFLD. The healthy participants are called the "Healthy Control" group. All participants will
      undergo the same testing.

      If you agree to participate in this study, researchers will first interview you and review
      your medical records in order to document your medical (clinical) history. You will also have
      a physical examination by a doctor and a blood test. You will then undergo a series of
      imaging tests to determine the status of your liver, heart and other internal organs.

      All participants will have a PET/CT Scan (Positron Emission Tomography), and an MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging). All participants will also have an Electrocardiogram and an
      Echocardiogram. All Electrocardiogram tests are the same, but there are two types of
      Echocardiogram tests. One is like a standard ultra-sound imaging of your heart. The other is
      a "Stress Cardio" that will require you to increase your heart rate on a treadmill before the
      ultra-sound test. Your study doctor will determine which test you have.
