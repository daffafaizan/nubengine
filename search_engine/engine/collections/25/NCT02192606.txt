      clinical setting. Based on previous studies indicating 3D laparoscopy has improved skills of
      novice surgeons in the simulation lab, there has been no reports to date investigating the
      role of 3D laparoscopy in the operating room. Our study will evaluate the facility of 3D
      laparoscopy in the novice surgeon, mainly residents and fellow. Patients who present for a
      scheduled total laparoscopic hysterectomy will be randomized to either the standard 2D
      laparoscopy system or 3D laparoscopy system. Stratifying residents versus fellow, we will
      compare the time to close the vaginal cuff comparing both systems.
