      subjects. A total of 24 subjects, 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each, will be enrolled in this
      study. All of the 6 subjects in each cohort will receive a single dose of Y-2 sublingual
      tablet on a single occasion. Prior to taking the drug and after taking the drug at 5 min to
      24 h, venous blood from all subjects will be collected at different time points for PK
      analysis. After dosing, safety and tolerability data for each cohort will be evaluated.
