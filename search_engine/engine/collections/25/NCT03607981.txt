    
      Multicenter prospective registry on patients with diagnosis of Spontaneous Coronary Artery
      Dissection (SCAD). Spanish nationwide based, the aims of the current registry are:

        1. To analyze predisposing factors, potential triggers and associated pathologies of
           patients presenting with SCAD.

        2. To study the clinical and angiographic presentation of these patients.

        3. To analyze the value of intracoronary diagnostic techniques (OCT, IVUS) and non-invasive
           imaging techniques in the diagnosis of this pathology.

        4. To better understand the in-hospital clinical evolution and the response to medical
           treatment or revascularization in these challenging patients, taking into account the
           angiographic or intravascular imaging morphological characteristics of SCAD and the
           treatment applied.

        5. To analyze its long-term clinical evolution (adverse cardiovascular events, including
           recurrence of SCAD).

        6. To identify those factors directly related to prognostic and risk of recurrence.
