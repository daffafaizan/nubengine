      closures within 12 weeks of treatment with MIRODERM Fenestrated Biological Wound Matrix. Some
      secondary objectives of this study include documenting the time course of wound healing and
      assessing changes in quality of life.

      The primary cohort is individuals suffering from a diabetic foot ulcer that has not been
      healed in the last 3 months and after at least 2 attempts with an advanced biologic. Ulcer
      will be between 1 and 12 cm squared, less than 5 mm deep, full thickness, below the ankle,
      and with no exposed bone or tendon. Subjects will be 18 or older, have Type I or II diabetes
      with adequate vascular profusion. Subjects will be unable to participate if they have
      osteomyelitis, Charcot foot, a known collagen vascular disease, are on dialyses, are
      immunocompromised or have an HbA1c level equal to or great than 12%.

      This is a single-arm study with no Independent Variables. Descriptive data to be collected
      will include demographics, pathology and medical history.

      Outcome assessments:

        -  proportion of subjects with 100% epithelialization of wound

        -  SF-36

        -  Adverse events
