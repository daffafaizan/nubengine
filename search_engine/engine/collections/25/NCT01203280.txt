      Traumatic minor cervical strains are common place in high-impact sports and premature
      degenerative changes have been documented in sports people exposed to recurrent impact trauma
      or repetitive forces. Whiplash injury may result in extensive trauma to muscles and
      ligamentous structures within the cervical spine . Many of these structures, particularly the
      muscles, contain mechanoreceptors that play a key role in position sense. Studies have shown
      that head and neck position sense may become impaired following whiplash injury.
      Subsequently, poor movement patterns, together with the perpetuation of pain and other
      symptoms may develop.

      Posture control is achieved by integration of sensory inputs emanating from somatosensory,
      vestibular, and visual systems. Patients with whiplash injury has been reported, reflected by
      increased body sway and reduced ability to overcome challenging balance tasks. In this study
      we have attempted to evaluate the influence of boxing on balance performances, isometric
      strength and flexibility; furthermore, evaluate the therapeutic effect of ice massage on
      boxers.
