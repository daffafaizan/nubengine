      I. Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      (Abraxane®), in terms of frequency and duration of objective response, in patients with
      persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane®) IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
