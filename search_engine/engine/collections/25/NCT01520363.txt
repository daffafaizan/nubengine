      year - 9.99 years of age. This clinical trial, which is a placebo-controlled study, will
      randomize patients to the drug or placebo to determine the benefits of DM vs placebo on
      cognition, behavior, or seizures if present.

      Your child will stay twice in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU) at Johns Hopkins
      ICTR, for 3 days during each admission. The first hospital stay will be for 3 days, before
      she starts the DM or placebo. The follow-up 3-day hospital stay will be 3 months after she
      starts taking DM or placebo. There will also be two interim follow up evaluations at 2 weeks
      and 1 month after she starts taking the DM or placebo consisting of a neurological
      evaluation, EKG, and blood work, which can take place at your local doctor's office or at
      Johns Hopkins, and will be paid for by this study. Our research nurse or research associate
      will contact you at least weekly during the first month, and at least monthly thereafter
      until the end of the 3-month study.
