      homeostasis. The homeostasis is modified continually by internal and external stimuli to
      which the autonomic nervous system modulates the response of organism by tight control on
      essential functions such as circulation, respiration, hormonal secretion and
      thermoregulation. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system could complicate the
      perioperative course in the patient undergoing surgery; therefore it should be considered as
      another risk factor during preoperative evaluation. Nowadays the evaluation of the autonomic
      nervous system function like a tool for prediction postoperative outcome is not considered in
      daily anaesthesiology practice. Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is a method for
      evaluation the autonomic nervous system function. It is a non-invasive method that provides
      information about the autonomic regulation of organism and thus it identifies patients with
      the autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
