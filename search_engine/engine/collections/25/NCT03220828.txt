      traumatic, but research indicates that high anxiety in children before surgery leads to
      adverse outcomes such as increased pain and analgesics requirements, delayed hospital
      discharge, and maladaptive behavioral changes. Treating anxiety may decrease any of these
      undesirable behaviors.

      In this study, investigators hope to determine if technology based distractions (VR headsets)
      are more effective than standard care for preventing high anxiety before vascular access. As
      a secondary aim of the study, we seek to determine if the use of technology based distraction
      will result in higher parent and patient satisfaction, decreased fear, and increased
      compliance, while monitoring for side-effects of the intervention.
