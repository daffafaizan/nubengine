      cross the blood-brain barrier in both normal and inflamed meninges in a clinical study in
      patients with severe West Nile virus disease.

      At issue, is whether this observation is limited to AVI-4020 PMO drug, or is observed with
      other PMO drugs. This study is one of three to assess the specific ability of PMO drugs to
      cross the blood-brain barrier, using similar dosing, and PK assessment time points. In order
      to rigorously assess the pharmacokinetics, this study is being performed in healthy
      volunteers at a single point in time.

      The ability of other PMO drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier will set the stage for future
      studies that exploit this product characteristic.
