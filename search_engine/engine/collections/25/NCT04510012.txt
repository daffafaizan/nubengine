      severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Immunological factors which lead to severe
      disease in certain COVID-19 patients remain incompletely understood. Neurological damage and
      complement activation may be a consequence of excess inflammation in severe COVID-19. The
      investigators plan to study the innate and adaptive immune response and potentially
      associated complications such as neurological damage and complement activation in mild,
      moderate and severe COVID-19 courses.
