      confirmed DMD/BMD female carriers (Cohort A). This cohort will consist of 150 DMD/BMD mothers
      who are somatic carriers of a mutation in the DMD gene. The data collected for this cohort
      will be compared to three control groups; Control Group B is a cohort of 50 DMD/BMD mothers
      who are NOT somatic carriers, Control Group C is a cohort of 50 age-matched healthy controls
      and Control Group D is a cohort of 25 genetically confirmed carriers who do not have an
      affected child. The inclusion of a Control Group B allows for a comparison to a group of
      mothers that share the emotional and cognitive burden of caring for an affected male without
      having the physical or cognitive risks of being a female carrier. The Control Group C offers
      robust data from an age-matched healthy cohort for purposes of comparison. Control Group D
      allows for comparison to a group of women that have the same physical or cognitive risks as
      the Cohort A female carriers, but do not have the same burden of care giving.
