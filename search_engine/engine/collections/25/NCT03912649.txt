      recruit a total of 25 women with a palpable contraceptive implant due for removal, in order
      to obtain at least 20 successful fixations.

      The implant retrieval device aims to standardize and simplify the implant removal procedure.
      There is no comparator in the investigation. Descriptive data will be recorded, all recruited
      subjects will be exposed to the investigational medical device (IMD) The primary endpoint is
      the percentage of fixated implants that are successfully removed without the use of
      additional tools.
