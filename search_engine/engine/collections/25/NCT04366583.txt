      nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Many endoscopic devices have been demonstrated
      to be effective in the hemostasis of bleeding ulcers. However, the additional hemostatic
      efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) after endoscopic injection therapy has not been
      widely investigated.

      【Study】 From Feb. 2012 to April 2016, consecutive patients with high-risk bleeding ulcers,
      characterized by active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessels and adherent clots, were
      admitted to our hospital. They prospectively randomly underwent either APC therapy plus
      distilled water injection or Hemoclipping plus distilled water injection. Pantoprazole
      infusion was conducted during the fasting period after endoscopy and orally for 8 weeks to
      encourage ulcer healing. Episodes of rebleeding were retreated with endoscopic combination
      therapy. Patients who did not benefit from retreatment underwent emergency surgery or
      arterial embolization.
