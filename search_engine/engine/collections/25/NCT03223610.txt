    
      Background:

        -  Combination chemotherapy with Rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for CD20-
           positive B-cell lymphomas

        -  Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with
           chemoimmunotherapy but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas
           remain mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone

        -  Targeted therapies aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies
           are emerging and showing significant activity in NHL in both the relapsed and first-line
           settings

        -  Mechanistically-based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who
           cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy

        -  ViPOR targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis);
           BTK (B-cell receptor signaling and NFKB); Cereblon (NFKB) and CD20.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase 1b: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity
           profile of the combination of Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab and
           Revlimid (ViPOR) in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies

        -  Phase 2: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate of
           ViPOR in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies

      Eligibility:

        -  Women and men greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma
           excluding CLL/SLL. NOTE: untreated MCL is included in the phase 2 MCL expansion.

        -  Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma effect

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1b/2 study

        -  Phase 1b: Standard '3 + 3' design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated
           venetoclax with fixed dose ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (ViPOR) in
           relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies

        -  Phase 2: Expansion cohorts of aggressive and indolent non-MCL patients and MCL patients
           will be treated at the MTD to determine the ORR and CR rate in these subtypes.

        -  Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days

        -  To explore all dose levels in both non-MCL and MCL patient cohorts in the phase 1b
           study, and to assess the ORR and CR rate in aggressive and indolent non-MCL and MCL
           patients in a phase 2 dose expansion at the MTD, the accrual ceiling will be set at 130
           patients.
