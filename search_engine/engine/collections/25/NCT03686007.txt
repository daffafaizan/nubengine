      I. Test the effects of the multimedia self-management (MSM) intervention on family caregivers
      (FCG) outcomes and cancer support services use at discharge and 3-month post-discharge,
      comparing intervention and attention control groups.

      II. Test the effects of the MSM intervention on patient outcomes and healthcare resource use
      at discharge and 3-months post-discharge, comparing intervention and attention control
      groups.

      III. Test the effects of the MSM intervention on outcome mediators at discharge and 3-months
      post-discharge, comparing intervention and attention control groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore moderators (age, sex, marital status, caregiver relationship to patient, caregiver
      employment status, co-morbidities) of FCG and patient outcomes and reciprocal relationships.

      II. Determine, through exit interviews, participant's experience with the MSM intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients and FCGs receive the MSM intervention consisting of videos, a handbook, and
      research nurse coaching over 40-60 minutes, approximately 3-7 days before surgery and within
      24 hours of planned discharge. Patients and FCGs also receive research nurse support by
      telephone (separate sessions for FCGs and patients) over 20-30 minutes at 2 and 7 days, and 2
      months post-discharge.

      GROUP II: Patients and FCGs receive attention control intervention consisting of videos
      (American Cancer Society video on "Clinical Trials"), American Cancer Society print
      materials, and assistance from a clinical research associate (CRA) approximately 3-7 days
      before surgery and within 24 hours of planned discharge. Patients and FCGs also receive
      assistance from CRAs via telephone calls at 2 and 7 days, and 2 months post-discharge.
