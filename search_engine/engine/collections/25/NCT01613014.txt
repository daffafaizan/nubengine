      central to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response (Carrasco & Van de
      Kar-2003, Herman & Cullinan-1997, Sapolsky et al-2000; Tsigos & Chrousos-2002). Chronic
      dysregulation of the HPA axis is common in major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and
      substance abuse disorders characterized by elevated AVP, increased responsiveness to AVP, as
      well as either increased or decreased overall HPA axis activity or responsiveness (Dinan &
      Scott-2005). HPA axis normalization via pituitary V1B antagonism is a mechanism for potential
      ABT-436 efficacy in these disorders (Sch√ºle et al-2009). Limbic V1B antagonism in the brain
      may also contribute to efficacy (Roper et al-2011).

      Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism, is characterized by a chronic relapsing course, in which
      alcohol-associated cues and stress are known relapse triggers (Brownell et al-1986, Heilig &
      Egli-2006, Sinha & Li-2007). Recent research suggests that neural systems mediating
      behavioral stress responses may offer useful targets for pharmacotherapy of alcoholism. In
      animal models, excessive alcohol consumption that results from a history of alcohol
      dependence is accompanied by increased behavioral sensitivity to stress (Heilig & Koob-2007).
      Preclinical studies have shown that V1B antagonists can attenuate reinstatement of heroin and
      alcohol self-administration, and block dependence-induced exaggeration of alcohol intake, in
      rats. V1B antagonists have also been shown to block stress-induced reinstatement of drug and
      alcohol seeking in ethanol dependent rats (Zhou-2011). For these reasons the NIAAA Clinical
      Investigations Group (NCIG) proposes to test ABT-436 in a Phase 2, proof of concept trial for
      the treatment of alcohol dependence.
