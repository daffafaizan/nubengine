    
      Subjects with a diagnosis of chronic hypertension made prenatally or in the first 20 weeks of
      pregnancy (+/- medical therapy). The clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia will follow the
      current criteria outlined by ACOG (American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists) 10.

      Study/Project Procedures:

        -  Blood draw at the time of initial presentation at the time of a clinically indicated
           blood draw (10cc maternal blood via venipuncture)

        -  Blood draw at 2-7 days after initial presentation if undelivered at the time of a
           clinically indicated blood draw(10 cc maternal blood via venipuncture)

        -  Laboratory analysis will be performed in batches after all clinical history, clinically
           indicated laboratory information, delivery information, and clinical outcomes recorded
           for sFlt-1 level, PlGF level, and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (not part of routine care and
           will be performed for research purposes only at the cost of the investigators).

        -  Urine protein creatinine ratio performed as clinically indicated (will not be altered
           for research purposes)

        -  Maternal CBC (Complete Blood Count), CMP (Complete Metabolic Profile), LDH (Lactate
           dehydrogenase), Uric acid as indicated clinically (will not be altered for research
           purposes)

        -  Ultrasound performed by the investigators for research purposes only evaluating the
           uterine artery Doppler, middle cerebral artery Doppler, umbilical artery Doppler,
           estimated fetal weight, and amniotic fluid volume on a weekly basis from the time of
           enrollment until delivery.

        -  Medical record abstraction of medical history, laboratory and clinical findings for both
           the mother and fetus.
