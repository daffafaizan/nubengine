    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a CO2 laser (EdgeTM CO2 Laser) with a
      fractional handpiece made specifically for the vagina to possibly restore the normal
      physiological conditions of the vagina, thus reducing the symptoms of VVA. The EdgeTM CO2
      Laser and general fractional handpiece is approved by the FDA for ablative skin resurfacing
      (for example, treating fine lines and wrinkles, acne and surgical scars, skin pigmentation
      and discoloration, sun damage, pre-cancerous as well as benign lesions and uneven skin
      texture). The fractional handpiece used in this study for the treatment of VVA is
      experimental and has not been approved by the FDA for vaginal dryness associated with
      menopause.
