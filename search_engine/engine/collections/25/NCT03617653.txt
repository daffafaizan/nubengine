    
      Detailed Description The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of a structured
      exercise intervention on mitochondrial fuel metabolism and cardiovascular function.
      Participants with diastolic dysfunction will undergo a structured exercise intervention.

      Group A (intervention) will undergo exercise intervention for three months and Group B
      (control) will not receive the exercise intervention. At the start of the study and upon
      completion, all participants will undergo cardiovascular tests to measure cardiovascular
      function, as well bio-specimen (blood and urine) collection for metabolic profiling.

      Groups and Cohorts Group/Cohort :Group A Intervention/treatment Visit 1. Baseline procedures

        1. Cardiovascular measurements Arterial stiffness assessment by non-invasive brachial blood
           pressure machine Echocardiography Standard transthoracic echocardiographic examination
           will be performed according to established laboratory practice using standard
           commercially available machines.

           Resting electrocardiography will be performed to ascertain sinus rhythm.

        2. Biospecimen collection Fresh blood, urine specimens will be collected for metabolomics.

        3. Six-minute walk test The Six-Minute Walk Test is a shuttle walk test.

        4. Musculoskeletal Analysis Participants will undergo focused examinations that include
           measurement of height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, body composition
           analysis.
