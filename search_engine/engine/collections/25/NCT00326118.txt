      available MenC vaccine as active controls. Priorix™ is given concomitantly in both groups. In
      the primary phase, two blood samples are taken from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses:
      before and one month after vaccination. In the extension phase, at Year 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, one
      blood sample is taken at each year to follow the antibody persistence up to 5 years after
      vaccination. No additional vaccine is administered during the extension phase.
