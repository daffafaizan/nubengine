    
      This multicenter, randomized Phase II study of patients with advanced or metastatic estrogen
      receptor-positive human epidermal receptor type 2-negative breast cancer aims to compare two
      treatment strategies following induction therapy with 4-6 cycles of the combined use of
      weekly paclitaxel (wPTX) and bevacizumab (BV). In arm A, wPTX+BV is continued, while in arm
      B, wPTX is switched to maintenance endocrine therapy (hormone+BV) until disease progression,
      followed by wPTX+BV re-induction. The primary endpoint is time to failure of strategy, which
      is the time from randomization to a qualifying event (addition of a new agent not in the
      primary regimen, progressive disease during or after planned therapy, or death).
