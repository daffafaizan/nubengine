    
      -  Out patients will be screened for malaria by blood film examination

        -  Malaria-positive children will be examined by the physician for inclusion or
           exclusion(see below)

        -  Informed consent will be sought from guardians of potential patients

        -  Patients or guardians will be interviewed and a case record form completed

        -  Patients will be randomised into one of the two arms in the ratio 4:1 AQ/Art: CoArtem
           and issued a study card

        -  Filter paper and 5ml venous blood samples will be collected

        -  Patients will be hospitalised for three days to allow completion of therapy under
           observation

        -  The patient will be asked to return on days 7, 14 and 28 for assessment of clearance or
           recrudescence of parasites

        -  Patient will be examined for parasites and evaluated for early treatment failure (ETF),
           late treatment failure (LTF), late parasitological failure (LPF) or adequate clinical
           and parasitological response.(ACPR).

        -  If a patient does not appear for follow up, a community health worker will try to trace
           them and will collect blood onto filter paper and a microscope slide should the patient
           have a temperature ≥ 37.5°C

        -  Patients whose parents opt out of the study will be administered quinine sulphate if
           parasitaemic

        -  Filter paper samples will be air dried and stored with dessicant until required.

        -  Whole blood samples collected into citrate as anticoagulant will be processed for
           plasma, aliquoted into 300µl lots and stored at -70°C.

        -  Patient information will be entered at the close of each day into laptops and
           collectively sent to Yaounde at the end of the first month of study and thereafter at
           the end of each week, along with the hard copies of the case report forms.

        -  Analysis will be performed on the samples within three months of collection for
           molecular markers of resistance, genetic structure of parasites and for blood drug
           levels of medications used in the trial
