      docetaxel schedule in combination with standard Ra-223.

      Secondary Objectives include: assessment of progression-free survival, time to treatment
      failure, overall survival, ability of subjects to complete 6 cycles of the combination
      therapy, assessment of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) kinetics and objective responses
      (measurable disease), assessment of quality of life and assessment of bone bio-marker
      outcomes.

      The study features a 4-week lead-in period with docetaxel monotherapy to assess for docetaxel
      intolerance. The lead-in period is then followed by combination therapy with Ra-223 every 4
      weeks for 6 cycles in a traditional Phase I dose-escalation design.

      A provision has been made to include prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) cohorts after the lead-in period if neutropenia is the dose limiting toxicity at
      either dose level.

      The investigators hypothesize that the fractionated dosing of docetaxel will significantly
      mitigate the hematologic toxicity, preserve antineoplastic activity and allow for maintenance
      of the 4-weekly Ra-223 schedule.
