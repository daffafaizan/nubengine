      hospital Saint Vincent de Paul.

      Clinical examinations will be done by the midwives following the indications given on the
      clinical form. A trans-perineal echography will then be done by technical operators following
      the ultrasonography form.

      These examinations will only last a few minutes, no further tests will be done afterwards.
