      frequently refractory to standard treatment approaches. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in patients with sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic
      GVHD by strongly inhibiting both PDGF (Platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF-β
      (transforming growth factor-β) intracellular signaling, which is responsible for the
      expression of extracellular matrix genes.

      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is one of effective agent for the treatment of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease. MMF is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and hydrolyzed
      to the active metabolite, MPA (mycophenolic acid). MPA selectively inhibits inosine
      monophosphate dehydrogenase, blocking the pathway of purine synthesis in T and B lymphocytes.
      In this study we will combine MMF and imatinib mesylate to treat steroid-refractory
      sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic GVHD to see the response rate and to find the safety of
      combination.
