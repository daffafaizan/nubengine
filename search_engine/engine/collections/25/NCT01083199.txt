      prostate cancer due to the multi-focal nature of the disease. RP is most suitable for
      otherwise healthy men whose cancer is limited to a small area. The RP procedure involves
      removing the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and nearby lymph nodes. One of the most
      technically challenging and critical aspects in all of these surgical approaches is
      reconstruction of the interrupted urinary tract by hand sewing the vesico-urethral
      anastomosis. This is where the bladder neck is sewn to the urethra after the prostate has
      been removed.

      CONTINUUM™ (study Device) is to be used as part of the RP procedure by facilitating the
      approximation of the bladder neck and urethral stump. The Device brings together and holds
      the tissue in place until adequate natural healing of the vesico-urethral anastomosis occurs
      thereby minimizing extravasation. The Device also provides a conduit for drainage of urine
      from the bladder out the urethra during tissue healing.

      The concept of the CONTINUUM™ device and the feasibility of its operation have been
      successfully tested in animal and human studies. Pilot clinical studies in the United States
      (G060095) found that the majority of subjects who received and were discharged with the
      Device demonstrated a water-tight vesico-urethral anastomosis at the first Device removal
      visit. Additionally, no unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) were reported. The focus
      of the proposed study is to further verify the performance of the Device in global research
      centers.
