      gait. A postural perturbration is a sudden change in conditions that displaces the body
      posture away from equilibrium. Reactive postural control response is an immediate ( 70-120 ms
      ) automatic "like reflex" response which is initiated by unexpected postural perturbration in
      order to maintain balance. Even among young healthy adults there could be a problem in
      balance performance which does not become evident untill a slip or a trip or any other sudden
      perturbration happens. Thus a simple test of pertubration while standing or walking can
      identify a problem .

      This study is comparing the reactive postural control of physical education students who
      suffer from chronic ankle instability (CAI) to healthy students on a Perturbation Treadmill.
      The device consists of a treadmill mounted on a moving force plate platform. The platform
      moves in the medial/ lateral plains to simulate a slip and a trip in both the standing and
      walking phase. Their reactive postural control is tested in a few conditions: standing on
      both legs - eyes open and eyes closed, in tandem standing, standing on one leg and in
      walking. In each condition the perturbration is given every 5-15 seconds in different speed
      and in unexpected direction (right /left). Lost of balance control is any change in the
      original location of the foot in standing conditions or stepping out of the treadmill.
