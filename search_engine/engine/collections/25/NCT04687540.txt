      However, the underlying mechanisms have not been identified.This project aims to investigate
      the overall hypothesis that IL-6 receptor blockade changes substrate metabolism during
      postabsorptive and postprandial states to favor storage over mobilization of fat and to favor
      glucose over fat as a source for energy production. This hypothesis finds some support in the
      literature: Infusion of recombinant IL-6 into humans, leading to high concentrations of IL-6
      in the circulation, stimulates lipolysis and free fatty acid oxidation.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that IL-6 receptor blockade impairs the mobilization
      of FFA from adipose tissue and impairs fat oxidation in skeletal muscle in the postabsorptive
      state. In the postprandial, state the investigators hypothesize that IL-6 receptor blockade
      reduces the insulin-induced uptake and deposition of fat by adipose tissue and skeletal
      muscle, therefore contributing to ectopic fat deposition in the liver.

      In this study 12 lean and 12 obese male participants will be included. The participants will
      attend one screening visit and two study visits. The IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab will
      be infused on study visit 1.

      Isotope dilution techniques, blood flow measurements, arterio-venous differences across
      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, fat and skeletal muscle biopsies will be used to assess
      lipid, glucose and protein kinetics on a whole-body as well as fat and skeletal muscle level
      in the fasting state and after the ingestion of a liquid mixed-meal. Respiratory exchange
      ratio will be measured by indirect calorimetry.
