      a prostatectomy due to significant PCa on biopsy are elibible for this study approved by the
      Ethics Committee. Targeted biopsies of the index lesion are performed by using an
      ultrasound-MRI image fusion system with Organ based Tracking (OBT)-registration (Trinity*,
      KOELIS, France) to provide quality control. Targeted cores are analyzed intraoperatively with
      an extemporaneoux analyses. If positive, a targeted focal microwave ablation is achieved
      during the same session by a single 18G needle inserted transrectally Under sedation.
      Predictive ablation charts obtained with the 2.45 GHZ frequency microwave generator (TATO,
      Biomedical Srl, Italy) through ex vivo experiments were used to choose the duration and power
      of the treatment.

      Treated patients are followed-up for 4 to 6 weeks and the planned radical prostatectomy is
      performed. All treated patients complete uroflowmetry test and questionnaires (IPSS,
      IPSS-QQL, IIEF-5, and MSHW-EJD-SF) befor, at 7 days and 1 month after the procedure. A mpMRI
      of the treated prostate is performed at 7 days after the ablation to identify the
      devascularized area, but also to verify that no organ at risk is affected by the microweve
      treatment. After radical prostatectomy, whole-mount histology serves to define the ablation
      boundaries and dimension in the prostate. It also allows to determine the impact of the use
      of microwaves on cancerous tissue. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled.
