    
      This study in patients with ovarian cancer refractory to platinum based chemotherapy is
      designed as a randomized, 2-schedule and dose-level, open-label, multicenter phase II study
      to select the better dose and schedule arm for further investigation.

      72 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral SU11248 therapy either 37.5
      mg/day continuously or 50mg/day for 4 weeks followed by 14 days off.

      Patients will get outpatients treatment. At screening the patients' eligibility will be
      assessed, their baseline and demographic characteristics obtained, and the baseline values
      for the effect variables collected. Patients with measurable lesions as well as
      non-measurable disease will be included into this trial. Measurable lesion will be documented
      by CT or MRI scan and CA-125 values, non-measurable lesions will be monitored by analysis of
      CA°125 levels.

      The patients' safety will be monitored during and up to 30 days after termination of SU11248
      therapy.

      In patients with measurable lesions at baseline, the (post)-treatment values for effect
      according to the RECIST criteria will be collected as shown in table 6. In case of CR or PR,
      a confirmatory CT or MRI scan is required after an interval of at least four weeks. Antitumor
      effects according to CA°125 levels will be determined in the same time intervals and, in
      addition, 28 days after last SU11248 application in patients with CA°125 response according
      to GCIG guidelines during therapy.

      For post study follow-up, patients and/or their physicians will be contacted via phone for
      overall survival and TTP (including the method of diagnosis and additional treatment) every 2
      months for their life time.
