      Extremities) and by treatment volume (low volume, high volume) for a total of 10 strata. This
      study will be done in two phases. In the first phase, feasibility will be established using
      the primary objectives set below. The second phase will begin no earlier than 90 days after
      the last patient in the initial phase has completed treatment in each strata and once
      feasibility has been verified. The secondary objectives will serve as the objectives for the
      second phase of the study.
