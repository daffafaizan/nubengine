      sample for complete blood count, CBC) to determine the etiology of the anemia (eg,
      myelodysplastic syndrome). Peripheral smears; iron studies; serum creatinine; serum
      erythropoietin; reticulocyte count; vitamin B12; and folate levels may be obtained/conducted.
      When no etiology is identified (ie, "unexplained anemia"), additional laboratory tests will
      be performed which will include some or all of urinary hepcidin levels; plasma cytokine
      levels; serum soluble transferrin receptor; C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate; D-Dimer; neopterin level; tryptophan level; and blood for a cytokine profile that may
      include IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and VEGF levels. Serum; plasma; and nucleated peripheral blood
      cells may be banked for future DNA and other analyses. In a subset of those found to have
      either unexplained anemia (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) or anemia of chronic inflammation
      (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) , bone marrow aspirate and biopsies may be performed for a
      planned analysis of erythroid progenitor and stem cells in these populations. In addition,
      plasma and serum and bone marrow samples will be obtained from elderly non-anemic controls
      (approximately 6 to 30 subjects), and bone marrow samples will be purchased for non-anemic
      young controls (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) .
