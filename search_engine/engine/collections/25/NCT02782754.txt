      However, late sequelae are unavoidable especially with craniospinal irradiation, and various
      efforts have been done to reduce the dose and extent of radiotherapy. In this study,
      chemotherapy and further reduced dose of radiotherapy will be used to minimize the late
      sequelae in the patients with intracranial germinoma.
