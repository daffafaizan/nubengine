      in the US and around the world. Over the last 20 years, catheter based AF ablation has been
      widely adopted. However, long-term success rates fhave been reported to be as low as 50% and
      20% for paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. To achieve permanent arrhythmia
      suppression, repeated ablation procedures are often needed. Prior work indicates that distal
      connections between coronary sinus musculature and the left atrium provide a substrate for
      single or multiple reentry beats as a trigger for atrial fibrillation. In this prospective
      randomized trial the investigators will define the efficacy of elimination of distal
      connections between coronary sinus and left atrial musculature for suppression of recurrent
      atrial arrhythmias. Patients will be randomly assigned to standard of care ablation
      (pulmonary vein isolation and non pulmonary vein trigger ablations) alone, or standard of
      care ablation augmented by distal coronary sinus to left atrial connection elimination.
