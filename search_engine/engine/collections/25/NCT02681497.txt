    
      This retrospective study will use data from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based database
      (Web based Diabetes Records (Web DR) researchable database), which has been used to study
      patient's socioeconomic characteristics, treatment patterns and health outcomes of patients
      with diabetes. The Web DR de-identified researchable database contains integrated
      demographic, clinical and laboratory test result data of patients who received care from
      outpatient diabetes clinics in London, Ontario. The database includes more than 16,000
      patients and their clinic visit information since 2000.

      Adult individuals (age>=18) with type 2 diabetes receiving , registered in Web DR who have
      been treated with canagliflozin in conjunction with insulin therapy will be selected for this
      study. The baseline period will be 6 months to allow for more complete observation of
      comorbidities and medication use patterns.

      The main objective of this project is to assess the characteristics and health outcomes of
      patients with type 2 diabetes treated with canagliflozin when used in addition to insulin
      therapy.

      HbA1c, lipid, blood pressure, weight and other clinical indicators will be gathered from lab
      results during the baseline period closest to the date of canagliflozin prescription and
      follow up period (the last clinical value within the follow-up period and >=30 days after the
      start of the medication data will be selected.

      The type of insulin used and dosages prescribed during the study follow-up period will be
      extracted from the database to examine the insulin dosage prescription pattern and understand
      the use of insulin with canagliflozin and its impact on clinical outcomes.

      Furthermore, use of oral antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, sulfonylureas,
      thiazolidinedione, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)
      inhibitors, bromocriptine) and injectable antihyperglycemic therapies (pramlintide,
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists) will be measured during the 6 months
      baseline period and the follow-up period of 3 and 6 months.
