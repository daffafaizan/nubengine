      community living is key to measuring the success of any physical therapy program. The
      essential tasks needed to allow independent community living have been well documented in the
      elderly population. However, these tasks have not been delineated in the pediatric
      population. The investigators aim to determine if selected sequence training using the
      Balance Master, added to established physical therapy treatment programs, will increase gait
      velocity of ambulatory children receiving in-or outpatient rehabilitation in relation to
      their ability to cross an intersection within the confines of community traffic signal (>120
      cm/sec). One essential task that is necessary in the urban environment is to have the ability
      to cross a street within the time constraint of a traffic signal. Walking speed becomes
      increasingly important for those living in urban settings, as the ability to cross the street
      safely is fundamental for achieving independence. One of the major criticisms of
      clinic/lab-based measures of gait speed is that relative performance may not be
      representative of independence within the community. Participants aged 5 to 21 years, will be
      recruited from the patient population at Blythedale Children's Hospital for a six week trial.
      Children will be assigned to one of two random groups: one weekly Balance Master sequence
      training group (in addition to their regularly scheduled therapy sessions) and a group that
      continue regularly scheduled therapy sessions alone. Gait velocity will be measured by "Walk
      Across" Functional Assessment using Balance Master long force plate.
