        4. Treatment D: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 2, fasted

        5. Treatment E: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 2, fed

        6. Treatment F: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 3, fasted

        7. Treatment G: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 4, fasted
