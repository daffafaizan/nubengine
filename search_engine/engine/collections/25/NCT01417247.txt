      disease, included central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Basic
      studies suggested that sympathetic nerves over activity played an important role in the
      development and perpetuation of metabolic syndrome. Clinical therapies occurred by
      complication treatment and therapeutic life-style changes. Present study of renal ablation
      for sympathetic modification shows a new method to decrease sympathetic nerves activity. We
      assume that modifying renal sympathetic activity by ablation is effective and safe in
      treatment of metabolic syndrome. This trial is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group
      VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will
      receive additional necessary medications besides expectant intervention, and patients in
      control group will receive appropriate medications only. We aim to observe the incident of
      composite cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOLÂ®
      catheter in patients with hypertension, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.
