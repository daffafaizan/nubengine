      marked Device) versus Standard treatment in women with twin pregnancy. The study is in two
      phases - a SCREENING phase, in which women with a short cervix (cervical length of ( less or
      equal to 35mm) will be identified, and a TREATMENT phase, in which women with a short cervix
      will be randomised to treatment with Arabin pessary or Standard treatment. Women will be seen
      in the antenatal clinic setting.

      An internal pilot phase will take place, with ten interviews being conducted with pregnant
      women to explore the acceptability of proposed methods of recruitment, their information
      requirements, their views of the consent and randomisation processes, and the delivery of the
      intervention, including the screening component. The interviews will also explore their
      understanding and expectations of trial participation. The findings of this pilot phase will
      feed into the next phase of the trial and support the design of the interview guides for the
      main nested qualitative study.

      This pilot phase is separate from the main study. Later on we will ask both women and
      healthcare professionals about their experiences of the study, via questionnaires and
      face-to-face interviews.
