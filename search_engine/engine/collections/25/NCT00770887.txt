      in attempting subcutaneous self administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.
      Candidates will be taught self administration by a clinic assistant at Planned Parenthood of
      Southwest and Central Florida. Patients who are able to correctly self administer the
      medication and wish to attempt to continue home self administration, will be provided the
      supplies and educational materials to do so. Continuation rates and satisfaction with this
      method will be assessed using preaddressed surveys that patients will return with the above
      information.
