    
      Women using a combined oral contraceptive (COC) and who have decided to stop it or switch it
      to a non-estrogenic contraceptive are included. At baseline, before the COC is stopped, and
      at multiple time points during the 3 months of follow-up, blood will be drawn to evaluate the
      hemostatic profile. Findings are compared with a control group of women without an estrogenic
      contraceptive, who are also followed for 3 months.
