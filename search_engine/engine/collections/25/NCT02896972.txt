      for irreversible visual dysfunction, and mostly requires immediate surgical intervention. The
      aim of they study is to evaluate efficacy of vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting
      membrane (ILM) flap technique for MHRD in highly myopic eyes, and to demonstrate
      postoperative clinical course of MHRD after inverted ILM flap technique using swept-source
      optical coherence tomography.
