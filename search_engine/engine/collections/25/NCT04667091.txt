      the pain related to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. The management of Patellofemoral Pain
      Syndrome includes a segmental treatment, giving special focus to the lateral rotators and
      abductors of the hip especially Gluteus Medius muscle, rather than treating the
      Patellofemoral Joint itself. It will help in improving the pain of the subjects suffering
      from this syndrome effectively, and within a shorter duration of time. It will also provide
      the practicing physiotherapist with an insight for treating such patients with better
      outcomes. Myofascial Trigger Points of the Gluteus Medius are important contributing factors
      in the management of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome which is identified in a single study as
      per author's knowledge. But the treatment used to release the trigger point of Gluteus Medius
      in managing this syndrome has not yet been explored. So, this study will compare two
      well-known treatments in comprehending which one of the two techniques have better effects on
      the population to be studied. Written consent will be taken from all the study participants.
      Simple randomization technique will be used through "Randomization Main" software and
      randomization sheet will be generated. 60 participants with patellofemoral pain syndrome
      having Gluteus Medius trigger point will be randomly allocated in two equal group.
