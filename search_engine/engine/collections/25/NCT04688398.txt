      compared to a DPA-free marine oil in improving the clinical signs and symptoms associated
      with rheumatoid arthritis through the score calculated from the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease
      Activity Index (RADAI) questionnaire, in patients suffering from this disease.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of DPA-rich seal oil on:

        1. the degree of disease activity as measured by a joint examination performed by the
           doctor

        2. the patient's overall health, quality of life and level of fatigue

        3. blood biomarkers of inflammation (CRP: c-reactive protein, TNF-: tumor necrosis factor,
           IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17: interleukin);

        4. the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);

        5. the occurrence of side effects.

      To do so, the proposed study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-designed
      study involving 130 participants with a previous diagnosis of RA from three research and
      treatment centers in Quebec: the Centre de l'ostéoporose et de rhumatologie de Québec, the
      Clinique de rhumatologie/physiatrie du Centre du Québec and the Institut de rhumatologie de
      Montréal. Rheumatologists from each of the centers, as well as research nurses, will be
      involved in this project, which will be coordinated by a research professional from the
      Institut sur la nutrition et les aliments fonctionnels (INAF) at Université Laval. Half of
      the participants (n=65) will randomly receive the experimental treatment while the other half
      will receive the control treatment. In order to reach a minimum blood concentration of DPA
      for measurable effects, the experimental and control treatments will be administered over a
      12-week period.
