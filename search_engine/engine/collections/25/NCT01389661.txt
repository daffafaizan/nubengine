      autologous product, a balanced cost and the possibility of extending use to other
      pathologies.

      This protocol includes treatment of 10 patients with cystic disease of the jaws that meet all
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

      For autologous cell preparation a sample of spongy bone from the maxillary tuberosity and 20
      ml of serum are obtained from the patient in order to prepare the crosslinked protein matrix
      and the MSV-H cells. Cells are selected and expanded under GMP conditions according to the
      methodology used in previous trials (EudraCT 2005-005498-36, 2008-001191-68 and
      2009-0170450-11 ). MSV-H cells are obtained directly from biopsy culture jawbone of the
      patient by cultivation techniques "in vitro" and differentiate for 21 days once conveyed in
      the matrix with osteogenic differentiation medium of the following composition: DMEM, 10%
      FBS, 1% P / E, 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 50 mM ascorbate 2-phosphate, 10 mM phosphate ÃŸGlicerol.
      All differentiation factors have already been approved for clinical use. After the period of
      the product differentiation can be implanted to the patient.

      The bioimplant is used to refill the bone defects after osteotomy and maxillary cyst
      enucleation, with 5-10 million cells per unit of 2 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm thick. The
      cavity is closed with the mucoperiosteal flap and sutured with reabsorbable material. The end
      point of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and indications of treatment
      efficacy according to both clinical criteria and objective imaging confirming the volumetric
      bone regeneration and maintenance over time. For this purposes orthopantomography exploration
      will be performed before and 2 and 6 months after intervention.
