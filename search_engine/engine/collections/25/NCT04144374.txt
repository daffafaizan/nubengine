      infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants. The study will take place in an
      inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at
      Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers. All participants will receive 3 to 5 doses of
      omadacycline (200mg IV once daily on day 1, transitioned to 300 mg by mouth thereafter). A
      microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc., N. Chelmsford, MA) will be inserted into the
      subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the wound (patients) or in the thigh (healthy
      volunteers). The microdialysis probe is perfused with normal saline solution and samples are
      collected for the 24 hours following the final dose (i.e., 48-72 hours). A peripheral
      intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples
      simultaneously with microdialysis samples. Concentrations in tissue are compared with blood
      to determine percent penetration.
