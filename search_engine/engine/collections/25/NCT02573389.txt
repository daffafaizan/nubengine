    
      Prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting is to be offered to all patients deemed a candidate for
      a distal pancreatectomy. This is a nonrandomized cohort study with a retrospective and
      prospective control group (Jan 2008 - Dec 2017 or sample size obtained) and a prospective
      endoscopic intervention group (September 2015 - Dec 2017 or until sample size obtained). We
      will then compare the rate of development of a postoperative pancreatic fistula between those
      patients who have preoperative stenting and those who do not. POPF will be defined as the
      amylase level of drain contents equaling three times or more the serum amylase on
      postoperative day 3, as defined by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula
      (ISGPF) or an ICD-9 diagnosis of 577.8. The patient will have a pre-operative visit for stent
      placement and a post-operative visit for stent removal if still in place 4-6 weeks after
      distal pancreatectomy.
