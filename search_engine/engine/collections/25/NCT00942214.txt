      project; Pharmacogenomic aims to determine biomarkers related to treatment response, a step
      toward patient-tailored medicine. Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody has just received the
      EMEA approval for MS patients who do not respond to interferon treatment or who experience a
      severe disease course. Efficacy of the drug is outstanding with 37% of the patients
      completing the "disease free" definition after 2 years (7% in placebo group). On the other
      hand, natalizumab may be associated with severe adverse events such as progressive multifocal
      leucoencephalopathy and high costs. Overall, this emphasizes the need beyond current approval
      criteria to identify those patients with the best efficacy to safety ratio, a major public
      health issue.

      Scientific aims The primary scientific aim is to define biomarkers that would allow
      predicting long term response to natalizumab.

      Methodology; The investigators plan to conduct a 5 years study to search for the best
      predicting factors at the beginning of treatment and after 2 years. In this grant application
      the investigators will perform a multivariate analysis of clinical, MRI, and biological
      markers (neutralizing antibody, DNA, and mRNA expression) from baseline to 2 years. For
      feasibility reasons, long term follow up (5 years) and proteomics study will be performed in
      a second stage.
