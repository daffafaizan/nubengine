      given a minimum of 7 days to think about whether they would like to participate in the study.
      If they would like to participate, and informed consent form will need to be signed, after
      which the patients will undergo a screening to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. A 2
      week run-in period will take place to let patients get used to filling in an electronic daily
      diary. Prior to this period, patients will be asked to fill out several questionnaires. After
      this period, randomisation into either (1) the anal insert group or (2) the care as usual
      group. Group 1 will then have an 'accommodation' week in which they can try out two different
      sizes of the anal insert to see which size they would prefer for the treatment period. The
      treatment period will consist of 8 weeks In which the (1) anal insert group is expected to
      use the anal inserts and the (2) care as usual group is asked to continue with their
      treatment as usual. During the treatment period, patients will fill out an electronic daily
      diary as well as weekly questionnaires.At the end of the 8 week treatment period, patients
      will fill out additional questionnaires. The follow-up consists of 4 weeks, after which
      patients will be asked again to fill out several questionnaires.
