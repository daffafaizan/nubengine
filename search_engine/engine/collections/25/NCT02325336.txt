    
      The ADIM system (Aide a la Distribution Informatisee des Medicaments) consists of 2 machines
      with photographic reconnaissance and readers: one for preparation assistance that can be
      placed at the pharmacy or in the clinical service and one to assist the administration by the
      nurse in the clinical service.

      The system ADIM preparation consists of a working area with 2 reader devices (a RFID reader
      and a bar code reader) and a touch screen . It allows selection from the list of patients,
      the patient's prescription for which the preparation will be made. It is linked to the drug
      data base.

      The system ADIM administration is composed of a laptop with touch screen, 2 readers (a RFID
      reader and a barcode reader) , the elements needed to care and a work plan and drawers
      containing unit dose drugs for patients for a specific nurse. The nurse scans her/his badge,
      the patient's wristband and each dose administered and prepared by the pharmacy. If the dose
      is not prepared by the pharmacy, the nurse takes the dose in the automat cabinet. The nurse
      scans the drug's barcode or select on the touch screen the drug and the required dose of the
      drug. In case of discrepancy with the prescription, there is a visual alert. However, the
      alert can be override by the nurse if she/he gives a justification.
