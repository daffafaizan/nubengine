    
      Total of 88 subjects (44 per arm) at high risk for inadequate colon preparation will be
      randomized and undergo procedure either in the Control arm (standard of care) or with the
      Pure-Vu System.

      Subjects will be enrolled at up to 4 clinical sites in the United States.

      primary endpoint- A comparison between the two study arms (i.e., Pure-Vu vs. standard
      colonoscopy) of the rate of overall cleansing as well as cleansing per segment will be
      evaluated by the BBPS scoring index (Bowel preparation adequacy defined as BBPS >2 in each
      segment)

      The following secondary endpoints will be determined:

        1. Assess the willingness of consented subjects to pay for Pure-Vu prior to colonoscopy

        2. Colonoscopy procedural measures for Intervention and Control arms

        3. Endoscopists' experience

        4. Safety assessment for all subjects on the day of procedure per endoscopist

        5. Post-colonoscopy patient experience and safety check with scripted phone call 1-3 days
           after colonoscopy

        6. Assess the willingness of consented subjects to pay for the Pure-Vu System 1-3 days
           after colonoscopy

      Follow-up call will be conducted 1-3 business days after the procedure to verify that there
      has been no change in their clinical status and record their willingness to use the Pure-Vu
      System in the future.
