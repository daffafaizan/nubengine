      maintenance therapy (MMT) distribution sites in Thai Nguyen Province of Vietnam. Five commune
      health workers (CHW) and 15 MMT clients will be recruited from each of the CHC (total n = 30
      CHW and 90 MMT clients). The six CHC will be matched into pairs based on the current number
      of CHW and MMT patient load; and within each pair, the two CHC will be randomized into either
      a control condition or an intervention condition. The intervention contents will include the
      promotion of streamlined procedure, skill training, problem solving, knowledge acquisition,
      networking and support, and information sharing. The intervention will be delivered through a
      combination of service provider in-person training and mobile phone application utilization.
      Provider-level outcomes (e.g., CHW's MMT/HIV service provision) and client-level outcomes
      (e.g., treatment progress) will be measured at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.
