           the time of FNA to a single molecular test (GSC or ThyroSeq v.3). In the previous phase
           of the study, patients were randomized to the previous versions of a single molecular
           test (GEC or ThyroSeq v.2).

        2. During the FNA, a sample will be collected for the molecular test.

        3. If the cytology results are indeterminate (Bethesda categories 3 or 4), the molecular
           test will be reflexively sent off.

        4. We will help patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules to establish care with an
           endocrinologist, if they do not already have one. The physicians will make treatment
           recommendations using best practices and incorporating the results of the molecular
           test. We anticipate that most patients with a positive molecular test will undergo
           surgery, while the majority with a negative test will be surveiled.

        5. Patients who undergo surgery will have histopathologic evaluation of the thyroid, which
           will determine whether the index thyroid nodule was benign or malignant.

        6. Patients who do not undergo surgery will have a followup ultrasound at 6 and 12 months,
           or sooner at the discretion of the treating physician.

        7. We will assess thyroid-specific quality of life at baseline (following initial diagnosis
           of an indeterminate thyroid nodule) and during followup (at 6 and 12 months) using the
           short version of Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcome.
