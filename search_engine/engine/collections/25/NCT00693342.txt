      Primary

        -  To compare the progression-free survival of patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian
           tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in second or third complete clinical remission
           treated with a polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccine (GM2-KLH, Globo-H-KLH,
           Tn-MUC1-32mer-KLH, TF-KLH, and sTn-KLH) in combination with OPT-821 vs OPT-821 alone.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the incidence of toxicities in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To characterize the immune response (by ELISA) in a limited sampling of patients, in
           order to determine if the outcome correlates with antigen-specific immune titers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccine in combination with
           OPT-821 subcutaneously (SC) once in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 27, 39, 51, 63, 75, and 87.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive OPT-821 SC once in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 27, 39, 51, 63, 75,
           and 87.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are
      analyzed for antibody expression to antigens (i.e., Tn-MUC1-32mer, GM2, Globo-H, TF, sTN, and
      Tn) by ELISA. IgM and IgG titers are also measured.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
