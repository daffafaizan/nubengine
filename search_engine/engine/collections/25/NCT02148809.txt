      within 90 minutes or less. This is key to understanding the effect of hypotensive anesthesia
      on patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The drop in blood pressure enhances the
      dilutional effect of intravenous fluid given during the procedure. Increases in TBV could
      result in decreases of postoperative hemoglobin. Understanding the effect of hypotensive
      anesthesia on postoperative hemoglobin levels and TBV will enhance our understanding of
      postoperative blood management and transfusion triggers.
