    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen response in patients with androgen-independent
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with docetaxel, estramustine, and
           thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the survival duration in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of both docetaxel and thalidomide in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine whether any pharmacodynamic relationships exist between plasma concentrations
           of docetaxel and/or thalidomide and clinical activity or toxicity of this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the existence of and quantification of circulating prostate cancer cells in
           patients before and after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine genotype, with regard to cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphism, in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate genotype with pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the changes in molecular markers of angiogenesis (including, but not limited
           to, serum and urine vascular endothelial growth factor) in patients before and after
           treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16, oral thalidomide once
      daily on days 1-28, and oral estramustine three times daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-20
      months.
