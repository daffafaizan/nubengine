      will be randomly allocated to receive either ALGRX 4975 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Study drug
      or placebo will be injected into the intermetatarsal space containing a painful neuroma.
      Subjects will complete weekly assessments for the Average Foot Pain Severity, the 7
      Interference Items of the BPI, and the number of analgesic units taken. Some subjects may be
      followed by monthly telephone interviews to assess their level of pain over the six-month
      period following treatment.

      Plasma concentrations will be assessed pre-dose and post dose at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45
      min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 hours.

      Safety will be assessed at baseline and during the study with adverse events (all visits),
      vital signs (Visit 2 pre and post-injection and Visit 3 or at early termination), and
      laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) and ECG (Screening and Visit 3 or
      at early termination). The injection site will be examined and assessed by a 6-point scale
      for erythema, edema, and hemorrhage before the injection and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the
      injection. A pain on injection NRS will be assessed immediately post- injection at 15, 30,
      and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after study drug administration. A sensory
      examination of the foot will be performed before the injection and 4 hours after the
      injection and at the completion of the study. If a subject has injection pain, the foot may
      be wrapped in ice for up to 20 minutes, analgesic medication may be provided.
