      increasing alveolar ventilation by facilitating the coughing mechanism so that the secretions
      of the peripheral airways are mobilized into the central airways so that they can be removed
      by tracheal aspiration or cough. Thoracic compression consists of manually compressing the
      rib cage during expiration, in order to increase expiratory flow, mobilize and remove
      pulmonary secretions. A randomized crossover clinical trial was performed with 30 patients
      submitted to isolated compression or associated with ventilator hyperinflation, with a 6 hour
      interval. Patients were evaluated through compliance and resistance of the respiratory
      system.
