      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for cognitive decline and
      long-term cognitive dysfunction. To address this issue, a randomized controlled intervention
      trial on the effect of physical exercise on cognition is conducted. In addition, the impact
      on psychological and physical health outcomes such as depression, fatigue, health-related
      quality of life and physical fitness is evaluated. A healthy control group matched to the
      patients on age, gender, and education will be included to both control for practice effects
      on neuropsychological measures and allow additional comparisons on self-report measures. The
      healthy control group will undergo neuropsychological testing and questionnaire survey at
      baseline and 4 months. Demographic data will be collected from all study participants at
      baseline. Medical data will be collected from patients at all time points. Results may
      benefit patients who suffer from disease- or treatment-associated cognitive change.
