    
      Purpose and Description:

      The purpose of the study is to determine if gastrointestinal toxicity of an anti-rejection
      medication Myfortic速 (mycophenolic acid delayed release) is less than equivalent doses of a
      similar anti-rejection medication Cellcept速 (mycophenolate mofetil, MMF) in patients
      receiving their first or second kidney transplant from cadaver or living donors.

      This study consist of two randomized groups, 75 patients given 3 doses of Thymoglobullin
      (Group I) vs. 75 patients given 3 doses of Thymoglobulin and 2 doses of Basiliximab (Group
      II).

      Our standard maintenance protocol dosing of tacrolimus, IMPDH inhibitor (vide infra) and one
      week course of corticosteroids.

      Patients will be randomized to receive Myfortic速 1,440 mg/day vs. Cellcept速 2,000 mg/day,
      each in two divided doses (induced with either the IL-2 receptor inhibitors or
      thymoglobulin). Tacrolimus will be dosed to 12-hour trough levels of 8-10 ng/ml.
      Methylprednisolone is to be given as per our center protocols, weaning to dose levels of <0.1
      mg/kg by 3-6 months post-operatively.
