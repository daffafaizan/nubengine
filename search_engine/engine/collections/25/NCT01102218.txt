      and other ESAs (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent). Concerns with ESA use include a
      substantial number of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients with ESA-resistant anemia, and
      a growing body of evidence of potential negative effects of high doses of ESA use, including
      increased mortality and increased rate of tumor growth in cancer patients.

      There are only a couple of small studies in the literature examining the effects of
      pentoxifylline on anemia in patients with renal failure. The results are limited by the very
      small number of patients. There is clearly a need for a larger, prospective, clinical trial
      of pentoxifylline in ESRD patients, not limited to those with ESA-resistant anemia. This
      would be the first prospective, randomized clinical trial of this size to study
      pentoxifylline for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease.
