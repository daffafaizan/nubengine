      Investigators will first place cotton elastic bands around your chest and abdomen so that
      measures of chest wall and abdominal movements can be measured. Then, tests of your breathing
      made from pulmonary function testing will be completed.

      Investigators will then have you complete a maximum inspiration followed by a maximum
      expiration three times.

      Investigators will ask you to produce a voluntary cough three times into a facemask which is
      attached to a computer.

      Then the investigators will provide you with nebulized water (FOG) through the facemask for
      up to a minute three times. You will have a minute break in between each presentation.

      Finally, the investigators will provide you with a nebulized dose of Capsaicin, which is
      derived from hot peppers, through the same facemask used in all of the above tasks. You will
      receive three doses of capsaicin and be provided with water at any time during the study.
