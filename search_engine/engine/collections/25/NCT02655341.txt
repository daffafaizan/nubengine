    
      Gathered data:

        -  descriptive general demographic data;

        -  previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart
           failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting -
           CABG, known renal disease);

        -  cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal perimeter, body mass index,
           smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia);

        -  routine biological data;

        -  metabolic data (obtained from two body composition monitoring evaluations - before and
           12 hours after coronary intervention) - body water, body fat tissue;

        -  information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms);

        -  coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications,
           final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow);

        -  echocardiography at admission (LVEF);

        -  renal arteries angiographic details performed in the same time with PCI (two independent
           operators evaluate stenosis based on a predefined scale);

        -  renal diameters;

        -  measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs
           post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial);

        -  in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE.
