      weight of more than 20 kg. However, there is a great need for an Artequin formulation for
      smaller children unable to swallow tablets. The new Artequin Paediatric oral formulation is a
      flavoured, taste-masked preparation of granules of 50 mg artesunate and 125 mg mefloquine as
      a fixed-dose combination (once daily in one single Stickpack, i.e. 3 Stickpacks for a 3-day
      treatment). It is suitable for children with up to 20 kg body weight (with a range of 10-20
      kg).
