      prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in individuals with ASD suggested that
      targeting gut may benefit patients with ASD. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was
      reported to be a psychobiotic in several animal studies which modulated the levels of
      neurotransmitters in different brain areas. The current randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      was conducted to investigate the psychophysiological effects of PS128 in preschool children
      with ASD.
