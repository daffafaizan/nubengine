      Usual care or standard refers to those processes or services that the elderly claimant
      receives the IMSS services network, after the acute phase of their illness has been
      stabilized and is defined that can be discharged from the emergency department, following
      clinical and therapeutic recommendations for improving their health.

        -  Elders risk population for emergency

      The aging population brings a major change in health conditions and social conditions around
      the elderly, the analysis of the elderly population is considered according to functionality
      and risks of old age, when it comes to care services emergency, care becomes more critical as
      the elderly are older, have been identified adults of 70 and over as more vulnerable to
      health services, especially for the emergency services as they do not exhibit classic
      patterns to acute events of prevalent diseases.

        -  Functionality and dependence

      The commitment of the functionality in adults older than 65 may be present in 5% of cases,
      while in over 70 years this figure rises to 50% or more. Functional impairment may be a
      "marker" of the effect of systemic disease on the patient and is also an indicator of
      severity of disease because it measures the ability of independence

      The accumulation of normal aging characteristics define a threshold, which once pierced,
      tends to increase the propensity for loss of functional abilities due to aging. However, not
      everyone ages the same way, since factors such as inherited genetic capital, especially the
      accumulation of risks associated with lifestyle and work activities, and the opportunity to
      identify the disease in its period latency coupled with the accessibility and use of health
      services, can delay or exacerbate the loss of functionality and increase the dependency of
      the elderly.

        -  Quality of life of older

      Frailty in the elderly is a state of increased susceptibility due to less booking multiple
      physiological systems resulting in lower resilience, negative energy balance, sarcopenia,
      decreased strength and reduced exercise tolerance. Frailty is associated with adverse health
      outcomes such as institutionalization, falls, reduced performance status and increased
      mortality.
