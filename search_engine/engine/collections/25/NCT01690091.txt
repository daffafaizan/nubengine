    
      40 patients with HF and DM without previous diabetes treatment will be randomized into 2
      groups (A succession: MET-placebo, B succession: placebo-MET) - stratified randomization with
      following parameters weighted: HF etiology (ischemic /non-ischemic), diabetes duration,
      gender, BMI, age, NYHA, smoker/non-smoker). After 3 months the treatment will be switched.
      All participants will undergo standardized selection of metabolic and cardiovascular tests
      (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with indirect calorimetry, measurement of endothelial
      function, echocardiography, spiroergometry, proton/phosphor MR spectroscopy, adipose tissue
      biopsy, selected cytokines in plasma and adipose tissue at the beginning and the end of each
      intervention period (3 times in total).
