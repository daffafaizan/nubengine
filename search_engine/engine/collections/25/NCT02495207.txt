      mason trichrome for histological findings in which the study samples are patients who have
      bilateral impacted mandibular third molar to be extracted with bone removal. First we collect
      bone sample for mason trichrome with either method then we collect the second samples after
      removing most of the bones cover the impacted third molar for checking HSP70 levels. Then the
      bone samples are treated using a special protocol to eliminate the protein from bone samples
      for the Elisa analysis. The other bone samples are going to be studied under the microscope.
