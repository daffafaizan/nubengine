      remains unknown. No published studies have examined the effectiveness of a split evening
      (three times daily) injection regimen in this group of patients. Indeed, because the first
      few years of diabetes management are the easiest (due to a "honeymoon" period characterised
      by residual insulin secretion), the potential for any benefit from more intensive management
      (i.e., three daily injections) may be small during this period. In addition, the intensity of
      the initial insulin regimen may be an important determinant of quality of life, family
      functioning, and subsequent compliance with diabetes regimens. A randomized controlled trial
      has been designed to test the hypothesis that a split evening injection regimen leads to
      better glycemic control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and
      adolescents with new onset diabetes.
