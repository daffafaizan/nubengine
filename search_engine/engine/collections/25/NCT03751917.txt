    
      Considering the clear therapeutic advantage associated with ATRA+ATO combination therapy and
      the more favorable and overall manageable safety profile compared to ATRA+chemotherapy, the
      benefits of the combination in the first-line indication do appear to overweigh the risks.

      However, no information regarding the actual adverse event (AE) incidence and the long-term
      toxicity of ATRA+ATO is available at present and therefore, as a postmarketing commitment,
      TEVA (the Company holding the Marketing Authorisation of TrisenoxÂ® (Arsenic trioxide)) is
      setting up a long-term safety cohort study of Trisenox in newly diagnosed low- to
      intermediate-risk APL patients retrospectively analyzing data from APL disease registries all
      around Europe.

      As a result, this observational study is part of the retrospective PASS Study (A
      Post-Authorisation Long-Term Retrospective Safety Cohort Study of Arsenic Trioxide in First
      Line Low-to Intermediate-Risk Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Patients) that will use data from
      multinational APL disease registries in Europe. The present study will focus on Italian
      patients.
