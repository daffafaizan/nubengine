      this heterogenous population there are individuals who are motivated for a very strict diet
      in order to reduce seizures.

      Among adults with epilepsy 75 - 80 % are diagnosed with focal epilepsy, while 20 - 25 % have
      generalized onset of seizures.

      We plan to include 92 patients with focal epilepsy diagnosis. Those are randomized into diet
      and control groups.

      During the inclusion period we also treat patients with generalized epilepsy that qualify for
      participation, but these are not to be randomized, rather they will follow the diet group
      course. We assume 18 - 23 patients with generalized epilepsy will be included in the project.
