    
      Clostridium Difficile infection or C. Diff (CDI) is an infection that causes severe diarrhea.
      Risk factors for this infection include hospitalization, the use of antibiotics, along with
      medications that decrease the acid in the stomach. This infection leads to a disease which is
      difficult to treat and can cause serious complications including death in rare cases. This
      infection also increases medical costs by prolonging hospital stays.

      Metronidazole (known by the brand name Flagyl) is an antibiotic that has been available for
      decades and has been used to treat this disease. Flagyl is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of C. diff infection. Recent research by the investigators
      group has shown that hospitalized patients who took Flagyl had a decreased chance of getting
      C. Diff infection. However, high quality studies are needed to better evaluate whether the
      investigators can prevent C. Diff infection in high risk patients with the use of Flagyl.

      The purpose of this study is to assess if metronidazole prophylaxis is effective in
      decreasing the incidence of hospital induced Clostridium Difficile diarrhea among inpatients
      at high risk for this infection.

      High risk patient population are as defined below: taking a broad spectrum antibiotics
      (piperacillin/tazobactam-Zosyn; Ciprofloxacin).
