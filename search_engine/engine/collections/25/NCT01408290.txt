        -  To assess immunogenicity of one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection of four FLUVAL
           AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.5μgHA, 6μgHA, 9μgHA or 15μgHA
           of seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens, as measured by haemagglutination
           inhibition (HI) test 21 days after vaccination in compliance with the requirements of
           the current European Union recommendations as determined in CPMP/BWP/214/96.

        -  To determine dose-effect relationship between one 0.5 mL IM injection of four FLUVAL
           AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.5μgHA, 6μgHA, 9μgHA or 15μgHA
           of seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens and immune response provoked 21 days
           after vaccination in terms of pre- and postimmunization HA titers as measured by HI
           test.

      Secondary immunogenicity objectives

        -  To assess immunogenicity of one 0.5 mL IM injection of four FLUVAL AB-like trivalent
           influenza vaccines containing either 3.5μgHA, 6μgHA, 9μgHA or 15μgHA of seasonal A/H1N1,
           A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens, as measured by HI test 14 days after vaccination in
           compliance with the requirements of the current European Union recommendations as
           determined in CPMP/BWP/214/96.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of
           post-immunization HA titers as measured by HI test 21 days after vaccination.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of
           post-immunization HA titers as measured by HI test 14 days after vaccination.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of the
           percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in antibody
           titer at day 21 after vaccination.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of the
           percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in antibody
           titer at day 14 after vaccination.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of Day
           21/Day 0 geometric mean titer ratios (GMTRs) as determined by HI.

        -  To find the highest dose of FLUVAL AB-like trivalent influenza vaccine among 3.5μgHA,
           6μgHA and 9μgHA the response of which differs from that of dose 15μgHA in terms of Day
           14/Day 0 geometric mean titer ratios (GMTRs) as determined by HI.

      Safety and tolerability objective

        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of one 0.5 mL IM injection of four FLUVAL
           AB-like trivalent influenza vaccines containing either 3.5μgHA, 6μgHA,9μgHA or 15μgHA of
           seasonal A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B influenza antigens.
