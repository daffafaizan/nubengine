      Ultrasound (CEUS)) in distinguishing ICU patients who exhibit increases in GFR in response to
      fluid loading, from those for whom fluid loading is without benefit of directly harmful.

      Patients available for inclusion will receive a baseline administration of Tc-99-DTPA for
      precise determination of GFR/renal function by blood and urine samples.

      Baseline values of ultrasound measures will be obtained, including renal arterial, renal
      venous, portal venous and hepatic venous Doppler measures and renal contrast enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) will also be recorded.

      After two hours, baseline values of GFR are finished. The patient is then exposed to passive
      leg raising and ultrasound measures are repeated, including renal arterial, renal venous,
      portal venous and hepatic venous Doppler measures.

      The participant then receives a standardised fluid bolus of 7 ml/kg (ideal body weight) Once
      the fluid bolus administration is complete, renal ultrasound is repeated, including renal
      arterial, renal venous, portal venous, hepatic venous Doppler measures and renal CEUS.

      Follow-up determination of GFR/renal function based on Tc-99-DTPA after fluid therapy is
      repeated with blood and urine samples.
