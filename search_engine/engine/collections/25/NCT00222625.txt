      stroke. Approximately 40% of patients die within 1 month of ICH onset, and two-thirds of
      survivors never regain functional independence. Though guidelines for supportive care exist,
      there is currently no treatment that has been shown in a randomized-controlled trial to
      definitely improve outcome after ICH. Hematoma volume is a critical determinant of mortality
      and functional outcome after ICH, and early hematoma growth may be an important cause of
      early neurological deterioration.

      Considerable clinical interest has been given to the relationship between antiplatelet and
      antithrombotic treatment and ICH.

      The reported incidence of major bleeding events in patients undergoing antithrombotic
      treatment is 5-11/1,000 patients/year, while the overall range of hemorrhages is about
      62/1,000 patients/year.In the patients treated with antithrombotic drugs (oral anticoagulants
      or antiplatelets agent) the incidence rate of ICH has been shown higher than in the general
      population. Moreover, the mortality rate for both spontaneous and post-traumatic events is
      higher in antithrombotic treated patients than in controls. [14,15] rFVIIa has been
      successfully used to control ICH in patients with hemophilia or other coagulation disorders,
      and can arrest intraoperative bleeding and reverse coagulopathies in patients undergoing
      neurosurgical procedures.[19] rFVIIa has also been reported to prevent or minimize refractory
      bleeding in non-coagulopathic patients.
