    
      The primary objective (Aim I) of this study is to evaluate whether the RFM Gait System can
      restore the capability to perform the components of gait required for safe, functional
      walking, for patients in the chronic phase after stroke (> 12 months). We will assess the
      treatment provided by the RFM system at the Cleveland VA compared to the FNS percutaneous
      Schreiner electrodes and custom-designed controller previously investigated by the
      investigators.

      The similarities between the RFM-based and percutaneous FNS systems will be assessed using
      six gait components required for the execution of functional, safe gait, which are lower limb
      strength, coordination, an index of walking endurance, muscle tone, walking speed, and
      quality of life.

      The secondary objective of this study is to test the technological performance and safety of
      the RFM Gait System. Measures of technology performance and safety include implantation time;
      anchoring capability at the motor point of the muscle; reliability of the RFMs during use;
      reliability of electrical performance of the system; comfort of the system (with stimulation
      off); comfort of the electrical stimulus.
