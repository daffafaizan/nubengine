      inspection of all colon segments is the basis of colonoscopy quality control, and furthermore
      improves the detection rates of small adenomas. Recently, deep learning algorithm based on
      central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential in computer-aided detection and
      computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. However, there is still a blank in
      recognition of anatomic sites, which restricts the realization of AI-aided lesions detection
      and disease severity scoring. This study aim to train an algorithm to recognize key colonic
      segments, and testify the accuracy of each segments recognition as compared to endoscopic
      physicians.
