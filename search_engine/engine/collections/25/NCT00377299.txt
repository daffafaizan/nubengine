      completing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent process. Baseline
      evaluation will include a medical and psychiatric history, structured clinical interview for
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) (SCID), mood assessment with the Inventory of
      Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-C), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and cognitive
      assessment with the Hopkins Auditory Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) (similar to the Rey Auditory
      Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) but more alternative equivalent versions are available), Stroop
      and computer assessments including Sternberg Memory Task and the Running Memory Continuous
      Performance Test. Alternate but equivalent versions of all cognitive tests, except the
      Stroop, will be used to minimize practice effects with repeated administration. Days and
      amounts of amphetamine and other substance use will be assessed at each visit with urine drug
      screens, and through self-report using the timeline follow-back method. Amphetamine, and
      other drug, craving will be assessed with a visual analogue scales. Citicoline or placebo
      add-on therapy will be given beginning at one tablet (500mg)/day with an increase to two
      tablets 1000 mg/day at week 2, three tables 1500 mg/day at week 4 and four tablets 2000
      mg/day at week 6.
