      I. To evaluate a novel clinical assay (MDSC clinical assay) to detect cancer associated
      immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients as a means to better detect and monitor
      malignant bladder cancer in patients.

      II. Estimate mean MDSC level, intra-patient variability, and inter-patient variability, for 3
      groups of subjects with variable bladder cancer disease status at baseline.

      III. In patients with known localized, muscle-invasive bladder cancer who undergo surgical
      treatment: to determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after treatment including
      surgery.

      IV. In patients with known metastatic bladder cancer who undergo systemic treatment: to
      determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after 4 cycles of treatment compared to
      the change in tumor burden as evaluated by radiographic imaging.

      V. In patients with no history of cancer: to determine the changes in MDSC levels from
      baseline to after 4 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare MDSC level measurements to urine cytology analysis at baseline and after treatment
      to determine whether the two tests correlate in any of the 3 groups of patients defined in
      this study.

      OUTLINE:

      GROUP I: Patients without cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for analysis
      via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and 4 months.

      GROUP II: Patients with localized bladder cancer undergo collection of blood and urine
      samples for analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after
      cystectomy.

      GROUP III: Patients with metastatic cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for
      analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after completion of
      4 courses of systemic chemotherapy.
