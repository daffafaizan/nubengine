      indicated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and likely will further receive invasive
      coronary angiogram will be recruited for a SPECT MBF study. The MBF study will be performed
      as an adjunct to MPI utilizing the same rest and stress injections of 99mTc-Sestamibi (MIBI)
      tracer, and the same infusion of dipyridamole, adenosine or adenosine triphosphate for
      stressing. The MBF study will be completed in single or two days depending on the imaging
      protocol of MPI for a site. This is an observational study with no interventions to the
      clinical routine whatsoever. Three models of SPECT (GE NM530c) and SPECT/CT (Siemens
      Symbia-T16 and -T2) cameras are included to acquire rest/stress dynamic SPECT and MPI data. A
      CT scan will be acquired for the purpose of attenuation correction. All dynamic images will
      be reconstructed with physical corrections, including attenuation, scatter, resolution
      recovery and noise reduction, and processed to quantify MBF with the same kinetic modeling.
      The imaging processing of MBF study will be conducted with a SPECT MBF dedicated software
      (MyoFlowQ) in a central lab. MPI images will be collected and independently read by three
      consensus readers. The angiographic result will be independently reviewed by an
      interventional cardiologist. Diagnostic performance of SPECT MBF and perfusion will be
      compared utilizing angiographic result as the reference standard.
