      administered as a single intravenous infusion every 21 days in adults with solid tumors not
      amenable to standard therapy. II. Describe the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of
      ET-743, and study the predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and
      dose-relationship of these toxic effects in these patients. III. Propose a safe dose for a
      phase II study based on the MTD determined on this study. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetics of
      ET-743 at different dose levels. V. Document any antitumor effects of ET-743 in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. All patients receive ET-743 IV over 3 hours every 21
      days for 4 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ET-743 until the maximum
      tolerated dose is determined. Patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
