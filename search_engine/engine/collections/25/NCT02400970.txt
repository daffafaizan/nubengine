      concern over the possible presence of malignant cells in testicular tissue that could cause a
      recurrence of the primary disease after reimplantation. Thus, the possibility of testicular
      tissue involvement needs to be evaluated with sensitive molecular methods.

      Based on our experience in detection by RT-PCR of minimal residual disease (MRD) in
      neuroblastoma since 1994 [Tchirkov et al. 2003] and in testicular tissue cryopreservation
      since 2012, we want to develop a specific and sensitive method for residual disease detection
      by RT-PCR in order to evaluate the tumor contamination of testicular harvested tissue.

      Study population: We chose 3 models of pediatric solid tumors with high risk of metastases
      and which often require sterilizing treatments (chemo and/or radiotherapy): neuroblastoma,
      Ewing tumor and alveolar rhabdosarcoma. We will use four tumor cells lines: IMR32 and SK-NSH
      for neuroblastoma; RD-ES for Ewing tumor; RH-30 for rhabdosarcoma. We plan to use 20
      fragments per line.

      Study duration: 12 months Study design: Testicular tissue without known malignancy but with a
      condition warranting a biopsy (fertility assessment) will be harvested.

      The harvested testicular cortex will be treated to recover all viable sperm and then, we use
      remaining tissue to be contaminated with tumor cells lines. Then, detection of the specific
      transcript will be done by RT-PCR in fresh tissue and after freeze/thaw. Total RNA will be
      extracted with the TRI-reagent and qRT-PCR will be performed using the "TaqMan" technology.

      Primary endpoint: to reach a sensitivity about 1/106 cells.
