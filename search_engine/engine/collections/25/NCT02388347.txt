      treatment assignment and sponsor will be unblinded to treatment assignment),
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety of single-ascending SC doses of MEDI7836 in
      healthy adult males subjects and healthy adult female subjects of non-childbearing potential.
      The study will be conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom (UK). Four dosing cohorts
      of MEDI7836 or placebo are planned for this study for a total of 32 subjects (24 subjects
      receiving MEDI7836, 8 subjects receiving placebo).
