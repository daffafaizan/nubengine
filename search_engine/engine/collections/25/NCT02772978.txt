      normally present in the brain. It may increase body movement and may also change a person's
      ability to process information. Tolcapone stops one's own naturally-released dopamine from
      being broken down as quickly. The investigators are interested in learning if tolcapone has
      positive effects on a person's decisions about rewards.
