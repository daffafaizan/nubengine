      the investigators aim to determine whether continuous veno-venous haemodialysis with an
      EMiC®2 filter leads to clearance of the following mediators Interleukin (IL) -1 alpha, IL-1
      beta, IL-2, IL- 4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Interferon gamma, Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
      epidermal growth factor.
