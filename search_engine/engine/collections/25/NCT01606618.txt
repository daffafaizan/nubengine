      the adult. The risk of developing a terminal renal insufficiency is eight times higher than
      the risk in the general population and twice as important as in acquired spinal cord injury.
      This risk continues to evolve with advancing age.

      One of the major stakes for these patients is the preservation of a regular follow-up of
      uro-nephrologicals risk factors and of a respect for the rules of self management of their
      neurological bladder. However, some studies report that nearly two thirds of these patients
      are not monitored at regular neuro-urological in the adulthood. Different psychosocial
      determinants were analyzed as potential markers of the impact of chronic diseases from
      childhood to adulthood and could account for the disparity of follow-up and access to
      healthcare. Among these, the self-esteem is a psychological dimension of analysis
      particularly relevant within the framework of chronic states inherited from the childhood.

      The investigators formulate the hypothesis that global self-esteem and lower perceived
      self-efficacy may be a causal predictive factor of a reduced access to the continence and a
      lower compliance monitoring in adult patients with a spina bifida.
