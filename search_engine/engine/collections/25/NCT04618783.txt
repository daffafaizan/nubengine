      the investigational sIPV in 600 healthy infants aged 2-months old. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the cross-neutralization capacity of the serum immuned by the investigational
      sIPV against 10 individual virus strains. Paired pre-immune and post-immune serum from 250
      participants of the phase 2 trial, with 50 in each group including the low-, medium- and
      high- dosage group, control wild poliovirus vaccine (wIPV) group and control sIPV group, was
      selected and sent to China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the
      cross-neutralization assay to determine the neutralizing antibody titer against 10 individual
      virus strains including Sabin strains (type 1, 2, and 3), Salk strains (Mahoney, MEF-1, and
      Saukett), cVDPV (type 1, 2, and 3) and Xinjiang wild strain of type 1(Xinjiang wIPV1).

      All the subjects in this study had been vaccinated at the schedule of month 0,1, and 2 in the
      phase 2 clinical trial.
