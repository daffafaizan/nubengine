      health issue during the last months, affecting mostly countries with a high metabolic risk,
      like Mexico. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of any kind of
      infection as well as an increased mortality risk. Hyperglycemia has been established as an
      important predictor of mortality in patients with T2D and SARS-CoV-2. The standard treatment
      of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients has been basen on insulin schemes, but recently
      evidence suggest the utility of some other drugs, reducing the risk of hypoglucemia and
      increasing the probability of a proper metabolic control. DPP4 enzyme has an ubiquitous
      distribution and has been considered as a pro-inflammatory enzyme, considering that DPP4
      inhibitors could have and anti-inflammatory effect, as it has been shown in different works.
      The goal os this study is to compare the utility of DPP4 inhibitor as a combination with
      insulin on metabolic control and prognosis in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and
      hyperglycemia. For this purpose we will randomize patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hyperglycemia
      to receive either the combination of DPP4i + insulin or insulin alone and will follow al
      algorithm treatment to define metabolic control as well as prognosis.
