    
      The effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed in terms aspects of body function,
      walking ability and endurance as well as level of activity in daily living and participation
      assessed at the end of intervention and at a 6 and 12 months follow-up.

      Intensive gait training with HAL is performed 1 session/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks and each
      session will not exceed 60 min of effective walking time with HAL. In addition, each session
      will include conventional gait training that will not exceed 30 min effective training time.
      To standardize the training procedure, training with HAL is performed on a treadmill and to
      enable body weight support. Body weight support is used to prevent falls and to unburden the
      weight of the suit (9 kg). The training program is performed by physiotherapists, trained in
      the HAL method and the study procedures. At the end of the 6 weeks, the physiotherapist that
      has been engaged in the patient's conventional training will perform 1-2 home visits to
      inform/educate the patient and those who are providing assistance to the patient in how the
      patient can make use of any gains in gait function during activities of daily living.

      The 1st control group will receive conventional gait training performed 1 session/day, 3
      days/week for 6 weeks that will not exceed 1h 30 min effective training time.

      The 2nd control group will not receive an intervention. The conventional gait training is
      performed according to current best evidence based practice and may include over ground
      walking with assistance and/or assistant devices as well as the use of a treadmill and body
      weight support and training of gait function in activities of daily living
