      CNTO 328. CNTO 328 is a new experimental drug. This study is trying to better understand the
      safety, the tolerability (side effects), and the distribution of the drug in the blood
      stream. The effects of CNTO 328 in patients with renal cell carcinoma are currently unknown.
      However, recent data has shown that treatment with another anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody
      reduces the symptoms of renal cell carcinoma.

      The study is divided in 3 parts. Part 1 is the phase I portion of the study and evaluated the
      safety of CNTO 328 in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Part 2 and 3 will
      evaluate efficacy and safety of the drug in this patient population.
