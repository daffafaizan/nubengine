      diabetes mellitus, its usefulness is limited by its toxicity. Since methotrexate (mtx) and
      cyclo synergistically inhibit other disease processes, we hypothesized that low dose cyclo
      and mtx therapy could safely induce remission.

      Research Design and Methods: In an open pilot study, insulin dose and glycemic control will
      be compared in children with new onset Type 1 diabetes administered cyclo at 7.5 mg/kg/day
      for 6 weeks and then 4 mg/kg/day and mtx 5 mg/kg/day for one year with control children.
      After 6 weeks, doses were adjusted to maintain blood cyclo levels to 100-200 ng/ml.
