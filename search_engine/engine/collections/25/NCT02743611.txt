    
      The goal of this study is to characterize the safety, feasibility, and clinical activity of
      BPX-701, a genetically modified autologous T cell product incorporating an HLA-A2-restricted
      PRAME-directed TCR and a rimiducid-inducible safety switch, when administered to subjects
      with relapsed AML, previously treated MDS, or metastatic uveal melanoma.

      The study will be comprised of multiple parts:

      Part 1 (Phase 1): Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-701 T cells
      (escalating doses from 1.25 x 10E6 cells/kg up to 5.0 x 10E6 cells/kg to be explored) Parts 2
      and 3 (Phase 2): Dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including BPX-701 T
      cell persistence and response to rimiducid as applicable), and clinical activity at the
      recommended dose identified in Part 1 During Parts 1, 2, or 3, rimiducid may be administered
      following BPX-701 T cell infusion in response to uncontrollable, treatment-emergent toxicity
