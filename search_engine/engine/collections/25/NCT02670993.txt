      essentially 65 years old and older patients. At this age, comorbidities are frequent and
      numerous, and often linked to pain. The prevalence is comprised between 40 and 85% according
      to different studies. Antalgic and psychotropic treatments have adverse effects in old
      people, and have to be used carefully. To improve the pain support and limit the drug
      consumption, it is possible to perform therapies without drugs. Among them, musical
      intervention represents an interesting complementary support, to deal with physical and moral
      pain in AD.

      The primary outcome is to evaluate the singing support on physical pain, by comparison with a
      control activity : "painting session".
