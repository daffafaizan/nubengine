      as the general population, and that is associated with significant distress and impairment.
      Previous research suggests that increased baseline activity of the amygdala and related
      neural circuits may serve as a mechanism for paranoid ideation. This exploratory study will
      use a paranoia induction procedure in healthy individuals who vary in pre-existing levels of
      paranoid ideation to test whether increases in self-reported paranoia are accompanied by
      increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased stimulus-driven neural activity in
      social processing networks, and increased behavioral perceptions of untrustworthiness.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to participate in a paranoia induction procedure or a
      control condition and will then complete neuroimaging and behavioral assessments.
