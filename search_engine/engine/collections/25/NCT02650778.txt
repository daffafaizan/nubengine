    
      Women with dense breasts (BIRADS 3 or 4) with a BIRADS category 1 or 2 mammogram are asked to
      participate in a automated volume breast ultrasound scanner. If the women agrees to
      participate and sign informed consent she undergoes an automated whole breast scan. The scan
      is interpreted independent of the mammogram. Scans are assigned a BIRADS category score of 1,
      2, 3,or 0. BIRADS category 3 lesions are reported as no evidence of malignancy and a 1 year
      follow-up is recommended. BIRADS category 0 lesions are requested to have a hand held
      ultrasound including elastography. Follow up is then determined by BIRADS score and
      elastography results of hand held ultrasound.

      The study evaluates prospectively the changes in recall rate, positive biopsy rate, cancer
      detection rate when BIRADS category 3 lesions are given a 1 year follow-up recommendation.
