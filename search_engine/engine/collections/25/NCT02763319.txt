    
      This is a randomised, two-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II/III efficacy and safety study
      of Tafasitamab in combination with BEN versus RTX in combination with BEN given to adult
      patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to at least one but no more than three
      prior systemic therapies and have failed, or are not candidates for HDC and ASCT, and have
      thus exhausted their therapeutic options of demonstrated clinical benefit. At least one prior
      therapy line must have included a CD20-targeted therapy.
