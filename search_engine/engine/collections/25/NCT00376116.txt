      events in heart failure patients. A selection of these predictors primarily composes the
      "Heart Failure Monitor" (HFM), which is implemented in Biotronik implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators (ICDs) capable of delivering cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) as well
      as in CRT-pacemakers. HFM and other parameters are transmitted to the attending physician via
      Home Monitoring (HM) function integrated in the implanted devices. In the future, a HFM with
      high predictive power may play an important role as part of a strategy of delivering
      effective health care for heart failure patients with an indication for CRT.

      Our included patients implanted with CRT devices STRATOS LV-T (CRT-pacemaker), KRONOS LV-T,
      or Lumax HF-T (CRT-ICD). Pre-discharge protocol comprised standard device follow-up,
      activation of the HM-function, and assessment of complications and cardiovascular events. At
      follow-up controls 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation, standard device follow-up
      was performed and complications and cardiovascular events were assessed.

      At enrollment, 6 and 12 months postoperative and in case of a rehospitalisation, the
      following parameters are documented:

        -  Echocardiographic parameters

        -  Quality of Life (Minnesota)

        -  ECG-parameters, NYHA-classification

        -  Blood pressure, body weight

        -  BNP / NT-pro BNP (optional)

        -  6 minute walk test (optional)

      At 1, 3 and 9 months postoperative:

        -  ECG-parameters, NYHA-classification

        -  Blood pressure, body weight

        -  BNP / NT-pro BNP (optional)

        -  6 minute walk test (optional)

      Further documentation:

        -  Change of drug treatment

        -  Any cardiovascular event and therapeutic intervention

        -  Heart failure related symptoms by means of patient diary
