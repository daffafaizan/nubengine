      as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment on clinical and biochemical parameters of
      patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

      Methods: A total of 72 stage II and Stage III periodontitis patients were included in the
      study. The systemically healthy patients which were between the ages of 19 and 58 were
      treated non-surgically. At the end of each visit concerning periodontal treatment, the pocket
      of each tooth was irrigated with a sterile plastic syringe (10 mL per quadrant) with a blunt
      tip containing ozonated water (OW; ozone groups), 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX
      groups) or saline (C; control groups) for 30-60 s. Periodontal clinical parameters, gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth
      factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were evaluated at baseline and 8 weeks after periodontal treatment.
      All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software.
