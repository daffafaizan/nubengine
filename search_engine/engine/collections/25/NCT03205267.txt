    
      Objectives:

      The objective of the BODO trial is to assess the tolerability and efficacy of a step-in
      dosing concept of the dual SRC-ABL kinase inhibitor Bosutinib in CP-CML patients who either
      developed intolerance or treatment failure to previous Imatinib, Dasatinib or Nilotinib as
      1st line therapy.

      Primary endpoint:

      â€¢ Rate of GI-Toxicity (i.e. incidence and severity of grade 2 to 4 toxicities) within the
      first 6 months of treatment

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Tolerability (i.e. all grade, grade 2 to 4 and grade 3 and 4 toxicities) at month 6, 12
           and 24

        -  Efficacy parameters: CCyR, MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 rate at month 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24

        -  Patient-reported outcome measures (QoL)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  The rate of emerging mutations during Bosutinib treatment

      Exploratory endpoints linked to substudies:

      Vascular biology substudy:

        -  Effects of previous therapy on the baseline vascular risk profile (i.e. Nilotinib- vs.
           Dasatinib-pre-treatment)

        -  Biological and clinical surrogates for vascular alterations during Bosutinib therapy at
           baseline, months 6, 12, and 24

      Pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and immunology sub- study:

        -  Correlation of PK with response and toxicity

        -  Correlation of PK with PD (i.e. phosphoproteomic changes) in immune cell populations

        -  Correlation of PD changes in immune cell populations with response

        -  Evaluation of the effects of Bosutinib on frequency and phenotype of immune cells

        -  Evaluation whether Bosutinib-induced changes of immune cells correlate to response

      Ultra-deep next-generation sequencing (UD-NGS) and telomere substudy:

        -  Documentation of subclone evolution or elimination during Bosutinib treatment

        -  Evaluation of telomere length in leukemic and non-leukemic cells as a prognostic
           indicator for depth and kinetics of response to and tolerability of Bosutinib
