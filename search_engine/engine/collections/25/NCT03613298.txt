    
      20 Subjects with deep invasive endometriosis (DIE) will receive the HIFU treatment with Focal
      One® device.

      Subjects harboring an isolated recto-sigmoid DIE lesion with a persistence of symptoms
      despite hormonal treatment will be installed on the Focal One® device to:

        -  Evaluate its ability to locate and assess the volume of the endometriosic lesion

        -  Treat the targeted lesion by HIFU energy application. Real-time guided ultrasonography
           will be used to determine the location of the endometriosic nodule. Succession of HIFU
           exposure will be then used to treat maximum lesion volume, excluding a security margin
           of 3 mm with the digestive mucosae to prevent risk of fistulae.

      Patients will fill-out questionnaires on gynecological and intestinal symptoms and on quality
      of life before treatment and at 1 and 6 months after HIFU procedure. Imaging follow-up scans
      will be organized at 1 and 6 months and by a pelvic MRI scan at 3/6 months.
