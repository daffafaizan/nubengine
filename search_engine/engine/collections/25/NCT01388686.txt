      disease in ICUs. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic administration are part of the
      SSC Resuscitation Bundle and essential for the outcome of the patient. The CDC criteria to
      diagnose sepsis do not take into account the overall number of blood cultures obtained and
      thus, lead to an underestimation of the true incidence of sepsis. Up to now, few data is
      available on the total number of blood cultures obtained and the relation to the incidence of
      sepsis in German ICUs.
