    
      STEMI patients with MVD (30% of total STEMI population) are - following successful primary
      angioplasty - randomized to either no additional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of
      other lesions or full revascularisation guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR).

      Eligible coronary arteries must be >2.0 mm in diameter and at the discretion of the operator
      suitable for PCI. Only arteries with angiographically stenoses > 50% can be randomized. All
      randomized lesions with diameter stenosis > 50% and < 90% are evaluated by FFR and a FFR
      value < 0.80 is considered significant and treated. Stenoses >90% are treated without prior
      FFR.

      Full revascularization is a priori obtained by means of PCI. If, however, PCI is considered
      inferior to coronary artery bypass grafting the latter option can be chosen.
