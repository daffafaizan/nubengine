      reserve is a prognostic factor supplemental.

      Its measure should influence the treatment and the follow up of the patients. The measurement
      of CRF by by one pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guide wire is a validated technique to
      evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve but it is an invasive technique.

      In this study, the investigators will compare this method with a non-invasive method:
      completely automated analysis and quantification of myocardial blood flow from DICOM files
      corresponding to stress and rest images was developed with a new camera CZT SPECT.
