    
      The present study will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Each nebulized
      solution [hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline
      (0,9%)] will be administrated during 4 days. After each inhalation, all patients will carry
      out a bronchial drainage session (autogenic drainage technique). All patients recruited will
      perform the three arms of intervention. In this way, each patient will be able to act as
      his/her own control.

      A 7 days washout period will be required among the different solutions to avoid carryover
      effects.

      During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged.
