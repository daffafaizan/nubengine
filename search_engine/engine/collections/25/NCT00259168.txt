      cardiovascular disease. IR is present in individuals with pre-diabetes/ type 2 diabetes.
      Epidemiological data demonstrate a tight relationship between postprandial blood sugar,
      insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endothelial dysfunction seems to be the
      very first sign of CVD.

      Purpose: We propose to determine whether attenuation /normalization of post-prandial
      hyperglycaemia, through the administration of an oral hypoglycaemic agent of ultra rapid
      action (nateglinide), ameliorates endothelial function in the IR.

      We extrapolate that a better endothelial function in the brachial artery reflects regression
      of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary system.

      Method and Study Design: Prospective, open, parallel, group comparison study of 1
      intervention group, 1 intervention control group and 1 disease control group. The
      intervention group and the intervention control group each consist of 30 individuals with IR.
      Individuals in the intervention group receive an individually adjusted dose of nateglinide 3
      times daily during 12 weeks. The third group consists of 10 healthy, young individuals. All
      groups are followed during 3 months with an otherwise unchanged lifestyle. Endothelial
      function is measured with the Flow Mediated Dilation method before and after the
      intervention/observation period.
