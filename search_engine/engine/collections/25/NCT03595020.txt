      to be placed in an uncomfortable or unnatural setting and foreign, noisy, dark, or
      claustrophobic environment (e.g., lying in a supine position in a narrow gantry with the head
      restrained during the entire examination), for accurate measurement during the procedure,
      with relatively lower temporal resolution. In contrast, a multi-channel fNIRS machine
      provides a completely non-invasive, quiet and mobile measurement of brain function in
      ordinary clinical settings and allows patients to be comfortably seated in a normal posture
      in a well-lit room, with higher temporal resolution making it possible to obtain a recording
      of the actual time course of a hemodynamic epoch in response to a specific cognitive task
      (e.g., facial emotion recognition task in our study) in a single trial. Additionally, due to
      the small operating and maintenance costs associated with NIRS, it is possible to run fNIRS
      study with a large sample of participants.
