      onset of T1D can vary among patients from long-standing diabetes triad symptoms (polyuria,
      polydipsia and weight loss) to coma and ketoacidosis. The initial clinical presentation of
      T1D was shown to have long-term influence on glycemic control of the patient. The
      investigators initiated a collaborative consortium including six pediatric clinics in Belgium
      to better characterize new-onset T1D patients.

      Hypothesis :

        1. Different subgroups of T1D patients might exist, underlying different physiopathology of
           T1D :

             -  The investigators will first investigate the presence of biomarkers in different
                fluids (e.g. urine, blood, feces,...).

             -  The investigators will correlate results with clinical parameters of glycemic
                control. Dynamic tests (HOMA and stimulated C peptide) will be realized at 2
                defined time points of the follow-up.

        2. Glucose variability can be influenced by external factors (e.g. diet, physical activity,
           Quality of Life (QoL),...) The investigators will evaluate those external factors using
           approved questionnaires. They will presented to the patient and its parents at 2 defined
           time points.
