    
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, international, multi-center, randomized
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with
      chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib
      versus an active comparator in treatment-na√Øve patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      ovarian cancer (Stage III or Stage IV). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival
      (PFS) as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment per RECIST
      v1.1.

      On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing Phase III
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 study. The alliance has notified health authorities and trial
      investigators of the decision to discontinue the trial. The decision was based on several
      emerging factors since the trial's initiation, including the previously announced interim
      results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010), which was stopped due to futility of
      efficacy at a planned interim analysis on 21 December 2018. The alliance determined that the
      degree of benefit observed with avelumab in frontline ovarian cancer in that study does not
      support continuation of the JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial in an unselected patient
      population and emphasizes the need to better understand the role of immunotherapy in ovarian
      cancer. Additional factors include the rapidly changing treatment landscape and the approval
      of a PARP inhibitor in the frontline maintenance setting. The decision to discontinue the
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial was not made for safety reasons.

      Patients who remain in the study will continue receiving investigational products according
      to their randomized treatment assignment and will be monitored for appropriate safety
      assessments until treatment discontinuation.
