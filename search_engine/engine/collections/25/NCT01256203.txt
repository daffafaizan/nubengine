      enrollment, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. Medical procedures
      including demographic information (age, sex, race, smoking and drinking habits),
      medical/surgical history, physical exam (including vital signs, body weight, height, and skin
      color), clinical laboratory testing, concomitant medication intake and other therapy uses
      will be collected. The study procedures will begin after the intravenous injection of
      porfimer sodium.

      Skin photobiological testing will consist of four 2-day periods performed over three months
      after the injection of porfimer sodium at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight. Each period will
      include a Skin Illumination session and a Skin Evaluation session. During the Skin
      Illumination session, the Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 will be randomly applied at a dose
      of 2 mg/cm² on a skin subunit area of the back 30 minutes before illumination. A second skin
      subunit will be used as a "no-treatment" observational area. Therefore, each subject will be
      her/his own control. Illumination will be performed using a visible light source. During the
      Skin Evaluation session, skin reactions will be scored by an outcome assessor 24 hours after
      illumination according to a pre-determined rating scale. The outcome assessor will be blinded
      to the active treatment sequence applications. All subjects will be followed for three
      months.
