      oral glitazone treatment may cause or exacerbate retinal edema. We hypothesized that
      glitazone treatment may cause subclinical edema evidenced by increased retinal thickness. We
      will conduct a double-masked, prospective safety study of 19 subjects undergoing
      placebo-controlled treatment with pioglitazone. Patient treatment consisted of either insulin
      with placebo or insulin with pioglitazone. The main outcome measures are ETDRS visual acuity
      and retinal thickness measured with optical coherence tomography.
