      function and everyday life activities of infants and toddlers at risk of or with a diagnosis
      of cerebral palsy after participating of the intensive treatment programme "Hand-arm Bimanual
      Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE)" will be studied . Changes, scored
      by parents in case of questionnaires and by experts in the case of tests, will be observed
      comparing infants/toddlers after their regular care and after receiving HABIT-ILE. Motor
      function and daily life activities will be correlated with neuroplastic changes. Moreover,
      possible therapy onset outcomes differences will be observed.
