      of the medication for their acute headache that they would otherwise receive. Once consented,
      participants will be randomized to PMR therapy or monitored usual care (MUC). Participants
      will be told that either group is being tested as an enhancement to the care they typically
      get in the ED for headache. (At the end, they will be informed which group they were in.) The
      study team will collect participants' health histories (biologic variables) and baseline data
      in REDCap, download the app onto subjects' smartphones, and conduct the sessions.
