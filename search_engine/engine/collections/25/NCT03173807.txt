      started on ADT for preventing and or delaying metabolic syndrome in this aging population.
      The study will employ a randomized, 2-arm wait-control design. Subjects will be randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio into two arms: dietary modifications and exercise counseling (Arm A) or standard
      of care (Arm B). The duration of intervention in Arm A will be 24 months. At 12 months,
      participants in Arm B will be offered the same intervention that Arm A received during months
      1-12. Medical records will be accessed up to 5 years for standard of care visits. The goal of
      this project is to generate preliminary data on the feasibility of applying such an
      intervention on a much bigger population with approximately 100 subjects on each arm. For
      this pilot, we aim to randomize 20 patients to each arm. The principal investigator or
      co-investigators who are evaluating the patient will perform the randomization since this is
      an open-label, non-therapeutic study. The ADT received by patients on both arms is considered
      standard of care therapy for their prostate cancer.
