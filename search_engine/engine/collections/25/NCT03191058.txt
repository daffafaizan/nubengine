      treatment arms conducted in two international academic medical centers (the Centre for
      Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada and UT Southwestern in Dallas, Texas). The
      investigators are pursuing a non-inferiority clinical trial in an effort to compare MST - a
      new treatment for TRD - to RUL-UB-ECT. Treatment will be administered two to three days per
      week. Depression symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HRSD-24) and suicidality will be assessed with the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI).
      Remission will be defined as HRSD-24 < or = 10 and a > 60% decrease in scores from baseline
      on two consecutive ratings. Once a participant reaches remission, a second rating to confirm
      remission will be conducted immediately before their next scheduled treatment. If remission
      is confirmed, they will then be considered a completer of the acute treatment course.
      Remission of suicidal ideation is defined as a score of 0 on the SSI. Therefore, there will
      be no specific minimum number of treatments that patients must receive to be classified as
      remitters. However, patients who do not meet remission criteria after 21 treatment sessions
      will be considered non-remitters and will cease treatment sessions. This maximum treatment
      number was chosen allowing for the possibility that MST may require more treatment sessions
      to achieve remission, similar to RUL-UB ECT. The blind will not be broken to participants
      until the completion of the entire study.
