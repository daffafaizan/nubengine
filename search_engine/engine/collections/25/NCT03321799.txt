      arthroplasty result in significant morbidity and cost. Persistent incisional drainage
      following total joint arthroplasty (TJA) has been reported to occur in 1% to 3% of patients.
      Drainage persisting greater than 48 hours has been reported as a risk factor for the
      development of an acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), with each additional day of
      wound drainage increasing the infection risk by 29-42%. Consequently, continued wound
      drainage has been shown to potentially increase the economic burden through longer hospital
      stays and subsequent surgical procedures. To the investigators knowledge, no prospective,
      randomized controlled trials have examined the rate of wound complications, infection, and
      reoperation following revision total hip arthroplasty when treated with NPWT versus sterile
      dressings. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of wound complications, infections,
      and subsequent procedures in patients undergoing revision THA treatment will demonstrate a
      statistically and clinically relevant decrease when using NPWT versus sterile dressing. The
      investigators will utilize a prospective, randomized, controlled study design to assess the
      efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on the rate of wound complications,
      surgical site infections (SSIs), and reoperations after revision total hip arthroplasty
      (THA). For 90 days after surgery, the wound complications, including wound dehiscence,
      prolonged drainage for >7 days postoperatively, hematoma formation, surgical site infection,
      or periprosthetic joint infection that requires postoperative interventions, and reoperation
      will be tracked.
