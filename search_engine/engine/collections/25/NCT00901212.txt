      ventricles simultaneously with specialized electrodes and a cardiac stimulator. However,
      controversy persists concerning the optimal configuration for cardiac pacing in these
      patients. Right ventricular pacing alone has been shown to be deleterious in some patient
      populations. The benefits of biventricular pacing in heart failure patients may be due
      primarily to left ventricular stimulation and may, in some patients, be decreased by the
      presence of simultaneous RV stimulation. Preliminary data from our own animal work suggest
      that in the majority of cases, LV stimulation alone is better than RV stimulation, and that
      BiV stimulation represents an intermediary situation between LV and RV stimulation.
