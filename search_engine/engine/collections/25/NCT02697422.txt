    
      The Vet-COACH study is a peer health coaching program to help reduce Cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk among Veterans. The goal of the study is to test the effectiveness of a home-visit
      peer health coach intervention to promote health outcomes and behavior change among Veterans
      with multiple CVD risk factors with a hybrid type 1 implementation study. The study will
      focus on Veterans with poorly controlled hypertension and at least one other CVD risk factor
      to target a high risk population.

      The study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to enroll n=400 Veterans to compare a
      peer health coach intervention consisting of home visits, telephone support, and linkages to
      appropriate community-based and clinic resources compared to usual VHA primary care. The
      primary outcome is reduction in systolic blood pressure from baseline to follow-up at 1-year.
      Secondary outcomes include a reduction in Framingham Cardiovascular risk score, individual
      cardiovascular risks (tobacco use, lipids), health related quality of life, and health care
      use. The investigators will also assess the effects of the peer health coach intervention on
      intermediate outcomes including social support, patient activation, patient/provider
      communication and health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, physical activity, nutrition,
      alcohol use, and stress management). The cost of the intervention will be assessed to inform
      feasibility for future studies, determine Veteran and staff satisfaction with the
      intervention, and identify barriers and facilitators to adoption.
