    
      This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, single arm study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of AUTO1 in adult patients with B-cell ALL by determining the overall
      response rate (ORR).

      Adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL will be enrolled in both phases of the study.
      Consented patients will go through the following five sequential stages: screening,
      leukapheresis, pre-conditioning, treatment, and follow-up. All patients will receive a total
      target dose of 410E+6 of CAR T cells as a split dose on Day 1 and on Day 10 (Â±2 days).
