      click-through movement, often but not necessarily associated with pain. A prevalence of 5-10%
      of the general population has been reported. Snapping hip is divided into three forms of
      snapping hip; intraarticular, internal and external snapping hip. External snapping hip (coxa
      saltans external) is the most common form, and patients may experience pain when the
      iliotibial band or anterior part of the gluteus maximus slides over the greater trochanter at
      femur. Patients with external snapping hip are typically between 15 and 40 years, and
      physically active.
