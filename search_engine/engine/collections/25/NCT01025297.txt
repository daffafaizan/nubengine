    
      This is a Phase I/IIa inter-patient dose-escalation study assessing weekly doses of
      Interleukin-7 (CYT107) in adult patients infected by virus genotype 1 or 4 of Hepatitis C and
      resistant to standard treatment with Peg-Interferon and Ribavirin (bitherapy).

      The dose escalation is aimed at establishing the safety of a biologically active doses of
      CYT107 added to the combination therapy of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. At each
      dose level, study patients will receive one subcutaneous administration of CYT107 per week
      for a total of 4.

      Groups of 6 patients will be entered at each dose level of CYT107. Three dose levels are
      planned.

      Eligible patients initially receive bi-therapy for 6-10 weeks. Thereafter, CYT107 is added
      for a cycle of four weekly injections at a defined dose level while standard bi-therapy
      continues for 9 weeks after CYT107 treatment discontinuation. The patients are then followed
      on a regular basis until reaching 48 weeks after the CYT107 treatment. The duration of study
      is approximatively 60 weeks with 20-25 weeks of bi-therapy.

      Participants will have 1 overnight hospitalization and 15 clinic visit on a period of 60
      weeks.

      During the visits the following may be done:

        -  medical history, physical examination, blood tests

        -  electrocardiograms (ECG)

        -  chest X-Ray

        -  liver/spleen imaging

        -  urine tests
