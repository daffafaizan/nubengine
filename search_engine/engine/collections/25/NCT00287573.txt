      rotational atherectomy, cutting balloon angioplasty, directional coronary atherectomy,
      excimer laser angioplasty, placement of a second stent or any combination thereof, and
      intra-coronary brachytherapy. Of these, only brachytherapy has been shown to reduce recurrent
      restenosis after PCI for ISR, - and is now considered the standard of care. Logistical
      considerations in establishing and maintaining a radiation program have limited the
      widespread availability of this modality. These considerations include the need for
      involvement of radiation oncologists, physicists, and safety officers; nuclear licensing
      requirements; need for increased shielding and safety training; equipment and procedural
      complexities; as well as increased procedural time and costs. Furthermore, recurrent ISR
      after brachytherapy may still occur. Stent based drug delivery for the treatment of ISR holds
      promise as a much simpler, safer and potentially more effective alternative to brachytherapy.

      This is a prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter, safety and efficacy trial
      for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. The primary objective is to demonstrate a superior
      or non-inferior 9-month target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate for TAXUS-SR stent
      compared to intra-coronary brachytherapy (beta source).
