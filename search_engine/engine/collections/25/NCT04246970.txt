      on candidates for liver transplantation (LT), as well as to study the effects of
      posttransplant training on the clinical and functional evolution of the recipients. Also this
      project pretends to assess the influence of functional capacity (FC) improvement on the short
      and long term post-S evolution of the LT candidates. This is a prospective randomized
      clinical trial in which three phases follow: Prehabilitation, training and follow-up. The
      sample will be constituted by 60 candidates for LT, randomized in a control group (CG, n=20),
      a Prehabilitation group (PG, n=20) and a Prehabilitation-posttransplant training group (PTG,
      n=20). To conventional care, a Prehabilitation program will be added to the PG and PTG. After
      the LT, just PTG will follow a posttransplant training program. The long-term follow-up will
      be extended to 2 years post-LT. The variables under study will be: complications and post-S
      evolution; FC; quality of life; etc. The individualization of Prehabilitation and
      posttransplant training program, and also medical control, will ensure safety and offer the
      potential benefits that these types of programs can provide.
