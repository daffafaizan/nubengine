      outcome in a population with patients treated with antipsychotic drugs compared to healthy
      controls.

      Background Life expectancy is about 20 years shorter for patients with mental illness
      compared to the general population. Increasing evidence suggest that antipsychotic drugs can
      cause cardiac arrhythmias and hence sudden death. However, the evidence as well as the
      incidence of rhythm disturbances in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs is insufficient
      reported. Prolonged monitoring with external portable monitors is difficult for practical and
      technical reasons. In addition, long-term consistent and structured timing of clinical visits
      is often a challenge in this vulnerable patient group. In recent years, patients who have
      been suspected of rarely occurring arrhythmias, have been offered long-term monitoring using
      an 'implantable loop recorder' (ILR). However, no study has evaluated the arrhythmic burden
      in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs using ILR.

      Methods and materials The study is a national joint project between departments of psychiatry
      and cardiology across Denmark. After written informed consent and a baseline evaluation
      including echocardiography, ecg and biochemistry, an ILR will be implanted. During follow-up,
      arrhythmias will be monitored at regular clinical visits. Cardiovascular endpoints will be
      monitored using Danish national registries.

      Expected outcome and perspectives The present study is the first to reveal arrhythmias among
      patients treated with antipsychotics using consistent long-term monitoring. The results will
      give valuable insights into possible mechanism of the observed early death and risk of sudden
      death in patients treated with antipsychotics.
