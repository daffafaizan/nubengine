      thyroid surgery has become more sensitive and selective. Besides, thyroid surgery has
      increased due to the increase in thyroid cancer and early detection of thyroid nodules. In a
      comprehensive study conducted by the Thyroid Cancer Association with 2398 patients in 35
      countries, it is found that 92.6% of the patients did not receive psychological support,
      84.1% did not receive institutional information, and 63.0% did not receive written
      information about the disease or treatment. Thyroidectomy patients are known to experience
      postoperative complications and symptoms such as hypocalcemia, hoarseness, dysphagia,
      drowsiness, or restricted neck/shoulder movement. Therefore, informing thyroidectomy patients
      about the surgical process will facilitate the management of the process. In addition to
      this, due to the increasing use of the internet with the developing technology, the behaviors
      of the patients searching for information from the internet are increasing day by day. It has
      been found that the rate of searching for health information from the internet is 68-72% in
      the world. Under this scope, this study will evaluate the effect of the web-based training on
      with thyroidectomy patients
