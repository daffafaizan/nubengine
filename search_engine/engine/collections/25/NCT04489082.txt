    
      The present study is being undertaken as an open-label study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of near infrared therapy as an intervention for patients with refractory
      depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment due to a neurodegenerative disease (e.g.,
      Alzheimer's), and traumatic brain injury. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize
      validated tests that are appropriate for repeated measures. The present study can be easily
      implemented because instruments have been in routine clinical deployment providing for a high
      degree of availability and reliability. Quality assurance is tightly controlled. The study
      population is sufficiently broad and the conditions of interest are sufficiently prevalent so
      that recruitment of subjects is not a limiting factor.
