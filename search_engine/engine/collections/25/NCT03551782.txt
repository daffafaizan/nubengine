      have now developed mCRPC and who have progressed on therapy with abiraterone acetate plus
      prednisone/prednisolone (AA-P), apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide. Participants with
      treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) assessed by the
      screening biopsy may be considered for this study. Participants must have confirmed
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group
      (PCWG3) criteria. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with cetrelimab and apalutamide is
      safe and leads to improvement in the 12-week PSA response rate. The study consists of an
      Optional Pre-screening Period, Screening period (28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), Treatment
      Period, End-of-Treatment Visit (performed after the last dose of study drug is administered),
      and Follow-up Period (participants will have Follow-up assessment every 12 weeks after the
      End-of-Treatment Visit). The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of cetrelimab in
      combination with apalutamide will be evaluated.
