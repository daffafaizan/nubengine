    
      it will assess the activation state of blood eosinophils in SSc patients compared to healthy
      controls (ECP production in vitro, surface activation markers, whole transcriptome array,
      ..).

      it will also study skin eosinophils and their recruitment (extracellular eosinophil granules,
      eotaxins production in skin, ..)
