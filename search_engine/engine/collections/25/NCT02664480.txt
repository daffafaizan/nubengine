      contains many hormones, drugs and antibodies of interest in screening and diagnosis. With a
      salivary specimen, one can collect multiple specimens at the optimum times for diagnostic
      information. Saliva can be collected in remote sites by unskilled personnel and, is stable at
      ambient temperatures for several weeks. Because of diurnal and monthly variations, several
      steroid hormones need multiple samples collected early in the morning or late at night or at
      the same time every day for a month to give meaningful results. Such collections are often
      very expensive, inconvenient or impossible to do with blood.

      Investigators aimed to investigate whether there is an association between ovulation and
      salivatory alpha amylase (sAA) activity in menstrual cycles during a month period in a group
      of reproductive women.
