      tools to measure the degree of muscle wasting are lacking in burn care. Ultrasound has been
      used for this purpose in the critically-ill population and has shown to be valid and
      reliable. Whether this can be extrapolated to the burn population, however, remains unclear.
      Open wounds, fluid status, and uncertainty regarding which protocol to use are amongst
      factors that complicate the use of ultrasound during the acute phase of burns.

      AIM This study examines the reliability and feasibility of ultrasound measures in the acute
      burn setting comparing different techniques and locations of application.

      METHODS Burned adults were assessed at admission in two Belgian burn centers by two trained
      assessors using B-mode ultrasound with a linear transducer. Ultrasound-derived variables
      included quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT) and rectus femoris cross-sectional area
      (RF-CSA) on both thighs. Both maximum and minimum compression techniques were used for QMLT,
      while RF-CSA was determined by minimum compression only. QMLT was measured at a proximal and
      distal location on the thigh, and RF-CSA was measured at the most proximal location possible
      where the entire muscle belly still remained visible.
