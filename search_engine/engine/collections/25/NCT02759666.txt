      important roles in multiple cellular processes, including single-strand DNA breaks, which if
      left unrepaired, leads to double-strand breaks (DSB) during DNA replication. The DSB can be
      repaired either through error-free homologous recombination (HR) or error-prone non-homology
      end joining. In HR deficient cancer cells with mutations on HR genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 or
      partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), DSB cannot be efficiently and correctly repaired,
      resulting in cell death. Viable cells, on the other hand, have normal HR and do not replicate
      as often as cancer cells; thus they can survive PARP inhibition. PARP inhibitors are being
      actively developed worldwide as promising anti-tumor therapeutics. The current trial will be
      conducted in participants with advanced solid tumors for whom satisfactory treatments are not
      yet available.

      In the dose-escalation phase, patients will be enrolled sequentially into the 8 dose levels
      of SHR3162 designated in this study(3-6 patients per cohort). One to two sentinel
      participants in Cohort 1 who will be treated and closely monitored for 24 hours. If no
      adverse effects are noted during the 24-hour period, dosing of further participants in the
      cohort may continue.

      In the dose expansion part of the study, up to 12 additional participants will be enrolled at
      the MTD.
