      the third most common cancer diagnosed5,6 with a 3-year mortality rate of 35%.5 Colonoscopy
      screening can save lives, and is the cornerstone of effective prevention. The National Polyp
      Study showed that removal of adenomas during screening colonoscopy decreases the subsequent
      development of CRC by up to 90% and death by up to 50% in comparison to historical controls.
      In VA, colonoscopy is the primary CRC screening modality with over 200,000 colonoscopies
      performed each year.9 Eighty-two percent of Veterans are up-to-date on CRC screening, with
      89% having a colonoscopy.9 However, the quality of those VA colonoscopies is unknown.

      High quality colonoscopy is critical for CRC prevention. Observational studies found
      significant rates of CRC even after normal colonoscopy, likely due to colonoscopists' varied
      performance in detecting and removing polyps.11,15 Among Medicare beneficiaries,
      approximately 7% of all CRC occurred in individuals who had colonoscopy that apparently
      missed the CRC diagnosis. A pooled analysis from eight surveillance studies suggested 52% of
      incident CRCs after colonoscopy were due to missed lesions.16 These interval cancers
      highlight the need to focus on colonoscopy quality indicators.11,15,17,18 Adenoma detection
      rate (ADR) significantly varies by provider and has been strongly linked to both CRC
      incidence and mortality. In essence, polyps that are not found cannot be removed for CRC
      prevention. ADR, defined as the proportion of screening colonoscopies performed by a
      physician that has one or more histologically-confirmed adenomatous polyps or CRC, is the
      primary benchmark for colonoscopy inspection quality. Increasing ADR correlates with a lower
      risk of interval and fatal CRC.10,11 A landmark US study of 314,872 colonoscopy exams showed
      marked variability in providers' ability to detect polyps, with the ADR ranging from 7.4 to
      52.5%.10 In patients of providers with the highest ADRs, as compared with those in the
      lowest, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for fatal interval CRC was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22 to
      0.65).10 Each 1% increase in ADR was associated with a decrease risk of 3% for interval CRC
      and 5% for CRC death.10 Using the methods the team developed19, the investigators have
      powerful pilot results showing colonoscopy quality variability in the VA and direct
      association with CRC death. From 1999-2011, there were 634,331 Veterans with baseline
      colonoscopy performed by one of 3101 colonoscopists with ADRs ranging from 13-79%. In
      patients who had a colonoscopy without polyps found, the higher the provider ADR, the more
      protected the patient was from developing future CRC: adjusted HR (adjHR) 0.57 for incident
      (95%CI: 0.42-0.79; ptrend< 0.001) and 0.73 for fatal (95%CI: 0.50-1.06; p=0.047) CRC for the
      highest vs. lowest ADR quintile. Among individuals who had a colonoscopy with polypectomy,
      increasing ADR was also associated with reduced risk: adjHRs 0.46 for incident (95%CI:
      0.34-0.62; ptrend< 0.001) and 0.53 for fatal (95%CI: 0.34-0.84; ptrend=0.006) CRC for the
      highest vs. lowest quintile. A 5% absolute increase in ADR was associated with relative
      reductions in fatal CRC risk of 4% after normal colonoscopy (adjHR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.95-0.97)
      and 6% after polypectomy (adjHR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-0.98) Other important quality metrics,
      including bowel preparation quality20-23 and cecal intubation rate11 also impact patient
      outcomes with poor bowel preparation and incomplete examinations associated with missed
      lesions24 and need for earlier repeat procedures.

      Audit and feedback of colonoscopy quality improves performance and outcomes. The VA Surgical
      Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) is an example of a VA nationwide reporting system that
      formed to focus on quality and has led to a decrease in mortality of 47% in patients 30 days
      after surgery.25-27 VASQUIP provides information to providers for self-assessment and quality
      improvement purposes.25 There is similarly strong evidence that providing colonoscopy
      performance feedback12,28,29 improves quality and patient outcomes.12,28 Kahi and colleagues
      showed in a single-center VA setting that a quarterly report card improved colonoscopy
      quality.28 Most recently, in a large prospective European cohort study evaluating annual
      feedback and quality benchmark indicators on screening colonoscopy performance,12 the
      majority of the endoscopists (74.5%) increased their annual ADR. Moreover, individuals
      examined by endoscopists in the highest ADR quintile (> 24.6%) had significantly lower risk
      of interval CRC and death. When compared with no increase in ADR, reaching or maintaining the
      highest quintile ADR decreased adjusted hazard ratios for interval and fatal CRC to 0.27 (95%
      CI, 0.12-0.63; P = .03), and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56; P = .03).

      Quality Gap: Quality reporting improves patient outcomes. The national VA healthcare system
      currently lacks a reliable, efficient program to routinely measure and report colonoscopy
      quality.13 Accurate measurement of quality metrics is challenging, because validated quality
      metrics are not available in structured VA data from VA CDW. The challenge is multifactorial.
      Colonoscopy procedure documentation resides in text notes in Vista/CPRS or endoscopic
      reporting software. The commonly used VA endoscopy note writer software programs (i.e.
      Endopro�, Provation�, etc) do not facilitate tracking pathology data and quality measurement.
      None of the current VA endoscopy reporting programs link to VA pathology data (to determine
      ADR); and production-level pathology data is not in the CDW. Thus, within VA, there has not
      been a reliable, efficient way to track critical procedure and pathology results to measure
      colonoscopy quality and ensure optimal protection from CRC incidence and death for Veterans.

      Proposed Solution and Rationale for Study: The foundation of VA-EQuIP is a novel natural
      language processing (NLP) algorithm and informatics reporting infrastructure that the
      investigators developed to measure the quality of colonoscopies performed by individual VA
      colonoscopists.30 The team will evaluate a national quality improvement program to better
      understand how and why such a program is effective or ineffective in different contexts. This
      study is critically needed to allow us to perform a rigorous evaluation to answer
      implementation science questions and to advance the clinical and epidemiologic knowledge on
      the impact of colonoscopy quality on CRC mortality. Leveraging the informatics investment
      made by HSR&D as well as the National GI Program office partnership in quality improvement
      initiatives, the roll out of VA-EQuIP is a rare opportunity to study, in real time, the
      deployment and impact of a large-scale learning health system initiative. Most existing
      performance measures are calculated at the facility level. The concept of calculating metrics
      from individual provider procedures and comparing these metrics not only with local peers but
      with national providers represents a profound culture shift. This is where implementation
      science becomes essential, especially with respect to stakeholder engagement, adaptation and
      tailoring.

      A primary justification for this study is that VA-EQuIP has a high probability of improving a
      quality metric outcome (ADR) directly associated with CRC death, one of the most common
      cancers in Veterans. A randomized controlled trial of this magnitude is an opportunity to
      show, for the first time, that even small improvements in clinical performance from audit and
      feedback can save Veterans lives, since even a 1% increase in ADR translates to a 3%
      reduction in interval cancer death. The proposal for a randomized program evaluation is a
      tremendous opportunity to determine the large scale effect of the audit and feedback strategy
      on changes in the colonoscopy quality metrics of individual endoscopists over time. The
      evaluation of VA-EQuIP implementation will identify factors associated with effective
      implementation and colonoscopy quality improvement (impact) at VA sites. Prior and planned
      work builds toward long-term goal to reduce mortality in Veterans by increasing early
      detection of CRC and inform national quality improvement initiatives such as remediation
      training for continual low performing endoscopists.

      Finally, with upcoming expansion to community care, VA will be making policy decisions about
      what services should be furnished by VA versus non-VA providers. It is more crucial than ever
      that health services researchers apply rigorous methods to identify meaningful quality
      metrics that are linked by evidence to patient outcomes so that these measures of quality
      will be used to justify such crucial "make versus buy" determinations. It is hopeful that the
      investigators study will not only improve colonoscopy quality but also provide a framework
      for assessing the quality of other procedures such as bone marrow biopsy or bronchoscopy.
