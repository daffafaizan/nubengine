      biologics aimed at inhibiting the pathways of eosinophilic activation, notably via the
      interleukin 5 pathway in eosinophilic asthmatic patients uncontrolled despite receiving
      maximum doses of standard drugs. These treatments showed efficacy in asthmatic patients with
      a high level of eosinophils in their induced sputum (> 3%) and the criteria were extended to
      those with circulating eosinophilia (> 300 / mm3). Eosinophils are therefore an important
      biomarker for phenotyping asthmatic patients. The Charcot-Leyden crystals are a reflection of
      the presence of eosinophils, and are sometimes found in some pathological samples. It is
      hypothesized that the presence of Charcot-Leyden crystals, a reflection of tissue
      eosinophilia, is a predictive factor for the efficacy of anti-IL5 biotherapies in patients
      with severe eosinophilic asthma.
