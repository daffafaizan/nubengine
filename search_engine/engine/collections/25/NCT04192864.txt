      incision on sound bone, as they involve incisions that are placed on the extraction socket
      resulting in higher incidence of mucosal dehiscence, followed by secondary wound healing

      This study involved 20 patient with bilaterally mesially angulated impacted third molar
      (class II position B). One side was surgically removed using the lingually based triangular
      flap and the other side was surgically removed using the bucally based triangular flap
