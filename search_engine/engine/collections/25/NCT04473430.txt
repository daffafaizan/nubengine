      glycemic variability patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2), treated with insulin
      and receiving hemodialysis, to assess the accuracy of the CGM in this specific cohort, and to
      assess the efficacy of real-time CGM data in preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

      The study will provide novel insights into the glycemic exposure patterns among dialysis
      patients and will provide preliminary data for future outcomes-based studies determining the
      best glycemic targets for this group.
