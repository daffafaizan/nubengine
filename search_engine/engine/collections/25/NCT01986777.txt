      study. Once they are deemed eligible for participation based on two assessment visits, they
      will be scheduled for their baseline test day. On this they, they will be asked to under a
      series of cognitive tests following by a brain-imaging scan. They will then take the first
      dose of either the LDX or placebo, wait for 3 hours and then undergo another brain-imaging
      scan to assess acute changes to memory/cognition due to the study drug. They will then come
      in for three 30-minute check-in visits during weeks 2, 4 and 6 on the study drug. They will
      be asked to undergo a final scan and series of cognitive tasks during weeks 8-10 on the study
      drug. They will then be discharged from active study participation. All participants,
      regardless of randomization, will be offered a consultation with the study MD and optional
      prescription for 4-weeks of treatment with LDX.
