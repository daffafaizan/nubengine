      been suggested that antimicrobial treatment makes a lot of harm to intestinal microbiome and
      may thus have effects on the child's health and wellbeing. However, data on these changes and
      their magnitude is scanty. This is a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of
      various antimicrobial treatments on the intestinal microbiome of small children. The
      participating children with acute otitis media are treated wither with amoxicillin,
      amoxicillin-clavulanate or without antibiotics. The children with allergy to amoxicillin
      receive a course of macrolide and they will be monitored as a separate group. The main
      outcomes of this trial are the changes in the intestinal microbiome after the treatment.
