      Feasibility of dose painting will be determined by the absence of tumor outside the high-risk
      region on an intra-operative trans-perineal biopsy.

      Frozen sections will not be obtained, however on receipt of the final pathology 2-4 weeks
      after the procedure 2 possible scenarios arise:

        1. There is no evidence of cancer: this confirms the accuracy of the TRUS MRI registration.

        2. There is evidence of tumor on the stereotactic biopsy: In this case a regular dosimetric
           check (this is performed in the Standard of care procedure and is known as
           post-operative dosimetry) will be performed to determine whether adequate dose was
           delivered. If not, as the involved needle position was recorded in the treatment plan
           and labeled with co-ordinates, the regular possibility of accurately adding radioactive
           seeds is possible.
