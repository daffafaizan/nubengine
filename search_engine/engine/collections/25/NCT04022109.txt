    
      Patients with established disease (gastric cancer, precancerous lesions) as well as patients
      investigated for the lesions and having been documented lack of the lesions will be enrolled
      to the study at clinical sites in Europe (Latvia, Ukraine) and Latin America (Colombia,
      Chile, Brazil). In addition, group of persons from general population at average risk for
      developing the target disease and individuals being referred for upper endoscopy according to
      clinical indications will be also enrolled.

      Testing of volatile markers will be conducted by one of two methods: 1) gas chromatography
      coupled to mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) and 2) sensor technology. Various sensors will be used
      and evaluated for the purpose.

      The potential sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath will be addressed by
      studying VOC emission by using headspace analysis from cancer tissue, gastric contents,
      cancer cell cultures and H.pylori.

      The potential role of gastric and faecal microbiota in the origin of VOCs in the breath will
      be addressed. Metabolome in the circulation will also get correlated to VOCs in the breath
      and with microbiome.
