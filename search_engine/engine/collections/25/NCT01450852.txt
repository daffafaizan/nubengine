      Chronic exercise reduces inflammation, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Recent
      studies have shown that stimulation of melanocortin 1 and 3 receptors (MC1R and MC3R) on
      immune cells increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. PURPOSE: To examine the
      influence of 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) on body composition, monocyte cell-surface
      expression of MC1R and MC3R and circulating markers of inflammation. METHODS: Healthy, active
      males and females (age 20-27 yr) were recruited into a RT group (RE; n = 23) and an active
      control group (AC; n = 19). RE completed 12 weeks of progressive, periodized RT 3d/wk while
      AC maintained normal activity habits. Measures of body composition (DXA) were taken and blood
      was collected prior to (PRE) and following the intervention period (POST). Blood samples were
      analyzed for monocyte cell-surface expression MC1R, MC3R, MC5R and C-reactive protein (CRP)
      and the plasma cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) using flow cytometry
      and ELISAs respectively.
