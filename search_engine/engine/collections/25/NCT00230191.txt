      United States. Radiotherapy ("RT") plays a significant role in the management of head and
      neck cancer. The most common and clinically significant toxicities arising from head and neck
      radiation therapy are acute mucositis and acute and chronic xerostomia (dry mouth or salivary
      gland changes). In subjects receiving RT for cancers of the oral cavity or oropharynx the
      incidence of acute mucositis can exceed 90%. The painful ulceration of the oral mucosa
      produced by the radiation often leads to the requirement for narcotics to control pain,
      inability to eat, dehydration, the need for parenteral nutrition and, sometimes, breaks in
      RT. In addition to its symptomatic cost, the presence of mucositis has been associated with a
      number of other adverse outcomes including higher costs and more frequent hospitalizations.
