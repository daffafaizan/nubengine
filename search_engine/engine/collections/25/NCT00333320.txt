      consequences of prolonged ischemia. However, it is now clearly established that reperfusion
      induces by itself severe myocardial injuries. Postconditioning has been described as an
      adaptive response triggered by a brief ischemia applied after a prolonged coronary occlusion.
      Several teams have reported that ischemia/reperfusion cycles allow to reduce infarct size in
      experimental models.

      Different pathophysiological processes have been proposed to explain the beneficial effect of
      postconditioning. It has been reported that postconditioning reduces the inflammatory
      response, and activates cardioprotective signaling pathways (Akt, eNOS, p70S6K). In addition,
      an improvement of the endothelial function has been reported.

      This controlled trial aim to study the potential beneficial effect of postconditioning in
      patients with acute myocardial infarction. Forty six patients will be included in the study
      and the culprit artery will be reoccluded three times for 1 minutes after desobstruction in
      one of the both groups after randomization of the patients.

      The evaluation will be focused on the comparison of the coronary reserve after intracoronary
      adenosine injection. In addition, additional parameters will be used to study the effect of
      postconditioning on post-ischemic endothelial dysfunction: frequencies of low reflow and slow
      reflow situation, myocardial blush and regression of ST elevation. The effect of
      postconditioning on the left ventricular systolic function will be studied by Doppler tissue
      imaging and RMN.
