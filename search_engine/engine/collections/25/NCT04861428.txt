      vs (cigarette) smoking as usual on switching from tobacco cigarettes during two-week
      "practice" periods in smokers screened for lung cancer.

      Study interventions include IQOS, a commercially available, over the counter product. The
      IQOS is a commercially available tobacco product that consists of a holder which contains a
      rechargeable battery and an electronically heated metal blade.

      All procedures will take place in the Prevention and Early Detection Center (PEDC) at the
      UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Participants will be assessed daily via remote CO assessment and
      online questionnaire throughout the entire study (WK1-WK5). At the end of a one-week baseline
      of normal smoking (WK1), participants will be randomized to either: 1) begin a two-week
      period of attempting to completely switch to exclusive IQOS use (IQOS First); or 2) continue
      to smoke as usual (IQOS Last; WK2-WK3), followed by a second two-week period during which
      they will smoke as usual or attempt to switch to IQOS (opposite of the first period;
      WK4-WK5).
