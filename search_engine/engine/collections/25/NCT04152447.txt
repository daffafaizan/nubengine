      United States4. The deleterious effects of the opioid epidemic have been well studied at both
      the individual and population level.2 3 Orthopaedic trauma patients in particular have high
      rates of psychological stress and disability related to protracted narcotic usage 5. However,
      opioid medications may not need to be the mainstay of pharmacologic pain management for
      patients with orthopaedic injuries. For example, one recent study from the Netherlands showed
      that 82% of patients with ankle fractures treated in the United States were prescribed
      opioids at discharge, whereas only 6% of Dutch patients were given narcotics. 6

      Non-pharmacologic interventions for pain management in the acute orthopaedic injury setting
      deserve full investigation. Virtual reality for pain management has been used in burn
      patients, pediatric patients, for procedures under local anesthesia and in the chronic pain
      setting. Results of these investigations are promising and demonstrate reduced narcotic usage
      and improved pain scores.7 8 9 Currently, there are no published reports on the use of
      virtual reality for pain management in the orthopaedic literature. By investigating VR as a
      non-pharmacologic intervention for pain, orthopaedic trauma patients may be able to avoid the
      known risks of narcotic medication while still controlling their pain and regaining function
      after their injury. Our study will lay groundwork for longer-term studies to evaluate the
      impact of virtual reality on functional outcomes, opioid usage after hospital discharge and
      patient satisfaction scores. VR can also be investigated for post-operative pain control
      across other orthopedic subspecialties.
