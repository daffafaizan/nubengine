      patients with advanced GIST failed to or intolerance of imatinib and sunitinib therapy.
      AUY922 is a novel HSP90 inhibitor and will be administered at dose of 70 mg/m2 i.v. infusion
      on D1 every week. The Simon one sample two-stage minimax design was used with 15 suitable
      patients to be accrued to the first stage. If at least two patients meet our primary endpoint
      (complete response＋partial response＋stable disease≧4 months), an additional 10 patients would
      be recruited to the second stage. AUY922 would be considered active in this patient
      population, if there were more than 5 cases of non-progressive disease in the total cohort of
      25 patients.
