      monitoring the degree of unconsciousness during general anaesthesia. Previous studies and
      results obtained during the project regarding the effect of anaesthetics on single neurons
      and small neuronal networks indicate that it would be most promising to use a method directly
      correlating to the integrity of the relevant functional systems. As one goal of the project
      it was formulated to develop and test a new system for recording and analysis of mid latency
      auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP), suitable to be used in the clinical surrounding of an
      operation theatre. Step by step an investigational system was developed, that after obtaining
      legal approvement was functional in a broad spectrum of cases. In a multicenter study the
      including 4 clinical centres and 426 patients the reliability of the system was proved. Even
      under the hard conditions of the OR the apparatus was able to record the signals with
      sufficient reliability and precision. A clear correlation of MLAEP parameters with clinically
      defined states of consciousness could be identified. Differences in the effect of the used
      combinations of general anaesthetics and opioids were identified. An algorithm for automatic
      analysis of the signals was developed, to allow users with limited knowledge of
      interpretation of MLAEP signals to use them for monitoring anaesthesia.
