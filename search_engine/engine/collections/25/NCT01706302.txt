      modeling outputs generated during the generated by EPI-FLU-018 BOD UK DB (116273) study,
      which estimated the burden of influenza in terms of General Practitioner (GP) consultations,
      hospitalizations, and deaths associated with various respiratory and non-respiratory
      outcomes.
