      rotational measurements on axial MRI images and 2) determine the correlation between clinical
      and MRI measures of femoral version and tibial torsion.

      The investigators will use previously obtained MRI images to retrospectively calculate the
      inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of our measurements. Participating physicians
      will undergo training to standardize measurement technique. Five orthopaedic surgeons and one
      radiologist will perform the measurement to calculate inter-observer reliability. To asses
      intra-observer reliability, repeat measurements will be performed by the same physicians at a
      later date (at least 2 weeks). The physicians will be blinded to previous results when
      performing the second set of measurements. A standardized rotational profile will be
      performed on all patients presenting to the investigators with patellofemoral complaints or
      rotational abnormalities warranting intervention. Internal and external hip rotation will be
      measured in the prone and supine positions. Tibial torsion will be assessed with the
      thigh-foot axis in the prone and sitting positions. Investigators will participate in a
      formal training session prior to data collection to normalize measurements. Each study
      participant will undergo MRI imaging of the femur and tibia.
