      Department of Nuclear Medicine both under TSH-suppression therapy and under endogenous TSH
      stimulation (TSH > 25 mU/l). All patients were staged by clinical examination, cervical
      ultrasound (7.5 MHz), I-131 whole-body scintigraphy and - where applicable - F18-FDG-PET.
      Written informed consent was obtained from all pts. Sera were taken in separation tubes
      without anticoagulants and stored at -20°C until analysis. Sera were allowed to come to room
      temperature prior to analysis.

      Tg, TgR and TgAb concentrations were determined by fully automated two-site chemiluminescence
      immunoassays (CLIA; Nichols Advantage®; Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Clemente,
      California). All 3 assays are based on the identical highly purified hTg material for
      calibration (Tg), recovery (TgR) and antigen (TgAb; biotinylated and acridinium ester
      labeled) for optimum comparability of test results.

      In addition, Tg and TgR was measured by a fully automated two-site TRACE immunoassay (BRAHMS
      Kryptor®, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and TSH with a 3rd-generation CLIA assay (TSH-3,
      Advia Centaur, Bayer Corporation).
