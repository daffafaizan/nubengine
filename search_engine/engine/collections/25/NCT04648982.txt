      from Ndera Hospital the only inpatient psychiatric hospital in Rwanda, will be collected from
      files. The descriptive data includes diagnosis, duration of hospitalization, medication,
      addiction, insurance, Somatic- and psychiatric comorbidity, referral pathways, employment
      status, number of previous hospitalizations. To the investigators' knowledge, there is no
      descriptive data on psychiatric inpatients in the country of Rwanda. Therefore, this.
      Information will be crucial for understanding the service provision at the referral hospitals
      and the accessibility to intensive mental health care in Rwanda. The data will be anonymized
      and recorded - this ensures the data cannot be linked to anyone subject which supplied it.
