    
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial of memantine in
      patients with MS and spasticity. Participants will be identified at routine care visits at
      the Rochester Multiple Sclerosis Center. After obtaining informed consent, patients will
      undergo screening, which will include a physical/neurologic exam and an assessment of the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale, spasticity, and functional abilities. Eligible patients
      will return for a baseline evaluation, will initiate their randomly assigned study
      medication, and will return after one and three months for re-evaluation. The type and
      severity of any adverse events will be recorded using standard definitions. Participants will
      be instructed to call between visits to inform the investigators regarding any adverse events
      they experience. Follow-up will continue until all adverse events resolve or stabilize.
