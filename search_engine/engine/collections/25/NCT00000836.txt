      toxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively. Despite continued maintenance therapy with these
      drugs, relapse occurs in 85 percent of patients within 4 months. Studies suggest that MSL
      109, a human monoclonal antibody, when given with either ganciclovir or foscarnet, may
      increase initial response and prolong time to progression in patients with CMV retinitis.

      Patients are randomized to receive either MSL 109 or placebo every 2 weeks as supplemental
      therapy to primary CMV treatment.
