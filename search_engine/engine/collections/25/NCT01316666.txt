    
      This is an observational, prospective three-year longitudinal study. The investigators will
      enroll participants with primary neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. All participants will
      undergo an extensive neurological and cardiovascular evaluation, including detailed autonomic
      testing and quality of life assessment. The investigators will then determine the magnitude
      of the pressor effect produced by 18 mg atomoxetine given orally, measured 1 hour after drug
      administration. Participants will be followed annually or more often if there is a
      significant change in their clinical condition. During follow up at year 3, the investigators
      will repeat the initial neurological, cardiovascular and autonomic evaluation. The primary
      endpoint would be the final diagnosis made at year 3 after the initial evaluation (at the end
      of the follow-up period) or if they develop significant worsening of symptoms during
      follow-up phone assessments, based on specific clinical criteria.
