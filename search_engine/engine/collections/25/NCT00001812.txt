      randomized into two groups: group one will receive nystatin swish and swallow immediately
      before initiation of IL-2, and the second group will receive a placebo. The patients in each
      group will be monitored and evaluated for differences in the rate and severity of development
      of oral irritation during treatment. They will also be studied for differences between the
      two groups in the number of doses of IL-2 taken.
