      post-surgical pain. Recent studies have reported that some patients persist in taking opioids
      for months beyond the surgery. While opioids are commonly used for pain management following
      surgery, patients and their providers often don't have a planned method to optimize opioid
      exposure. This can lead to patients entering a cycle of opioid use that is difficult to
      manage, because, as opioid exposure is continued, pain relief is reduced and side effects
      increase. The investigators' study is aimed at reducing opioid exposure following total hip
      and total knee replacement.
