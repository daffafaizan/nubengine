      also for Germany. In addition to its somatic and economic consequences, the psychological
      dimension of the Coronavirus pandemic is discussed increasingly and is visible in public life
      - e.g. in the "pandemic-caused experience of threat", "loss of control" and "panic" of
      multiple people. The study examines the phenomenon of this "corona-related anxiety" in terms
      of epidemiological, clinical and psychosocial characteristics. It is investigated how "corona
      anxiety" affects people who already have an anxiety disorder or other mental illnesses as
      well as formerly mentally healthy people. It is also examined how media reporting and
      personal consequences of COVID-19 are connected with corona-related anxiety and if there is a
      need for therapeutic support regarding corona-related anxiety.

      To answer these questions a longitudinal online survey targeting the general population in
      Germany is carried out. The survey takes place all three weeks as long as the pandemic lasts
      and ends with one follow-up one year later.
