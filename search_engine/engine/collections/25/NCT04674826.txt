    
      This is a single center, randomized, open label, 2 period, 2 sequence cross over trial
      designed to compare the PK and to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 300
      mg tralokinumab administered as a 1 × X mL SC injection with Device A (test treatment [T])
      and 2 × Y mL consecutive SC injections with Device B (reference treatment [R]) in healthy
      subjects. Additionally, the experience of tralokinumab being administered with Device A
      compared to Device B will be evaluated.

      After being informed about the study and the potential risks, all subjects giving written
      informed consent will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences, Sequence TR
      or Sequence RT in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., subjects receive the 2 treatments in the specified
      order).
