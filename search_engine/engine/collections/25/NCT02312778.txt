    
      Mean and standard deviation are calculated for each variable of postural control, as well as
      the values obtained in the measurement of pain using the numeric pain rating scale and
      algometry data.

      t-test or Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare data before and after the manipulation
      protocol.

      Multiple One-Way ANOVAs will be used to compare the manipulation protocol, for each dependent
      variable: effects of pain and center of pressure displacement.. Statistical analysis will be
      conducted with a confidence interval of 95%, α value of 5%, p value of ≤ 0.05.
