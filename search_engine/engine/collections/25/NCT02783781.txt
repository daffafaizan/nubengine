    
      Main objective: To improve the EuroSCORE II predictive power on the 90-day mortality and/or
      severe hospital morbidity, incorporating immediate preoperative biological data.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Analyze EuroSCORE II calibration by risk group (external validation).

        2. Studying the improvement of the EuroSCORE II-bio predictive power by risk class,
           especially high risk.

        3. Refine selection and definition of discriminating criteria for diabetics for predicting
           surgical risk in cardiac surgery (the HbA1c value, the existence of microalbuminuria,
           the nature of treatment etc.).

        4. Compare the risk profiles of operated patients in the French Overseas Departments to
           those from different sites of Western Europe.
