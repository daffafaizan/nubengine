    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety
      of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers measuring clotting times using WBCT as
      determined by the manual testing method. All subjects will undergo screening up to 36 days
      prior to enrollment.

      All enrolled subjects are to receive 10 mg apixaban orally for 3.5 days (every 12 hours on
      Days 1-3 and once on the morning of Day 4). On Day 4, subjects who achieve sufficient
      anticoagulation (WBCT â‰¥20% above baseline) are randomized and will receive a single dose of
      study drug (ciraparantag or placebo) intravenously (IV) approximately 3 hours after the
      apixaban dose, followed by serial testing of manual WBCT.

      Subjects are enrolled sequentially into 3 ciraparantag dose cohorts. There will be a safety
      review after completion of treatment in one cohort and prior to initiation of treatment in
      the subsequent cohort.
