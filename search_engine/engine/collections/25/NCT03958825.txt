      very few studies have been conducted to compare the outcomes between open and laparoscopic
      liver resections. So little is known about their advantages and disadvantages. The aim of
      this prospective randomized study is to compare the outcomes between laparoscopic and open
      liver resection in treatment of hepatolithiasis within the left lobes within an enhanced
      recovery after surgery programme.
