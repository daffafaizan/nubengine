      35-40% of people over 65 suffer a drop per year, and above 75 years this percentage is even
      higher, with hip fractures being one of the most serious consequences.With regard to
      malnutrition, the investigators know that aging carries an increased risk of suffering from
      decreased appetite and intake and changes in body composition. According to different series,
      the percentage of malnutrition in patients with hip fracture ranges from 13% to 60%.
      According to the hospital protocols in Spain in elderly people with spontaneous hip fracture,
      it is important to perform a nutritional screening during the first 24-48 hours of admission,
      to evaluate their nutritional status and apply a dietary treatment.

      The IRENE study aims to determine whether phase angle and reactance, measured by electrical
      bioimpedance by vector analysis (BIVA) are related to functional recovery in patients with
      hip fracture.
