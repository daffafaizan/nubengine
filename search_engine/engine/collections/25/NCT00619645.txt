        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 and -5 and
           fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSC): Patients undergo allogeneic
           PBSC on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppressive therapy/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients
           achieve100% donor T-cell chimerism on day 30 without disease recurrence, and
           cyclosporine A (CSA) IV continuously over 24 hours or orally every 12 hours on days -1
           to 60 followed by a taper until day 100 and oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) once every
           12 hours on days 1-40, in the absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD.

      Patients with recurrent disease or < 100% donor T-cell chimerism (on day 30) undergo a 12-day
      CSA and MMF taper followed by escalating doses of previously collected donor leukocyte
      infusion every 4 weeks until 100% donor T-cell chimerism or disease regression, in the
      absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
