    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of berberine (berberine chloride) administered to participants
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission while receiving maintenance therapy with
      mesalamine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the molecular efficacy of berberine by examining the following biomarkers:

        -  Plasma-based measures of inflammation, including the blood C-reaction protein (CRP)
           level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and cytokines such as TNFa, IL-4, IL-6,
           IL-8 and IL-10 measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

        -  Tissue-based measures of inflammation, including TNFα, COX-2, and NF-kappa (κ)B by
           immunohistochemistry (IHC), and anti-cancer action, including antigen Ki-67 (Ki67) and
           activated caspase-3 by IHC, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation on SFRP1,
           TCERG1L FBN2, TFPI2 using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP)
           strategy.

      II. Clinical efficacy: UC related symptoms will be measured using the Ulcerative Colitis
      Disease Activity Index (i.e. the Mayo score) (UCDAI).

      III. Histological analysis for inflammation: severity of histologic inflammation will be
      evaluated using the Geboes grading system.

      IV. Determine plasma concentration of berberine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive berberine chloride orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for 90 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo PO TID for 90 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow-up for 30 days.
