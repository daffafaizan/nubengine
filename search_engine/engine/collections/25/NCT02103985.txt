    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 2 treatment-sequence, and crossover
      study (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical
      study). The study consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 21 days before medication
      administration), a 2-period open-label treatment phase, during which each participant will
      receive 1 of 2 open-label treatment sequences, and the end-of-study or withdrawal assessments
      (within 7-11 days after the last dose of the study medication). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment-sequences: Treatment Sequence AB (dosing in fed [with high fat
      diet] condition followed by dosing in fasted [without food] condition) or Treatment Sequence
      BA (dosing in fasted condition followed by dosing in fed condition). Study medication
      administrations will be separated by a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of
      7 to 14 days. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks.
