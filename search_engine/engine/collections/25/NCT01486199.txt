      changes in liquid absorption in the airways - a central pathophysiological process known to
      be important in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. This technique may provide a measure of
      disease severity and indication of therapeutic correction in advance of currently available
      outcome measures. It involves the simultaneous delivery of two radiopharmaceuticals by
      inhalation: one an absorbable small-molecule (Indium-111 labeled
      diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; In-DTPA) and the other a non-absorbable particle
      (Technetium 99m labeled sulfur colloid; Tc-SC). The overarching hypothesis is that In-DTPA
      absorption provides a quantifiable, non-invasive measurement of airway liquid absorption that
      (a) is sensitive to CF genotype, (b) uniquely identifies basic disease phenotype and predicts
      disease severity, and (c) is modulated by therapeutic interventions.
