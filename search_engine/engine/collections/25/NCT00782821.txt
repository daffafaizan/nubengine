      rejection have not been established. This pilot, prospective, randomized study evaluated
      addition of B cell/plasma cell-targeting agents to T cell-based induction with rabbit
      antithymocyte globulin (rATG) in high immunologic risk renal transplant recipients. Patients
      were randomized to induction with rATG, rATGþrituximab, rATGþbortezomib or
      rATGþrituximabþbortezomib.
