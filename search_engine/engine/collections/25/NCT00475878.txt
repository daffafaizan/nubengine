      in this study. Enrolled study participants will complete interviews at baseline and again
      every two weeks for a total of 8 interviews over 3 months. In this double-blind randomized
      controlled trial, participants will either receive a placebo or escitalopram (10mg). All
      participants will also be followed by their Buprenorphine clinic medical provider. Questions
      during the face-to-face interviews will assess mood, drug craving, pain, sleep, medication
      adherence and drug-related experiences. Comparison(s): Participants randomized into the
      medication component of the study as compared to participants randomized into the placebo
      component of the study.
