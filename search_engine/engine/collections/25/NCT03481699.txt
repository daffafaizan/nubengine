      severe suffering. Although there are good intervention programs for children and adolescents
      at risk, the results for universal interventions have generally been poor. The current
      project will test the efficacy of an Intervention based on the Implicit Theories of
      Personality (ITP). This procedure has recently been developed at US by David S. Yeager and
      colleagues, with extraordinary results in the reduction of depression, stress, and
      aggression. The project includes the following aims: (1) the evaluation of the efficacy of
      the ITP on depressive symptoms (Study 1) and aggressive behavior (Study 2) in Spanish
      adolescents; (2) to test whether the intervention changes biological and cognitive variables;
      (3) to identify whether development and sex moderates the effects of the intervention; and
      (4) to test whether temperament moderates the effect of the intervention. The study involves
      the evaluation of the intervention in a sample of around 900 adolescents (12-18 years),
      randomly allocated to experimental and control condition. It is a field experiment conducted
      in high schools and involves multiple measures over time (self-reports and parent reports; as
      well as levels of cortisol, testosterone and DHEA in saliva in a subset -50%- of the
      participants). In summary, the project aims to respond to the challenge of health and
      wellness in the population through a randomized controlled trial with multiple sources of
      measure and from a biopsychosocial perspective. The ITP intervention has the potential to
      become a universal intervention to help reduce the rates of depression and bullying.
