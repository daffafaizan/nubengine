    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate and compare the prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction in uterine cancer
      survivors by modality of treatment and to compare with a control group with no history of
      cancer using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the degree of sexual dysfunction in uterine cancer survivors by modality of
      treatment using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) as a continuous measure, and to
      compare to a non-cancer control group.

      II. To compare the long term quality of life (QoL) (using the FSFI, the Pelvic Floor Impact
      Questionnaire [PFIQ], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Cancer [FACT-En],
      Brief Pain Inventory [BPI], Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale [ADAS]/Cancer Rehabilitation
      Evaluation System for Research [CARES] dating scale and Menopausal survey) of patients who
      were treated with surgery and radiotherapy versus surgery alone (with or without
      chemotherapy), and to compare to a control group with no history of cancer.

      III. To evaluate associations between dose volume parameters of organs at risk and pelvic
      floor symptoms using the PFIQ and PFDI.

      IV. To evaluate associations between the radiation and surgical technique and quality of life
      (including pelvic symptoms and sexual function using the FSFI, PFIQ, PFDI, and FACT-En).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires over 45-60 minutes consisting of demographic, treatment,
      lifestyle, disease, and comorbidity questions, as well as multiple study instruments
      assessing quality of life as it pertains to common toxicities of uterine cancer treatment.
