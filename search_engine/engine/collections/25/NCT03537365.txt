        1. To investigate the safety, tolerability and the preliminary effects of BC, used as an
           HMF for MM and DM in very preterm infants.

        2. To facilitate the determination of sample size for a later, larger RCT with NEC- and
           LOS-free survival as the primary outcome.

        3. To assess the feasibility of study procedures, incl. recruitment rates, parental
           consent, adherence, sample collection, and clinical routines.

      Participants Parents to eligible very preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
      Units (NICU) at Nanshan People's Hospital (NAN) and Baoan Maternal and Children's Hospital in
      Shenzen, China will be asked for participation.

      Since this is a pilot trial, a conventional sample size calculation, using only one primary
      outcome, is not required. The aim is to include 200 infants (100 per group), which is
      expected to give sufficient strength to demonstrate effects on the chosen feasibility
      outcomes and secondary blood and stool variables (see protocol). Statistical analyses will be
      performed blindly on both intention-to-treat and per protocol basis. Continuous outcomes will
      be summarized as mean and standard deviation (e.g., body weight) or median and interquartile
      range (e.g. time to reach full enteral feeding). Binary outcomes (e.g. incidence of NEC) will
      be presented as counts and percentages. To test the preliminary effects of BC, clinical and
      para-clinical outcomes will be compared between the two groups. The estimates will be
      presented as relative risk and absolute risk difference, difference between means, or hazard
      ratio, depending on the type of outcome. The estimates will be presented with a 95%
      confidence interval. Further statistical analyses are described in the protocol.
