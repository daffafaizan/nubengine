      including leukemia and lymphoma, many patients with relapsed or refractory diseases do not
      respond to the standard treatments. It has been shown that anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells
      may be an effective approach to treat the relapsed or refractory diseases. The procedure
      involves collecting PBMCs from the patients and modifying the T cells to attack the malignant
      B cells. In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) containing the signaling domains of CD28 or 4-1BB and CD3-zeta will be
      infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. The
      patients will be pretreated with a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen before the
      infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and will be monitored for safety, adverse events,
      persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and the treatment efficacy.
