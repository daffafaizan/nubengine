    
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which
      mutations in human Cu, Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) have been identified as a cause of
      familial ALS (FALS) cases.1-2 It has been shown that mutant SOD1 develops a novel toxic
      function through experiments demonstrating that many disease mutants maintain enzymatic
      activity, SOD1-null mice do not exhibit ALS symptoms, and co-expressed wild type protein does
      not rescue the disease-state.7-11 The majority of cases, however, are not caused directly by
      mutations of SOD1, instead being caused by a poorly understood interplay of several genes as
      well as environmental factors, which is often referred to as sporadic ALS (SALS).3 It has
      been found that FALS and SALS share similar pathology. 4-6 The hSOD1 protein aggregates
      characteristic of FALS have also been found in SALS patients, furthering the evidence that
      hSOD1 has an important role in the etiology of ALS in sporadic ALS patients.16-19 The exact
      mechanism of SOD1-associated toxicity has not yet been elucidated though many disease mutants
      have been shown to destabilize the SOD1 dimer. In this study we aim to compare the levels of
      SOD1 post-tra slational modifications in ALS patients to levels in healthy donors and to
      determine if there are distinct patterns of protein glutathionylation or phosphorylation. Our
      overall goal is to elucidate a direct mechanism of toxicity in SALS as well as identify
      potentially critical triggers
