      different treatments. The treatments were high-fat breakfast muffins containing either butter
      (control) or pecans. The investigators recruited healthy, normal-weight adults between the
      ages of 15 and 45y. Study visits were completed in a random order with at least 72 hours
      between each visit. Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and fasting and postprandial blood
      samples were collected at each visit.

      Hypothesis: The pecan-enriched meal will blunt the post-meal increase in glucose, insulin,
      triglycerides (TG), and lipid peroxidation while improving all measures of subjective
      appetite and TAC compared to the traditional meal without nuts.
