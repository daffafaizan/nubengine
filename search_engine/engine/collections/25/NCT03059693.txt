    
      This study is a 17 week (119 days) randomized, double-blind, in home use study among 48 male
      and female subjects with moderate to severe active atopic dermatitis (AD). The study will
      include subjects with ages 12 - 65 years old inclusive. Group assignments will be balanced by
      disease severity, age, and body location of AD lesions (listed in order of importance). The
      study will consist of a 1 week washout period, 12 week treatment phase and a 4 week
      regression phase. During the treatment phase, subject will be provided one of the two test
      products to use twice daily on all lesions and non-lesional areas as instructed. No
      additional creams, lotions or soaps other than provided test products will be allowed
      throughout the duration of the study. Measurements, expert visual assessments and
      self-assessments will be taken as described below. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated
      by incidence of AE's (defined per CTCAE), exacerbations, application site
      reactions/infections, and lab evals. There will also be consumption/compliance checks and
      dermatological evaluations at each visit.
