      Alegre, South of Brazil, a city of 1.4 million inhabitants. The trial included health centers
      that provide primary care services predominantly to low-income families.Physicians, nurses
      and administrative staff of all intervention health centers participated in a training in
      January 2008 based on the "Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding for Brazilian Children from Birth to
      Two Years of Age" guideline.

      Following staff training at the intervention sites, interviewers visited the intervention and
      control health centers from April to December 2008 to identify and enroll pregnant women who
      were in the last trimester of pregnancy. 98% of eligible pregnant women agreed to participate
      and answered a questionnaire about their socioeconomic status and expected due date.
      Addresses and telephone numbers were obtained in order to schedule subsequent home visits.

      Data Collection:

      Maternal interviews using structured questionnaires were conducted at baseline (during
      pregnancy - 2008) and at follow-up home-visits at mean child ages six months (2008/2009), 12
      months (2009/2010) , three years (2011/2012) and six years (2014/2015) by field workers who
