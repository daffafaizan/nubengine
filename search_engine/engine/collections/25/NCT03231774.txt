      right heart catheterization are important tools in the diagnosis and progress monitoring of
      heart failure.

      Gold standard in diagnosis of hemodynamic parameters in patients with heart failure is right
      heart catheterization. However, this diagnostic device represents an invasive method that is
      additionally associated with high risks such as infections, vessel and nerve injuries.
      Echocardiography is probably in a position to determine hemodynamic parameters as reliably as
      right heart catheterization without additional health risk due to its non-invasive character.
      All procedures performed are part of clinical Routine. Patients do not undergo any
      study-specific procedure at all.
