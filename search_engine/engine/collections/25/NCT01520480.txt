      The Register is a quality-control database which prospectively collects individual-based
      information on patients operated for skeletal metastases in the long bones and pelvis. Data
      on patient identity, age, sex, primary tumor, location of metastases, type of pathological
      fracture, and perioperative treatment were gathered. Information concerning surgical
      procedures such as method of fixation, type of implant, and postoperative complications are
      registered. Moreover, some clinical data such as pain levels (no, light, moderate, strong, or
      severe pain), pain medication use, mobility, and the Karnofsky performance score are
      recorded.

      We will identify all patients surgically treated for pathological subtrochanteric femur
      fractures during 1999-2009.

      The Stockholm Hip Fracture Group provides data on the reference group. During 2003, a
      consecutive series of patients with acute non-pathological subtrochanteric femur fractures
      treated in Stockholm were included in a prospective cohort study. The regional ethical review
      board located at the Karolinska Institutet approved the study (DNR 206/02).

      The aim of this study is to analyze survival and reoperation rates of patients operated for
      pathological subtrochanteric femur fracture. We want compare those findings with a cohort of
      patients with non-pathological subtrochanteric fractures.
