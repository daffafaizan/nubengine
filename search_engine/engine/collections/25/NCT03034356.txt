      substantially diminished quality of life. Improved treatment strategies clearly are needed.
      Recent studies suggest taht an overactive hippocampus is associated with cognitive deficits
      in the illness. Based on findings that the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) reduces
      hippocampal activity and improves cognition in other clinical populations while being safe
      and well-tolerated, this study will examine the effects of the drug on hippocampal activity
      and cognition in Veterans with schizophrenia. In this crossover design, participants will
      take LEV for 4 weeks and placebo pills for 4 weeks, but will not know the order in which they
      are taking them.
