      I. To prospectively collect tissue (including primary inflammatory breast cancer [IBC],
      ipsilateral nodal metastasis and/or distant metastasis [if applicable] obtained prior to
      primary systemic therapy and mastectomy/axillary dissection), serum, plasma, whole blood,
      clinical, and imaging data from patients with recently diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer
      (IBC), or highly suspicious for IBC, who have not received systemic therapy.

      II. To collect paraffin tissue blocks or unstained slides (including primary, ipsilateral
      nodal metastasis and/or distant metastasis [if applicable] obtained prior to primary systemic
      therapy), mastectomy/axillary dissection tissue, serum, plasma, whole blood, clinical, and
      imaging data (if available) from patients with previously diagnosed inflammatory breast
      cancer (IBC), who have been treated or partially treated, but have not had mastectomy and are
      seeking further treatment in the IBC clinic at M. D. Anderson or participating cancer network
      sites.

      III. To collect oral swab, skin and stool bacterial culture swab for microbiome analysis to
      compare patients with specific breast cancer subtype to report changes in flora during the
      course of treatment and correlated to toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires and participate in interview over 30 minutes. Patients also
      undergo collection of medical data and blood, tissue, and stool samples.
