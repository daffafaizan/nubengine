      the application of specific exercises for scapulothoracic muscles and rotator cuff on pain
      reduction and improvement of upper limb function, supervised or performed at home, and these
      same exercises associated with other therapies promote a greater reduction in pain and
      improvement in disability.

      Currently, the evidence of better methodological quality present in the literature13 points
      out that the performance of motor control exercises focused on the scapula associated with
      mobilization and stretching generate pain improvement and clinically relevant improvement of
      the function. The few studies in this area have great methodological diversity with
      significant limitations. The hypothesis is that patients with subacromial pain syndrome who
      will receive traditional exercise protocol with the addition of neuromuscular training will
      show less functional disability, a greater reduction in pain intensity, increase muscle
      strength and range of motion when compared to the patient group that will receive only the
      protocol without neuromuscular training, immediately after the intervention, four and eight
      weeks and four months after randomization and that these benefits are clinically relevant.
