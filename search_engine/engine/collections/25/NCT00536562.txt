      Two hundred consecutive patients from Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPC) at London Health
      Sciences Centre and the Ottawa Hospital (100 patients from each site) who have sustained a
      Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or mild non-disabling stroke will participate in a randomized
      controlled trial in which they will either receive Usual Care (UC) as delivered by the SPC,
      or enter the existing multi-disciplinary 6-month comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR)
      intervention at LHSC and Ottawa in addition to receiving UC. This study seeks to determine
      the benefits of providing a CR program to TIA/mild non-disabling stroke patients.
