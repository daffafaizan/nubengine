    
      The EnSite Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System is a newly developed system that introduces
      features such as Delayed Enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DE-MRI) image integration,
      lesion marking automaticity, automatic mapping, and workflow flexibility to aid in the
      success of complex ablation procedures. Utilization of this system in the treatment of
      complex ablation procedures and its impact on patient outcomes is not well characterized.
      This clinical study is designed to collect a broad range of usage scenarios, therefore this
      clinical study has limited patient selection criteria and data collection is focused on
      EnSite Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System usage and patient outcomes.

      The data collected from the procedure (performed per Instructions For Use (IFU) and per
      standard practice of the physician) as well as the 12 month follow up period enables the
      Sponsor to review the system's standard practice usage. This information will be added to the
      current knowledge and understanding of treatment options for patients with arrhythmias, which
      can assist the Sponsor to provide future recommendations for best practices to improve
      patient outcomes.
