    
      The purpose of this research study is to study the safety and effectiveness of a drug called
      bortezomib for the treatment of autoimmune cytopenia(s) (low blood cell counts) after bone
      marrow transplant that are not responding to standard treatments. Autoimmune cytopenias are
      low blood counts due to antibodies or proteins produced against an individual's own blood
      cells. Having a low red blood cell count (anemia) can make a person feel tired and require
      blood transfusions frequently. A low platelet count (blood cells that help blood to clot) can
      make a person bleed or bruise easily. A low neutrophil (white blood cell) count can make a
      person have infections.

      All of these things can be a serious complication after bone marrow transplant and can cause
      prolonged hospital stay. Bortezomib is being used in children with certain types of blood
      cancer, however, bortezomib has not been used in children with autoimmune cytopenia(s) and
      its use in this study is investigational.
