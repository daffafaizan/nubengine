      genotypic bioinformatics: Plink, Haploview, STATA, IMPUTE2, SNPtest, GTOOL, Galaxy
      management. In addition, the investigators have support of Spanish Consortium for Genetics of
      Stroke (Genestroke). The PLINK software is the main program for the analysis of GWAS. Using
      this software we can clean the raw results of genotyping platforms and determine the presence
      of risk alleles associated with resistance to the study drugs. Haploview software will be
      used for data management and graphics for significance analysis. STATA statistical software
      is a data management and very useful for the creation of Q_Q plots graphs that assist in the
      interpretation of genotypic results. GTOOL, SNPtest and IMPUTE2 are software for data
      imputation and analysis of imputed data through the information available in the 1000 Genomes
      Project.
