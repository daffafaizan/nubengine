      endoclips for closing procedure associated gastrointestinal perforation under endoscopy,
      which is one of the most severe complications and needs timely treatment. Endoclips have been
      widely used in closing the gastrointestinal perforations, but the location of the endoclips
      could significantly influence the effective rate. In addition, multiple endoclips will be
      needed for a relatively large perforation, which could increase the medical cost and the
      procedure time. At recent, a new purse string suture device has been developed and introduced
      to the clinicalmanagement of such patients with gastrointestinal perforations. A loop was
      equipped in this device, which could be tightened. Thus, compared with endoclips, this device
      could be more convenient and effective in completely closing the gastrointestinal
      perforations. This study will test whether purse string suture device will increase the
      effectiveness of treating procedure associated gastrointestinal perforations under endoscopy
      in a randomized controlled trial.
