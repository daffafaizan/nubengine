    
      This is a multicenter ,prospective, randomized double blind study. This study has a 2-arm
      design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY™ stent to
      the uncoated Bx VELOCITY™ stent, both mounted on Raptor® Stent Delivery Systems. A total of
      100 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be either randomized to Treatment A or Treatment B.
      Neither the investigator nor the patient will know which stent will be implanted. Patients
      will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure,
      with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months. Additionally, medical costs
      associated with the index hospitalization and length of stay, and repeat hospitalizations and
      costs associated with other relevant medical resource use during the 5 years follow-up period
      will be collected and analyzed.
