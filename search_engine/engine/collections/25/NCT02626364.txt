      patients with recurrent/refractory glioblastoma with PDGFRA gene amplification. Eligible
      patients include those with recurrent/refractory glioblastoma after prior therapy including
      surgery, radiation, and temozolomide. The trial is designed to assess the anti-tumor activity
      of crenolanib in recurrent/refractory glioblastoma with PDGFRA gene amplification based on
      the estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Symptom burden will be
      evaluated using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT).

      Crenolanib will be administered orally continuously at 100 mg TID on a 28-day cycle basis .
      Patients are allowed to receive crenolanib for a maximum of 26 cycles if clinical benefit has
      been observed.
