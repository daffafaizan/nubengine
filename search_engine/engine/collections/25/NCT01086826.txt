    
      This multicenter open label randomised phase III study is the implementation of a previous
      phase II randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy with or without
      neoadjuvant TPF chemotherapy in locally advanced Head and Neck cancer. Assuming a
      randomisation ratio of 1:1, using the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank test, 204 events are
      required in order to achieve a power of 0.80 of detecting an hazard ratio of 0.675 in favour
      of the experimental treatment with a type I error of 0.05, two-sided. With a uniform accrual
      of 4 years and a follow-up of 2 further years, the total number of required patients is 420
      (210 per arm) to detect an absolute difference of 12% in 3 year overall survival in favour of
      the neoadjuvant arm (from 52.5% to 64.5%).Since the 101 patients randomized in the phase II
      part of the study will be included in the final analysis, 319 new patients are needed to
      complete the trial.The total number of 420 patients will be able to detect a difference of
      10%, (from 35% to 45%) in terms of grade 3/4 in-field mucosal toxicity during the concomitant
      treatment (radiotherapy plus chemo or cetuximab) with a power of 80%. Within the H&N07 trials
      was introduced a sub-study that allows to investigate the value of circulating marker
      evaluation as predictor of response to anti EGFR therapy in patients with cancer of the head
      and neck.

      The expression level analysis of circulating biological markers will be evaluated on blood
      collected during therapy. The analysis will concern the following biological
      markers:Cytokines angiogenesis and cell adhesion molecules; Proteins involved in the EGFR
      signaling pathway (EGF, TGF-a, s-EGFR);circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating
      endothelial cells (CEC).
