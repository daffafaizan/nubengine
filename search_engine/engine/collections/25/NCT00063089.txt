      pathogen. Because it is a common cause of osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and meningitis, S.
      aureus infections lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this
      study will be to test the safety and pharmacokinetics of Altastaph in patients with S. aureus
      bacteremia and persistent fever. This study will also assess the efficacy of Altastaph versus
      control.
