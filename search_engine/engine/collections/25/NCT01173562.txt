      investigator), single-center, single-dose, single-arm (ie, 1 treatment group) safety study.
      This study will consist of a screening visit on Day 1 at which time all study-related
      screening procedures will be performed. After all results are reviewed, children who meet all
      of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the
      open-label phase of the study. A single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be
      administered on Day 1 and the children will remain at the study site so that adverse events
      can be recorded at approximately 30 minutes postdose. Study participants will return to the
      study site 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) postdose at which time adverse events will be
      recorded again. Safety will be monitored during the study by assessing adverse events by
      direct observation at 30 minutes after dosing and at 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) after
      dosing, by direct observation of the study participant, report by the parent or guardian, or
      both. On Day 1, a single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be chewed and swallowed by
      each study participant. If desired, study participants will be allowed to drink water when
      administered study drug.
