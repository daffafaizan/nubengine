      1: Firstly, single electric nerve stimulation and repetitive electric nerve stimulations
      causing temporal pain summation. The stimulations were given at 50, 75 and 100% of the
      thresholds for pain tolerance and temporal pain summation. Secondly, the volunteers were
      exposed to cold pain by use of two different Cold Pressor Tests (CPT) with water temperatures
      at 8 and 1 Celsius. All measurements were repeated after an hour to test reproducibility.

      At study day 2: Brief Thermal Stimulation were used with two different temperatures and
      duration.
