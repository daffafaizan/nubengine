      in a 1:1 ratio with age stratification (three strata: 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years).

      The study will start on September 2019 at the Department of Cervical Cancer Prevention at the
      Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. To obtain results
      representative for the entire country several sites are planned for inclusion in the study
      from 2020 in 10 regions of Poland.

      Primary end-points include the detection rate of histologically confirmed high grade
      intraepithelial lesions or worse in each screening arm. Selected secondary endpoints include
      detection rate ratios, colposcopy referral rates and positive predictive values of referral
      for colposcopy.

      Additionally, biobanking of cytological samples taken from patients participating in the
      HIPPO Project is planned in Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology
      for the purpose of potential future restrospective analyses if new cervical cancer screening
      technologies emerge.

      The study has been approved by a local bioethics committee.
