    
      Subjects: In this study, a total of 600-800 patients with severe carotid artery stenosis or
      occlusion who scheduled for CEA are recruited.

      Data collection:

        1. The plaque characteristics, stenosis degrees of carotid artery and intracranial
           arteries, and collateral circulation are evaluated by ultrasound prior to the procedure.

        2. CT, MRI and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were applied pre- and post-procedure
           to identify the clinical events.

      Endpoint: The combination endpoints events of death, cerebral hemorrhage , newly cerebral
      infarction, hyperperfusion syndrome within 30-day after the procedure.

      Statistical analysis plans: The Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS version 22.0)
      software are used for statistical analysis. The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve and hosmer-lemeshow test were used to evaluate the discrimination
      and calibration of the risk prediction model.
