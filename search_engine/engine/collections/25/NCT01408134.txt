      indicates myocardial segments with a reduced likelihood of functional recovery following
      myocardial revascularization. Preliminary evidence suggests that multi-detector CT (MDCT)
      angiography also can detect irreversible myocardial scarring through the detection of regions
      of delayed hyperenhancement (DE) of the myocardium.1-4 However, existing studies have been
      performed in single centers, and the reproducibility, and impact of this modality on recovery
      of myocardial function is unknown. In this study, the investigators propose a single-center
      trial using a standardized MDCT DE protocol among patients scheduled for clinical cardiac CT
      with planned reoperative surgical. The primary endpoint will be characteristics of DE imaging
      of the myocardium including its inter-reader variability and factors associated with image
      quality. These findings will further our understanding of the role of DE MDCT for the
      detection of myocardial viability.
