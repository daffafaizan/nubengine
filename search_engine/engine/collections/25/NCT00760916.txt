    
      This study is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in subjects with PAH who are currently receiving approved therapy for their PAH (i.e.,
      endothelin receptor antagonist and/or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor)or as a monotherapy
      treatment. Study visits will occur at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks with the key measure of
      efficacy being the 6-minute walk test. Study procedures include routine blood tests, medical
      history, physical exams, disease evaluation, and exercise tests. At the end of the first
      12-weeks, the patient will be un-blinded. Patients will continue with another 12-Week open
      label portion with visits occuring at 4-week intervals.

      Patients who complete all assessments for 24-weeks will also be eligible to enter a 36 month
      open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).
