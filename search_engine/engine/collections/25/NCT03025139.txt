      I. To evaluate the efficacy of two different types of group interventions (mindfulness and
      survivorship education), specifically tailored to the needs of younger female breast cancer
      survivors, in reducing depressive symptoms, compared to a usual care control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of the two interventions relative to a usual care control group on
      fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms.

      II. To examine the efficacy of the two interventions relative to a usual care control group
      on circulating and genomic markers of inflammation.

      III. To explore potential moderators and mediators of intervention efficacy in the two
      intervention groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS PRACTICES [MAPs]): Patients attend a mindfulness meditation
      class over 2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients then attend in person booster sessions
      that include guided meditation, questions, and discussion of how to maintain a mindfulness
      practice over 1 hour once monthly for 3 months.

      ARM B (SURVIVORSHIP EDUCATION INTERVENTION [SE]): Patients attend a survivorship education
      class over 2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also receive monthly electronic
      newsletters with tailored information about topics of interest to younger survivors,
      including cancer-related events in the community and tips about following through on
      recommendations for healthy living.

      ARM C (USUAL CARE/DELAYED TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP): Patients receive usual care for 9 months.
      Patients are then offered a choice of participating in Arm A or Arm B.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
