      chronic analgesic therapy and quality of life (through a dedicated questionnaire - Euro QoL
      5D5L1) will be recorded. Surgical data (type of procedure, lobe affected by resection, type
      of approach and surgical time) and anesthesiological data (intravenous opioid, locoregional
      technique (s), non-opioid analgesics administered and other medications) will be collected in
      the perioperative phase. In the 48 hours following the surgery (in the Recovery Room, at 6h,
      12h, 24h, 36h and 48h) the patient's pain data will be recorded (static, dynamic and
      cough-associated NRS) and those relating to any complications. The total amount of morphine
      administered to the patient in the first 48 hours will also be recorded. Each patient will be
      evaluated 7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after the surgery by telephone interview. In this last
      phase, the possible presence of pain and its characteristics will be assessed, especially if
      these meet the criteria of neuropathic pain.
