      study drug is re-used, but in the end only the most-registered case of the subject would be
      collected.

      The recommended treatment plan for this study is from the usage and dosage of NIF. The
      clinician can make appropriate adjustments to the specific usage and dosage according to the
      patient's condition.

      Load dose: Adults usually use 0.3mg/kg each time, under continuous ECG monitoring, the
      injection should be completed within 5 minutes, and the maximum dose should not exceed 0.5
      mg/kg.

      Maintenance dose: After load injection, the adult routine dose is 0.4 mg/kg/h under
      continuous ECG monitoring. The dosage could be appropriately increased or decreased according
      to the patient's reaction, but the maximum dose should not exceed 0.8 mg/kg/h.
