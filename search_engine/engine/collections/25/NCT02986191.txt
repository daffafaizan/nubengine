      autologous soft tissue grafts (connective tissue graft or free gingival grafts) or allografts
      like acellular dermal which can be used as substitutes for palatal donor tissue. MucograftÂ®
      (3D collagen matrix) is also an allograft from porcine origin and is designed for soft tissue
      regeneration and considered the ideal solution to autogenous soft tissue grafts and it
      provides an ideal matrix for blood vessel and soft tissue ingrowth.
