      administration to prevent cardiovascular events in some at risk individuals. We seek to
      describe the effect of chronic aspirin administration at varying doses on platelet
      aggregation. This will help to define mechanisms for aspirin failure and to pursue possible
      alternative therapies in patients who fail to respond to aspirin therapy.

      We hypothesize that (1) inhibition by aspirin (ASA) of ex vivo-induced platelet aggregation
      varies in a predictable time and dose dependent manner, (2) thromboxane and prostacyclin
      production is inhibited by ASA in a dose-dependent manner and remains relatively constant
      over time once maximal inhibition has occurred, and (3) granule secretion by platelets during
      induced aggregation is inhibited by aspirin acutely but this effect does not persist during
      chronic administration at high doses.
