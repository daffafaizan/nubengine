      resection of the primary tumor. Non-invasive assessment of tumor metabolism is possible in
      vivo by means of positron emission tomography (PET)-scanning. Therefore, FDG-PET scan offers
      a suitable approach to determine the influence of removal of a primary colorectal tumor on
      metabolic activity of the liver metastases. The FDG uptake in the liver metastases is
      quantified by calculating standardised uptake values (SUVs).
