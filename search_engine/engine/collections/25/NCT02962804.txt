    
      Patients with metastatic or recurrent renal cell cancer who have progressed on standard
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy and who have metastatic or primary tumors suitable
      for palliative radiation will be eligible for this study. Treatment will consist of nivolumab
      plus hypofractionated radiation therapy. The primary endpoint will be objective response
      rate, which will be compared against the historical control of 25% using nivolumab alone as
      established in the CHECKMATE 025 clinical trial. Patients will continue on nivolumab until
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Follow-up will continue for 2 years.
