      and endometrium from women with endometriosis compared to healthy women. Our hypothesis is
      that telomere shortening and high telomerase activity will be found in tissues from women
      with endometriosis, compared to women without endometriosis.

      A prospective study that compares telomeres and telomerase levels in different lesions of
      endometriosis and endometrial tissue of women with endometriosis and healthy women without
      endometriosis. The study group will consist of women with suspected endometriosis facing
      surgical treatment and the control group will consist of healthy women facing gynecologic
      surgery for different indication.

      We will sample endometrial tissue in both groups. In the study group we additionally will
      sample endometriosis lesion.

      The samples collected will test for histological diagnosis of endometriosis and verification
      tests will be done to characterize the telomeres array and telomerase levels and other
      characteristics for genomic instability such as spontaneous aneuploidy.

      expect telomere shortening and high telomerase activity in endometrial tissue and in
      endometriosis tissue sample, that won't characterize samples from women without
      endometriosis.
