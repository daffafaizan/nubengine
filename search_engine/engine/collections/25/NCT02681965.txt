    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of modifying the LEAN intervention
      (NCT02110641) to make it more cost effective by reducing or eliminating the counseling
      sessions. To guide the modification of the intervention one or more focus group sessions with
      former LEAN participants will be conducted. The purpose of these meetings will be to gain
      input on enhancing the LEAN book.

      The LEAN book will be central to the modified intervention, but the LEAN book will be
      modified based on feedback from the focus group(s) and experience gained from the LEAN study.
      The reading level of the LEAN book will also be assessed to ensure acceptability to those
      with a low literacy level.

      Once these changes have been finalized, the efficacy of the modified program will be tested
      using the methods described in the Brief Summary.
