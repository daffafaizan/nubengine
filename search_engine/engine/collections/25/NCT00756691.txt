    
      A Phase I Radiopharmacokinetic and Radiodosimetric study of 18F-FAZA. Prior to treatment,
      subjects will receive a single injection of 18F-FAZA. Subjects will undergo a series of 5-5
      PET scans, and will have 8-13 blood samples and 2 urine samples taken at specified time
      points over a 4.5-5.5 hour period. 18F-FAZA PET images will be reviewed to develop a dynamic
      uptake model, and blood and urine samples will be analyzed for unchanged 18F-FAZA and its
      metabolites.
