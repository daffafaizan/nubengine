      obtain safety and tolerability data when MBS2320 is administered orally as single and
      multiple doses to healthy subjects (parts A to C). The effect of MBS2320 on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of the first-line rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy, methotrexate
      (MTX), and the effect of MTX on the PK of MBS2320, will also be evaluated in a cohort
      consisting of subjects with RA (Part D).
