    
      Additionally to clinical routine tests, we will investigate the following possible predictors
      of cognitive dysfunction after STN-DBS in PD:

        -  Imaging biomarkers: volume of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) measured on
           preoperative MRI and data driven search for unknown MRI characteristics relating to the
           incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder by means of Deep Learning
           (Convolutional Neural Networks), test of previously established classification models

        -  Molecular biomarkers in CSF: TAU, phospho-TAU, ß-Amyloid 1-40 and 1-42 measured
           preoperatively

        -  Comorbidity: according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index

        -  Nutritional Status: defined by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF)

        -  Duration of intra-/perioperative brake of dopaminergic medication

        -  Nature and depth of anaesthesia: general or conscious sedation and depth of
           consciousness: as measured by 4 channel electroencephalography (SedLine®) and during
           implantation of impulse generator

        -  Incidence and duration of postoperative delirium: defined according to the Diagnostic
           and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and/or as ≥ 2 points in the nursing
           Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) and/or a positive Confusion Assessment Method for the
           Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) score, assessment three times daily during hospital stay

        -  Length of stay at ICU / hospital

        -  Postoperative organ complications: according to Clavien-Dindo classification

        -  Localisation of bilateral electrodes and active contacts on postoperative imaging

      Substudies

      Correlation of domain specific CANTAB connect test scores with possible predictors and
      incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder

      Social Cognition: comparison of pre- and postoperative Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities
      measured by the Yoni-Paradigma (assesses affective and cognitive ToM)

      The resulting multivariate risk model is expected

        -  to improve peri- and intraoperative management by identifying avoidable risk factors for
           the development of postoperative cognitive deficit

        -  to support evidence-based and personalized decision-making when advising PD patients
           considering STN-DBS

        -  to result in the development of future hypothesis-driven interventional trials on the
           basis of biomarker-based sub-grouping of patients

        -  to allow a better understanding of underlying pathophysiological processes both PD and
           surgery-related regarding cognitive effects of STN-DBS
