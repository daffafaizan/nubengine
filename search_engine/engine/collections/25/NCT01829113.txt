      cancer (NSCLC) compared with supportive care alone, with non-squamous NSCLC patients treated
      with platinum/pemetrexed living longer than patients treated with platinum/gemcitabine.
      Despite these advances, poor outcomes with advanced disease warrant exploration of novel
      drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence in lung cancer models shows
      promising antitumor activity with OGX-427 in combination with platinum based therapy or
      pemetrexed. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study, pemetrexed and
      carboplatin plus OGX-427 followed by maintenance pemetrexed and OGX-427 will be compared with
      pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by maintenance pemetrexed and placebo in
      patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
