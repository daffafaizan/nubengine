      the endobronchial pathway that is created by virtual bronchoscopy, the flexible bronchoscope
      will be navigated to the regions of interest and an optical biopsy of the region will be
      obtained using pCLE. One biopsy sample will be processed in the endoscopy suite to be able to
      prepare it for micro-CT analysis.
