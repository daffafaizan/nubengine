      complications like residual pleural effusion and pneumothorax therefore it is common that
      surgeons make a thoracic drainage by introducing intercostal tubes for evacuation of air and
      fluid from the pleural space. Complications extend to involve the parenchymal pulmonary
      tissue causing consolidation or involve the interstitial tissue .all these complications
      affect the postoperative recovery.

      As a classical technique a daily chest X-ray is performed from first day of surgical
      intervention to hospital discharge to assess the amount of residual pleural effusion so
      drainage removal can be done or not and also assess other pulmonary complications.

      However, chest X-rays are costly, exposing patients and health care workers to ionizing
      radiation requiring patient movement with chest drains, difficult positioning of the patient
      to get good films, and time consuming.

      On the other hand, using chest ultrasound is a good alternative for chest X-ray because it is
      a bedside, easier, more sensitive and accurate in detection of pulmonary complications.

      Its main advantages represented in avoiding the danger of ionizing radiations, easier device
      portability, low cost and a rapid learning curve.

      So it is easy and less time consuming to correlate between ultrasound findings and clinical
      data and assist in invasive procedures.

      Hypothesis that detecting pulmonary complications postoperative using chest ultrasound is
      easier, more sensitive and accurate compared to chest X-ray.
