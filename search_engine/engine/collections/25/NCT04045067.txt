      symptomatic treatment of atrial fibrillation. The interest of substrate ablation, completing
      the isolation of the pulmonary veins is controversial. The usual technique for the ablation
      of recurrent atrial fibrillation is primarily a disconnection of the pulmonary veins, which
      can be accomplished by isolating the veins one by one or two by two. The isolation of the
      pulmonary veins is followed most often by a defragmentation of the atrium (ablation of the
      substrate). The defragmentation is guided by a map of fragmented potentials, made through a
      topography catheter, to locate the most abnormal areas that are the target of ablation. This
      strategy requires extensive ablation of the left atrium, with a long procedure time and
      repeated many radiofrequency shots. On the one hand there is a risk of complication related
      to the duration of intervention, but also in the longer term of occurrence of flutter scar.
      In addition to pulmonary vein isolation, the goal is to identify patients with sinus rhythm
      atrial arrhythmogenic substrate. Once the sinus rhythm has been restored by electrical
      cardioversion or spontaneously, a voltage map is carried out to identify the most abnormal
      (low voltage) areas, and intra-atrial fragmented potentials are identified, either
      spontaneously or spontaneously by the extra-stimulus method. Ablation of these abnormal areas
      may lead to better long-term results, limiting prolonged radiofrequency shots and
      complications associated with longer procedure times.
