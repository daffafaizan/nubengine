      (mHealth-CR) improves functional capacity in older adults (age â‰¥70) with ischemic heart
      disease (IHD), identified at the time of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), compared with usual
      care. Our central hypotheses related to efficacy are that mHealth-CR will (1) improve
      functional capacity (primary outcome), (2) improve goal attainment, health status, and
      activities of daily living, and (3) lower rates of hospital readmission and death (secondary
      outcomes). Our central hypothesis related to engagement is that we will identify distinct
      trajectories of engagement and characteristics that predict membership in each category.
