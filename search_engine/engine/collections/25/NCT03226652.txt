      ejection fraction (HFpEF) share similar characteristics. Increasing age, hypertension,
      obesity, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation are well recognised links in both groups.
      It also known that SDB is common in patients with heart failure, both with reduced and
      preserved ejection fraction. It is therefore hypothesised that among patients being referred
      for SDB assessment, we can identify a group with unrecognised HFpEF.
