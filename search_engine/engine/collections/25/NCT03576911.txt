      in addition to being a potent lipophilic antioxidant. Deficits in CoQ10 status have been
      linked to cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, fatigue, and depression. CoQ10
      supplementation may have a potential therapeutic value for patients with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial that
      will compare neurocognitive performance and symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder in participants randomised to active CoQ10 compared to scores from participants who
      received placebo. CoQ10 will be administered at a dose of 300mg/day, delivered in 3 doses of
      100mg each. Participants will take CoQ10/placebo for 6 months. At three time points
      (baseline, 3 months and 6 months) each participant completes a neurocognitive and
      psychological battery of assessments. Blood pressure is monitored, and blood samples to
      assess mitochondrial function and plasma CoQ10 status are taken at each assessment.
