      complications, such as systemic inflammatory response, sepsis, organ dysfunction remain
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The underlying posttraumatic
      pathophysiology remains poorly understood, especially since the polytrauma patients present a
      highly variable patient cohort with complex injury patterns, comorbidities and different
      therapeutic strategies.

      Therefore, the present "NTF_PT_2014" multicenter study of the Trauma Research Network (NTF)
      of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma (DGOU) with its established national
      Polytrauma-serum-bank aims to collect, store, and analyse plasma and serum from
      polytrauma-patients and corresponding clinical data to address:

        1. how trauma modulates the release of danger molecules, inflammatory mediators,
           coagulation factors and novel biomarkers?

        2. how the specific injury pattern affects the posttraumatic response and regenerative
           potential on a organ-, cell, and molecular level?

        3. how could a specific organ- and immune-monitoring predict the clinical outcome?

      Blood will be drawn from anticipated 1000 patients with an injury severity score ≥ 25 at the
      time of hospital admission (in the emergency room), 8 h, 24h, 48, 120 h, and 240 h post
      injury. The biochemical and immune-monitoring data will be correlated to corresponding
      clinical data and data from the German Trauma Registry (TraumaRegister DGU®).

      Blood from age- and sex matched healthy volunteers (n=200) will serve as a control group.

      The study will provide a detailed picture of the molecular danger response after multiple
      injury and may reveal novel therapeutic targets for posttraumatic complications.
