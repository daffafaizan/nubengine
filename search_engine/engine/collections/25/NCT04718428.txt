      purpose of this study is to identify NUSG properties in patients with PsA and healthy
      controls. The investigators recruited patients with PsA according to the CASPAR criteria and
      sex- and age-matched healthy controls into the study. NUSG parameters were examined by
      grayscale and power Doppler techniques for all of the fingernails and first toenails (12
      nails); and five scorings including nail plate impairment score (NPIs), nail plate thickness
      score (NPTs), nail bed thickness score (NBTs), nail thickness score (NTs), and the Doppler
      activity score (DAs) were calculated. The investigators compared the PsA and control groups
      in terms of the NUSG scorings and also documented the discriminative performances (with
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) of the scorings. Then, the feasibility and
      reliability analysis of the NUSG scorings were performed. Finally, the association between
      the NUSG scores and participant characteristics, including sex, age, body weight, height,
      labor market participation, smoking, hemoglobin, disease duration, history of dactylitis,
      current enthesitis, radiographic sacroiliitis, C reactive protein, minimal disease activity,
      Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index, and Psoriasis
      Area Severity Index were explored.
