      the support provider. But little is known about the basic brain mechanisms underlying this
      ability or how this ability can change with practice. To address these questions, this study
      has two parts. In the first, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to gain
      insight into the brain systems involved in helping others regulate negative emotions by
      comparing them to the brain systems involved in regulating the participants' own negative
      emotions. In the second part, participants engage in three weeks of structured practice, or
      training, in either socially regulating others' emotions or in self-regulating their own
      emotions. The investigators predict that helping others regulate their emotions will involve
      many of the same brain regions implicated in regulating one's own emotions, in addition to
      regions involved in perspective taking and the reward of helping others. Further, when
      relating the brain data from part 1 to the regulation practice data from part 2, the
      investigators expect that individuals who in part 1 show greater activity in brain regions
      supporting either social or self-regulation may be more likely in part 2 to show
      corresponding improvements in regulation performance. The results of these studies are
      intended to lay the groundwork for future studies investigating the social regulation of
      emotion in older adults and clinical populations for whom social support can be beneficial.
