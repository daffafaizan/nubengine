      industrialized world. Approximately 80% of patients with AMD suffer from the dry form of the
      disease also called geographic atrophy (GA) which is characterized by the progressive loss of
      photoreceptors and RPE that are essential to the visual cycle. There is currently no therapy
      to cure GA. This represent a major health problem with millions patients worldwide.

      GA is a complex multifactorial disease influenced by: aging, environmental factors, genetic
      predispositions, oxidative stress and inflammation. Oxidative stress is the major
      environmental risk factor of developing AMD. Whereas inflammation, is now, recognized as one
      of the main player in AMD pathophysiology. Therefore, antioxidant and immunosuppressive
      therapies are susceptible to be beneficial in humans for patients with GA.

      Dimethyl Fumarate activates the NRF2 pathway, which is the major transcription factor
      regulating anti-oxidative enzymes production. Dimethyl Fumarate commercialized under the name
      TECFIDERA® by BIOGEN is an effective antioxidant and immunosuppressive drug, used to treat
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the Central Nervous System
      leading to progressive disability. This new therapeutic agent may be easily repurposed to
      treat GA patients and could reduce or slow photoreceptors and RPE degeneration and the
      associated vision loss.

      In this randomized, open labelled trial we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      TECFIDERA®, in two groups of patients (treated vs. untreated) with GA. This is the first time
      this strategy, based on evidences that oxidative stress and inflammation are central in GA
      physiopathology, will be tested in patients with dry AMD.
