      biological pathways in prostate cancer that are especially relevant to prostate cancer
      disparities between African American and Caucasian men. Also, to determine any significant
      differences in the molecular signature that exist in African American and Caucasian men in
      relation to their vitamin D levels.

      Recruitment will be at the Urology Clinic at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in
      Charleston, SC. Men who are scheduled for a Standard of Care prostate biopsy will be
      consented for their permission to collect an extra prostate tissue core for RNA-sequencing.

      After the pathology report is discussed by their Urologist, and the treatment decision is
      Active Surveillance, the participant is enrolled into the Intervention Phase. At that time,
      baseline allostatic load measurements (Blood pressure, pulse, waist/hip ratio, height and
      weight for BMI) and bloodwork: (lipid panel, HgbA1c, albumin and creatinine, IL-6, CRP, and
      DHEA-s) plus a vitamin D level, will be collected. Vitamin D3 softgels (4,000 IU) daily (six
      months supply) will be dispensed. A Social Determinants survey will also be dispensed for
      subject completion.

      At the Urology Standard of Care six month follow-up appointment, the a vitamin D serum level
      will be collected and the next six months supply of vitamin D3 will be dispensed.

      At the Urology Standard of Care follow-up (repeat at 1 year) surveillance prostate biopsy, an
      extra prostate tissue core will be collected for RNA-sequencing. The allostatic load
      measurements and bloodwork will also be obtained. A single blood vial will also be collected
      for ancestry markers.
