      provide a first indication of which types of cancer and at what stage of tumor burden
      acetylamantadine will be found in patients' plasma, saliva and urine samples. Volunteers will
      provide complete first morning urine collection prior to amantadine ingestion. The volunteers
      will then ingest a therapeutic dose of amantadine (200 mg: 2x100mg capsules), at least 2
      hours before breakfast (nothing to eat or drink except water after midnight before the
      scheduled appointment), and their complete urine will be collected at 2 and 4 hours (plus or
      minus 1 hour) after amantadine ingestion. In addition, blood samples will be taken by
      venipuncture before and at 2 and 4 hours after drug ingestion. The patients will be asked to
      provide a saliva sample at the same time as the urine samples are taken after drug ingestion.
