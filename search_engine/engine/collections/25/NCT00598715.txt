      Although there are no data, it may be assumed that certain lesions might be resistant to a
      given drug and in need of a different DES. Thus, for lesions which develop restenosis after a
      DES, it is not known which the right strategy to use is, implantation of the same type of DES
      as the initial one or a DES with a different drug. This prospective, randomized trial will
      compare the anti-restenotic efficacy of PES or SES in patients with restenosis after initial
      implantation of a SES
