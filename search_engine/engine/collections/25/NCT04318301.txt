      China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia1. Deep sequencing
      analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, then named COVID-19). Up to Mar 16, 2020, the total number
      of patients had risen sharply to 153,546 confirmed cases worldwide
      (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html). The data extracted from 1099 patients
      with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in China from January 29, 2020 showed that hypertension is
      the most common coexisting illness of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 13.4% in nonsevere
      patient vs. 23.4% in severe patients, and the total incidence is as high as 15%2.
      Interestingly, ACE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and SARS-COV-2
      pneumonia. The above reasons prompted us to speculate that the organs attacked by SARS-COV-2
      might not only be lungs, but also include other ACE2 expression organs, especially
      cardiovascular system. In addition, patients with comorbid hypertension, especially those
      with long-term oral ACEI/ARB medication for hypertension, might have different susceptibility
      and severity levels of pneumonia upon SARS-COV-2 attack. Therefore, we investigated and
      compared the demographic characteristics, coexisting disease, severity of pneumonia, and the
      effect of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI/ARB versus non-ACEI/ARB) in patients with COVID-19
      coexisting hypertension, thereby, hopefully, to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated
      with hypertension in patients with COVID-19.
