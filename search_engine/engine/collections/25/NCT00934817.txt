    
      16 subjects were randomized to each of 2 sequence groups which have different treatment order
      of the study drug in each period.

      Only healthy volunteers had screening tests such as medical inquiry, physical examination,
      clinical laboratory test, etc. within 4 weeks (-28d ~ -1d) prior to drug administration (1d)
      and those determined eligible for this study were selected and randomized between screening
      and 1 day prior to the first administration of study medication (-1d). Then, the subjects
      were admitted to the clinical research center of Seoul National University Hospital by 9 p.m.
      of -1d and then, they were not allowed to take anything except water.

      After one week of washout period, subjects went on to the second phase of treatment period
      and were administered according to the treatment order in a crossover way. For the subjects
      who completed the study, post-study visit tests were performed after a designated time had
      passed.
