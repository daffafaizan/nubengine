      undergo laparotomy and tumor debulking. Patients will be randomized at completion of tumor
      debulking to receive continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (HIPEC,formerly CHPP) with
      250 mg/m^2 cisplatin and an intraperitoneal dwell of 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m^2 and paclitaxel
      125 mg/m^2 once between postoperative day 7 and 12. All patients will receive systemic
      oxaliplatin, leucovorin and infusional 5-FU, every other week of every four weeks starting 4
      to 6 weeks after operation and continuing for four cycles. The major endpoint is time to
      intraperitoneal tumor progression and survival in patients stratified based on history of
      previous treatment with systemic chemotherapy (yes vs. no), history of prior debulking
      surgery; and ability to optimally vs. suboptimally debulk intraperitoneal tumor burden.
