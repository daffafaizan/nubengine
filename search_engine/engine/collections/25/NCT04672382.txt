      of both acute and chronic pain conditions as well as in surgical procedures. Opioids render
      effective pain relief, however, they may cause bothersome itch as a side effect. With this
      series of experiments, we wish to clarify how an injection with morphine in the skin layer
      called dermis (located right below the upper skin) will affect itch.
