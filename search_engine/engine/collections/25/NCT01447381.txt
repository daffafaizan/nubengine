      immunosuppressive therapy for disease control, yet there are few studies regarding the
      appropriate use of these drugs for pediatric AD and even less data comparing them. The
      current observational study will observe the effect of these therapies on children with
      moderate to severe atopic dermatitis as they are treated. These drugs being observed will be
      cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate.
