      referral to a Palliative Care (PC) provider who is also located in our clinic and an initial
      appointment will be scheduled with the PC provider. The frequency of follow-up visits with
      the PC provider will be at the discretion of the PC provider and the patient. Visits with the
      PC and neuro-oncology providers will be scheduled on the same day whenever possible. As part
      of the study, participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires and
      assessment forms at different time intervals. These questionnaires and assessments are
      intended to track symptoms experienced during the course of treatment. Total study duration
      is about nine months.
