      osteoarthritis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment or brain Injury are more
      likely to experience a fall or a fall-related injury than healthy individuals during to
      impaired postural stability or diminished joint perception. Under certain circumstance they
      may also experience pain, depression, anxiety, and a decreased quality of life. The
      investigators' research has been designed to provide exercise training using non-invasive
      body-worn sensors (similar to those used in an iPhoneÂ®) to provide real-time visual
      information about joint motion in a virtual environment. These sensors will be worn using a
      vest, t-shirt or elastic band. The investigators will, 1) assess changes in participant's
      perception of lower extremity position while they perform these exercises; 2) motivate and
      guide simple exercise performance in the clinic/home, using an interactive game-like scheme;
      and 3) assess changes in participant's postural stability and gait as a result of provided
      exercise training. The information gathered will provide new understanding about more helpful
      rehabilitation strategies that improve postural stability in patient population.
