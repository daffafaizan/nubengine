      general anesthesia and is collected in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. After
      precipitation of red blood cells, Low density mononuclear cells will be collected by
      centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque density gradient. For CD133+ cells separation the CliniMACS
      instrument will be used. Cells are injected via portal vein under sonography monitoring.
      After cell therapy, patients are followed up every week for 4 weeks, and laboratory data are
      analyzed for 24 weeks.
