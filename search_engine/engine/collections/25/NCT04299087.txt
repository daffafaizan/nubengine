      with tremor before and after applying a session of rTMS. Specifically, the investigators will
      apply rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1) as our group and others have shown abnormal
      function of the region. Moreover, a study shows that targeting of M1 and the dorsal premotor
      cortex (dPMC) with rTMS results in a trend towards improved clinical outcome in patients with
      focal hand dystonia and cervical dystonia. The central hypothesis of this study is that rTMS
      can modify cortical oscillations in patient populations with tremor and that the
      investigators will be able to detect these changes with the use of Electroencephalography
      (EEG). By applying inhibitory rTMS to the motor cortices, the investigators may expect a
      shift in cortical oscillations towards normal activity.
