      metabolic activity, and one sensitive to inflammatory processes, investigators can separately
      identify metabolically active tumor from radiation necrosis related inflammation. This can be
      accomplished with quantitative assessments of tracer uptake using kinetic modeling
      techniques, as well as by high-resolution imaging to assess the distribution of tracer uptake
      in the tumor region. All participants in the study will have the receive the same diagnostic
      tests.
