      the aneurysm is <65o. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance
      of the bifurcated Aorfix™ Stent Graft in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic
      aneurysms and aorto-iliac aneurysms, in infrarenal necks angulated > 60o (between 60 to 90
      degrees) as measured by 3-dimensional reconstruction in order to widen the indication.

      The investigation is a prospective open label, single arm, multi-centre clinical study. The
      study group will consist of 25 evaluable participants. In order to account for patients lost
      to follow up (estimated at approximately 20%) up to 30 patients will be enrolled in the
      study.
