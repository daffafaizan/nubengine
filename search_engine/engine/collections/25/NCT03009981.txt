      in 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment arms: (1) Control arm consisting of LHRH analogue
      monotherapy (degarelix or leuprolide), (2) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide in
      combination with LHRH analogue, and (3) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide,
      abiraterone acetate + prednisone, and LHRH analogue. Patients will be treated for a maximum
      duration of 52 weeks and then enter follow up phase until the time of PSA progression,
      development of metastasis, or patient withdrawal from study, whichever occurs first. Patients
      with PSA progression will be followed long term until the development of castration
      resistance, first metastasis, and death.

      The primary endpoint of the study is PSA progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat
      patient population. PSA progression during the 52-week treatment period is defined as a
      rising PSA confirmed on repeat measurement, and at least 25% and 2 ng/mL above nadir or
      baseline, whichever is lower. PSA progression during follow up defined as PSA > 0.2 ng/mL
      confirmed by repeat measurement at least 2 weeks later. Secondary study endpoints include PSA
      progression-free survival in testosterone-evaluable population, 36-month PSA progression-free
      survival rate in both intent-to-treat and testosterone-evaluable populations, time to
      testosterone recovery, time to castration resistance, metastasis-free survival, quality of
      life, and safety. Each experimental arm will be compared against the control arm in pair-wise
      fashion. The study is not powered to detect differences in primary or secondary endpoints
      between the two experimental arms.
