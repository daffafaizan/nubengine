      Its appearance increases the morbidity of the surgical patient, increasing the incidence of
      cardiac events or perioperative blood loss and causes a greater time of recovery from
      anaesthesia. Prewarming is the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, prewarming in patients submitted to spinal anesthesia
      is still a weak recommendation and the optimal prewarming time has not been elucidated. Due
      to the searching of optimal prewarming time and the lack of evidence about the efficiency of
      prewarming in patients submitted to transurethral resection under spinal anaesthesia, the
      conductance of this clinical trial is justified.
