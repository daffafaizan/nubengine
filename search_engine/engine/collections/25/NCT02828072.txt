      are effective in improving cardiac autonomic control (CAC) in patients with affective
      spectrum disorders. However, the effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on autonomic function
      in this population is unknown. To test the hypothesis that SKY training improves CAC,
      cardiorespiratory coupling and adaptive response of sympatho-vagal balance to orthostatic
      changes were evaluated in patients with anxiety and/or depression disorders.

      The authors will enroll patients with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression disorders
      (DSM-IV) and they will divide them in two groups: 1) conventional therapy (Control) and 2)
      conventional therapy associated with SKY (Treatment) for 15 days. Anxiety and depression
      levels will be determined using quantitative questionnaires. For the assessment of CAC and
      cardiorespiratory coupling, cardiorespiratory traces will be analyzed using monovariate and
      bivariate autoregressive spectral analysis, respectively.
