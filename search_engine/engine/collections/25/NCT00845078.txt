      treatment. (1, 2) Administration of radiation before or after autologous soft tissue
      reconstruction has being shown to alter the aesthetics of the new breast. (3-7) Currently,
      the optimal timing for autologous breast reconstruction in patients who need postmastectomy
      radiotherapy remains in debate between surgeons. (8) Various studies have tried to address
      this problem. However, most of them have been retrospective studies (3, 7, 9) and the
      prospective ones have not have enough patients, have mixed population of patients or the
      radiation protocols have not been normalized. (5, 6, 10)

      We hypothesize that immediate autologous reconstruction patients who undergo subsequent
      radiation therapy have equivalent aesthetic outcome when compared to those in whom
      reconstruction is delayed until after radiation, with the additional benefit of avoiding the
      psychological side effects of breast amputation.
