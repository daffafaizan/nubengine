      using clarithromycin (CLM) association with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of
      generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). Sixty periodontal pockets were select and
      randomly assigned into four groups: Periodontal Debridement (PD) (n=15): periodontal pockets
      that received periodontal debridement (PD) with placebo; PD+CLM (n=15): periodontal pockets
      that received periodontal debridement associated with clarithromycin; PD+PDT (n=15):
      periodontal pockets that received periodontal debridement associated with photodynamic
      therapy; PD+CLM+PDT (n=15): periodontal pockets that received periodontal debridement
      associated with clarithromycin and photodynamic therapy. Probing depth (PD),gain in clinical
      attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6
      months post- operatively.
