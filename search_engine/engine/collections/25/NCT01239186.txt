      assisted reproductive techniques. Now abnormalities of methylation could be implied in
      defects of spermatogenesis and certain abnormalities of development of the male germ cells
      could be due to modifications abnormal epigenetics.

      The objective of this research is to determine the frequency of arisen the abnormalities of
      methylation at the level of the locus H19 in the sperm cells of barren men presenting an
      unexplained oligozoospermia and to determine if these changes are a reflection of
      abnormalities of the profiles of methylation of the whole genome.

      The patients will realize a taking of sperm having signed the consent.
