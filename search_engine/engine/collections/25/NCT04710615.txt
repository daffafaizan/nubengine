      potentially harmful medication use. One particular challenge is the phenomenon of
      polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use in elderly, which is associated to an increased
      risk of drug-drug interactions. Several scales and tools have been proposed to identify
      inappropriate drugs prescription in older adults. Among them, the STOPP / START criteria
      (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions / Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment)
      are internationally recognized.

      The Synapse platform offers a panel of functions that may help physicians to prescribe
      medications. For instance, the prescriber can interact with the Synapse platform by asking
      any type of question about a drug (dosage, contraindication, interaction ...) before
      prescription. It also allows them to take a picture of prescription. The software detects in
      less than 10 seconds criteria for inappropriate medication prescriptions and potential
      drug-drug interactions.

      More precisely, the Synapse platform provides information on a particular drug or
      prescription analysis regarding:

        -  Indications, contraindications, dosage and adverse effects of drugs.

        -  STOPP criteria.

        -  START criteria.

        -  Associations at risk for drug-drug interactions.

      Multiple new health technologies are emerging, but few of them have demonstrated their
      scientific and medical added value using an evidence-based medicine approach.

      This clinical trial aims to validate the clinical interest of the Synapse application in a
      geriatric environment.

      Prescriptions made by geriatricians participating in this study will be analyzed by two
      independent experts, including one pharmacist and one geriatrician.
