      response conducted by different pro and counter inflammatory cytokines. The evolution of the
      infection is mainly dependent on the intensity of the inflammatory response. The AIM of the
      project is to determine the clinical usefulness of methylprednisolone treatment (0,5 mg/ Kg
      weight every 12h for 5 days in patients with severe CAP and an excessive inflammatory
      response( patients identified based on a cut-off point of the reactive C protein (RCP) of 15
      mg/dl). A randomized double blind placebo controlled study with two arms will be performed:
      The study group (patients with excessive inflammatory response) will receive
      methylprednisolone + antibiotics. Control group will receive placebo + antibiotics. Patients
      older than 18 years with Fine V pneumonia will be recruited. Clinical data and prognostic
      factors (APACHE II and, SOFA scores, etiology, mortality at ICU and at 28 days) will be
      collected.
