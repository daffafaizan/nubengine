        -  To rigorously examine fractionated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients
           with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  To define somatic mutations occurring in de novo AML, including the FLT3-ITD, CEBPA,
           NPM1, TET2, ASXL1, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations.

        -  To examine what cellular compartments (LT-HSC, ST-HSC, CMP, GMP, and MEP) contain the
           selected mutations and in what order those mutations occur.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow specimens are analyzed for sequencing and detection of
      mutations by Sanger-based resequencing of PCR amplicons. Results are then compared with the
      results of age-matched healthy controls.
