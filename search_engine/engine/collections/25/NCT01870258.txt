      a high cost of care. Early prediction can be helpful in preventing the development of
      myocardial infarction with appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Artificial neural networks
      have opened new horizons in learning about the natural history of diseases and predicting
      cardiac disease.

      Methods: A total of 935 cardiac patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic electrocardiogram
      (ECG) were enrolled and followed for 2 weeks in two groups based on the appearance of
      myocardial infarction. Two types of data were used for all patients: nominal (clinical data)
      and quantitative (ECG findings). Two different artificial neural networks - radial basis
      function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) - were used.
