      care to test hypothesis that 'treat to target' ustekinumab (UST) maintenance treatment
      strategy coupled with early endoscopic assessment will result in higher endoscopic response
      rate after 48 weeks of treatment, compared to pragmatic maintenance treatment strategy. It
      consists of screening (5 weeks); treatment period (Week 0 to 48); extension period (Weeks 48
      to 104) and safety follow up visit (16 weeks after last dose). Participants will be given an
      option to enter ultrasound sub-study to assess intestinal ultrasound (IUS) parameters
      indicating transmural changes in response to treatment with UST in participants with Crohn's
      disease. Study treatment will be unaffected by participation in sub-study which is optional
      for participants of main study.
