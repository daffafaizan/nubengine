      scheduled within a 40 days' time frame. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped
      with a blood glucose meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected
      with the investigational medical device. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions
      each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a blood glucose meter and two
      investigational medical device measurements.
