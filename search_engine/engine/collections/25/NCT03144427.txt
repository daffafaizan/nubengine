      selected to include wide cross-representation of resuscitation practices using crystalloids
      alone, crystalloid plus albumin, and among sites that use albumin, variable approaches to the
      timing of albumin initiation.

      Detailed data will be continuously collected in "real time" during fluid resuscitation over
      the 1st 48 hours following a burn injury. Data collection during this phase will be done
      prospectively, hour-by-hour, by the bedside nurse caring for the patient. Primarily this data
      collection will involve recording of resuscitation fluid volumes, urinary output, vital signs
      (heart rate and blood pressure), and use of vasopressors and inotropes. Outcome data (organ
      function, need for mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and survival) will be
      collected at various time points during the subjects' acute care stay.

      At completion of the study we intend to make the following comparisons:

        1. Subjects that received crystalloids only compared to subjects that received crystalloids
           plus albumin.

        2. Subjects that had albumin started "early" (< 8 hours post burn), compared to subjects
           that had albumin started "intermediate" (8-12 hours post burn), compared to subjects
           that had albumin started "late" (>12 hours post burn).

        3. Characteristics of resuscitation prior to the start of albumin ("pre-albumin") compared
           to characteristics of resuscitation following initiation of albumin ("post albumin").
