    
      PA 325 is proposed for the reduction in the risk of aspirin-associated gastrointestinal (GI)
      adverse events in patients requiring daily aspirin. This study is designed as a Proof of
      Concept study to evaluate the gastroprotective effects, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety
      of PA 325 in healthy volunteers.

      To compare the gastroprotective effects of a once-daily dose of PA 325 combination tablet
      combining 325 mg pH-sensitive aspirin and 20 mg immediate release omeprazole versus a
      once-daily dose of 325 mg enteric coated aspirin utilizing Lanza scores from endoscopy
      findings in normal healthy volunteers.
