      symptom of severe arrhythmia. Early diagnosis of the underlying disease is very important to
      identify patients with severe cardiac arrhythmia to commence adequate treatment. Standard
      diagnostic methods such as 24 hours Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring or Event Holter
      do not guarantee early diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Prolonged heart rhythm recording and
      analysis using an automatic full disclosure telemetric device can increase probability of
      arrhythmia diagnosis and early administration of adequate treatment. Study patients will be
      diagnosed using standard Holter ECG monitoring, Event Holter or 30 days telemetric ECG
      monitoring. Efficacy of telemetric monitoring in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia will be
      assessed in comparison with the standard Holter monitoring and Event Holter.
