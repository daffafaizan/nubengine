    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b/2a study
      designed to evaluate the safety of an investigational product called ATR-04 to reduce the
      severity of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) associated papulopustular rash
      on the face. This study will be performed at 10-12 clinical sites, with potentially a virtual
      component. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter a screening period for up
      to 28 days to determine eligibility prior to randomization.

      Approximately 60 eligible subjects, will be randomized to receive ATR-04 or a placebo, in a
      ratio of 1:1.

      On Day 1, subjects will be instructed on study medication administration technique, the first
      application by the subject will be observed in person, via telehealth or via video connection
      and the subject will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) for at least 20 minutes.

      Subjects will perform twice daily (BID) study assigned medication applications for 28 days.
      Subjects will have in person or virtual visits throughout the study. Subjects will return all
      study materials (i.e. diary cards, and study medication containers, swabs) either in person
      or via mail on Day 29 for their End of Treatment visit.

      Beginning on Day 1, subjects will be assessed for safety. In addition, subjects' faces will
      be examined and assessed utilizing the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) in person or via
      a virtual visit. Subjects will complete the Quality of Life (QoL) tool and standardized
      digital photographs will be taken.

      A subject's participation in the study will be up to a maximum of 86 days (up to 28 days for
      Screening, 28 days of BID treatment, and a 30 day no treatment follow-up period).
