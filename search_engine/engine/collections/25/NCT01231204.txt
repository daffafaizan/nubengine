    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition
      of a multiple-day ambulatory continuous paravertebral block decreases the incidence and
      severity of post-mastectomy pain.

      Hypothesis 1: Following mastectomy, the incidence and severity of breast pain will be
      significantly decreased in the week following surgery with a multiple-day ambulatory
      continuous paravertebral block as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment
      (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).

      Hypothesis 2: Following mastectomy, the incidence and severity of chronic pain will be
      significantly decreased three months following multiple-day ambulatory continuous
      paravertebral blocks as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as
      measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).
