      their fear of mastectomy, spare them one or more second surgery and additional hospital stays
      in case of late breast reconstruction. However, in France, most patients with invasive breast
      carcinoma and treated with mastectomy are not offered immediate reconstruction. One reason is
      the need for postoperative radiotherapy for most patients (40 to 70% according to the
      centers). Indeed, radiotherapy induces side-effects which can alter the cosmetic result of
      the breast reconstruction as well as the patient's quality of life. Since 1995, a significant
      correlation is observed between the RILA test (measurement by flux cytometry of the
      lymphocyte T-CD8 apoptosis induced by radiotherapy) and the risk of occurrence of severe
      radio-induced breast fibrosis. Such accurate personalized medical care could allow
      identifying before any treatment high risk of toxicity patients and thus help establishing
      the therapeutic strategy. Identification of low-risk patients could also allow limiting
      autologous samplings and thus their associated morbidity.
