      from each ICU. Investigators did calculate that a total of 22 ICUs are required, in which 11
      will be assigned to the low frequency and 11 will be assigned to a high frequency group of
      postural change until obtaining a total of 1,650 patients in each arm of the study and a
      total of 3,300 participants in the study.
