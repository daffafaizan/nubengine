      research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents
      with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols.

      The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is:

      To test if intramuscular PEG-asparaginase administered either at six or two week intervals
      from day 92 until 8 months from diagnosis for patients with non-HR ALL will result in equal
      probability of EFS. As secondary endpoints asparaginase antibody production and toxicity
      including allergic reactions in the treatment-arms will be analysed
