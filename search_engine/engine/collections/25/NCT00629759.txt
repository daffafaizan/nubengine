    
      Patients are treated with JX-594 once every three weeks until progression at the site(s) of
      injection or until the patient has received a maximum of 4 treatments; four additional cycles
      can be administered to patients with an objective response of the injected tumor(s) (i.e. 8
      total treatments possible). Study dose levels are 1e8 pfu, 3e8 pfu, 1e9 pfu and 3e9 pfu per
      treatment. Standard Phase I dose-escalation guidelines are used, with 2-6 patients enrolled
      per cohort (3 if no dose-limiting toxicities are reported).
