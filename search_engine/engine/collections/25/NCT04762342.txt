      increased substantially. Today more than one-third of all people with MS are 60 years or
      older. With advanced age, people with MS are more likely to have impairments in cognitive and
      physical function.

      Positive adaptations within the nervous system (~neuroplasticity) have been shown to occur in
      people with MS following periods of resistance training (RT). This resembles the observations
      in young and old healthy individuals. Moreover, a specific type of RT termed power training
      appears to be particularly beneficial, as it emphasizes an explosive concentric phase of
      muscle contraction. This taxes the nervous system to a very high extent. As a result, power
      training has been shown to improve several aspects that rely on the nervous system in older
      individuals without MS. These aspects include cognition, neuromuscular function, and physical
      function.

      The investigators speculate that older people with MS would also benefit. However, no studies
      have looked into the effects of power training in older people with MS. Moreover, it is not
      known if the effects of power training are blunted, compared to healthy age- and
      gender-matched healthy individuals due to the marked neurodegeneration that characterizes
      older MS (transient/permanent damage to CNS).
