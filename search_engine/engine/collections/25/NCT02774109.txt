      medical care for low back pain have no specific history and no specific finding in image
      study, and therefore do not receive a specific diagnosis. This type of low back pain is
      termed "nonspecific low back pain." Fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA can reduce
      the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. They are also the precursors of the E-resolvin and
      D-resolvin that suppress inflammatory cytokine production and act to resolve inflammation.
      Several previous studies showed that fish oil has the effect of anti-inflammation and pain
      reduction without side effect that affecting stomach and renal function. Therefore, fish oil
      is considered a new type of NSAID, and many studies are investigating its effect of
      anti-inflammation and pain reduction on different diseases. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of fish oil on patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.
