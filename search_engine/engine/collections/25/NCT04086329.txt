    
      This is an investigational device clinical trial. MM cases and healthy volunteers will
      undergo nanosensor muscle oxygen measurement in exercised (dominant) forearm muscle during
      handgrip exercise. The same measurements will be repeated between 7 and 30 days later in the
      same forearm and at the same time of day for each participant to assess reproducibility.

      After placement of the nanosensor in the forearm under local anesthesia, the primary outcome
      measure is nanosensor-muscle oxygen levels. The secondary outcome measure is an assessment of
      pain.
