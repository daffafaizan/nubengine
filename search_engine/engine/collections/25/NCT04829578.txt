      impact on quality of life. At present, there is no specific treatment for CIP. Topical
      steroids are frequently used, with partial efficacy, and adverse effects. Hypnosis is a
      specific state of conscience. It differs from waking state, sleeping state, relaxation, or
      meditation. In this state, the person is highly responsive to suggestion. In medicine,
      hypnosis can be used to engage the internal resources of the person against unpleasant
      feelings. It was shown previously that hypnosis can relieve painful sensations. Pain and
      pruritus share many similarities regarding sensory receptors and pathways, suggesting that
      hypnosis might help relief CIP.
