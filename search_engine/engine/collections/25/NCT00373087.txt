      high activity (allele H) and a low activity (allele L) form of the enzyme. L and H allele
      frequency in the Caucasian population is around 50%. This is a monocentric randomized blinded
      cross-over study comparing acute challenge of L-dopa + placebo versus L-dopa + 200 mg
      entacapone, in Parkinson's disease patients with HH and LL genotypes.
