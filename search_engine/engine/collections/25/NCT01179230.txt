      Rubidium rest PET image will be obtained prior to a Dipyridamole stress test. Subjects will
      receive both Rubidium and technetium isotopes following the Dipyridamole stress, and will
      undergo first PET imaging and later SPECT imaging following the stress test. Patients will
      then go for cardiac catheterization as clinically ordered by their physician.
