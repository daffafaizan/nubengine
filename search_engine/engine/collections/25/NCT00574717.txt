      farsighted babies. We will give them glasses with a partial correction, an amount that is
      less than their full degree of farsightedness but enough to put them in the zone of effective
      emmetropization. This 'boost' is meant to enable very farsighted babies to use their eyes in
      a normal way and emmetropize as normal infants. This partial correction would be given at 3
      months of age for a period of up to 15 months. A program of visual engagement is also
      provided in order to encourage the normal development and use of accommodation. As changes in
      farsightedness occur, the power of the glasses will be reduced at follow up appointments to
      keep the farsightedness within the zone of effective emmetropization. Once an infant reaches
      a normal amount of farsightedness, the glasses would be discontinued.
