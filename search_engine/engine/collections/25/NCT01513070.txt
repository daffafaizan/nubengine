      symptoms of coronary artery disease. Quick-Acting Heart Reliever is one of blood-quickening
      stasis-transforming medicinals to relieve angina pectoris in clinic and is especially benefit
      for the patients with moderate coronary stenosis who need not coronary revascularization only
      have medical treatment. But there is no randomized evidence that established the beneficial
      effects of blood-quickening stasis-transforming medicinals to treat moderate coronary
      stenosis lesions. This study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.
      A total of 120 consecutive participants with at least one moderate coronary stenosis lesion
      (diameter stenosis 50-75%) will be randomized to two groups: group 1(n =60) will receive
      Quick-Acting Heart and the placebo of isosorbide dinitrate, patients in group 2(n = 60) will
      receive isosorbide dinitrate and the placebo of Quick-Acting Heart for six months. The
      myocardial perfusion imaging and the coronary CT angiography will be used to evaluate the
      effective power of angina pectoris,myocardial blood-supplying，the quality and volume of the
      plaque, diameter stenosis after treating after 6 months and the end point of the heart
      (including death，myocardial infarction and myocardial revascularization which includes
      intracoronary stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting,) after 12 months. The purpose is
      to study the function of Quick-Acting Heart Reliever delaying percutaneous coronary
      intervention(PCI) for moderate coronary stenosis.
