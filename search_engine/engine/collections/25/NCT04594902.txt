    
      Research Design: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and maintenance of a remote
      home-based preventive intervention, the Infant Behavior Program (IBP), to decrease behavior
      problems in infants from high-risk families. Specifically, the investigators propose to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate its efficacy and maintenance in reducing
      behavior problems and increasing infant regulation relative to an enhanced pediatric primary
      care (EPPC) active control condition. Assessments will occur at pre (week 0)- and post (week
      8)-intervention assessments (approximately 2 months apart), as well as at 4-month (week 24) ,
      8 -month (week 40), and 12-month (week 56) follow-up assessments.

      Procedures: Families will be primarily recruited from pediatric primary care centers and will
      be randomized to receive six sessions of either IBP or EPPC in their home. Families also will
      participate in five remote home-based assessments.

      Risks and Benefits: Families may experience risk from a breach in confidentiality as
      participants reveal sensitive information and there are risks in breach of confidentiality
      due to videoconferencing methods, in particular if study staff become aware of abuse or
      neglect situations. Families may experience discomfort when answering personal questions.
      Benefits to families could include providing families with information that can assist in
      caring for their child, and instilling new parenting strategies that are designed to outlast
      treatment.

      Knowledge: This study will provide information about the efficacy of a remote home-based
      preventive intervention to improve infant behavior and regulation.
