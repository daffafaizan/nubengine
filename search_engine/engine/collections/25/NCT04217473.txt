    
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of TILT-123. The approach has
      the potential to a) increase the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapy, b) remove the need for
      toxic pre- and post-conditioning regimens, c) yield the combined anti-tumor benefits of armed
      oncolytic viruses and T-cell therapy.

      Dose escalation of TILT-123 injection will take place between cohorts not intra-patient and
      will be determined based on Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).
