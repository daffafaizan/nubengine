      States and now kills over 30,000 Americans annually. To reduce the morbidity and mortality
      caused by this aggressive cancer, current practice guidelines recommend semi-annual abdominal
      ultrasound in adults with cirrhosis, the leading risk factor for HCC, to detect HCC nodules
      when they are small and treatable. Unfortunately, US has poor sensitivity for early-stage HCC
      in cirrhosis, failing to detect treatable cancer in over half of affected patients.
      Alternatives such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also
      not ideal due to ionizing radiation (CT), higher cost (MRI), or long exam time (~30-45 min
      for MRI). An optimal and fast HCC screening method is urgently needed and should be more
      sensitive and cost-effective than US and avoid ionizing radiation.

      This is a prospective cross-sectional single arm non randomized multicenter study enrolling
      in 4 American centers as follows: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai-ISMMS, University
      of California San Diego-UCSD, University of Wisconsin-UW, and Duke University. The composite
      reference standard will incorporate the clinical results of the full baseline MRI exam and of
      subsequent imaging and pathology data collected over the next 6 months. Routine clinical
      follow-up imaging at 6 months will be observed. Patients will then be classified as positive
      for HCC, negative for HCC, or excluded.
