      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential sunitinib (sunitinib malate) with
      bevacizumab in patients with clear cell kidney cancer.

      II. To assess the objective response rate of sequential sunitinib with bevacizumab in
      patients with clear cell kidney cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic change in standardized uptake values (SUV) peak and tumor
      perfusion using fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) scans at baseline, during sunitinib exposure, and during bevacizumab exposure
      (during sunitinib withdrawal period) in patients with renal cell and other solid
      malignancies.

      II. To characterize changes in the ratio of free: bound plasma vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) in patients treated with sequential sunitinib with bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate.

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) on days 1-28 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV)
      over 30-90 minutes on day 29. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
