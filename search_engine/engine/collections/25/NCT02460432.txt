      similar technical success rates. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP)-guided stent
      placement has become the preferred approach to palliate malignant biliary obstruction. The
      major mechanisms of self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) occlusion are tumor ingrowth, tumor
      overgrowth, and epithelial hyperplasia. These mechanisms provide the rationale for developing
      a drug-eluting stent in order to improve stent patency. Limited data exist regarding outcomes
      of paclitaxel-eluting stents in malignant biliary obstruction. This study is to prospectively
      compare the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel-eluting covered metal stent and covered
      metal stent for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction.
