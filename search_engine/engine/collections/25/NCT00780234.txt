      agonist pioglitazone in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. The high risk current and
      former smokers qualify based on tobacco exposure, airflow limitation on lung function
      testing, and sputum cytologic atypia. Subjects have a quantitative high resolution thoracic
      CT scan and a fluorescent bronchoscopy at study entry and after 6 months on drug or placebo.
      Biologic samples are collected at both time points. The primary outcome is endobronchial
      histology and determining if pioglitazone can retard progression. Secondary endpoints related
      to the PPAR gamma signaling pathway will also be analyzed.
