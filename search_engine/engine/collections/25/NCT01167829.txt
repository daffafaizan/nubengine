      be given on Day 0 to turn off the body's testosterone production for about 10-14 days.

      The next day, Day 1, subjects begin taking 300 mg modified slow-release testosterone pill by
      mouth, three times a day, around 9 AM, 1 PM, and 7 PM for a total of 27 pills.

      There are overnight stays on Day 1 and Day 9 to allow monitoring of blood testosterone levels
      over a 24 hour period, from @9 AM to 9 AM the next morning. At those visits, blood is drawn
      at baseline (before taking the pill) and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 24
      hours after the morning dose.

      Acyline is an experimental drug. The FDA allows its use only in research with a small number
      of volunteers. We have used acyline in over 125 men without serious side effects. The use of
      testosterone in this study is experimental and there may be unknown or unanticipated risks.
