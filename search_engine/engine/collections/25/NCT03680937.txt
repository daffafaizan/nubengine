    
      To perform this study, investigator will compare three groups. Group 1: immature ovocytes
      vitrified before IVM; Group 2: immature oocytes vitrified after IVM; Group3: fresh immature
      oocytes treated by IVM (without vitrification, control group).

      The immature oocytes provide from ICSI patients. In routine these oocytes (germinal vesicle)
      are normally destroyed because they cannot be used for injection. The women will give an
      informed and written consent. Inclusion criteria are women less 37 years without
      dysovulation.

      The vitrification will be performed with the semi-automatic method (Gavi, Merck). The kinetic
      and maturation rate will be analysed by time lapse (Primovision, Vitrolife) In the mature
      oocytes, the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton, the spindle organization and the cortical
      granules will be studied by immunofluorescence and 3D confocal microscopy. The expression of
      maternal factors transcription will be analyzed by RT-PCR. The ploidy will be analysed by
      multiFISH and/or CGH array.
