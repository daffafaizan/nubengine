      volunteers living in the Beaujolais region (France) to perform appropriate calibrations for
      metabolomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses. The main study will be conducted in a
      sample of 150 male non-smoking volunteers and 50 professional pesticides applicators from the
      same region (3 sampling periods).
