      study. After obtaining parental consent, the infants will be prospectively and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1.po Paracetamol at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 6 hours at x 3
      days or Group 2- IV indomethacin - 0.2 mg/kg/dose q 12h for three doses; or IV Ibuprofen 10
      mg/kg infused over 15 minutes, followed by two doses of 5mg/kg each at 24 hour intervals
      (total of 3 doses).Clinical staff will be blinded as to the study group assignment of the
      babies and since the group 1 drug is to be given every six hours, all babies will receive a
      parenteral substance every 6 hours. For Group 2 infants, the intermittent doses will be IV
      D5W alternating with drug.All infants will fed trophic feeds (20 cc/kg/day) during the
      treatment for ductal closure.
