      natural defenses to protect nerve cells against chemical stress. Researchers think there may
      be a relationship between the brain's natural defense system and the amount of dairy food
      intake. Strengthening these defenses could provide beneficial protection to the brain against
      neurodegenerative age-related diseases and cognitive decline.

      Glutathione (GSH) is a metabolite in the human brain protective system. It plays a key role
      in protecting cells against oxidative stress, which is one of the major processes
      contributing to aging and neurodegeneration. Preliminary findings suggest that there may be a
      correlation between dairy food intake and GSH levels in the aging brain. Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy (MRS) measures chemicals in the brain. It is a noninvasive measure of the
      effects of dairy food intake on the major protective metabolite levels in the living human
      brain in aging.

      This study involves using an MRI with special MRS scans to see if adequate dairy food intake
      may aid in enhancing cerebral protective capacity to fight against age-related disease and
      cognitive decline in the brain.

      Participants will be asked to make a total of six visits to the research site. Participation
      will last about 3 months.
