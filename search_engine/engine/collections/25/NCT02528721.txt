    
      Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for initial diagnosis of H.pylori
      infection or post therapy confirmation of eradication will be eligible to participate in the
      trial. Two sets of biopsies will be taken: one set for histological analysis and one set for
      rapid urease test (RUT) analysis. The two results will be used as a gold standard composite
      score in determining the presence of H.pylori bacteria in the stomach. The Urea Breath Test
      (UBT) using the Exalenz Dual Mode BreathID Hp System will also be performed within a week of
      the biopsy. The outcome of the UBT will be compared to composite score of the biopsy and the
      accuracy of the UBT will be evaluated. The UBT will be performed using breath collection
      bags, where the subject will be asked to breathe into the bags before and after ingestion of
      the 13C-labelled urea.
