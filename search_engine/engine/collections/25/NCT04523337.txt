      with an estimated 50% having criminal justice involvement annually. Justice-involved Veterans
      (JIVs) receive assistance with their addiction and behavioral health needs, but MH RRTP
      programs do not directly address their antisocial behaviors and cognitions. Furthermore, MH
      RRTP discharge is a vulnerable transition and no national transitional approach facilitates
      Veteran's engagement in prosocial community behaviors that sustain MH RRTP gains, ultimately
      reducing revolving door service use.

      Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and
      Networking-Criminal Justice version (MISSION-CJ) is a new case manager and peer delivered
      team-based treatment for JIVs with a co-occurring substance use and mental health disorder
      (COD). While MISSION-CJ derives in part from an evidence-based treatment for homeless
      individuals (MISSION), it includes a new conceptual framework and numerous new and
      differentiating features for a CJ population including: (1) a treatment planning tool focused
      on criminogenic needs that monitors progress and tunes service delivery elements; (2) a
      prosocial treatment curriculum; and (3) tools/resources to address JIVs' legal issues. With
      MISSION-CJ, this study attempts to change the practice paradigm and transform care for JIVs
      by moving beyond the current model of linking Veterans to VA care and tracking behavioral
      health outcomes, to a hybrid treatment/linkage approach that addresses criminogenic needs,
      supports engagement in VA and non-VA care, and targets recidivism as an outcome-the gold
      standard for CJ research.

      Using a Hybrid Type 1 design, this project will test the effectiveness of MISSION-CJ in a
      two-site RCT (Bedford and Palo Alto VAs) with JIVs with a COD, admitted to an MH RRTP, and
      previously arrested and charged and/or released from incarceration in the past 12 months.
