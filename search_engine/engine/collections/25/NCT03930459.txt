      (SCS) versus normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for organ preservation before liver
      transplantation with steatotic livers (between 30 % and 60% of histologic macrovesicular
      steatosis), in order to:

      Main Objective:

      To compare the effect of NMP versus SCS in preventing preservation injury and graft
      dysfunction, as measured by highest transaminase levels during the first week after liver
      transplantation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare graft and patient survival between the NMP and SCS steatotic livers.

        -  To compare the liver biochemical function between the NMP and SCS steatotic livers.

        -  To compare the physiological response to the reperfusion between the NMP and SCS
           steatotic livers.

        -  To compare the evidence of reperfusion injury between the NMP and SCS steatotic livers.

        -  To compare the evidence of ischemic cholangiopathy between the NMP and SCS steatotic
           livers.
