      devices used to treat PAD and compare patient outcomes with propensity score-matched patients
      of similar risk who receive non-paclitaxel devices.

      The primary outcome will be freedom from all-cause death using propensity-matched survival
      analysis.

      Three principle analyses are planned:

        1. Paclitaxel DCB (including the Bard Lutonix, Medtronic In.Pact Admiral, and Philips
           Spectranetics Stellarex DCB's) as compared with propensity-matched patients treated with
           plain balloons.

        2. Paclitaxel delivering DES (Cook Zilver PTX) as compared with propensity-matched cases
           using bare-metal stents (BMS).

        3. Patients treated with either Paclitaxel DCB or Paclitaxel DES compared with
           propensity-matched controls (with DCB patients matched to patients treated with plain
           balloons, and DES patients matched to patients treated with BMS).

      Note that this analysis is planned at the device class level and is not intended to compare
      early or late mortality between specific devices or brands.
