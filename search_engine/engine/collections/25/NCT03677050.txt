      mucosa during colonoscopy. Patients referred for a colonoscopy will be scheduled for an
      intake. During this intake patients receive education about Picoprep and will be asked about
      their health condition (medical history, medication use). Standard a face-to-face education
      is given by an intake nurse or doctor. The producers of Picoprep, Ferring BV designed an app
      including a drinking schedule adapted to the timing of the coloscopy, aiming a lag time
      between intake of the last Picoprep dose and the scopy of 2-4 hours. We hypothesize that the
      Boston Bowel Preparation Scale and patient satisfaction will be higher in patients receiving
      standard education plus using the bowel preparation app versus patients receiving single
      standard education.
