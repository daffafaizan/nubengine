      antibiotics (Bartlett, 2002). In hospitalized patients, AAD is related to significant
      increases in mortality, length of stay, and cost of medical care (McFarland, 2006).
      Twenty-nine percent of hospitalized patients may develop diarrhoea after antibiotic use;
      therefore, identifying strategies to minimize antibiotic-associated diarrhoea could be of
      significant medical and economic advantage (McFarland, 1998). A promising tool in this area
      is the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri
