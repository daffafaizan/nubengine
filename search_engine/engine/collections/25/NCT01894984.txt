      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time) and observational study of risperidone long-acting injection in participants with
      schizophrenia. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study
      commences on Day 1) and Treatment (that is, Week 1-24). All the eligible participants (after
      risperidone intolerance test during screening) will be receiving risperidone as intramuscular
      injection (injection of a substance into a muscle) at a dose of, either 25 milligram (mg),
      37.5 mg or 50 mg every two weeks. Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated
      through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
