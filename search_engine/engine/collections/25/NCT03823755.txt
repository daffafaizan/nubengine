      understanding of the biomechanics of this tendon after surgery, to objectively assess the
      repair of the tendon and the recovery of its mobility. The visualization of the aspect and
      the movement of this operated tendon would make it possible to adapt the rehabilitation for
      each patient and to prevent the occurrence of complications which limit functional recovery
      and source of handicap.

      The analysis of the imaging in patients evolving would establish useful criteria the surgeon
      to judge the evolution of the operated tendon.

      The first step consists in evaluating the feasibility of the acquisition of dynamic sequences
      in MRI and the possibility of observing the movement of the flexor tendon operated during the
      mobilization of the finger, and comparing the biomechanical data obtained with those of the
      nonoperated tendons and experimental models.
