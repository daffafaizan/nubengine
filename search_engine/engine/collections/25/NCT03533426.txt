      all cancer victims. Lung cancer still represents the first cause of cancer deaths and lung
      resection surgeries could be the main therapeutic procedure. Hence, the number of
      thoracotomies is progressively increasing with more & more post- thoracotomy pain . Together
      with amputation, thoracotomy is considered the main etiology of severe & long-term acute and
      chronic post-surgical pain syndromes (CPSP). The prevalence of post - thoracotomy pain
      syndrome (PTPS) is variable (30-50%). The international association for the study of pain
      (IASP) has defined PTPS as "pain that recurs or persists along the thoracotomy scar at least
      2 months after the procedure".Besides, PTPS is mostly described with neuropathic
      manifestations along the thoracotomy scar, mammary & submammary ipsilateral scapular &
      interscapular areas. Pain is often aching, burning with tingling, numbness, pruritis plus
      sensory loss and/or hypoesthesia.Preemptive post-thoracotomy analgesia is mostly multimodal &
      integrates both systemic & regional techniques. Systemic drugs (either given parenterally or
      through patient controlled - analgesia "PCA") include, NSAIDs, Cox - II inhibitors,
      paracetamol, opioids, ketamine (as N-methyl-D- aspartate blocker), gabapentins & pregabalin,
      selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and/or duloxetine .Regional analgesic techniques
      include thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) which, is considered by many as the gold standard
      analgesic mode for post-thoracotomy pain .Other regional analgesic techniques are
      paravertebral analgesia (PVB), intercostal nerve blocks and intrapleural analgesia.Recently
      SAPB has been practiced more widely as an U/S - guided, simple technique of effective
      post-thoracotomy analgesia which is comparable with standard techniques such as TEA and PVB.
