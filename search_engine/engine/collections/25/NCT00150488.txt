    
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent responders to treatment as indicated by
      improvement on a seven-point Patient Global Assessment scale at week 10 (after 6 treatments)
      compared to baseline. The patient evaluates the overall change in their condition as markedly
      improved, moderately improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, moderately worse
      or markedly worse.

      Secondary efficacy objectives will be as follows:

        1. Improvement in individual IC symptoms during the treatment period and at week 10 (after
           6 treatments) compared to baseline.

           Pain and urgency scores (0-10 cm VAS) will be obtained using patient on-site
           questionnaires prior to first treatment (baseline), and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14,
           18, 22 and 24.

        2. Change in Patient Symptom/Problem Index scores over the course of the treatment until
           the end of study (week 24) compared to baseline.

           The validated O'Leary Symptom Problem/Index will be completed prior to first treatment
           (baseline) and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.

           The validated PUF questionnaire will be completed prior to first treatment (baseline)
           and again for weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.

        3. Change in patient condition every month throughout the therapy and treatment follow-up.

      In addition to measuring the change in patient condition at week 14, the Patient Global
      Assessment will be completed at weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 24.
