      coronary syndromes (the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, MINAP), Hospital Episode
      Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) available through CALIBER
      (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records), offers
      an opportunity to investigate the association between autoimmune disorders and the initial
      presentation of non-fatal and fatal specific cardiovascular phenotypes. The use of a
      systematic approach to investigate whether a range of commonly diagnosed autoimmune disorders
      are independent risk factors for several specific and well defined arterial and venous
      diseases will help to improve the investigators understanding of the role of autoimmune
      disorders in development of specific types of CVD in both men and women and in different age
      groups. It will also provide useful information to improve existing cardiovascular risk
      prediction methods that are used in clinical practice for patient management.
