      intervention on quality of life outcomes in children with high-risk cancer. The intervention
      includes a series of tailored discussions delivered by the child's primary physician/nurse
      dyad that begins at diagnosis, and integrates visual aids to facilitate conversations with
      parents about prognosis, hopes, and goals-of-care across the cancer continuum. The central
      hypothesis is that the intervention will foster alignment of goals of care between providers
      and parents across the cancer continuum, leading to improved quality of life outcomes.
      Outcomes include: Enrollment in home hospice care, high-intensity medical interventions,
      child pain and emotional distress, parental hope, parental uncertainty and distress.
