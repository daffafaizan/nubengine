      drug, while the remaining 1/3 will receive a placebo (a pretend medicine that does nothing).
      The group you are assigned to is decided by chance (as by the toss of a coin or drawing
      straws). Neither you nor your doctor will be able to choose which group you are in. Also,
      neither you nor the researchers will know which group you are in. Participants will take
      rituximab, or the placebo, once a week during the first 4 weeks in the study. It will be
      given as an intravenous infusion at a clinical center.

      Participants will need to return to the clinical center for a visit about every 3 months for
      two years; those participants that continue to secrete insulin will have further follow-up
      for an additional two years.
