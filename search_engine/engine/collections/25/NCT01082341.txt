      irr-spz. (Short name: Irrad-SPZ) Population 27 healthy adult volunteers, males and
      non-pregnant females, between 18-45 years of age, who fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria
      (described below) as determined by clinical history and serological tests. Approximately 20
      parasitized blood-donor volunteers will be required to infected Anopheles mosquitoes which
      will be used to immunize volunteers with a total of 1000-1500 infected mosquitoes, during
      8-10 months. Afterwards challenge to prove protection.

      Number of Sites: 2 Study Duration: 2 years. Subject Duration : Step1: 1-2 hours to blood
      donors; Step 2 and 3: 2 years to immunized volunteers Objectives Primary

      â€¢ To assess the safety and protective efficacy of P. vivax irradiated sporozoite vaccination.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the immune responses and duration elicited by the P. vivax challenge in
           human Fy(+) volunteers previously immunized with irr-spz, as compared with non-immunized
           human volunteers.

        -  To determine the immune responses and duration elicited by irr-spz immunization scheme
           in human Fy(+) volunteers; comparing it with the same immunization scheme with non
           irr-spz in Fy(-) participants, and also with controls exposed to the same mosquito bite
           scheme as that of immunization but using mosquitoes without parasite infection.

        -  To study new antigens potentially useful to induce pre-erythrocytic protection against
           P. vivax malaria infection
