      increasing world wide. Patients who are colonized with MRSA are the main source for further
      distribution. In addition colonization with MRSA is a precondition for infection.

      Whole body washing with antiseptic solutions as part of eradication strategies for MRSA has
      been widely used. However, there is insufficient evidence to support use of topical
      antimicrobial therapy for eradicating of MRSA because treatment with antiseptic solution has
      never been compared to placebo.

      Comparison: The efficacy of whole body washing in the control of MRSA was studied in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The study treatment consisted
      of five days of whole body washing either with 4% chlorhexidine solution (verum) or with
      placebo. All patients received mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. The
      outcome was evaluated 3, 4, 5, 9 and 30 days after treatment by swabs taken from several body
      site.
