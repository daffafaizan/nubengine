      factors.

      Investigators will compare the outcomes/survival rate and clinical outcome of the different
      resection types (Total, near total, subtotal/debulking) of supratentorial high grade gliomas
      according to the clinical condition and comorbidities of the patient, the location and
      morphology of the lesion, the grading of lesions, and the clinical experience of the
      neurosurgeon.
