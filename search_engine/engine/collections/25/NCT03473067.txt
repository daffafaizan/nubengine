    
      In a group cluster trial, a comprehensive, tailored, data-based social norms marketing
      campaign that addresses misperceptions of: 1) the acceptability of dating and sexual
      violence; 2) gender roles; 3) sexual activity; 4) sexual communication/consent; 5) support
      for victims; and 6) bystander intervention will be evaluated among middle schools. Poster
      messaging will be paired with several systematic efforts to diffuse program content through
      the community, including a Lunch and Learn Teacher Training, Social Norms Video, Teacher
      Workbook, Parent Mailing, and Parent Information Session. A member of the
      researcher-practitioner team, designated as a School Resource Provider, will oversee campaign
      implementation in partnership with a teacher champion. The Resource Provider will also track
      campaign intensity, assess campaign credibility through intercept interviews with teachers
      and students, work with teachers to infuse messaging into classroom activities, and assist
      the teacher champion with addressing "kick-back" to the campaign. Outcome assessments will be
      completed by teachers, administrators and students. Towards the goal of exploring the role of
      other environmental factors as moderators of program effects, school administrators will
      assess their community readiness to develop and implement school dating and sexual violence
      prevention policy, in general, and social norms marketing, in particular. A neighborhood scan
      will also be conducted to estimate the density of nearby outlets associated with gender-based
      personal violence.
