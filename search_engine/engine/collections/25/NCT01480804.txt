      team, with addition of a care manager, to help overcome barriers to diabetes care in older
      adults will result in improved clinical, functional, and quality of life measures compared to
      usual care. In addition, we will assess whether the support network formed during
      intervention by the geriatric diabetes team will empower patients, resulting in long lasting
      improvement in parameters after intervention is completed. We will also explore whether
      improved blood glucose control will improve blood circulation in the brain that is
      compromised in elderly with diabetes.
