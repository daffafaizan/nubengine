      I. To demonstrate that neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with short-course
      radiation will improve the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) in microsatellite
      instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) locally advanced rectal
      adenocarcinoma at total mesorectal excision (TME).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with short-course
      radiation will improve the rate of sphincter preservation in low-lying tumors.

      II. To demonstrate that neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with short-course
      radiation will improve 5-year disease-free survival (DFS).

      III. To demonstrate that neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with
      short-course radiation will improve overall survival (OS).

      IV. To demonstrate that neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with short-course
      radiation will have acceptable safety/toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles. Starting least 2 weeks but no
      longer than 6 weeks after completion of cycle 2 of nivolumab and ipilimumab, patients undergo
      short-course radiation therapy of 5 fractions daily for 1 week. Patients then continue to
      receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. 8-12 weeks after completion of 4th cycle of nivolumab and ipilimumab, patients
      undergo total mesorectal excision.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
