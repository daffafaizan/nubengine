      prevents fractures in the elderly. It is clear that many people living in areas of northern
      latitude have less than optimal levels of vitamin D. The current recommendations for vitamin
      D intake are not enough to bring a large majority of the population to the desired adequate
      level. Furthermore, differences have been observed in the amount of Vitamin D produced in the
      skin in whites and blacks.

      Based on the evidence from literature and our experience from prior studies we hypothesize
      that:

        1. the dose of oral vitamin D3 supplement exceeds current recommendations to achieve
           adequate desired level;

        2. there may be differences in the dose-response to vitamin D supplement between Blacks and
           Whites; and

        3. vitamin D supplementation that produces serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in the
           range proposed is safe.

      The aims for this pilot study are to determine:

        1. the average dose of vitamin D3 needed to attain 25-OHD levels between 80-140 nmol/L in a
           healthy population of mixed races; and

        2. if there are differences in response to vitamin D3 supplementation between African
           American and Caucasians subjects.
