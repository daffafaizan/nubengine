      treatment for their foot ulcer at the UT Southwestern wound clinic starting on May 17, 2018
      to November 13, 2018. The investigators chose this date because that is the first time laser
      treatments were performed in the clinic. The investigators will collect the following data
      points:

        -  Ulcer etiology

        -  Ulcer location

        -  Prior ulcer treatment type and duration, and wound measurements/characteristics

        -  Wound size 4-6 weeks prior to laser treatment; at treatment time; and then each follow
           up measurement healed or x weeks

        -  eGFR

        -  Albumin

        -  Last A1c-Presence/absence of DM

        -  Amputation history

        -  Vascular status via ABI's

        -  Identify comorbidities

        -  Identify associated encounters in the patients such as complications (i.e. infection),
           related readmissions The investigators will identify this information from patient
           charts (EPIC EMR).
