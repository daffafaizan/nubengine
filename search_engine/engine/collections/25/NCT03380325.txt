      reduced whole-body glucose uptake. This study aims to identify iloprost - a stable
      prostacyclin analogue - as a possible therapeutic option to increase whole-body glucose
      uptake via enhancement of muscle perfusion.

      All participants will be subjected to two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps; one with and
      one without simultaneous iloprost infusion in a randomized cross-over design. Microvascular
      blood volume will be measured by means of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.
