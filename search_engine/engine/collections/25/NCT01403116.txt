    
      This was a randomized, open-label, 2-arm, active controlled, 12-month study of Oral TU that
      planned to enroll ≈ 300 hypogonadal men (≈ 150/group) at multiple study sites. Incorporated
      in the design was dose titration based on serum T concentration assessed 4-6 hrs post AM
      dose. Following a 2-visit screening period during which a serum T concentration was measured,
      eligible subjects were randomized to either Oral TU (Group A) or transdermal T-gel (Group B)
      for dosing during Treatment Period 1 (Days 0 to 42). Group A was initially dosed with 400 mg
      T daily (two 100 mg capsules, orally, twice a day [BID]), and Group B was initially dosed
      with 5 g of transdermal 1% T-gel.

      Serum T sampling was done on Day 30, 4-6 hours after the morning dose and these T
      concentration results were used to determine the need for dose titration. Dose titration
      occurred on Day 42 for Treatment Period 2, until Day 90. Subjects whose dose was titrated on
      Day 42 were re-evaluated on Day 60 , with dose adjustments made as necessary on Day 74.

      Serum T sampling was performed on Day 90, for Oral TU subjects who had dose titration on Day
      74, on Day 105. If the serum T level was > 1800 ng/dL, the sample was repeated; subjects were
      discontinued if the second assayed T concentration was > 1800 ng/dL. An additional dose
      titration was done for subjects whose Day 180 occurred after a protocol amendment. Subjects
      taking 150 mg T BID with serum T over 1500 ng/dL on two separate draws were discontinued.

      Safety measures included physical examination, vital signs, fasting laboratory analysis
      (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), CV biomarker monitoring [hs-CRP, Lp-PLA2, Lp(a), and
      ApoA1], measurement of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG); luteinizing hormone (LH),
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); prostate specific antigen (PSA), and the American
      Urological Association/International Prostate Symptom Score (AUA/I-PSS).
