      of the therapeutic strategies of the complications of cirrhosis. .Although surgical
      procedures have become less invasive the mortality rate in ACLD patients undergoing
      extrahepatic surgery remains high. For these reasons, an accurate prediction of operative
      risk for patient-tailored surgical planning becomes crucial.

      Purpose of the study: To evaluate the prognostic role of portal hypertension by non- invasive
      methods in predicting post-operative complications in ACLD patients undergoing elective
      extrahepatic surgery.

      Study type: An international multicenter, prospective, uncontrolled observational study

      Study design: In cirrhotic patients undergoing extrahepatic surgery, within one month, a
      complete baseline evaluation is provided. Baseline evaluation (T0) includes: signature of
      informed consent, clinical history of liver disease, comorbidities and risk factors for
      hepato-biliary complications; complete laboratory tests; liver and spleen elastography (with
      Transient Elastography, ARFI or 2D-SWE).

      After surgery, each patient is evaluated at T1 (+90 days) with Elastography, laboratory
      tests, clinical examination and T2 (+ 365 days) by a clinical examination.

      Each center will prospectively collect data according to an electronic e-CFR on REDCap
      (Research Electronic Data Capture) system, a web application designed to support data capture
      for research studies in a secure manner.

      Study duration: The study period will last approx. 730 days, with a planned follow-up of 365
      days after surgical intervention
