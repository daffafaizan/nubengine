      utilized lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and exercise among groups with BMI
      classifications of normal, overweight and mildly obese. A limitation of recent investigations
      is the failure to utilize participants who are significantly overweight. Those whose BMI
      classification extends to Class II and Class III obesity (BMI > 35.0, and BMI > 40.0) have
      not yet been studied at length, yet these individuals have been shown to be able to
      substantially improve their cardiovascular risk profiles without attaining a BMI below 25.
      Inactivity has been linked to increased adiposity and a trend toward higher levels of
      cardiovascular disease risk. It is necessary to study the relationships between weight loss
      and weight loss with added physical activity among Class II and Class III obese participants
      in order to gain a more thorough knowledge of the effects of BMI on circulating markers of
      inflammation and the cardiac structural and functional changes associated with weight loss
      among this population. A second limitation of the current research is the use of strictly
      progressive resistance training protocols. The protocols used have increased constantly in
      intensity or volume, if not both. Constant increases in intensity tend to lead to
      overtraining among participants, highlighting a need for more variation of intensity and
      volume in the training protocol in order to avoid stagnation and overtraining. Finally, no
      research has studied the specific impact of diet and resistance training on either CRP or
      cardiovascular adaptations.
