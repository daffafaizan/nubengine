      and demonstrate the bioequivalence of three 35 mg fenofibric acid tablets (105 mg total
      single dose) to a single 105 mg fenofibric acid tablet in healthy adult volunteers when each
      dose is administered under fasted conditions. Fifty-four healthy, non-smoking, non-obese,
      18-45 year old, male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion
      to receive each of three fenofibric acid dosing regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout
      period between dosing periods. On the morning of the first day of each dosing period, after
      an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive single doses of fenofibric acid
      (1 x 35 mg tablet), fenofibric acid (3 x 35 mg tablets - 105 mg total dose), or fenofibric
      acid (1 x 105 mg tablet). Fasting will continue for 4 hours after dose administration. Blood
      samples will be drawn from all participants prior to dosing and for 72 hours post-dose, at
      times sufficient to adequately define fenofibric acid pharmacokinetics. Subjects will be
      monitored throughout their participation for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or
      procedures. Seated blood pressure and pulse will be measured prior to each dose and
      approximately 2 hours after each dose to coincide with peak plasma concentrations. All
      adverse experiences, whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or observed by clinic
      staff, will be documented in the subject's case report form.
