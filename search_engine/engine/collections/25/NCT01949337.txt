    
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment groups: enzalutamide or enzalutamide,
      abiraterone and prednisone. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed for clinical outcomes for a maximum of 5 years post study
      treatment. The primary and secondary objectives are described below.

        1. Primary Objective:

           To compare the overall survival of patients with progressive metastatic
           castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with either enzalutamide only or
           enzalutamide with abiraterone and prednisone

        2. Secondary Objectives:

             -  To assess the grade 3 or higher toxicity profile and compare safety by treatment
                arm.

             -  To assess and compare post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines by
                treatment arm.

             -  To compare radiographic progression free survival defined by Prostate Cancer
                Working Group 2 (PCWG2), and objective response rate, by treatment arm.

             -  To test for radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) treatment interaction in
                predicting overall survival.

             -  To assess pre- and post-treatment measures of tumor burden and bone activity using
                sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)
                and technetium (Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy and correlate
                these measures with overall survival.

             -  To develop and validate prognostic and predictive models of overall survival that
                include baseline clinical and molecular markers.
