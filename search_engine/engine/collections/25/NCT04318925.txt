    
      Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and it is
      the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. Tick-borne disease cases reported
      to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been on the rise with over 59,000
      cases reported in 2017. This protocol is designed to collaborate with University of Maryland
      School of Medicine for the purpose of recruiting and enrolling patients with Lyme disease and
      other tickborne illnesses. This is a natural history study which has the objective of
      developing a rigorously defined population of patients with Lyme disease and other tick-borne
      illnesses, per CDC case definitions, to serve as the basis for research in multiple aspects
      of the infections. These research sub-projects have emphasis in exploring the biological
      markers of tick-borne infections, developing new diagnostic tests for these infections,
      assessing the clinical course and outcome of patients with these tick-borne infections, and
      defining the immunological response to the pathogens.
