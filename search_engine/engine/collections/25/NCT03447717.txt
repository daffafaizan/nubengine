      treated by the implentation of the AcitGait system (which has a CE-certificate in Europe).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the device on gait with a follow-up
      period of one year. Patients are assessed before implantation and at one-year follow up. At
      baseline, they are asked to walk without any assistive device, as well as with surface
      electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. At follow-up, they are asked to walk with the
      ActiGait system switched off and switched on.

      Outcome assessments include a 10m-walking test and gait analysis with a VICON 3D-camera
      system. This allows to extract spatio-temporal parameters (as steps per minute, step
      length,...) as well as kinematic data (e.g. joint ankles during the gait cycle). All outcome
      data is analyzed using statistical tests.
