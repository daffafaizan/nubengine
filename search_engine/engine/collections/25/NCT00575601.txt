      smooth muscle proliferation, ameliorating inflammation, limiting theca-interstitial
      proliferation & decreasing steroidogenesis (production of progesterone &
      testosterone).Polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is associated with increased cardiovascular
      risks and is characterized by ovarian theca-interstitial hyperplasia& hyperandrogenism .This
      study will test the hypothesis that simvastatin improves biochemical parameters& IVF-ICSI
      outcome in Pcos patients.
