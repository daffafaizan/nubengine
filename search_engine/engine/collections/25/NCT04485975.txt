      medications cannot be used due to the side effects or attain no adequate hormonal suppression
      response at the highest dosage and in cases of rapid onset of clinical symptoms. This study
      presents the treatment results of patients who underwent TPE and subsequently operated for
      thyrotoxicosis.

      Methods: The files of 27 patients who underwent preoperative TPE for thyrotoxicosis between
      January 1999 and February 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The demographic and clinical
      features of the patients were included.
