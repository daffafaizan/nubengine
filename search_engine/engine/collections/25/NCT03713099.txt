    
      Adult patients with medically inoperable and operable secondary soft tissue lesion(s) of the
      lung less than 2cm will undergo transbronchial microwave ablation performed by an
      interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon using cone beam CT imaging for probe
      guidance and confirmation on ablation outcome. All treated patients will be followed for one
      year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and safety.
