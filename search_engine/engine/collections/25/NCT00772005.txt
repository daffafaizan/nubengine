    
      This study was designed and was powered to evaluate the efficacy and safety of armodafinil
      treatment at dosages of 150, 200, and 250 mg/day compared with placebo over 24 weeks as an
      adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication (olanzapine, oral risperidone, or
      paliperidone) in adults with schizophrenia who were clinically stable at study entry.
      Specifically, the effects of armodafinil treatment on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia
      were the primary assessment in this study.
