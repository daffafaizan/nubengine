      be the control subjects, and these will be selected from patients who are admitted for
      scheduled cesarean delivery. Ten women will be selected from women who develop uterine atony
      either following cesarean delivery, or postpartum patients who delivered vaginally but
      subsequently required surgical management of uterine atony (hysterectomy or uterine saving
      surgery). From each patient a small amount of uterine muscle will be excised and placed in a
      fixative, preservative transport medium. Ten cubic centimeters of blood will be drawn from
      each patient to accompany the tissue. The tissue and blood will be processed and analyzed to
      identify differences in the tissue and plasma of messenger RNA, micro RNA, long non-coding
      RNA, and DNA methylation in normal and atonic uterine patients. Statistical analysis of these
      markers will be performed to determine whether there are significant differences in their
      expression. It is hoped that differences will be discovered that may be used diagnostically
      to predict uterine atony, and differences that may suggest the etiology of uterine atony.
