      have led to population displacement, worsening living conditions, exacerbation of poverty,
      and disruption of already weakened social service systems. As implemented, the Suubi Project
      goes considerably beyond the usual care, which primarily consists of institutionalization and
      reactive strategies (involving food and material aid). Specifically, the intervention
      promotes children's savings accounts, also known as children development accounts, for
      postprimary education and microenterprise development (i.e., development of small
      income-generating businesses).

      The Suubi intervention is grounded in asset theory (Sherraden 1990, 1991), which holds that
      assets (e.g., savings, educational opportunities, and economic opportunities in the form of
      income-generating activities or microenterprises) have important economic, social, and
      psychological benefits for individuals and families. Asset building is increasingly viewed as
      a critical factor for reducing poverty, improving psychosocial functioning, and positively
      affecting attitudes and behaviors.
