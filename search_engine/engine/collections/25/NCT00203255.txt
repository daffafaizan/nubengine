      migraines experienced around the menstrual cycle are most often associated with premenstrual
      complaints such as nausea, backache and breast tenderness. The condition of hormone-related
      headache (i.e. menstrual migraine) is unclear.

      Soy isoflavones have been used to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. They contain natural
      estrogens (female hormones). Since menstrual migraine is thought to be associated with the
      withdrawal of estrogen, or the natural fall of estrogen levels, the use of this natural
      source of estrogen may be helpful in the prevention of menstrually-associated migraine.
