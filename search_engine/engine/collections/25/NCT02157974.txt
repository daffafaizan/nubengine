    
      Hepatic glucose release will be assessed with a stable isotope glycerol tracer, lipolysis
      with a glycerol tracer, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis with an acetate tracer. Data will be
      collected fasting and after a glucose challenge. The degree of hepatic steatosis and
      abdominal fat partitioning will be assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and total
      body composition with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
