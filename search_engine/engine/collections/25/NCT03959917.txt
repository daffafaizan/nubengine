      men. After the introduction of bipolar resection with saline, the serious complication of
      transurethral resection syndrome (i.e. acute hypo-natremia) has been eradicated.

      The post surgical care is generally a couple of days inhospital care. The reson for this, is
      the risk of clot formation and in rare cases post surgical infection.

      However, in selected cases, outpatient surgery has been performed with encouraging results.
      However, the technique has not been spread widely. The use of ambulatory surgery would reduce
      the direct cost of the procedure, thereby increasing itÂ´s availability.

      Also, complications in contemporary TUR P in the modern era (outside of the selected patients
      of clinical trials) is lacking. The information of complications that can be expected is
      therefore an important for patient counseling. In some studies, the use of incontinence pads
      after TUR P is more than 15%, which is important to reliably ascertain if this is holds true.
