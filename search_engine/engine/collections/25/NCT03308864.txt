      intervention that has been shown to be efficacious in a number of randomized control trials
      for adolescent depression. The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of incorporating Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A) into routine
      psychotherapeutic treatment at Strong Behavioral Health: Child and Adolescent Outpatient. The
      second aim of the present investigation is to examine changes in adolescent symptomatology,
      interpersonal functioning, perceived stress, and social support throughout the course of
      treatment. The third aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of IPT-A versus
      treatment as usual (TAU) at reducing depressive symptoms among adolescents.
