      Primary objective:

      The main objective is try to stablish a descriptive panel (first phase of a score system)
      based in the conjunction or sum of several clinical and laboratory parameters (molecular and
      genetic factors). The aim is to detect in a fast, early and successful way those patients
      that presents a high risk to develop an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the future in a
      specific population: HIV and HCV coinfected patients. The establishment of this panel will
      allow clinicians set up a correct treatment decreasing the probability of liver cirrhosis and
      HCC.
