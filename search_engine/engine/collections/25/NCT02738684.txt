      could be used as a screening method for EGFR-TKI targeted therapy for late stage lung cancer
      patients, as well as a standard for the therapy efficacy. This study can be used as a
      standard to assess gefitinib' s efficacy after 8 weeks of treatment in IIIB or stage IV lung
      cancer through tumor tissue negative, ctDNA positive EGFR mutation.
