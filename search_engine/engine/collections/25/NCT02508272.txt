      blood samples by high throughput technologies. Genetic and molecular characteristics of the
      immune system after severe trauma will be crosslinked to clinical aspects of posttraumatic
      organ failure, with the goal of identifying typical molecular "fingerprints". Patients with
      and without sepsis or organ failure will be compared with the goal to develop a diagnostic
      test designed to predict the clinical course following severe trauma. Criteria for study
      enrollment includes patient age ≥18 y, an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 17 points, and time
      from injury to admission < 6 h. Whole blood from trauma patients will be collected within the
      first 6 h after trauma (day 0) and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21.
