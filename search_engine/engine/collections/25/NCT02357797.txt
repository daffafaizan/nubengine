    
      This is a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study
      comparing adjunctive vortioxetine with identically appearing adjunctive placebo pills in 88
      stable patients with a research diagnosis of schizophrenia determined with the Structured
      Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). Patient randomization will be stratified by illness
      duration (i.e., </=5 years and >5 years) in order to allow for post-hoc analyses examining
      whether earlier illness moderates greater negative and /or cognitive symptom reduction in
      response to vortioxetine.

      Patients with clinical stability for at least 3 months and stable antipsychotic and
      psychotropic medication treatment for at least the last 4 weeks and without relevant
      depression, positive psychotic symptoms or extrapyramidal symptoms EPS will be eligible.
      After written informed consent, patients will undergo a screening visit to confirm full study
      eligibility. If all in- and exclusion criteria are fulfilled, patients will undergo a
      baseline assessment and then be randomized 1:1 to 16 weeks of adjunctive treatment with
      vortioxetine or placebo. Subsequently, patients will be seen at week 1, 2, 4 and monthly for
      the next 3 months.
