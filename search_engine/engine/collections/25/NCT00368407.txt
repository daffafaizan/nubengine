    
      Vitiligo patients were treated with 308-nm excimer laser for 20 sessions at different
      frequencies (0.5×, 1.0×, 2.0× and 3.0× weekly). Treatment protocols adapted the dose to the
      lesions and not to the minimal erythemal dose. Treatment efficacy was blindly evaluated by 2
      independent physicians. Re-pigmentation rate was graded on a 6-point scale. The onset of
      re-pigmentation of vitiligo lesions was evaluated after 5 treatment sessions. The differences
      between Group 0.5×, 1.0×, 2.0× and 3.0× linking different clinical variables were assessed.
