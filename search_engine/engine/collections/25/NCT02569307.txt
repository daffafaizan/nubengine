      Omega-3 fatty acids will have reduced transition rates to psychosis over a one year follow up
      period (from baseline) compared with Treatment-As-Usual (TAU). The transition rates will be
      lowest in the group receiving minocycline and Omega-3 fatty acids in combination.

      Secondary objective is to determine that the Persons with ARMS who are prescribed minocycline
      and / or Omega-3fatty acids in combination will have greatest symptom reduction compared with
      TAU.

      This study will be a six-month intervention of minocycline and/or Omega-3 fatty acids added
      to TAU in patients with ARMS, using a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind factorial
      design.The study will be a four-arm trial: one arm will receive minocycline with TAU; the
      second arm will receive Omega-3 fatty acids with TAU; the third arm will receive both
      minocycline and Omega-3 fatty acids with TAU; the fourth arm will receive placebo with TAU.
