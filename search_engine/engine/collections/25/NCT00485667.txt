      developing SKY0402. A formulation of bupivacaine, given as a single injection after surgery,
      that could provide adequate, continuous, and extended pain relief would greatly simplify
      postoperative pain management, reduce the need for repeated administration, and minimize
      break-through episodes of pain.
