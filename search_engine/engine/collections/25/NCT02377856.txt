      treatment efficacy and is the mainstream of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection.
      Current guideline suggests pegylated interferon monotherapy for patients with acute HCV
      infection. The efficacy might greatly improves if the treatment starts earlier. An estimation
      of 20 percents of patients could recover from acute infection spontaneously within 6 months
      after exposure,however. The present study aims to clarify the efficacy of pegylated
      interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for patients with hepatitis C six months after
      onset of acute infection
