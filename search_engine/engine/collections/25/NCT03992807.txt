      demands for greater visual functioning. Patients with age-related cataract face their initial
      decision about when to undergo cataract surgery. Although the majority of patients want to
      participate in a shared decision-making process, no decision aid has been available to
      improve the quality of decision. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a decision
      aid increases informed decision about cataract surgery for patients with age-related
      cataract.
