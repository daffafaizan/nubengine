      pain and nausea on a line graph. If the patient is a female of child bearing age, a urine
      pregnancy test will be done per standard of care. After this, an IV catheter will be placed
      in a vein in the patients arm. Pain medicine will be given through this IV per the doctor's
      order. With this medicine, patients will be given 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of either
      Sodium Chloride (salt water) or Phenergan mixed with Sodium Chloride (salt water). Phenergan
      is a medication typically used to help with nausea and is a common ingredient in prescription
      cough medicine.

      After this is finished, patients will be asked to rate their pain and nausea in 30 minutes,
      and again 1, 2, and 4 hours later. If the doctor decides the patient is able to be discharged
      from the emergency room before the 4 hours are up, they will be asked to rate your pain and
      nausea again before going home, and the study will be stopped at that time.
