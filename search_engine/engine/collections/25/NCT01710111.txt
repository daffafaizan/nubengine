      with the influenza virus via droplets into the nose. Other volunteers (Recipients) will then
      be exposed to them by occupying the same room (in the day time) and taking part in certain
      activities e.g. playing card games. Some of the Recipients will wear face shields and clean
      their hands regularly during the times they are with the Donors. The wearing of face shields
      together with good hand hygiene should reduce the spread of infection through large
      respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces but will not prevent infection
      that occurs through aerosols in the air. Use of symptom diaries and diagnostic tests for
      influenza will allow the presence of subsequent illness to be identified. Volunteers will be
      required to participate in the quarantine facility for up to approximately 13 days (typically
      9 for Donors and 13 days for Recipients), plus study screening clinics and followup.

      Additionally, during the study, environmental sampling will be performed looking for the
      presence of influenza virus. Air sampling and swabbing of surfaces and objects may provide
      information enabling us to better understand the routes of transmission.
