      dystonia, demonstrated in fact, after neurological screening, to be of psychogenic origine.
      These patients are not candidate for functional surgery and, furthermore, usually refuse
      psychotherapy leading them to medical nomadism. This study proposes to evaluate the efficacy
      of an innovative intervention program based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback that
      promotes self-regulatory skills in dysfunctional movement disorders (DMD) patients in order
      to improve their condition and symptomatology.

      Heart rate is under the control of efferent sympathetic and vagal activities directed to the
      sinus node, which are modulated by central brain stem (vasomotor and respiratory centers) and
      peripheral oscillators (oscillation in arterial pressure and respiratory movements). Spectral
      analysis of HRV is a reliable quantitative method for analyzing the modulatory effects of
      neural mechanisms on the sinus node. Several biofeedback protocols and assistive electronic
      technologies, such as proposed by SymbioCenterÂ©, exist to enhance increase HRV and
      synchronize respiration with the heart rhythm. HRV biofeedback training appears to be an
      opportunity in the patient's management in order of preventing medical overconsuming. It is
      offering a safe and non-pharmacological alternative approach managed by a multidisciplinary
      team in a functional neurosurgery unit. It is expected that developing respiratory coherence
      in these patients will improve their painful symptomatology.
