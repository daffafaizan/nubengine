           percutaneous coronary angioplasty in stable patients.

        -  Purpose : to compare efficacy and security of use or not of different anticoagulant
           treatments during percutaneous coronary angioplasty in patients with double
           antiaggregant therapy.

        -  Abstract : In stable patients pretreated with double antiaggregant therapy use of IV
           anticoagulants has not been yet evaluated during angioplasty. In this prospective
           randomized trial we want to compare in such patients the efficacy and security of the
           administration of IV heparin, IV enoxaparin, IV bivalirudin and no use of anticoagulant
           during coronary angioplasty. We will evaluate in each group ischaemic events (clinic,
           ECG and biology) and haemorrhagic events (clinic, biology) with a one month follow up.

        -  Primary outcome: ischaemic events via troponin Ic measurements during 24 hours post
           procedure.

        -  Secondary outcomes: haemorrhagic events : clinical and biological evaluation (Hb, Ht,
           TIMI score)

        -  Study design : monocentric randomized clinical trial type therapeutic equivalence phase
           IV.

        -  Interventions : In patients prepared with therapeutic association (aspirin clopidogrel)
           comparison between use or no of anticoagulant (IV heparin, IV enoxaparin or IV
           bivalirudin).

        -  Number of subjects : 120 per group (total of 480).

        -  Statistical analysis : multivariate analysis with logistic regression models : each end
           point (troponin Ic increase, haemoglobin decrease, …) will be explicated with treatment
           group and other covariates (sex, age, creatinine, …).
