      rectal stump and end colostomy.

      End colostomy: A stoma is created from one end of the bowel while the other portion of the
      bowel is either removed or sewn shut (Hartmann's pouch).

      The second operation (reversal) requires a colo-rectal anastomosis.

      Primary anastomosis: colonic resection with primary anastomosis and defunctioning ileostomy.
      The second operation (stoma reversal) requires an entero-enteral anastomosis.

      Anastomosis: is to join together two bowel ends to restore continuity after resection or
      stoma formation.

      Colostomy: is a reversible surgical procedure in which a stoma is formed by drawing the
      healthy end of the colon through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall and suturing it
      into place. This opening, in conjunction with the attached stoma appliance, provides an
      alternative channel for feces to leave the body.

      Ileostomy is a surgical opening constructed by bringing the loop of small intestine (the
      ileum) out onto the surface of the skin.
