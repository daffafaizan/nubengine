      and efficacy of AR19 in the treatment of ADHD in adults from 18 through 55 years of age.
      Safety parameters and therapeutic effect will be evaluated throughout the trial. A target of
      312 subjects is set for enrollment. Once subjects are determined to meet all inclusion
      criteria and were screened, they will be randomized to 20 or 40 mg AR19 daily or placebo.
