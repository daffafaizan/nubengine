    
      The principal objective is to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve with placebo stimulation, applied 20 minutes daily
      for 3 months, in Lower Urinary Tract Disorders (LUTD) in patients with Parkinson's disease or
      multisystem atrophy, evaluated using the PGI-I (Patient Global Impression of improvement)
      tool.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy of TENS with placebo stimulation on
      change before/after 3 months of treatment on:

        -  the intensity of urinary symptoms, evaluated using the Patient Global Impression of
           Severity (PGI-S) scale

        -  the number of voidings in 24 hours, number of episodes of urinary incontinence in 24
           hours and maximum bladder capacity, evaluated by a voiding diary over 3 days

        -  urinary symptoms, evaluated with the urinary symptom profile (USP) questionnaire

        -  quality of life, assessed by the Qualiveen-SFÂ® questionnaire

        -  post-void residual volume measured by bladder ultrasound and effect on the development
           of infectious complications, by comparing the number of urinary infections over 3 months
           in each group.

      Lastly, the safety of TENS will be compared with that of placebo stimulation by the
      occurrence of adverse events during the 3 months of treatment.
