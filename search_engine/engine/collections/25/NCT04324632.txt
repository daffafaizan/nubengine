    
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with a
      remitting-relapsing disease pattern. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)
      represent the two main forms of IBD.

      In CD inflammation affects various parts of the bowel, separated by unchanged intestinal
      segments, while in ulcerative colitis enteric involvement is continuous, extending from the
      rectum throughout the colon. Additionally, in Crohn's disease the inflammatory process
      spreads through all layers of the intestinal wall, while in UC only the mucosa and sub mucosa
      are affected.

      Imaging findings, endoscopic studies and histological data together with clinical assessment,
      can be used to help distinguish these two forms, determine prognosis, assess disease activity
      and to inform treatment decision-making.

      A "treat-to-target" strategy with close monitoring of intestinal inflammation is recommended
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ileocolonoscopy (CS) remains the gold-standard for
      assessing disease activity in IBD but is a relatively invasive procedure and is impossible to
      repeat in the context of tight monitoring strategies.

      MRE is preferred over computed tomography enterography by most radiologists and
      gastroenterologists because of the potential for differentiating active inflammation from
      fibrotic strictures, and due to the lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. This is
      especially true in children, as the onset of IBD in childhood is a known risk factor for high
      cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation from imaging.

      MRE furthermore provides a transmural study of bowel loops (oedema, wall thickening, and
      enhancement post contrast). These features make MRE ideally suitable to the IBD population.
