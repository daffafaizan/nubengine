      may describe regulatory control of oxygen transport and utilization and have greater
      reliability and less inherent risk than assessment of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in
      patients for whom exercise is limited by pain, excessive fatigue, dyspnea and motivation. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of exercise intensity on the time
      constant describing changes in VO2 (tauVO2) during recovery from one minute of constant work
      rate exercise. Five normal healthy volunteers ages 18 and older will perform a progressive
      maximal aerobic exercise test, using a cycle ergometer, to determine VO2max and lactate
      threshold (LT) estimated by gas exchange. Each subject will also complete a series of maximal
      constant work rate tests and submaximal constant work rate tests at 80% LT and 50% of the
      difference between LT and VO2max (50% delta). Breath by breath variability and VO2 span will
      be used to determine the number of constant work rate test repetitions, for each subject for
      each exercise intensity, needed to establish confidence in tauVO2. A mean response profile of
      VO2 recovery kinetics for each exercise intensity will be analyzed using non-linear
      regression to determine tauVO2. To examine the effect of exercise intensity on tauVO2, one
      way analysis of variance will be used to determine whether differences exist among maximal
      and submaximal (80% LT and 50% delta) time constants. We hypothesize that there will be no
      significant differences among time constants for VO2 during recovery from maximal and
      submaximal constant work rate exercise lasting one minute. The results of this study are
      expected to provide increased understanding of the measurement of VO2 kinetics during
      recovery.
