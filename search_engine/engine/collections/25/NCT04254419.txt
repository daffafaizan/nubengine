      infusions over 12 weeks. Each cycle will consist of 1 infusion per week for 3 weeks, followed
      by a rest week (week 4). Dose will be escalated in an inter-patient stepwise fashion
      consisting of 4 dose levels until dose limiting toxicities are observed or the recommended
      phase II dose is determined.
