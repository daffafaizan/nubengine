      evaluation using a community-randomized controlled trial (CRCT); and 2) a detailed analysis
      of intervention costs, linked to the impact evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of
      these interventions.

      For the CRCT, sixty World Vision drop-in centers which deliver standard care were randomly
      assigned to one of four study conditions: IPTG, Vhutshilo, IPTG+Vhutshilo, and control.
      Approximately 1600 adolescent OVC aged 14-17 years (current beneficiaries at the drop-in
      centers) and their caregivers were eligible to participate in the study at baseline.

      Participants were visited three times including the baseline survey. Follow-up data
      collection was conducted in two rounds. The first round took place 8 months after the
      baseline survey and immediately following intervention exposure. A second follow-up round
      took place a year later, allowing assessment of both the immediate and longer-term impact of
      the interventions.

      Participants were interviewed at home in Xhosa or Sesotho. Caregivers in the sample completed
      face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers, while adolescents complete surveys used a
      mix of face-to-face interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interview technology
      (ACASI).
