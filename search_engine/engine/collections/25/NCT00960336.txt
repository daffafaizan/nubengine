      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, in terms of
           objective response rate, in elderly women with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate chemotherapy-induced toxicities in these patients.

        -  Assess the disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Study the geriatric covariates.

        -  Assess the covariates predictive of the hematopoietic reserve and the risk of febrile
           neutropenia in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60-90 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      progressive disease.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
