      in the United States. One strategy to increase the number of available kidneys is to offer
      kidney transplant candidates kidneys that come from donors who have an increased risk of
      transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Increased
      risk kidney donors are defined as those who have engaged in behaviors associated with an
      increased risk of HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, and comprise approximately 9% of all US
      deceased organ donors. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy mandated
      informed consent from recipients who accept increased risk kidneys. The objective of this
      study is to increase study participants' comprehension about increased risk donor kidneys
      necessary for informed consent. To accomplish this objective, we will develop a web-based
      tool that educates and assesses participants' comprehension (Inform Me), as a supplement to
      current informed consent processes. We will then compare the effectiveness of the current
      informed consent processes supplemented by Inform Me, with the current consent processes
      alone. The tool will utilize health information technology to deliver information about the
      definition of, risks, benefits, and alternatives to using increased risk donor kidneys via a
      web-based application. Computer adaptive learning will personalize information presented to
      each candidate according to his/her comprehension levels in interactive chapters to increase
      comprehension. Inform Me will facilitate nurses' primary role as patient educators.
