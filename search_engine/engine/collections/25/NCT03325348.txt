      mortality. Parenteral therapy needs more resources, more monitoring and supervision. Oral
      therapy is cheap, easily available, easy to administer especially in resource constrained
      settings

      OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of nifedipine and labetalol in terms of control of BP in
      pre eclamptic pregnant patients

      Design: Randomised control trial SETTING: Department Obstetrics & gynaecology, Services
      Hospital, Services Institute of Medical Sciences.Lahore POPULATION: Pregnant patients with BP
      160/110 mm Hg or symptoms of severe preeclampsia

      METHODS: Patients are randomised to receive nifedipine (10 mg tablet, orally, up to five
      doses) and intravenous placebo saline injection or intravenous labetalol injection (in an
      escalating dose regimen of 20, 40, 80, 80 and 80 mg) and a placebo tablet every 15 minutes
      until the target blood pressure of â‰¤140/90mmHg is achieved. Crossover treatment is given if
      the initial treatment regimen is unsuccessful
