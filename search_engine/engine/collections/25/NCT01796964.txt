    
      This study consisted of 16 visits (Screening, Baseline [Day 0], and 14 post-baseline
      assessment visits) that occurred at 4-week intervals through Week 56. Enrolled subjects were
      randomized 1:1 to receive ESBA1008 or EYLEA. All subjects received active intravitreal (IVT)
      injections at baseline with 2 additional loading doses of the assigned investigational
      product at 4-week intervals (ie, at Weeks 4 and 8) and then received further injections at
      8-weeks intervals at Weeks 16, 24, and 32. Subjects in the ESBA1008 group also received an
      injection at Week 44, while subjects in the EYLEA group also received injections at Weeks 40
      and 48. To maintain the study masking, subjects in the ESBA1008 group received sham
      injections at Weeks 40 and 48 (when the subjects in the EYLEA group received active
      injections), while subjects in the EYLEA group received a sham injection at Week 44 (when the
      subjects in the ESBA1008 group received an active injection). All subjects were followed up
      to Week 56. Week 40 visit was the end of assessment period for the 8-week treatment cycle.
