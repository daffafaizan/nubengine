      effects of early mobilization in the ICU versus only conventional intensive care for
      improving physical function after ICU discharge, and after hospital discharge, in patients
      undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure or sepsis.

      Recently, several studies on rehabilitation treatment for patients in intensive care have
      reported that rehabilitation treatment is safe for patients with ventilators, elderly
      patients, and patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the United States and Europe, evidence of the
      stability and clinical outcomes of physical and occupational rehabilitation in the ICU have
      already been established. In contrast, there is a lack of cost analysis and health and
      sociological grounds for intensive care rehabilitation in Korea. Therefore, there is an
      urgent need to evaluate the clinical effects of early rehabilitation, starting on the very
      first day in the ICU, in patients with acute respiratory failure and sepsis, requiring
      mechanical ventilation.

      The clinical study plan of the current study is as follows. In ICU patients undergoing
      mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure or sepsis, the clinical effects of early
      mobilization on improving physical function will be assessed using FSS-ICU at discharge from
      the ICU and discharge from the hospital, and compared to those who did not receive early
      mobilization.
