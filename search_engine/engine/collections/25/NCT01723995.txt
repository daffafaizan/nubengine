      nipple trauma, lifting of stipulated criteria, and inclusion of women in the study upon
      acceptance and signing of the consent form. To collect the data, a group was formed with
      people trained as evaluators, responsible for election, randomization, filling of First
      Assessment and Subsequent Assessment forms, recording of photo images and pain evaluation
      before and after treatment with laser; and applicators, responsible for laser handling and
      irradiation. Data collection followed the following order: filling of the first instrument,
      breast image capture, suckling observation, identification of pain during the child's breast
      sucking, laser irradiation and re-identification of pain during the child's breast sucking
      after laser treatment. The collection of data of this form occurred continuously every twelve
      hours until repair of the nipple trauma or patient discharge. A minimum of two and a maximum
      of six assessments were carried out, from the inclusion of the patient in the study (taken as
      zero hour) to 60 hours postpartum. Irradiation, in turn, was performed every 24 hours during
      the same period, including one to three irradiations per patient in each of the breasts.
