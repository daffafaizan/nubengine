      cell tumors or other malignant tumors. However, some studies revealed that patients with
      hereditary persistence of AFP also had persistent abnormal AFP. Therefore, we study will
      recruit the patients and their family with elevated AFP (>20 ng/mL) and normal AFP patients
      being control groups. Then, their AFP genes extracted from the blood will be analyzed. The
      hypothesis of this study is that the mutation of AFP gene might be one of the causes of
      abnormal AFP.
