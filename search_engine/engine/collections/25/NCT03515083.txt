      improved compliance with apixaban therapy if they complete a daily measurement of heart
      rhythm via a smartphone electrocardiogram monitor, as compared to patients managed in a
      conventional manner.

      Primary Endpoint

        1. Primary Endpoint 1: is the percent compliance with apixaban therapy as measured by the
           amount of apixaban medication that was consumed per month. Compliance is defined as "the
           extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a
           dosing regimen." Percent compliance will be measured as a continuous variable and strict
           cutoffs for 'compliant' and 'non-compliant' status will not be imposed.

           Secondary Endpoints

        2. Secondary Endpoint 1: is the number of deaths from any cause, stroke, and
           hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and/or congestive heart failure. Given the low
           numbers of patients in this study, this will be a composite endpoint of all of these
           outcomes, since there is insufficient sample size to examine each outcome individually.

        3. Secondary Endpoint 2: is the self assessment of atrial fibrillation symptom severity
           through the use of a standardized scale.

      While the secondary endpoints are not directly related to the primary endpoint, there is a
      possibility that the intervention may lead to changes in health maintenance behavior, which
      may lead to differences in the secondary endpoints. While this study may not be powered to
      differentiate between these secondary endpoints, if a trend is noted, this may be hypothesis
      generating for future studies.
