      examinations, of a follicle antral count by transvaginal ultrasound and AMH measurement.

      At baseline, physicians will complete a short questionnaire to check the inclusion criterion,
      the results of the measurement of follicle count and hormone measurement (including AMH).
      Cases and controls will respond to self-administered questionnaire at inclusion with
      information about their medical history, their demographics, their tobacco and alcohol
      consumption, their occupation and products handled in the workplace. Blood samples (for
      measure of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals) and urine (for measure of
      metabolites of glycol ethers) will be collect at baseline. Occupational exposures to solvents
      will be defined using job exposures matrices. The risk of decreased ovarian reserve will be
      analyzed using logistic regressions for each exposure of interest adjusting for potential
      confounders.
