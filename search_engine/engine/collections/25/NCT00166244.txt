      although circumstantial evidence suggests the measurement of mycophenolic acid plasma
      concentrations adds to patient management.

      A concerted effort to test the hypothesis that TDM will improve outcome in mycophenolate
      mofetil therapy in a prospective randomised trial is to be made if we want to have a solid
      base for the continued measurements of mycophenolic acid concentrations in the future. This
      trial aims to demonstrate the added value of TDM for mycophenolic acid, by comparing fixed
      dose treatment with concentration controlled mycophenolate mofetil treatment in kidney
      transplant recipients.
