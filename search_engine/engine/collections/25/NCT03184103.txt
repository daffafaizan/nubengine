      streptococci and follow upper airway infections such as pharyngitis or tonsillitis, by 14 to
      21 days and 3-6 weeks after skin infection especially in warmer climates .

      In recent decades the number of patients with post streptococcal glomerulonephritis has
      decreased considerably in the United States and Europe industrialized countries. In other
      parts of the world ,some developing communities. the incidence of post streptococcal
      glomerulonephritis has remained high. post streptococcal glomerulonephritis is one of the
      leading cause requiring hospital admissions in children , and it is also an important cause
      of acute renal failure in developing countries. Though deaths due to this disease are rare,
      it can cause serious complications such as hypertensive emergency, congestive cardiac
      failure, renal failure, encephalopathy and retinopathy .

      Acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis can also progress to rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis which is defined as''a syndrome that progresses rapidly within a few weeks
      or months to renal failure and is accompanied by urinary findings of nephritis.'' The
      clinical concept of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis includes various renal diseases
      that cause renal function to deteriorate over a subacute course. Necrotizing crescentic
      glomerulonephritis is often observed in histopathological findings .

      Acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis was diagnosed in the presence of :

      features of acute nephritic syndrome. evidence of recent streptococcal infection. lower serum
      complement three levels. Anti streptolysin o titre >200 units/ml was considered as evidence
      of recent streptococcal infection
