      extensive research, the exact etiological relations have not been established.

      Periodontal disease is a subclinical and persistent infection source which induces the
      systemic inflammatory reactions and increases the risk of preeclampsia. It is believed that
      the results will set light to the etiology of preeclampsia and will help to develop
      strategies to prevent the disease.
