      performed in a single site (Centre Cap, Montpellier, France). Six subjects per dose group
      were enrolled into 1 of 4 groups with escalating doses of ABX464 (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg).
      For each dose group, a first subject was treated, if no adverse event (AE) occurred, a second
      subject was dosed one hour later. The four last subjects were dosed the day after if no
      clinically significant AE occurred. Escalation to the following dose level was decided after
      review of PK and safety data (laboratory results, ECG, vital signs and AEs)
