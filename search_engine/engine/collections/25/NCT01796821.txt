    
      A double-blind, randomized,vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, and dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SR-T100 gel in patients with EGW(s). The primary efficacy
      endpoint will be defined as the proportion of patients whose baseline EGW(s) on the treated
      area achieve total clearance. The efficacy of SR-T100 gel in prevention of new EGW(s)
      occurrence will be evaluated. Distinct to existing medications for EGWs, SR-T100 gel
      possesses characteristics of high safety and low LSR causality. SR-T100 gel will be
      administered on EGW lesion(s) for clearance and on the surrounding clinical normal skin for
      prevention of new EGW(s) occurrence.
