        1. Development and validation of the CAT. 4 steps :

             -  Elaboration of a pool of items, based on literature review and interview with

             -  Selection of the most relevant items based on a qualitative approach using
                cognitive interview with patients.

             -  Calibration of the item bank : the psychometric properties of the item bank will be
                based on classical test and item response theories and approaches, including the
                evaluation of unidimensionality, item response theory model fitting, and analyses
                of differential item functioning.

             -  Metrological validation of the CAT.
