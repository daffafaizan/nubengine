      and intake of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. Preliminary data from ongoing
      intervention trials carried out at the IFR suggest that dietary changes can directly
      influence the metabolic profile of prostate tissue. The most significant result observed to
      date is that of sulphate accumulation within the prostate. The additional sulphate is likely
      to drive synthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, a universal sulphate donor, a
      process which would consume energy from ATP. A significant rise in levels of both ADP and
      phosphate has also been observed in prostate tissue from these studies, supporting the
      potential depletion of cellular ATP. Interestingly, the data indicate that the extent of ADP
      accumulation is negatively correlated with prostate cancer progression.

      The investigators now propose to undertake a two arm parallel un-blinded study to test the
      hypothesis that a short-term intervention with broccoli soups will lead to the accumulation
      of sulphate and ADP in prostate tissue. A potential increase in glutathione metabolites
      indicating a change in redox status, and therefore functional status, of specific genes
      involved in tumour suppression (PTEN) will also be investigated.

      Furthermore, the investigators aim to determine whether the accumulation of sulphate and ADP
      is specific to the prostate gland through the metabolic analyses of both prostate and
      non-prostate tissues.
