      is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This debilitating form of AMD
      affects the macula lutea, the central part of the retina, which is responsible for high
      resolution visual acuity. Characteristic findings in neovascular AMD include the development
      of new, abnormal blood vessels in the choroid layer beneath the macula otherwise known as
      CNV.

      Current treatment options for this condition have included include laser therapy,
      photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intraocular injections (different types of anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factors) alone or in combination. While current treatments were
      demonstrated to slow the progression of vision loss, neither therapy was shown to
      significantly improve visual acuity.

      Given their different modes of action, it is believed that combination therapy of Ranibizumab
      with PDT may lead to better visual outcomes and may result in an improved effect in treating
      AMD and therefore may help decrease the need for monthly Ranibizumab injections. After the
      first injection, regardless of which group the patient has been assigned to, they will
      receive Ranibizumab injections at 4 week intervals if clinically indicated. The purpose of
      the this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes of intraocular Ranibizumab injections in
      combination with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for the treatment of neovascular AMD.
