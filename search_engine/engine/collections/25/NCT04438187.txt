    
      This study will involve 8 centers is to determine the effect of delaying antimicrobial
      initiation until objective microbiologic data is obtained in patients with presumed
      ICU-acquired pneumonia without septic shock. The study team will compare two sequential
      4-month periods in each unit, one 'aggressive' antimicrobial initiation period and one
      'conservative' antimicrobial initiation period.

      This study will serve the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine feasibility of a larger multicenter study of the same design as
      well as assess protocol adherence across multiple centers.

      Specific Aim 2: Prospectively determine the all-cause, in-hospital mortality for all patients
      with suspected pneumonia who were treated under either an aggressive or conservative
      antimicrobial initiation protocol.

      Specific Aim 3: Prospectively determine antimicrobial initiation rates, total days of
      antimicrobial administration, hospital and ICU length of stay, and ventilator-free alive days
      for patients treated under each protocol.

      Specific Aim 4: To survey physicians that participated in the study to assess their feelings
      about the study including level of comfort starting antimicrobials aggressively, level of
      comfort withholding antimicrobials until definitive evidence of infection, perceived protocol
      adherence, perceived importance of the study, and willingness to participate in other studies
      of its kind (to be performed after closure of the clinical portion of the study).
