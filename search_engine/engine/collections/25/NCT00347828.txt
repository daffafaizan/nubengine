      targetting and reducing the number of bacteria on the surface of the eye. These bacteria
      serve as potential sources for post-operative infection. One commonly used method is the
      administration of antibiotic drops 3 times: 1 hour prior to surgery at intervals of 5
      minutes. Studies in the lab have shown that the preservative benzalkonium chloride 0.005%,
      part of the Zymar antibiotic drop preparation, allows the antibiotic to act more effectively
      than the antibiotic Vigamox, which does not include this preservative.

      Comparison: The effect of Zymar antibiotic eye drops on conjunctival cultures compared to the
      effect of Vigamox on conjunctival cultures as measured by conjunctival cultures taken prior
      to treatment and then one hour after administration of eye drops 3 times, at 5 minute
      intervals.
