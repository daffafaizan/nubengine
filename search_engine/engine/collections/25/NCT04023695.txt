      treats the underlying inflammatory pathology. Some surgeons add lidocaine with epinephrine as
      a local anesthetic with the injection. Lidocaine with epinephrine is associated with a
      burning sensation and may be the primary pain associated with the injection. We hypothesize
      that a corticosteroid injection without lidocaine with epinephrine will be less painful, and
      equally effective in treating trigger finger
