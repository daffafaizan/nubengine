      and fifth intercoastal infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinepherine combined with
      immediate post operative IV acetaminophen, followed by scheduled oral acetaminophen and
      supplemental IV and PO narcotics. This practice is beneficial since it controls most of the
      direct surgical site pain for at least 6 hours, however, after the local anesthetic
      dissipates, pain is usually managed with the use of opioids combined with scheduled oral
      acetaminophen.

      Opioids are the most commonly used medications to control pain early after surgery because of
      their high potency. However, their undesirable effects and risk of dependence become
      limitations.

      The Investigators believe Liposomal Bupivacaine would be beneficial in this population due to
      its quick onset of action and prolonged half-life associated with liposomal formulation
      ranging from 23.8 to 34.1 hours. The primary endpoint will be a 20% reduction in opioids use.
