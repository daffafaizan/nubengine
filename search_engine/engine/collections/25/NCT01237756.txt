      for example the marker method, the mainstem method or the formula method. However, to date,
      auscultation of the left and right lung is the standard of care and the only ubiquitary
      available method with an error rate of up to 12%. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a
      new non-invasive method for evaluation of left and right lung ventilation. In this study the
      investigators investigate the potential role of EIT for proper placement of pediatric
      endotracheal tubes. For this purpose, pediatric patients are routinely intubated for cardiac
      catheterization using the mainstem method or 3xETT size method. Placement of the ETT is then
      verified by intraoperative fluoroscopy and lung ventilation is verified by EIT.
