    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of the effects of EPA
      and DHA on inflammation and lipid metabolism in 24 men and women with metabolic syndrome. The
      study will characterize the effects of EPA alone and DHA alone, relative to each other and to
      placebo, on plasma biomarkers of inflammation, inflammatory cell activation and gene
      expression, and plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.
