      with better clinical outcomes, but the safety of such interventions are not fully understood.

      A prospective observational study of patients admitted at surgical ICU, aged > 18 years old,
      undergoing cardiac surgery was conducted to estimate the incidence of adverse events during
      physiotherapy interventions in those patients and to identify predictors of adverse events.

      Physiotherapy interventions were observed, performed by physiotherapists outside of the
      protocol. The occurrence of adverse events or physiological abnormality were recorded,
      classifying them according to the symptomatic consequences for the patient, from grade 1
      ("near miss", additional intervention not required) to grade 5 (death). The investigators
      collected clinical characteristics of patients, such as sequential organ failure assessment
      (SOFA) score, comorbidities, sedation leve and pain. Participants were followed up to
      hospital discharge.
