      Your immune system helps guard your body from germs, viruses, and other threats. Although
      dendritic cells are very strong, the number of them in the body is not high enough to cause a
      powerful immune response; therefore, more DC are made in a laboratory with cells collected
      from an individual's blood.

      In this study, we will make a vaccine that we hope will educate immune cells to target the
      pp65 antigen, a type of immune marker in GBM, thus resulting in what we call the pp65 DC
      vaccine. Use of a vaccine that activates your immune system is a type of immunotherapy. It is
      hoped that by giving the pp65 DC vaccine as a shot under the skin, the immune system will be
      activated to attack tumor cells in the brain while leaving normal cells alone.

      To see if the pp65 DC vaccine is effective for the treatment of GBM, subjects will be
      assigned to different treatment groups. Two groups of subjects will receive the pp65 DC
      vaccine and one group will receive a placebo.
