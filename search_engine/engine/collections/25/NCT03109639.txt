      wall and peri-gastrointestinal masses. A major strength is that it can be used to guide fine
      needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of any lesion in the wall or within 5cm from the GI tract.
      However, EUS-FNA has a major drawback- it rarely able to provide tissue blocks. Thus multiple
      passes, each of them time consuming, are necessary to obtain adequate cellular samples for
      cytological analysis. A radically new design of FNA needle (AcquireTM) has recently become
      available. The needle has an additional cutting edge surface, which allows better tissue
      access and acquires intact large core samples. The flexibility of the needle permits its use
      in tortuous anatomy, thereby making it an ideal needle for FNA. The new AcquireTM fine needle
      biopsy device (FNB) provides core tissue (>90%) for histology. This ability of the needle
      will enable us to obtain core tissue in fewer passes and make a precise diagnosis. However,
      at present there is no prospective randomized study to validate this finding.

      The investigators hypothesize that the unique cutting system of Acquire TM fine needle biopsy
      (FNB) device will improve the specimen adequacy of solid intestinal and extra-intestinal
      lesions by providing a good core tissue for analysis.
