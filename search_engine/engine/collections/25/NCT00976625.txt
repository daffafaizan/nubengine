      Patients with severe aortic regurgitation show eccentric LV hypertrophy and structural
      changes of the myocardium. Reversibility of functional and structural changes after
      successful valve replacement may be limited. Persistent diastolic dysfunction has been
      observed in the present study late after aortic valve replacement. This finding has been
      explained by incomplete regression of the extra-cellular matrix 7 years after valve
      replacement. Interstitial fibrosis remains unchanged compared to the preoperative situation
      but was increased early after operation due to the reduction in LV muscle mass. Regression of
      LV hypertrophy was 40% after 2 and 55% after 7 years of valve replacement. Myocardial muscle
      fibers decreased slightly but remained hypertrophied even late after operation. Interstitital
      fibrosis was found to be positively correlated to myocardial stiffness and inversely to LV
      ejection fraction.

      Thus, persistent diastolic dysfunction with maintained systolic ejection performance can be
      observed late after successful valve replacement in patients with severe aortic
      regurgitation. Altered diastolic function has been associated with increased filling
      pressures during strenuous exercise with signs of dyspnea.

      Objective

      Evaluation of myocardial structure and function in patients with chronic volume overload
      before and after valve replacement(LV-remodeling).

      Methods

      Pressure-volume measurements and myocardial biopsy samples for assessing myocardial function
      and structure.
