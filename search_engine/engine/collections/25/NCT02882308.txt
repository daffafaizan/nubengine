    
      OPHELIA is a window-of-opportunity phase II study randomized between combination with
      durvalumab and olaparib, cisplatin and olaparib, monotherapy with olaparib or no treatment,
      before starting standard treatment.

      Although patients will be randomized between the 4 arms, no formal comparison between the 4
      arms will be performed.Patients allocated to the olaparib monotherapy arm will serve as a
      proof-of-concept to interpret the mechanism of action of olaparib. Patients allocated in the
      "no treatment" group will be used as control.

      The primary endpoint will be the change in the tumour Ki-67 before and after treatment with
      the combination of olaparib + durvalumab or olaparib + cisplatin or olaparib monotherapy.
      Secondary endpoints will be early tumour response by RECIST criteria, pathologic complete
      response rate, tolerability to treatment and surgical complications rate, and optionally,
      metabolic response assessed by FDG-PET/CT scan. Translational correlates will be tested in
      tumour tissue, plasma and germline DNA.

      All the endpoints will be analyzed by an "as treated analysis" since the trial does not
      include a formal comparison of the treatment arms.

      Administration of olaparib monotherapy has been associated with reports of the following
      laboratory findings and/or clinical diagnoses, generally of mild or moderate severity (CTCAE
      Grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation.
