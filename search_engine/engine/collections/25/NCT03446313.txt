      preventing secondary cardiac events in patients with ischemic heart disease. Our central
      hypothesis is that monitoring and promotion of health-related behaviors by increasing
      patient-provider communication through a mobile device after discharge from cardiac rehab
      increased adherence to a heart healthy prescription over time. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to use a mobile app or serve as the control group. All participants will have an
      activity tracker to track their activity for two months.
