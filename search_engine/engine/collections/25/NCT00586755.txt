      Intravenously over 1 hour every 12 hours for 8 total doses) and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2/d
      intravenously [IV] over 30 minutes daily on days 1, 2, and 3). This will be combined with
      Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody) for 6-8 weeks. If, after this one cycle, subjects have not
      had progression of disease as noted on physical exam or radiographic scans, they will proceed
      to stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide. This will be immediately followed by high
      dose therapy with stem cell support. Following count recovery, rituximab will be used for 8
      total doses as consolidation therapy. Involved field irradiation may be given post-transplant
      to those with localized bulky disease as well. Day -6: Carmustine (BCNU): 15 mg/kg (or 550
      mg/m2) IV over 2 hrs. Day -4: Etoposide Day -2: Cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg in 1 liter D5W
      over 2 hours.
