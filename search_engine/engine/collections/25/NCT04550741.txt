           The solution will be provided during the fourth and final week of RR's stay during which
           patients will be trained to use all of the solution's features. Patients will carry out
           the entire post-rehabilitation using the remote rehabilitation solution and will benefit
           from medical assessments by teleconsultation at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months as well as

        -  Control group of 100 patients following usual standard chronic care. Patients will
           receive during the last week of stay in the center, the usual advice to continue
           physical activity and nutritional advice at home. The evaluations at 3, 6 and 12 months
           will be done by electronic filling of auto-questionnaires followed by a telephone
           quality control if necessary. A final evaluation at 12 months, by videoconference, will
           be carried out at the patient's home.
