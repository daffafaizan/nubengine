      participants recruited from previously identified University of Pennsylvania obstetrics and
      gynecological (OB/GYN) clinics. A total of 100 pregnant subjects will be recruited
      consecutively and evaluated in the first and third trimester of their pregnancy as well as
      within a month after delivery.

      The entire project will take one year.
