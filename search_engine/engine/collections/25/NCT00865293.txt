      the causes of this impairment is expiratory flow limitation, which is related to decreased
      lung volume. As a result, obesity can cause an asthma-like symptoms. Therefore, some patients
      with obesity are misdiagnosed as asthma-patients, and treated with asthma medication. The
      effects of bronchodilators on the mechanical airway obstruction in obese subjects have not
      been well established.

      Posture also has effect on lung volumes: they are decreased in supine position. Therefore,
      the interaction of obesity and supine posture might result in a larger decrease in lung
      volumes, and thereby a more increased airflow limitation. It has been suggested that both
      obesity and supine posture result in an obstruction of peripheral airways. Such an
      obstruction can be measured by spirometry, using the ratio of forced expiratory flow between
      25 and 75% and vital capacity. This measure is highly variable, however.

      The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a non-invasive method to measure the resistance and
      reactant of the respiratory system. Particularly the reactance has been shown useful in the
      measurement of airflow limitations.

      The investigators hypothesize that obesity causes a posture dependent end- expiratory airflow
      limitation due to a mechanical compression of lung tissue, resulting in increased resistance
      and reactance in the airways. Therefore, the investigators expect no protective effect of
      bronchodilation by salbutamol. The investigators expect that reactance measured by FOT
      detects differences in airflow limitation and correlates with airflow limitation as measured
      by spirometry.
