      transduced ex vivo with CD68-ET3 lentiviral vector and subsequently, following a conditioning
      regimen of busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin, the transduced cells will be infused to
      patients. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up
      to 15 years.
