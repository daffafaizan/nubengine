    
      This is a single-center registry of consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke,
      intracerebral hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attack (TIA) who are emergently managed in
      the stroke care unit in the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, a flagship stroke
      center in Japan.

      Neurological emergencies other than stroke/TIA and subclinical cerebrobvascular inpatients
      are also enrolled.

      Data are collected and analyzed to determine change in underlying characteristics, stroke
      features and severity, process for diagnosis and acute treatment, and long-term outcomes of
      stroke/TIA patients over the years.

      The National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center was founded in 1977 in Suita, Osaka, in order
      to provide the public with the most advanced treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases and to conduct the highest level of basic as well as applied research on the
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems.
