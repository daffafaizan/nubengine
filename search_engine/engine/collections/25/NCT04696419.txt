    
      Using a within-subjects design, we will compare four standardised and controlled test
      situations with different levels of dog contact:

      1) visual (V), 2) tactile and visual (TV), 3) tactile, visual, interaction (TVI), and
      4)control (C).

      The participants will be subjected to all four test situations on the same day, and will be
      randomly allocated to test order.

      On the test day, we collect background information and baseline measures for the participants
      (baseline period, duration: 50 minutes), whereafter they rest for 30 minutes
      (pre-intervention rest period). After this the participants are subjected to the four test
      situations (10 minutes each) that are followed by rest intervals (30 minutes each).

      The participants' interaction with the dog during the 10-minute test situations are
      standardised according to the specific contact treatment. Most physiological and all
      behavioural measures are recorded continuously throughout each test in order for us to link
      the "dosage" of dog (the different levels of contact) with the psychological responses and
      some physiological measures obtained before an after each test situation.

      Below is shown the exact time schedule of the test day, that we refer to when describing the
      outcome measures. The baseline period (30 minutes) is not included in the total test period
      (total duration= 190 minutes), that consist of a pre-intervention and intervention period.

        -  Baseline period (50 minutes - not part of total test period)

        -  Pre-intervention period (start, t=0 minutes; end t= 30 minutes)

        -  Test situation 1 (start, t=30 minutes; end, t=40 minutes)

        -  Rest period 1 (start, t=40 minutes, end, t= 70 minutes)

        -  Test situation 2 (start, t=70 minutes; end, t=80 minutes)

        -  Rest period 2 (start, t=80 minutes, end, t= 110 minutes)

        -  Test situation 3 (start, t=110 minutes; end, t=120 minutes)

        -  Rest period 3 (start, t=120 minutes, end, t= 150 minutes)

        -  Test situation 4 (start, t=150 minutes; end, t=160 minutes)

        -  Rest period 4 (start, t=160 minutes, end, t= 190 minutes)
