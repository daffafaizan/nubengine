    
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind study. the investigators
      included in the study the patients:

      whose age is greater than or equal to 18 years; ASA class 1 or 2, proposed for elective
      visceral, orthopedic, oncology, ophthalmologic, urologic surgery under general anesthesia
      with orothracheal intubation, expected duration ≤ 120 min.

      the non-inclusion criteria are known allergy to ketamine or maguisuim sulphate, ASA 3 and
      more, cervical surgery; rapid sequence induction, difficult intubation planned or history of
      difficult intubation, malformation of the O.R.L sphere; upper respiratory tract infections.
      the need for multiple laryngoscopies for orotracheal intubation (≥ 2 attempts); the need for
      a postoperative nasogastric tube.

      randomization is performed upon entering the operating room. The gargle allocation scheme,
      Ketamine Group or Magnesium Sulfate Group was randomly generated using a randomization table
      with an allocation ratio of 1: 1.

      Postoperative follow-up was carried out in the post-intervention monitoring room then in
      hospitalization within the various referring services (general surgery, orthopedics, O.R.L
      and ophthalmology).

      On the day of the procedure, the doctor responsible for the study prepares the two types of
      solutions containing:

        -  One of magnesium sulfate (20mg / kg diluted in 30cc of 5% glucose serum);

        -  The other ketamine (50mg diluted in 30cc of 5% glucose serum). These two solutions were
           distributed over two groups of patients for use as a gargle, lasting at least 60 seconds
           for each patient in each group and 15 minutes before the surgery.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence and severity of POST at the twenty-fourth hour
      postoperatively The secondary outcomes are the incidence and severity of POST at 15 minutes
      and one hour postoperatively; The occurrence of cough, The presence of dysphonia and Patient
      satisfaction

      The severity of POST was scored on a three-point score from 0 to 2 (0 = No pain; 1 =
      Oropharyngeal pain on speaking; 2 = Spontaneous oropharyngeal pain)
