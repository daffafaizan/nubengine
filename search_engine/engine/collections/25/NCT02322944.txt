      reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI, and to evaluate their effectiveness via a
      hospital-level cluster randomized clinical trial, based on the nationally representative
      collaborative network of over 100 hospitals established in China PEACE retrospective study.
      The primary outcome measure is reperfusion rate among eligible patients with STEMI, and
      secondary ones include timeliness of primary PCI (D2B) and fibrinolytic therapy (D2N). the
      assessment is based on consecutively recruiting all eligible inpatients, as well as
      collecting relevant medical information via a case report form finished by local doctors and
      central medical record abstraction.

      During the first study period, the baseline performance of all 100 participating hospitals
      before the implementation of the intervention will be assessed.

      During the following period, 3-5 PCI-capable and 3-5 non-PCI capable hospitals that show the
      strong willingness and ability to collaborate will be selected as "process optimization
      group". Their clinical pathways and team building will be re-organized for the purpose of
      quality improvement, and develop individualized treatment strategies and process, including
      examining local hospitals' workflow to determine the key link affecting the rate of
      reperfusion therapy and its timeliness (such as pre-paid policy for fibrinolytic or PPCI,
      thrombolytic drug preparation, cardiac catheterization laboratory preparation, transferring
      from the ER to the Cath lab, interventional medical team gathering, etc.). Also, QI
      strategies and tools developed in the current study will be provided to these hospital,
      including training in standardized treatment pattern; building quality management team and
      determining improvement goals; periodical quality feedback report and regular quality
      meeting; tools like a wristband in order to remind all medical staff involved in the
      treatment process, workflow posters and cards, a CRF including a flowchart to inform the
      management steps, study website serving as the communication platform.

      Meanwhile, other participating hospitals will be divided into intervention and control groups
      in a 1:1 ratio using minimization allocation, in which the intervention group will take the
      QI strategies and tools developed in the current study as mentioned above, while the control
      group will maintain the routine practice pattern. Then the outcome measures and other
      performance indicators will be compared among different groups (process optimization,
      intervention and control).
