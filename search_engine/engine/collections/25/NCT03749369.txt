    
      Sixty-six subjects with untreated, moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis will be selected
      by convenience sampling. The participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups:

        1. Test group: SRP + SP gel

        2. Control group: SRP only

      Each participant will undergo treatment in the following steps:

        1. QUESTIONNAIRE:

           All participants will complete a structured baseline questionnaire provided by one
           trained interviewer that will include the data regarding; (a) age; (2) gender; (3)
           education status; (4) occupation; (5) medical status

        2. INFORMED CONSENT:

           All eligible subjects will be thoroughly informed of the nature, potential risks and
           benefits of their participation in the study.

        3. ASSESSMENT OF PARAMETERS:

             1. CLINICAL PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS Full-mouth plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing
                (BOP), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) will be recorded on
                baseline, 6th week and 12th week for all the patients that pass the inclusion
                criteria.

             2. RADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS The depth of bony defects (BD) will be evaluated at baseline,
                6 and 12 weeks using image analysis software (Scion Image Analyzer, Scion,
                Frederick, MD, USA).

             3. ANALYSIS OF PLAQUE MICROORGANISM Subgingival plaque will be collected at baseline
                and 12 weeks from the deepest PD (>4mm) of each patient.

        4. SCALING AND ROOT PLANING After baseline recordings, thorough SRP will be performed by a
           single clinician. The SRP procedure will be carried out in two sittings, comprising of
           ultrasonic scaling in the first, and manual instrumentation and root debridement in the
           second.

        5. APPLICATION OF SP GEL In the test group, areas with PPD greater than 4 mm will be marked
           on the periodontal chart. In these areas SP gel will be placed following root planing
           procedure.
