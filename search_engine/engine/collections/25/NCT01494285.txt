      parallel group, dose range finding clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of ARK-E021 foam for treatment of acne vulgaris.

      It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the listed Medical Centers as well as
      out-patient clinics at the community.

      Approximately 144 male and female subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be
      enrolled in this study. Following satisfaction of the entry criteria and screening
      procedures, subjects will be randomized to either 5% or 10% topical foam (ARK-E021) or
      placebo foam. Subjects will apply the study medication once daily on the face at bedtime for
      12 weeks followed by a post-treatment follow up visit 4 weeks after end of treatment. The
      first dose will be applied in the presence of the study investigator or his assignee.
      Subsequent applications will be made by the patient.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration. Efficacy will be assessed by facial
      lesion counts and by the investigator global evaluation of acne severity at baseline and at
      weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 16.
