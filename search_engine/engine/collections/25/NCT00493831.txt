      cigarettes/day. Eligibility criteria include male and female cigarette smokers â‰¥19 years of
      age, who are able to give informed consent, able to exhale into Eco Screen instrument for

      with normal lung function who meet criteria for diagnosis of chronic bronchitis will be
      excluded. Subjects with stable medical conditions, excluding inflammatory lung disease, will
      be permitted to participate, providing anti-inflammatory therapies are not used regularly and
