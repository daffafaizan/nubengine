      included. All patients were evaluated before the randomization and after 24 weeks from
      enrollment. The investigators performed a detailed anamnesis and complete physical
      examination, Doppler echocardiography, Stress Testing, 6-minute walk test, heart rate
      variability analysis, and quality of life test. Patients were randomized either to a training
      group: performing a supervised training program, or a control group receiving usual care. All
      patients received an optimal pharmacologic treatment including diuretics, angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-adrenergic blocking
      agents. All patients included in the training group attended a supervised program 3-days/week
      during 24 weeks (68-74 sessions). Physical aerobic training appears to impart beneficial
      changes in autonomic control of patients with chronic heart failure through both
      parasympathetic and sympathetic control of hear rate. These effects produce changes in
      several Heart Rate Variability indices as HF and rMSSD related with parasympathetic tone.
