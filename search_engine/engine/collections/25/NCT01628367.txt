    
      Aim: The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate the effect of a non-resorbable
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane on immediate implant placement in the esthetic zone.

      Material and Methods: Systemically healthy subjects presenting with a hopeless tooth in the
      maxillary premolar or anterior region will be recruited in the study. Following a minimally
      traumatic tooth extraction, subjects will be randomly distributed into one of two treatment
      groups, a Membrane (Test) or a No Membrane (Control) group. Both groups will receive
      immediate placement of an implant along with placement of a bone graft material to fill the
      spaces around the implant. Sites in the test group will receive a non-resorbable PTFE
      membrane over the socket, whereas those in the control group will receive a collagen dressing
      over the socket. At sites in the test group, the membrane will be removed at 4 weeks. A
      second stage surgery and placement of a provisional restoration will be carried out 4 months
      after implant placement. Final restorations will be placed 3 months after placement of the
      provisional restoration. Clinical and radiographic measurements will be performed at
      baseline, implant placement, placement of provisional and final restorations and at the
      5-month recall visit.
