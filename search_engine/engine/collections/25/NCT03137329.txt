      effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy compared to an intensive lifestyle intervention of a high
      protein low carbohydrate, hypocaloric weight loss diet combined with exercise training among
      older adults aged 60-75. For pragmatic and ethical reasons, the investigators are employing a
      nonrandomized design. The investigators will recruit 10 older patients undergoing sleeve
      gastrectomy and match, recruit, and enroll 1-2 subjects to the lifestyle intervention for
      each surgical subject. The investigators will assess physical function, weight loss, body
      composition, bone density, QOL and adverse events/health utilization at baseline and 6 and 12
      months.
