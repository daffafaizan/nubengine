      Type 1 diabetes. Insulin resistance may also play an important role in the pathophysiology of
      type 1 diabetes mellitus. Once diabetes has emerged chronically elevated glucose levels
      further induce insulin resistance (glucose toxicity).

      Inflammation is an important link between obesity and insulin resistance. The mechanism of
      hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance is not clear, but evidently must be related to high
      glucose levels. There are indications that chronic hyperglycemia can induce inflammation, for
      example hyperglycemia induces IL-1β release, and recent studies have shown an interaction
      with thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), at the level of the beta-cell but also, as
      found by our own group, at the level of the adipose tissue

      All together, these findings suggest that blocking IL-1β-receptor activation by the
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, may reverse insulin resistance associated both
      with obesity and/or chronic hyperglycemia. When applied in (hyperglycemic) subjects with type
      2 diabetes, blocking IL-1β should diminish the effects of glucose toxicity both at the level
      of beta-cell function as at the level of insulin sensitivity. When applied in (hyperglycemic)
      subjects with type 1 diabetes, the effects of glucose toxicity at the level of insulin
      sensitivity should decrease.

      In order to be able to study an isolated effect of IL-1β blockade on insulin sensitivity,
      this study will test this hypothesis in subjects with type 1 diabetes and hence provide a
      proof of principle in vivo in humans for a proposed link between hyperglycemia, inflammation
      and insulin resistance.
