      to corticosteroids. Patients with steroid-refractory a GvHD (SR-a GVHD) have a low 1-year
      survival rate. In this study, the investigators aim to identify and validate novel targetable
      kinases in SR-a GvHD patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by using a
      kinase-specific proteomic approach, and thereafter to investigate the role of the identified
      kinases in different immune cell subtypes by analyzing biopsies taken from SR- a GvHD
      patients.
