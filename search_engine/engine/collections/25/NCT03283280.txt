      composite restorations become the golden standard for restoring intracoronal cavities. While
      for the extracoronal cavities, the indirect resin composite onlays tend to replace metallic
      restorations in most situations being more esthetic and conservative with lower cost (Rocca &
      Krejci, 2007).

      Indirect resin composite onlays usually are lab processed in two appointments but it can be
      made in one appointment through CAD/CAM technology or by flexible model technique (semidirect
      technique).

      These restorations offer more control on the proximal contacts and the anatomic form over the
      direct approach. Polymerization shrinkage occurs outside the patient mouth so the stresses
      are decreased and become limited to the width of the luting space. Annual failure rate (AFR)
      of indirect posterior resin composite restorations is up to 10% (Manhart et al, 2004).

      One of the advancement in resin composite technology is the evolution of short fiber
      reinforced resin composite (SFRC) material that allows making a direct onlay restoration
      possible thus offers less procedural steps and saves more time (Garoushi et al, 2013).

      This material is made to be used as a dentine substitute in the high stress-bearing areas. It
      is covered by a conventional resin composite filling to act as the enamel replacement this
      combination gives us a kind of biomimetic restoration.
