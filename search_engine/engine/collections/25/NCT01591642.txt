      artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent fatal heart disease. Coronary artery bypass graft
      surgery (CABG) is now one of the most common procedures to treat CAD. It was reported that
      CABG intervention could prolong the life. However, outcomes of CABG have historically been
      measured in terms of mortality and recurrence of symptoms or complications.There is ample
      evidence to demonstrate the effect and benefit of cardiac rehabilitation in QOL and function
      activity in patients post CABG. However, the participation rate of postoperative cardiac
      rehabilitation is low, especially in women.Little research has been done to examine the
      physical activity, physical performance, and QOL in this population outside the cardiac
      rehabilitation setting.
