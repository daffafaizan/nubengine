      of cancer-related deaths in the world. Because HCC is insidious and early diagnosis is
      difficult, most patients have locally advanced or distant metastasis at the time of
      diagnosis. So they are not suitable candidates for curative treatments by resection or
      transplantation. Currently, There are only not more than five drugs to be selected for
      advanced HCC, although it prolongs the survival for less than 3 months. Recently,
      metabolomics studies of HCC have shown that typical Warburg effect was observed in hepatoma
      carcinoma cells. Arginine hydrochloride is a new anticancer drug in the treatment of HCC,
      which is mainly aimed at the pathway of energy metabolism.acetazolamide may play an
      anti-tumor role by inhibiting the reverse TCA cycle. The investigators have been proceeding
      this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acetazolamide combined with levamisole in
      the treatment of advanced HCC.
