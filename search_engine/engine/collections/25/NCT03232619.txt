      an artificial antigen binding receptor and also intercellular co-stimulating molecules into T
      cells. This kind of engineered T cells gains the ability to recognize antigen specific tumor
      cells and initiate the killing process in a HLA-independent way. CD19 is the specific
      cellular marker of B lineage acute leukemia (B-ALL), thus CD19-CART will be efficient in
      treating B lineage ALL. The investigators have constructed two kinds of CD19-CART. One is
      equipped with a murine CD19 scFv (single-chain variable fragmentt), while the other with a
      humanized scFv. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of both murine and
      humanized CD19-CART in treating refractory or recurrent ALL.
