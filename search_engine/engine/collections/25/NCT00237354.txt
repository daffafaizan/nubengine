    
      This is a single center, open label, ascending dose study. Subjects with at least one
      recurrent, histologically confirmed measurable soft tissue breast carcinoma who are
      candidates for lumpectomy (removal of the lesion from the site of recurrence in the breast or
      at another site) or mastectomy will receive a single intralesional injection of PV-10 into a
      single target lesion to uniformly infiltrate the target lesion and up to a 0.5 cm margin at a
      dose of up to 1.0 mL/cc lesion volume. Systemic and locoregional adverse events will be
      monitored over the study interval. Subject accrual and PV-10 administration will be stopped
      if more than 1 subject has a treatment related Grade 3 non-hematological or Grade 4
      hematological toxicity within a period of two weeks after PV-10 administration.
