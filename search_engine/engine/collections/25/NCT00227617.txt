      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) with
           bevacizumab in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

        -  Determine the best overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the biochemical marker response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (carcinoid vs islet cell vs poorly differentiated neuroendocrine).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1
      and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours beginning on day 1. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 26
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-102 patients (13-34 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
