      Seventy-eight clinical rules, programmed into the ePartogram, are based on global guidelines
      in the WHO manual "Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives
      and doctors" and the expert opinion of Jhpiego physicians and nurse-midwives. The rules
      underwent a validation process by 65 expert skilled birth attendants (SBAs) (working in
      maternity wards of health facilities) from a variety of geographic and clinical settings
      affiliated with Jhpiego. In the ePartogram application ("app") that is put on an Android
      tablet computer, the clinical rules trigger "reminders" to SBAs to take a routine clinical
      measurement, such as fetal heart rate (every 30 minutes) or maternal temperature (every 2
      hours). The rules also trigger "low-level" alarms indicating a measurement that falls in the
      abnormal range that could be cause for concern (i.e. meconium-stained liquor), and
      "high-level" alarms that could indicate need for immediate action (i.e. maternal systolic
      blood pressure â‰¥160 mm Hg).

      Litwin et al. reported on the feasibility and acceptability of use of an electronic partogram
      in Zanzibar and concluded that health workers felt the ePartogram improved timeliness of care
      and supported decision making. Health workers quickly became competent and confident in using
      the tablet device and ePartogram application. This study in Kenya has an objective to
      evaluate whether providers' use of the ePartogram improves labor outcomes and labor
      management in health facilities. The study design is a quasi-experimental design evaluation
      comparing data collected at 6 intervention sites and 6 comparison sites with similar facility
      characteristics and in two regions of Kenya.
