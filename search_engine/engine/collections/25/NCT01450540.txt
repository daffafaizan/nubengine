      remains the largest single obstacle to the successful resolution of sleep-disordered
      breathing in OSA patients. It has been estimated that up to 50% of patients who have been
      prescribed CPAP for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) are not using the treatment one year later.
      A myriad of possible causes for low compliance rates have been proposed and examined in
      previous studies. These include race, gender, education level, income, bed-partner's sleep
      quality, mask discomfort, continuity of care, nasal irritation, discomfort due to elevated
      expiratory pressure, and level of daytime sleepiness.

      Therefore, many investigators have proposed new methods and approaches to help deal with
      these problems. Interventions have ranged from people-centric approaches using intensive CPAP
      education and follow-up programs, to device modifications using features such as a ramp,
      C-FLEXÂ®, BiLevel therapy, and heated humidification.

      In this study. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Automated
      Graduated CPAP (AGPAP), also know as EZ-start acclimation period, and its impact on short
      term adherence
