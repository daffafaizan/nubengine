      surgically under anesthesia. Anesthesia in these types of old patients carries more risk than
      the adult population, since these type of patients have a lot of chronic diseases which
      affect their general health.

      In this study the investigators will review patient's records that underwent surgery for hip
      trauma under anesthesia between the years 2010 to 2015, and to see if type of anesthesia
      affects patient's outcome and the rate of postoperative complications like Deep Venous
      Thrombosis, Pulmonary complications, myocardial Infarction and others.
