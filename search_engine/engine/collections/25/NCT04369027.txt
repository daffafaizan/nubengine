      mechanical ventilation with spontaneous cycles, for whom the physician in charge decided to
      test preload responsiveness were included. We collected demographic and clinical information,
      the use of mechanical ventilation and its parameters, the use of vasopressors and their
      dosage and blood lactate.

      Firstly, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed to measure the velocity time
      integral (VTI) of the left ventricular outflow tract .

      A PLR maneuvre is performed with TTE probe in place and a new assessement of VTI is measured,
      in addition to the PPV and other hemodynamic parmeters (Diastolic, mean and systolic arterial
      pressure, heart rate, CVP). Delta VTI is the difference between VTI during PLR and VTI at
      baseline divided by VTI at baseline.

      Patients were considered as preload responsive when delta VTI was â‰¥10%. Secondly, a TVC was
      performed by increasing the TV by 2mL/kg predicted body weight from its baseline value . PPV
      was recorded before and after the TVC in addition to the other hemodynamic parmeters listed
      above. Further more, respiratory parameters are collected: ventilator setting, plateau
      pressure, upper airway pressure, before and during the TVC.
