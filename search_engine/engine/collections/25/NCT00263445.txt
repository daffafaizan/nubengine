      retrospective chart review and collection of preexisting data. We analyzed charts of patients
      who underwent non-weight-based GH dose adjustments preceded and followed by a serum IGF-I
      level. Data collected included patient's age, gender, height, weight, linear height velocity,
      pubertal status, GH dose, IGF-I levels, disease condition (i.e., growth hormone deficiency,
      idiopathic short stature, small-for-gestational age) and recording of any adverse effects.
      Based on this data collected, we performed statistical analysis of the relationship between
      GH dose change and change in IGF-I level achieved, and have found that in prepubertal
      children, there is a significant relationship between the GH dose change and change in
      corresponding IGF-I level. We have subsequently constructed a mathematical prediction model
      that allows us to determine the GH dose change necessary to achieve a desired IGF-I level,
      and in this second phase of our study, we plan to apply this mathematical prediction model
      prospectively for guiding GH dose adjustments in prepubertal children being treated with GH
      therapy.

      Children being treated with GH are typically followed in the outpatient Endocrinology clinic
      every 3-4 months, and our practitioners have routinely been obtaining serum IGF-I levels (via
      venipuncture in the outpatient laboratory) for monitoring purposes. Validation of our GH dose
      change/IGF-I change prediction model will require assessment of sequential serum IGF-I level
      measurements immediately preceding a GH dose change, and again within 1-4 months following
      the GH dose change. We plan to continue our retrospective and ongoing analysis of patients
      who have paired values of GH dose adjustments preceded and followed by a serum IGF-I level,
      in order that we may continue to fine-tune our prediction model for optimizing GH dose
      adjustments.
