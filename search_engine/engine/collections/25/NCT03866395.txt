      symptoms but its role in patients without left-ventricular systolic dysfunction is still
      unclear. The aim was to quantify the effects of ivabradine in terms of MVO2 indicators and
      diastolic function.

      METHODS. 28 consecutive patients with residual angina after PCI were randomized to ivabradine
      5 mg twice/day(IG) or standard therapy(CG). All patients performed a stress echocardiography
      at the enrollment and after 30 days. Myocardial oxygen consumption was estimated from: double
      product(DP); triple product(TP) integrating DP with ejection-time(ET). Diastolic function was
      evaluated determining E and A waves, E' measurements and E/E' ratio both at rest and at the
      peak of exercise.
