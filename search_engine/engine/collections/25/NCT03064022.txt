      To improve health professionals understanding of preterm infant growth patterns, and to
      determine if growth patterns (rapid early growth in the first 2 weeks of life, weight less
      than the 10th percentile at the time of discharge) predict risks of adverse metabolic
      outcomes (measured as overweight at age 3) once the following variables are controlled for:
      size at birth (z-score), neonatal morbidities, social determinants of health, and nutritional
      adequacy in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      To assess diagnostic accuracy of 36-week anthropometric weight, length and head circumference
      <10th and <3rd percentiles to predict preterm infant cognitive impairment.
