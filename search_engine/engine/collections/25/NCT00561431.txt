      hemodialysis(IHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has emerged as an alternative
      form of renal replacement therapy in the critical care setting due to its advantages of slow
      continuous fluid removal, steady acid-base correction, and hemodynamic stability.

      There are no standard protocols for initiating or administering CRRT, and practice patterns
      vary widely among institutions, with less than 25% of patients with ARF in the ICU receiving
      this therapy in the United States.

      Various CRRT modalities are available that use diffusion, convection, or a combination of
      both to obtain adequate solute clearance. However, there is no consensus as to the optimal
      dialysis modality, adequate dialysis dose, or optimal clearance modality (convection vs.
      diffusion). Clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal method of administering CRRT,
      with respect to modality, dose of dialysis, and time of initiation of therapy.

      Although some studies suggest that a higher dose of dialysis improves survival, there have
      been no prospective randomized studies comparing the effectiveness of diffusion and
      convection, combined together, for solute clearance.
