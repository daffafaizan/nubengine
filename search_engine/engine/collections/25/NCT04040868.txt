      surgery, to achieve the safety and clinical requirements of internal fixation. Robot-assisted
      technology has become an effective means to improve the accuracy of implants with higher
      accuracy, free from fatigue and equivalent repetitive operation. The investigators present
      the design of a randomized trial to compare the accuracy and safety of screw insertion using
      the robot-assisted technique versus the conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine
      surgery at multicenter.

      500 participants per group (1000 participants in total) are being recruited after diagnosis
      and before treatment through multi-hospital system and randomised to 1) robot-assisted
      technique or 2) conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine surgery. Outcomes are
      being measured pre-operatively, during- surgery and at 3, 6, 12 months post-surgery. The
      accuracy and safety of screw insertion are measured by deviation of guide pin placement
      position, deviation of screw placement position, and intraoperative or postoperative
      complications. Secondary outcome parameters such as radiation exposure, postoperative
      recovery, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and economic appraisal were also
      evaluated and compared between treatment groups.

      The study is addressing key questions of importance by evaluating the TiRobot-assisted
      technique versus the conventional fluoroscopy-assisted technique in spine surgery at
      multicenter. Outputs include evidence to facilitate more effective and safe decision making
      about surgical treatment for spine.
