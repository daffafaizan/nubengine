      Besides the debate on low fat or low carbohydrate diets, focusing on some food groups
      including fruits, vegetables and low fat dairies in the diet may be helpful for weight
      maintenance. However, energy intake is the key factor of weight maintenance. Energy intake
      will decrease by reducing energy density (ED) of a diet without producing short-term calorie
      restriction or feeling hunger. There are several studies which showed the beneficial effects
      of low energy density diets on weight reduction. However, few studies discuses regarding the
      effects of such diets on weight maintenance.
