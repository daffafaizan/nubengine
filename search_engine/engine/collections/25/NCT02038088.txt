      that a certain degree of immunosuppression occured after general anesthesia. In this study we
      detect the cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL) count and activity, interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and HBV-DNA
      content form the HBV patient who will accept general anesthesia. Our purpose is to evaluate
      the influence of general anesthesia immunosuppressive on HBV replication. If the results show
      that HBV-DNA quantity increases, so the patients might be given anti-HBV drugs or immune
      enhancer; otherwise it is indicated the general anesthesia immunosuppressive don't influence
      HBV replication.
