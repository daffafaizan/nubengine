      Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in the
      Cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene. Carriers of this mutation have a 56-70% lifetime risk of developing
      gastric adenocarcinoma. Current international guidelines recommend endoscopic screening of
      CDH1 mutation carriers that consists of systematic biopsies of an otherwise normal appearing
      stomach. However, this approach lacks sufficient sensitivity for detecting intramucosal foci
      of signet ring cells (SRC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC syndrome. The goal of the current
      study is to utilize confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) for screening the gastric mucosa in
      this high-risk population.

      Objective:

      Determine if confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) will afford greater sensitivity for
      detection of signet ring cells (SRC) foci in CDH1 germline mutation carriers.

      Eligibility:

      CDH1 germline mutation carriers, or those who meet clinical criteria for HDGC testing but
      have tested negative for a CDH1 gene mutation or those who have other germline mutations
      suspected to be, or reported to be, associated with HDGC (e.g. Catenin Alpha 1 (CTNNA1).

      Design:

      Phase II, single-institution study of CEM for detection of intramucosal SRC foci compared to
      current systematic gastric mapping procedure.
