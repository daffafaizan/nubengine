      study group, where the physician will use the electromagnetic tracking system along with "US"
      ultrasound or "CT" computed tomography to complete the procedure and a control group, where
      the electromagnetic tracking system will be used, but the physician will be blinded to it and
      use only the typical, standard, conventional protocol, using US or CT, to complete the
      procedure. The expected completion time for enrollment is 12 months, but will depend on the
      ability of each Clinic to enroll patients.

      Data and observations will be collected at a total of 2 scheduled appointments (screening and
      1 study visit) or based on the current hospital workflow, which may combine these into one
      patient encounter.
