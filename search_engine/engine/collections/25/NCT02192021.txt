      of patients diagnosed with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma utilizing a dissolvable microneedle
      array (MNA) delivery device that is used to directly and specifically deliver a drug to the
      tumor microenvironment for skin cancer therapy. We will utilize MNAs to deliver a
      well-characterized, potent chemotherapeutic agent (doxorubicin) to kill topically accessible,
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells. In addition to directly killing cancer cells, doxorubicin is
      known to induce an immunologic cell death with the potential to simultaneously convert a
      cutaneous neoplasm into a highly potent patient specific immunogen capable of inducing
      innate, adaptive, and tumor specific effector and memory immune responses. Importantly,
      doxorubicin is currently in clinical use with a well-established safety profile. It is
      anticipated that use of the MNA-Doxorubicin (MNA-D) delivery system will enable direct and
      specific delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor, thereby avoiding any potential for systemic
      toxicity. The study will be conducted in two phases, with the first being a safety
      dose-finding phase and the second phase for efficacy and safety evaluation. The first phase
      is now completed.
