      eligibility criteria will enter 3 weeks of monitoring of usual brand smoking. Subjects will
      then be randomly assigned for a period of 6 weeks to one of two conditions: 1) ventilated
      cigarettes; or 2) unventilated cigarettes. Subjects in each condition will be unblinded to
      simulate real world conditions. Subjects are provided with a debit card (ClinCard) that has
      been loaded with the appropriate amount of money to cover self-purchased usual brand
      cigarette in baseline and the assigned study cigarettes during intervention. Weekly
      telehealth visits will be conducted during baseline and the 6 weeks on study cigarettes to
      collect study measures, followed by a one month follow-up.
