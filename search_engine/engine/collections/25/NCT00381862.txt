    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of nausea and vomiting control, of aprepitant,
           palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone, in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea
           and vomiting in patients receiving FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy for metastatic
           colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the percentage of patients with no emesis and no rescue therapy when treated with
           aprepitant, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone during repeated courses of
           FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the effects of aprepitant on nausea, appetite, taste changes (via visual analogue
           scale), nutritional intake, and mucositis in these patients.

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Beginning 1 hour prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on day 1, patients receive oral
      aprepitant on days 1-3, oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, and palonosetron hydrochloride IV on
      day 1.

      Nausea is assessed daily for up to 4 courses of chemotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
