      for acute myeloid leukemia. Patients at high risk for relapse may benefit from a novel,
      biologically rational therapeutic intervention to prevent this outcome. PF-04449913 is a
      small molecule inhibitor of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway that inhibits the protein Smoothened
      (SMO). Aberrant Hh signaling may contribute to the survival and expansion of the leukemia
      stem cell, and inhibiting the Hh pathway can eliminate these cells. Therefore, targeting Hh
      may be a logical intervention in the post-transplantation setting for those with high risk of
      relapse. The investigators propose a phase 2 study of PF-04449913 in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia who have received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and are at high
      risk of relapse.

      This is an open label, phase 2 study employing PF-04449913 in acute myeloid leukemia patients
      who received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk of relapse.
      Patients will receive consecutive 28-day cycles of PF-04449913 at 100 mg/day, beginning on
      post-transplantation day 80 +/- 10 days, after their routine post-transplant bone marrow
      biopsy. Treatment will continue for up to one year or until they experience toxicity or
      disease relapse. 50 patients will be required for a 90% power to detect a 20% difference in
      one-year relapse-free survival.
