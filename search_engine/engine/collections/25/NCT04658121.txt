    
      Design:

      Cross-sectional surveys of (1) nursing home and outpatient healthcare facilities, and (2) the
      general population in each selected research site community through time-location sampling

      Population:

        1. Adults residing in nursing homes or attending outpatient healthcare facilities in
           neighborhoods of selected research sites

        2. Adults and children (> 2 months of age) in neighborhoods of selected research sites

      Study Size:

      For each research site, 3,920 individuals will be enrolled from:

        1. nursing homes/assisted living facilities (n = 500) and outpatient healthcare facilities
           (n = 500), and

        2. community surveys distributed across four age strata (0-17, 18-39, 40-59, 60+ years) (n
           = 730 per stratum or 2920)

      Total sample size = 3,920 x approximately 20-25 clinical research sites

      Study Duration:

      Approximately one (1) year for overall project. Two (2) months for protocol development and
      institutional review board (IRB) approval, followed by:

        1. Facility-based surveys: 9 months (2 months for site preparation and initiation, 1 month
           for enrollment/sample collection, 4 months for shipping and laboratory testing, 2 months
           for close-out), concurrent with

        2. Time-location sampling (TLS) surveys: 12 months (2 months for site preparation and
           initiation, 2 months for enrollment/sample collection, 6 months for shipping and
           laboratory testing, 2 months for close-out)

      Study Location:

      Catchment areas surrounding US-based Clinical Research Sites (CRSs) of the: HIV Prevention
      Trials Network (HPTN), HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), Infectious Diseases Clinical
      Research Consortium (IDCRC), International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials
      Group (IMPAACT), and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); to be specified in the Site
      Announcement Memo

      Study Methods:

      Blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and characterization of the serologic
      response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; nasal mid-turbinate swab collection for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
      testing; collection of saliva and/or oral fluid and dried blood spot samples (DBS) in a
      subset of participants to evaluate the performance of diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 assays using
      these matrices; administration of tablet-based survey. Medical records abstraction for
      healthcare facility participants.
