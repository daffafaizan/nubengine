      every year. The majority of BC patients are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
      (NMIBC). The majority of NMIBC are treated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine (BCG) as
      adjuvant treatment but for carcinoma in situ it is the primary treatment. BCG is known to
      give a lot of side effects both local and systemic, the severity of these can lead to
      premature termination of the treatment.

      The object of this PhD project is to investigate if reduced dwell time, the time the BCG is
      in the bladder, will decrease the severity of side effects due to BCG instillations.

      This will be investigated in a Nordic setting and the project will be done as a two-armed
      randomized clinical trial.

      By decreasing the severity of side effects, we hypothesize the number of patients completing
      all planned instillations will increase and thereby decrease the risk of the BC evolving into
      a more aggressive type.
