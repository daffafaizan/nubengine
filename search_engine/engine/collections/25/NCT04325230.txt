      blood flow drop during perinatal period. It is the leading cause of neonatal encephalopathy,
      and thus a major cause of perinatal mortality, morbidity and adverse neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Usual care brain MRI is critically important in the diagnosis and prognosis. Lasting
      about 30 to 40 minutes, MRI exam includes successive sequences providing complementary
      information but none relatively to brain perfusion. Perfusion MRI without contrast media
      injection is possible using Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) sequence. ASL is highly suitable for
      neonates, noninvasiveness, and lasts only 5 minutes. However, only one study assessed ASL as
      a prognostic factor. The purpose of the study is therefore to perform ASL sequence within
      usual care brain MRI.
