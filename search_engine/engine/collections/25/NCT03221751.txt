      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), now appear to be
      caused by the accumulation and aggregation of proteins that cause progressive damage to the
      brain. Recent preclinical results suggest that clearance of such neurotoxic proteins from the
      brain may be greatly increased during states where noradrenergic (NA) tone is decreased or
      blocked, such as anesthesia and normal sleep, but impaired in animal models of mild Traumatic
      Brain Injury (mTBI). These results also suggest that clearance through this mechanism, which
      has been termed the 'glymphatic' system, is likely to be decreased in conditions where NA
      signaling is inappropriately maintained during sleep, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Importantly, the rate at which toxins are cleared through the glypmhatic system has
      been found to be under alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (AR) control, and the application of
      noradrenergic blockers such as the alpha-1 AR antagonist drug, prazosin, has been shown to
      increase waking clearance of these proteins to levels normally found during sleep or
      anesthesia. This suggests two important possibilities: first, that conditions in which the
      brain NA signaling is increased and sleep is impaired, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and mTBI, may predispose people to decreased clearance of neurotoxic proteins
      associated with the development and progression of dementia; and second, that the use of
      prazosin may be able to prevent such effects.
