    
      In this pilot study, 10 black participants and 15 non-black participants will be enrolled
      after achieving 50% or more decline of their prostatic specific antigen (PSA) while on
      abiraterone for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Abiraterone will be stopped and will not be re-initiated until there
      is 50% or more increase of the PSA. Each time abiraterone is stopped, it will be defined as
      the start of a new adaptive therapy cycle. Participants who cannot achieve a 50% decline of
      their PSA after restarting abiraterone will continue abiraterone until they develop
      radiographic disease progression. If the decline in performance status does not occur at the
      time of radiographic disease progression, participants will be followed until they develop
      radiographic disease progression.

      The study will be terminated early if less than 3 of the first 10 enrolled participants can
      complete 2 cycles of the adaptive abiraterone.
