      reward-related behaviors. The investigators previously showed that individuals who report
      occasional feelings of high energy and excitability experience less effect from a single dose
      of alcohol, compared to people who have not experienced these effects. Now the investigators
      wish to determine if this dampened response also occurs with other rewards, namely feelings
      of wellbeing after a dose of amphetamine, or liking of a sweet solution. Individuals who
      exhibit the BPP (i.e., periods of excitability) also are more likely to develop alcohol
      problems, substance misuse, and weight gain and obesity. Therefore, the investigators will
      test the working hypothesis that young adults who report having these experiences, based on a
      questionnaire measure (i.e., BPP individuals) will show dampened subjective responses to both
      single oral doses of amphetamine or sweet palatable tastes. The investigators will also
      obtain objective measures (e.g. Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia and heart rate) to amphetamine
      and sweet taste, to establish whether the dampened subjective response extends to
      physiological indices as well. This study will extend the previous literature regarding the
      blunted effects of alcohol in BPP individuals and will suggest possible mechanisms that
      promote broader addictive behaviors in individuals with mood disturbance. Importantly, the
      investigators are proposing to test individuals at a relatively young age, 18-19 years. This
      is important to identify a risk factor, that is thought to pre-date use of drugs. In older
      participants, it would be difficult to separate the role of the pre-existing trait from the
      effect of habitual drug or alcohol use that escalates markedly after age 20.
