    
      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MK-6240 (also known as [18F]MNI-946) a
      tau targeted radiopharmaceutical.

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MK-6240 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MK-6240 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its
           ability to measure tau protein in brain using the tracer plasma concentration or a
           reference region as indirect input.

        -  To obtain test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with
           Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers (Cohort 1).

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MK-6240.

        -  To determine the longitudinal change in tau burden (including SUVR and tau distribution
           metrics) compared to baseline in AD subjects and in similarly aged HV subjects.

        -  To evaluate the correlation between the longitudinal change in tau burden and change in
           clinical, MRI and CSF biomarker measures in AD subjects and in similarly-aged HV
           subjects.

        -  To further explore the relationship between tracer metabolism and smoking (Cohort 3).
