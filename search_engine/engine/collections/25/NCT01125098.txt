      in Italy, starting October 2006 and continuing until December 2010. The 100 patients
      randomised to the standard non PRO-CT guided antibiotic treatment plan will continue
      antibiotics for 10 days, whereas the 100 patients randomised to the PRO-CT-guided antibiotic
      treatment plan will continue for 10 days or stop antibiotics on day 3 depending on PRO-CT
      levels measured at admission, day 1 and day 2. Serum PRO-CT will be measured in a central
      laboratory. Patients will be examined at admission (visit 1), discharge and/or at 10 days
      (visit 4), 1 (visit 5), 3 (visit 6) and 6 months (visit 7). A telephone interview will be
      obtained at 2, 4 and 5 months. The primary outcome of the study will be the rate of
      exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will be hospital readmission, admission to ICU, change in
      FEV1, duration of hospitalization, and death. The sample size was estimated according to the
      primary outcome of the study.
