      lesions, which has been widely applied in clinical practice. However, during the examination,
      too much water, foam or residues in the stomach will not only increase the procedure time and
      the misdiagnosis rate, but also decrease the patients' tolerance, for more efforts should be
      made to deal with the excessive water, foam or residues in order to obtain a clear view of
      the mucosa. Simethicone is also called poly-dimethylsiloxane, which can be used to remove the
      foam and water. Although simethicone has been routinely administrated before the
      esophagogastroscopy, the optimal strategy of administrating simethicone has not been clearly
      investigated, especially the time to administrate simethicone. Intaking simethicone too early
      will result in too excessive water in the stomach, while if the patients take it too late it
      doesn't take effects. Thus, this is a study to determine whether selecting different
      simethicone administration strategies could improve the performance of the
      esophagogastroscopy and minimize the patients' dissatisfaction.
