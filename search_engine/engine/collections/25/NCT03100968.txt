      of bony landmarks to facilitate epidural placement in obstetric anesthesia. Using ultrasound
      for epidural placement has become popular over the last decade with several studies being
      published on the topic. The likely increase in popularity for ultrasound use in the obstetric
      population is the need to more reliably locate bony landmarks as the traditional palpation
      technique has been shown to be an inaccurate way to accomplish this. Given the fact that the
      long-taught palpation technique can be inaccurate and studies have validated the use of
      ultrasound for epidural placement, ultrasound technique is routinely taught by the obstetric
      anesthesiologists to the anesthesiology residents at UAB. Also, since both techniques are
      considered standard practice at UAB, anesthesia providers (residents, fellows, and faculty)
      are free to choose either technique to locate bony structures of the back prior to epidural
      placement. Since no current study has specifically addressed its use in the obese pregnant
      patient, the investigators would like to validate its use in this population.

      In this study, investigators will evaluate the use of ultrasound in the obese population to
      determine if its use will decrease the time it takes to place the epidural and number of
      attempts required when compared to the traditional palpation technique. The study will also
      determine the success rate of epidural placement in both the palpation and ultrasound groups.
