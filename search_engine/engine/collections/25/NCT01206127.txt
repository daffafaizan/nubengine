    
      Corneal transplant is a surgical procedure where a damaged or diseased cornea is replaced by
      donated corneal tissue (the graft) in its entirety (penetrating keratoplasty) or in part
      (lamellar keratoplasty). One type of lamellar keratoplasty is DSAEK (Descemet's Stripping
      Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty), where only the damaged posterior section of the cornea
      is replaced.

      To get the graft in the right position inside the eyes anterior chamber, the anterior chamber
      is fully filled with air, and the patient is placed in a supine position looking facing up
      for different amount of time depending on the surgeon. In this way the air bubble will press
      the graft in the right position and prevent dislocation. Our experience is that since the
      anterior chamber of the eye already is fully filled with air, it does not matter how the
      patient is positioned postoperatively regarding graft dislocation.

      Our hypothesis is that the immediate postoperative positioning is insignificant. If this can
      be significantly proved this may enhance the patients comfort postoperatively.
