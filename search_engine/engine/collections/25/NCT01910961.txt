      investigators have revealed that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce
      intestinal and pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal aortic
      aneurysm (AAA) repair.Few groups have investigated the long term influence of limb remote
      ischemic preconditioning.Therefore, the investigators evaluated the impact of limb remote
      ischemic preconditioning on mortality, hospitalization costs and quality of life during
      elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single
      blind setting.
