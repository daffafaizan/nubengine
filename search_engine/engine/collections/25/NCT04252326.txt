      beds. Healthcare workers who are authorized to intervene in children (0-18 age group)
      including medical doctors, nurses and dentists were enrolled to study. In the evaluation of
      the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of the participants about drug hypersensitivity
      reactions in children, a study questionnaire was developed by pediatric allergy and
      immunology specialists and pediatric nurses by considering the other studies on the same
      subject.
