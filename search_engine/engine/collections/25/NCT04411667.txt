      compare the impact of adding IVIG to the Standard of Care (SOC) to the SOC without IVIG.
      Randomization will be 1:1. The goal of this study is to identify whether or not IVIG can halt
      the progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in subjects admitted
      to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19. The addition of IVIG to the standard of care
      treatment for these patients may be beneficial in abating acute lung injury in subjects with
      SARSCoV-2 induced hypoxia that results in organ injury.
