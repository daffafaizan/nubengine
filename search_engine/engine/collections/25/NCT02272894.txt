      and other countries, due to the popularity of screening and Improved surgical procedures,
      there has been great improvement in overall survival. Standard D2 Gastrectomy has been the
      standard operation for advanced gastric cancer. However, there is no unanimous consensus
      whether Standard D2 Gastrectomy plus 14v lymph node dissection is needed.Till now, it is
      difficult to stage the 14V lymph node as regional lymph nodes metastasis or distant
      metastasis. And it is urgent to explore the necessity of 14v lymph node dissection in
      advanced gastric cancer.So a prospective randomized controlled study will to carry out to
      evaluate the effects of D2 radical gastrectomy plus 14v lymph node dissection compared with
      D2 radical gastrectomy.
