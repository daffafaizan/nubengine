      injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that erythropoietin is useful to repair
      neurological injury in brain. The main mechanism of erythropoietin is supposed as follows;
      neuroprotection effect, angiogenesis, and anti-inflammation.

      On the basis of many experimental studies, erythropoietin is suggested as a potential therapy
      for cerebral palsy.
