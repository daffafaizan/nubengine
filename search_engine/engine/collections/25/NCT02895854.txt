    
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common solid malignancy among the men in the Western world.
      The classification to low, intermediate and high risk groups is determined by the PSA,
      Gleason score and clinical TNM status at the moment of diagnosis. There are several treatment
      options available for patients with low and intermediate risk PC and generally their
      prognosis is good. The men live long after their radical treatments and they have to live
      with the possible adverse effects caused by the treatment.

      In this prospective, randomised clinical trial we are comparing two radiotherapy modalities
      to find out if there are differences in the acute and late adverse effects among men treated
      either by low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy or hypofractionated external radiotherapy. Also
      the PSA-responses and cost utilities will be analysed. The number of patients recruited for
      the study is 60 and the patients will be randomised 1:1 to each treatment arm.
