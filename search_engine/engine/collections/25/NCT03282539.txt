      EUS-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs). It is postulated safer
      than other types of stents due to the presence of bilateral anchoring flanges, designed to
      appose the stomach or duodenum to the PFC wall minimizing the risk of perforation or
      peritoneal leakage. In addition, the larger lumen diameter facilitates the drainage of PFC,
      specially the walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN). However, secondary adverse effects such
      as infection due to complete or partial stent obstruction, migration, bleeding or buried LAMS
      syndrome have also been related . The placement of a coaxial double pigtail plastic within
      the LAMS has been reported beneficial in order to avoid external migration or the lumen
      obstruction and to the prevention of bleeding and other adverse events. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAMS with and without a coaxial double pigtail
      plastic stent in the EUS-guided transmural drainage of PFCs.
