      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. We designed a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, open-label phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 versus
      placebo as consolidation chemotherapy (CCT) after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy for
      unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).The purpose of this
      study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 vs placebo as
      consolidation chemotherapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy for unresectable
      locally advanced ESCC.
