      Primary

        -  To evaluate ERCC1 tumor expression, as measured by IHC, as a predictor of
           progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced ovarian epithelial
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (C8092A and codon 118) with ERCC1
           tumor expression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 tumor expression by
      IHC and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
