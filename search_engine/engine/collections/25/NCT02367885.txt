      healthy Japanese children when given as an intramuscular injection.

      The study will enroll approximately 99 participants (33 per treatment group) to receive
      TAK-850 in open label fashion, The participants will be assigned to each treatment group as
      follows:

        -  a single intramuscular injection of TAK-850/0.5 mL in 13 to 19 years old healthy
           Japanese children,

        -  Two injections of TAK-850/0.5 mL in 3 to 12 years old healthy Japanese children,

        -  Two injections of TAK-850/0.25 mL in 6 to 35 months old healthy Japanese children.

      The overall time to participate in this trial is 22 days (13-19 years old) or 43 days (6
      months to 12 years old). Participants will make up to 2 visits (13-19 years old) or 3 visits
      (6 months to 12 years old) to the site.
