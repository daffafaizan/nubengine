      with Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI) and Laryngeal-Mask-Airway (LMA), daily used in the
      investigator's Hospital to anesthetize women undergoing breast surgery. Aim of this trial is
      to define if neurocognitive tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test A and B,
      Digit Span Test) before and after surgery relate to concentrations at effector's site (Ec) of
      propofol and remifentanil TCI and the values of Bispectral Index and Entropy monitoring and
      Surgical Plethysmographic Index (SPI).
