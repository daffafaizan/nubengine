      to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fatal in 1% of cases. However, pregnant
      women and their fetuses could particularly be vulnerable to the infection, as shown by
      previous human coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

      Cases will be recruited among all pregnant women aged >18 years old who have tested positive
      for COVID-19 and are followed in a maternity belonging to the French South Regional
      Perinatology Network. Voluntary physicians will refer eligible participants to the
      study-coordinating center at APHM University Hospital. The participants will be followed by
      phone after having provided an informed consent. Clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging
      findings, maternal and perinatal outcomes will be recorded.
