      Primary objective: To evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of neoadjuvant cisplatin plus
      paclitaxel and postoperative chemoradiation therapy with fluorouracil plus leucovorin calcium
      in patients with high-risk gastric cancer.

      Secondary objectives: To assess the pathologic response of gastric tumors to neoadjuvant
      cisplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy, and preliminarily assess the patterns of failure and
      disease free and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 3 courses of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy given on day 1
      every 21 days. Courses consist of an intravenous infusion of cisplatin and a 3 hour
      intravenous infusion of paclitaxel on day 1. Patients then undergo surgery for tumor removal
      on day 63, followed 4-6 weeks later by one course of daily intravenous bolus leucovorin
      calcium and fluorouracil for 5 days. Chemotherapy is repeated 4-6 weeks later for the first 4
      days of week 1 and the last 3 days of week 5 of radiation therapy given 5 days a week for 5
      weeks. Patients receive two more courses, 4 weeks apart, of fluorouracil and leucovorin
      calcium for 5 days 4-6 weeks after completing radiation treatment. Patients are followed
      every month for the first 3 months, every 3 months for the next 21 months, every 6 months for
      the next year, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-42 patients will be accrued over 18 months.
