    
      CDX-1127 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on
      certain immune cells and also on certain hematologic tumor cells and may act to promote
      anti-tumor effects.

      This study will evaluate the safety and activity of escalating doses of CDX-1127 in patients
      with B-cell and T-cell hematologic malignancies known to express CD27 and solid tumors that
      are more likely to be responsive to the immune system.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of 5 dose levels of CDX-1127. This first phase of the study will test the safety profile
      of CDX-1127 and will assess which dose to test in future studies.

      During the Expansion phase, cohorts of approximately 15 patients each will receive the study
      treatment to continue to evaluate the safety profile of CDX-1127 and to determine if it has
      an effect on their cancer. Expansion cohorts may be limited to one or more tumor types.

      Patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment for up to 5 cycles, until their
      disease has progressed or until it is necessary to stop the treatment for safety or other
      reasons.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is
      responding to treatment and for any side effects that may occur.
