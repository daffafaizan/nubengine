      transsphenoidal surgery exploits the nasal corridor and paranasal sinuses to reach the skull
      base, sinonasal trauma is a primary source of postoperative morbidity in many of these
      patients. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of endoscopic transsphenoidal
      pituitary surgery on nasal function using a numerical simulation and to compare the
      difference between two kinds of transsphenoidal approachese(single nostril approach and
      bilateral nostril approach)ï¼Ž
