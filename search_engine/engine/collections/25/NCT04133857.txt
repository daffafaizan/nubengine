    
      40 participants were recruited and divided into 2 groups. Each group performed 2 exercise
      protocols with a 4 day washout period between them.

      The intraocular pressure was measured before the exercise and after the exercise in 5 minute
      periods up until 30 minutes post exercise.

      The intraocular pressure was measured using a handheld rebound tonometer.
