      continuous AF for more than 12 months. Concomitant surgical AF ablation was offered to
      suitable patients as determined by the surgeon, and patients then decided whether to undergo
      the additional procedure.

      The operations were performed through median sternotomy and under cardiopulmonary bypass. The
      bipolar ablation clamp was positioned precisely around the pulmonary veins (PV) for bilateral
      circular ablation. After Marsh ligament cutting and cross-clamping the ascending aorta, the
      left atrial appendage was resected and left atrial cavity exposed through an incision behind
      the interatrial groove. Then, linear ablations were performed between the left and right
      inferior PVs, between the left and right superior PVs, between the left superior PV and the
      opening of the left atrial appendage, and between the line connecting bilateral inferior PVs
      and the mitral valve isthmus. Ablation at the right atrium was then performed. Briefly, the
      bipolar ablation clamp was positioned around the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrial
      appendage for circular ablation. An L-shaped incision was then made on the anterior wall of
      the right atrium and linear ablations were performed vertically from the incision to the
      interatrial groove and tricuspid annulus, to the ablation ring around the right atrial
      appendage, and from the superior vena cava to the ablation ring around the inferior vena
      cava.

      The left atrial appendage was always excluded by resection and the incision was closed with
      continuous running stitches. Temporary pacemakers were placed in all patients and activated
      when heart rate was less than 70 beats per minute.
