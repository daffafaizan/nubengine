    
      This is a multicenter, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of triplet regimen
      (FOLFOXIRI) combined with cetuximab for patients with EGFR wild type LARC. After 4 cycles of
      FOLFOXIRI+cetuximab and 2 weeks later, the patients will be evaluated by senior radiologist,
      oncologist and surgeon through pelvic MRI, CT and Positron Emission Computed Tomography
      (PET-CT). The patients will go to surgery (TME) if the tumor response is good enough to have
      complete resection under the decision of the multidisciplinary team (MDT),otherwise, the
      patients will receive pelvic radiotherapy(45Grey/25Fraction and 5.4Grey/3Fraction boost to
      the tumor bed) combined with capecitabine(625 mg/m²,bid po,d1-5,qw), and additional four
      cycles of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or Oxaliplatin 135mg/m²plus Capecitabine 1.0/m², bid
      po(XELOX) of each 3 weeks cycle for 2 cycles chemotherapy before TME. All patients will
      receive 6-8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 4-5 cycles XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy after TME.

      FOLFOXIRI+Cetuximab Irinotecan 165 mg/m² + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² + leucovorin 200 mg/m² + 5-FU
      2800 mg/m² cont. inf. 46h + Cetuximab 500 mg/m²,all on day 1 of each 2 weeks cycle for 4-6
      cycles,
