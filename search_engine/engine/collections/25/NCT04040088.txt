    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the difference in radiation therapy (RT) target volume definition between
      gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET/CT and iobenguane (metaiodobenzylguanidine
      [MIBG]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the difference in metastatic tumor burden as detected by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT
      and MIBG.

      II. To estimate the difference in metabolic activity between tumors diagnosed on
      68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and MIBG.

      III. To evaluate patterns of failure after RT in association with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and
      MIBG.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients with newly diagnosed neuroendocrine cancer receive 68Ga-DOTATATE
      intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT over 20-30 minutes at diagnosis (before any treatment)
      and at the time of radiation treatment planning.

      COHORT B: Patients with previously diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer receive 68Ga-DOTATATE
      IV and undergo PET/CT over 20-30 minutes at the time of radiation treatment planning.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.
