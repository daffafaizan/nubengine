      within the previous fourteen (14) days will be considered for entry to this long-term
      open-label trial. All patients will receive 'T80/H25'. Additional antihypertensive therapy
      will be allowed if the patients' blood pressure is not well controlled. [In the preceding
      double-blind trial 502.480, patients who failed to respond to the fixed dose combination of
      telmisartan 80 mg '+' hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (T80/H12.5) were randomised to 'T80/H12.5'
      or T80H25 for eight weeks.] This is a multi-centre, multinational trial with approximately 80
      study centres participating. Only study centres participating in the preceding trial 502.480
      can enter patients into this open-label trial. It is anticipated that a maximum of 480
      patients will be entered into the trial in seventeen countries. Each trial centre is expected
      to enter between four and twenty-four patients.

      Enrollment of patients into this trial will finish when the last patient completes the
      preceding trial 502.480. At this time, centres will be notified of the termination of
      recruitment and will not be authorized to include any further patients.

      Patients will visit the clinic one month, three months and six months later for assessment of
      their blood pressure and general health. Their participation in the study is complete six
      months after the start of the treatment period.

      Study Hypothesis:

      No statistical hypothesis will be tested. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterise
      the effects of treatment with T80/H25 with and without other antihypertensive treatments.

      Comparison(s):

      The proportion of patients achieving DBP control will be summarised by the total number of
      patients in the trial as well as by the maximum achieved dose level according to the two
      categories of T80/H25 alone (T80/H25) and with other antihypertensive medication added
      (T80/H25/other). An additional sub-group summary by the treatment group in the preceding
      trial 502.480 (T80/H12.5 and T80/H25) will also be presented.
