    
      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety
      and device performance of The RenalGuard System in the management of patients admitted with
      signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of
      volume overload. Subjects will be referred by their physician if he/she feels that the
      subject could benefit from observed diuresis in a hospital setting.

      The device being utilized is called The RenalGuardÂ® System (The System). By default, The
      System infuses a volume of hydration fluid equal to the volume of urine output. This is known
      as matched hydration. In addition, the clinician has the ability to adjust the matched
      setting such that RenalGuard can infuse hydration fluid to achieve a positive fluid balance
      (e.g. +100 ml/hr.) or a negative fluid balance (e.g. -100 ml/hr.). The purpose of this
      balanced fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension and vital
      organ dysfunction, or fluid overload that may lead to shortness of breath in subjects in whom
      high urine output is desired.

      All patients will be treated with The RenalGuard System for a minimum of 24-hours, and
      possibly longer, at the investigators discretion. They will be followed for 30 days post
      discharge. The protocol will enroll up to 40 subjects to develop the clinical algorithm
      required to optimally and safely perform removal of volume. The study will be conducted in up
      to 5 sites in Europe.
