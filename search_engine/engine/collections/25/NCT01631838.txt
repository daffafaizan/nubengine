      will be conducted in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects will be supplemented with
      Tocovid Suprabio 200 mg twice daily (or placebo) for 2 weeks followed by a postprandial
      challenge on Day 14. During the postprandial challenge, venous blood samples will be
      collected during fasting. Subjects are then required to consume a high fat breakfast meal
      containing 50g fat and 100mL milkshake, followed by the assigned capsules. Venous blood
      samples will be drawn at 2, 4 and 6 hours after consumption of capsules. A washout period of
      at least 14 days will be in place before the commencement of the second treatment.
