      to date there have been no studies evaluating re-tear rate following arthroscopic surgery.
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is less invasive and exposes the patient to fewer risks than
      open surgery. Once this pilot study is completed the next step will be to compare the rate of
      re-tear, as assessed via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) between the two techniques. If the
      rate of re-tear is lower following arthroscopic surgery this will provide validation for use
      of the arthroscopic technique. If, however, the rate of re-tear is higher using the
      arthroscopic technique, then use of this technique is not justified.
