      cancer and continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.Early
      diagnosis and monitoring tumor recurrence after surgery are still far from satisfying.

      Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) detection has been proved to be feasible in early stage NSCLC in
      previous studies.Both genomic mutation and methylation a promising biomarker.Therefore,this
      study will perform multiplex detection of ctDNA,analysing mutations, methylation and other
      biomarkers,focusing on the early diagnosis and postoperative surveillance for NSCLC patients.
