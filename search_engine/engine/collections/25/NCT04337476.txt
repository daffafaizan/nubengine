    
      A Prospective randomized controlled pilot study trial will be conducted. Infants will be
      evaluated at 32-34 post-conceptional weeks when the volume of milk assumed orally will be
      less than 50% of the total enteral intake.

      Infants with gestational age less than 34 weeks will be enrolled. After the request for
      informed consent, participants will be randomized randomly through computerized.

      The administration of the PAL and the reproduction of the relative voices will be performed
      by the music therapist.

      Objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerance (in terms of clinical stability,
      described through the HRV parameter) of the PAL device by the enrolled customers and
      investigate any benefits of the positive reinforcement purchased, through its use, on the
      acquisition of food skills and on the growth of preterms.

      Primary Outcome: Clinical Stability Using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Measurement during the
      music therapy treatment.

      Secondary Outcomes: effects of positive reinforcement (obtained through the use of the device
      PAL) on the acquisition of food skills and the growth of preterm consumers.

      In particular:

        -  Evaluation of the achievement of the exclusive oral sucking

        -  Evaluation of the variation in the rate of meal intake between the beginning and the end
           of the intervention

        -  Assessment of the infant's weight gain in the 24 hours following stimulation

        -  Evaluation of the rate of growth from the last day of treatment to discharge.

        -  Duration of hospital stay.
