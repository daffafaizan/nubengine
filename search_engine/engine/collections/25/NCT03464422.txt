      intervention manual (created by the study PI) using feedback from previous qualitative
      interviews with MSM in New Haven and Hartford, CT. Also incorporated will be recent
      qualitative research on MSM of color's resilience. Specifically, the ways in which racial
      minority stigma impacts the mental health of MSM in small urban areas and adaptive coping
      skills that MSM can use in the face of these health threats.

      Aim 2, will consist of the deliver of the adapted intervention to 30 young MSM (15
      HIV-negative and 15 HIV-positive) to gather data on the feasibility and acceptability of the
      newly adapted program. The evaluation of the new program will be conducted using pre-post
      comparisons of quantitative assessments and from qualitative interviews hoped to provide
      information regarding intervention feasibility, acceptability, and any needed refinement.

      This project integrates expertise in culturally-sensitive evidence-based interventions for
      MSM's HIV risk into a community-based HIV prevention and care context at the Fair Haven
      Community Health Center, where the intervention will be delivered to the existing patient
      population.
