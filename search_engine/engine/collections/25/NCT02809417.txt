      share there medico-psycho-social informations with all actors taking part of the patient
      care. Indeed, current informatique systems in medical establishments have an isolated
      functionning, without transmission of information outsite the wall of the hospital. The idea
      of this project is to bring together all actors involved in the care of a patient around a
      single shared patient record, regardless of the structures where professionnals work. This
      project is associating partners from the public area (university hospital of Nice, Nice
      university) and the private area (Agfa Health Care, Radhuis, Domicalis) to create a unique
      medico-psycho-social shared record. The informations will be share between all the
      professionnal taking car of the patient.

      The main objective of this protocol will be to determine the impact of using the LICORNE
      platform on the coordination of care of elderly patients with multiple diseases. We will
      assess the impact of using the LICORNE platform on the implementation of electronic health
      record (Dossier Médical Partagé, public health insurance of the social security), and the
      benefit of using the LICORNE platform to reduce patient's hospital readmissions.

      The purpose of this project is to significantly improve coordination of care, especially
      between hospital and home. We can expect a significant improvement in the patient's living
      conditions, improving its management, its security and ultimately, lower health care costs.
