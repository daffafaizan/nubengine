      feared complications in the elderly; they increase the postoperative morbidity and mortality,
      worsen the cognitive and functional outcome with loss of independence and increase the
      hospitalization length and costs . However, the etiology of these postoperative cognitive
      impairment, although probably multifactorial, remains unclear and strongly debated.

      The investigators hypothesize that excessive anesthesia depths associated with intraoperative
      hypotension may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment following
      surgery.
