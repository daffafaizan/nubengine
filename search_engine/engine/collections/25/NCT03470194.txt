    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Patients presenting to the UMass Memorial UROGYN
      clinic will be screened for eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. LEP
      patients will be identified as patients that initiate conversation in a non-English language
      and are only able to communicate adequately regarding their medical problem in a non-English
      language.

      After patients have been seen for their scheduled office visit, they will be invited to
      participate in the study. Once the patient has agreed to participate in the study the
      participant will be randomized. Study assignment will be revealed using sequentially numbered
      sealed opaque envelopes. Randomization will be performed using software and a block
      randomization scheme to yield a 50% chance of having an in-person interpreter.

      Those assigned to the control group will receive phone translation services and the
      experimental group will have in person interpreters.

      At the subsequent visit, demographic information will be collected and patients will then
      receive interpretation services from the phone or an in-person interpreter.
