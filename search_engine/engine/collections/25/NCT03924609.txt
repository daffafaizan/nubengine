      gradually increasing, accounts for the first place in the incidence of female malignant
      tumors. Bone metastasis is the most common distant metastatic site for breast cancer,
      accounting for approximately 70% of all patients with advanced breast cancer. About 26%-50%
      of breast cancer patients with primary metastases are bone. Autopsy results showed that the
      overall incidence of breast cancer bone metastasis was about 47%-85%.

      Postoperative routine screening for bone metastases in breast cancer patients, whether
      domestic or foreign, is not recommended in most guidelines. These recommendations were based
      on two prospective randomized controlled trials in Italy in 1990s, indicated that a bone scan
      every six months or annually didn't provide a survival benefit to the patient. However, there
      were researches showing that about 11% of patients with asymptomatic breast cancer have bone
      metastases, suggesting that early screening might detect more patients with asymptomatic bone
      metastases. The meta-analysis also pointed out that early screening may prolong the
      disease-free survival of patients. Besides, the imaging techniques have advance rapidly and
      remarkably since then. New trials are needed to figure out whether imaging screening of
      asymptomatic patients should be routinely performed to detect more asymptomatic bone
      metastases needs further investigation.
