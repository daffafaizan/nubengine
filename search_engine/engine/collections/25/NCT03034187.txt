      (Standard Follow-up Programme). It also includes the post -operative adjuvant treatments and
      the patients with positive lymph nodes.

      Patients will complete weekly questionnaires to score the patient -rated toxicity. Biweekly
      patients are seen by the treating radiation oncologist and / or AIOS in which the physician
      -rated toxicity is scored. In the follow-up will always patient -rated toxicity and physician
      -rated toxicity can be determined.

      Use of an SFP should yield a profit for the practitioner , such as the automatic generation
      of letters. This should apply to all SFPs .

      Quality of life and toxicity in patients will be completed on the touch-screen computers at
      FU visits.
