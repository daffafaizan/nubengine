      Surgery at the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, starting in January 1996. All
      potential candidates for obesity surgery were prospectively registered in the database.
      Patients were informed by the bariatric surgeon of the prospective database, and of the
      possibility of utilizing personal data for research purpose after anonymization. Patients
      were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. The standard preoperative assessment included
      nutritional counseling, psychological evaluation, abdominal ultrasound, upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy, and blood tests. Type and date of surgery, biological and
      clinical follow-up data and morbidity data were recorded prospectively in the database.

      A case-control study was performed, to compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients treated
      for internal hernia (IH group) with the QoL of patients with an uncomplicated course after
      Roux en Y gastric bypass (Uncomplicated RYGB group). Patients who had IH were paired with
      patients of the same age and sex and at the same postoperative interval. Paired patients were
      contacted by phone to obtain the QoL questionnaires, abdominal pain evaluation, and weight
      loss data.
