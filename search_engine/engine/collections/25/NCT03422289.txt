      such as subfertility and pregnancy complications. So far myo-inositol, successfully used in
      PCOS, has not been always effective in all patients. Aiming at overcoming this drawback, we
      tested a new formulation with myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin, in consideration of the effects
      exerted by α-lactalbumin in favoring molecule passage among body compartments, and also in
      consideration of its anti-inflammatory activity.

      Only PCOS patients, according to Rotterdam ESHRE-ASRM criteria, with anovulation and
      infertility > 1 year, were included in the study. Following a treatment with 2 g myo-inositol
      and 0.2 mg folic acid, a part of them are resistant and do not ovulate.

      These non-responders to myo-inositol alone undergo the second phase of the study, receiving
      2g myo-inositol and 0.2 mg folic acid plus 50 mg α-lactalbumin for three months. After this
      combined treatment, the majority of them ovulate, showing a hormone and lipid profile
      improvement. In addition, myo-inositol plasma levels at the end of the treatment are
      significantly higher than at baseline and comparable to those patients who respond positively
      to myo-inositol alone.
