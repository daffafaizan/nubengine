      medical device ABL01. The intended use of ABL01 is to reduce and treat onychomycosis, fungal
      nail infection. ABL01 is a solution intended to be topically administered weekly to infected
      nails. The trial is designed as a double blinded randomized placebo controlled clinical
      trial. The trial involves 70 study subjects, half of which will receive ABL01 and the other
      half placebo. The inclusion criteria for study subjects are adult men and women that present
      with distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DSU) on the big toe nails. Furthermore, the
      extent of DSU should not involve more than half of the area of the nail.

      The study subjects will themselves apply the study solution weekly to the treated nail. The
      trial will run for 6 months with a possible extension to maximum 12 months. There will be a
      total of 4 study visits at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months to follow up the progress of the
      trial. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if ABL01 treatment are able to
      reduce and treat onychomycosis. Secondary objectives are to collect safety data, determine if
      the ABL01 are perceived as easy to use and assess long term effects of the treatment. The
      endpoint of the trial is reduction in clinical signs or complete cure of onychomycosis at the
      6- or 12-month time-point.
