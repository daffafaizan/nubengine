      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine
      Symptoms (FACT-ES) scores to detect changes in AI-induced symptoms and well-being in
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer at 3 months of nanoemulsion curcumin (NEC) vs placebo

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Brief Pain Inventory, and
      Geriatric Assessment as secondary tools for monitoring AI-induced symptoms and well-being II.
      To evaluate adherence to a regimen of NEC vs placebo by postmenopausal women experiencing
      joint arthropathy induced by aromatase inhibitor therapy III. To obtain preliminary data
      regarding function in women with AI induced arthropathy (IA) by monitoring grip strength at 0
      and 3 months of NEC versus placebo IV. To conduct exploratory analyses of blood based
      biomarkers in postmenopausal women with AI-induced arthropathy taking NEC vs placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nanoemulsion curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 3
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for up to 3 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
