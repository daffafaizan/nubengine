      examining use of the Surefire device to improve tumor perfusion. Specifically, this study
      compares TACE both with or without the use of the Surefire device

      Investigators are doing this research to determine if a Surefire Infusion System can improve
      tumor response to liver-directed intra-arterial chemotherapy compared to a traditional
      microcatheter.

      Surefire is a Food and Drug Administration-approved valve-like device that blocks backflow
      within the artery but also generates increased pressure in a tumor feeder vessel during
      infusion. During this study, participants will receive the same medication in the same dose
      and the same way it would be delivered to the liver as a standard of care procedure, only
      either through a regular microcatheter (which is the standard of care procedure) or a
      Surefire Infusion System (which is a modified microcatheter).
