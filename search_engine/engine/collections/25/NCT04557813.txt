      or metastatic solid tumors harboring NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3 gene fusions, thereby generating
      real world evidence. It will identify factors that influence treatment decisions after
      receiving the diagnosis of a NTRK (Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase) fusion-positive
      cancer. All treatment lines administered before and after the molecular diagnosis of a NTRK
      fusion-positive cancer, irrespective of the type of antineoplastic treatment, will be
      documented. Data will be assessed at least 36 months per patient (i.e. until 36 months after
      inclusion of the last patient in the study). This approach will allow a description of TRK
      fusion protein-targeted therapies and other therapy strategies regarding effectiveness and
      disease-related symptomology within the limitations of non-randomized studies in terms of
      comparative analyses. Intra-individual and inter-individual comparisons (for the latter,
      provided that a sufficient number of patients with a NTRK fusion-positive cancer are not
      treated with a TRK inhibitor) could be performed.

      The associated biomarker profiling module of the REALTRK registry will aim to set up a
      decentralized biobank for future research on molecular alterations.
