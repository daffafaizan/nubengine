      concerns in the translated protocol. 20 Spanish-speaking Hispanics at least one year
      post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 20 Spanish-speaking Hispanics with multiple sclerosis
      (MS), both with an objective deficit in learning and memory will be recruited. Baseline
      assessment includes neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as
      completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday memory and everyday
      functioning. Subjects are randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups.
      Experimental and control treatments includes two 45-60 minute sessions, twice per week, for 5
      weeks. Follow-up assessment includes a neuropsychological evaluation using traditional
      measures as well as completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday
      memory and everyday functioning. Protocol efficacy will be determined by improvements between
      baseline and follow-up on an objective measure of learning and memory.
