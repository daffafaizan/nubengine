      immediate-treatment group, or a 3-month waitlist control group. Both groups will be given
      surveys to complete online, and a seizure calendar to keep track of auras, seizures, and
      events. The immediate-treatment group will be scheduled to start Project UPLIFT with their
      trained facilitator. Each of the eight weekly sessions will take place at the same day of the
      week and at the same time, and will last approximately one hour. Participants will have the
      option of using a fake-name during the telephone calls to conceal their identity during the
      group telephone calls.

      After the 8 weekly sessions, both groups will be given a second set of online surveys to
      complete individually. At this time, the waitlist control group will be scheduled to start
      Project UPLIFT with the trained facilitator. After the waitlist group completes the final
      session of Project UPLIFT, both groups will complete a third and final set of online surveys,
      thus concluding all study procedures.
