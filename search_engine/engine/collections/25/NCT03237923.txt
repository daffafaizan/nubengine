      mortality and hospitalizations in the 21st century. Despite advancements, prognosis often
      remains poor and mortality high. Congestive Heart Failure diagnoses are often characterized
      by frequent hospitalizations and re-admissions, and early detection of pulmonary edema, a
      chief characteristic of worsening heart failure, may have positive implications in patients'
      quality of life and frequency of hospitalizations. The EasySense device is a non-invasive
      device designed to measure lung fluid in patients with CHF. Similar to ultrasound technology,
      the device uses radiofrequency waves to assess fluid status. The device is placed on the bare
      skin of the chest and held in place for approximately 60 seconds to obtain a reading.

      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the EasySense system in measuring lung fluid
      volume. Seventy-five patients are sought for enrollment. Patients will be enrolled during
      their hospital stay, and will be asked to maintain daily EasySense measurements, in addition
      to other measurements, for thirty days post-discharge.
