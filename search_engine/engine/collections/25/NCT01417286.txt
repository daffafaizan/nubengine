      I. Freedom from local failure and freedom from regional failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Acute toxicity and late toxicity using previously published toxicity scales. II. To
      identify co-variates responsible for poor cosmetic outcome in women with reconstructed chest
      walls when treated with accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy.

      III. To correlate toxicity, cosmesis, and local control with molecular markers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hypofractionated accelerated RT over 11 weekdays (for 15 elapsed days)
      within 21-63 days after last surgery or last course of chemotherapy. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks, every 3-6 months
      for 3 years, every 6-12 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
