      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and anesthesia using inhalants such as sevoflurane or
      desflurane. For TIVA, the combination of propofol and remifentanil has been used and
      remifentanil is known for increasing vagal tone and inhibiting sympathetic nervous system as
      other opioids do. Sevoflurane is presumed to have no effect on parasympathetic or sympathetic
      tone. On the other hand, desflurane induces tachycardia and is noted for activating
      sympathetic activity. Previous studies on sympathetic nervous activity according to different
      anesthetics did not directly measure sympathetic tone but have relied on indirect measures
      such as blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability.

      In order to evaluate skin sympathetic nerve activity according to different anesthetics, we
      will be recruiting patients undergoing transurethral procedures, where the sympathetic tone
      is expected to be activated during anesthesia and surgery. The transurethral procedures
      consist of transurethral resection of bladder (TURB) and transurethral resection of prostate
      (TURP). During transurethral surgery, about 300mL of fluid is used to fill the bladder to
      secure surgical view and for irrigation. Bladder expansion causes sympathetic nerve
      activation and vasoconstriction, which will also increase SKNA signals. The purpose of this
      study is to measure skin sympathetic nerve activity according to different anesthetics during
      intraoperative events that stimulate sympathetic tone.
