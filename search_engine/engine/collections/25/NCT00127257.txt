      floor dyssynergia to a skeletal muscle relaxant drug (diazepam 5 mg two hours before
      attempted defecation) and to placebo medication. Prior to randomization, patients will first
      receive medical therapy (laxatives and education) for 4 weeks and only those remaining
      constipated will be randomized. Physiological tests of anal canal pressure during straining
      to defecate and ability to pass a 50-ml air filled balloon will be tested before and after
      treatment. Patients will keep a diary throughout baseline and treatment, and they will be
      reassessed at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Treatment will consist of 6 clinic visits at
      2-week intervals. The investigators will develop a detailed treatment manual for this
      disorder which would permit other investigators to replicate their study.
