      and motility. It is FDA approved and indicated for treatment of chronic idiopathic
      constipation and recently, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

      The Physicians Desk Reference lists over 90 Brand medications with reported incidence
      associated with constipation over 3%. Little data are available about treatment responses. A
      recent publication by our group reported treatment success for medication constipation using
      polyethylene glycol. Since ongoing studies are addressing the role of lubiprostone in opioid
      constipation, this work will be enrolling medication constipation study subjects not using
      opioids.

      In this study, patients who meet diagnostic criteria for constipation will be randomized to
      receive 28 days of treatment with lubiprostone 24mcg twice a day. Data will be collected to
      evaluate therapeutic outcome.
