      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and recommended phase II
           dose of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine the feasibility, safety, and toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the biologically effective dose.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) IV over 1 hour
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-DMAG until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
