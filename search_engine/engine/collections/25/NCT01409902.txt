    
      This is a descriptive clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of a sheathed speculum
      in providing adequate visualization and access to the cervix in women with excessive vaginal
      tissue. Eligible, consented subjects who fail their initial speculum examination (because
      their cervix is not visualized due to the collapse of loose lateral vaginal walls) will have
      a sheathed speculum examination instead of the standard-of-care exam whereby the clinician
      fabricates a solution at the bedside (condom with tip cut placed on speculum, concomitantly
      using an additional instrument like a lateral-wall retractor, glove with tip of thumb placed
      over the speculum, using the largest speculum available)
