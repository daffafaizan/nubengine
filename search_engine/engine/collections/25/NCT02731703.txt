      (i.e., newly fabricated conventional denture, conversion to a 4 implant retained overdenture
      and finally a 4 implant retained palateless overdenture). Additionally they will be recalled
      yearly for 5 years.

      Participants will have an interim denture fabricated to be worn for 10-12 weeks. During this
      time, participants will have 4 implants placed and continue wearing the interim denture. At 8
      weeks after implant placement, participants will have locator attachments placed on implants
      and the interim denture snapped into place, termed the 'overdenture.' After 10-12 weeks of
      wearing this overdenture, patients will receive a new denture, termed 'final palateless
      overdenture,' which consists of a denture snapped into the 4 implants without a palate.
      Participants will be evaluated at a 10-12 week followup from insertion of this prosthesis.
      Participants will complete questionnaires at each stage of treatment.

      One year after delivery of the final palateless overdenture and for five consecutive years
      patients will be asked to return for a follow up appointment.

      Estimated duration of patient participation is approximately 5 years and 8 months (271
      weeks). Estimated time for active clinical treatment is 8 months (32 weeks) with
      understanding of flexibility based on laboratory fabricated denture frameworks and
      adjustments needed for approval of esthetics.
