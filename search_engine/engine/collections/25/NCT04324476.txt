      second-line treatment. XELOX and XELIRI adopt the three-week regimen, and the single dose of
      oxaliplatin and irinotecan is large, which has a great impact on the gastrointestinal
      toxicity and blood toxicity of patients. Therefore, there is no lack of a two-week improved
      regimen with increased frequency and reduced single dose applied in clinical, so that it has
      good safety, exact efficacy and increase the drug delivery density. Based on the above, we
      should not only consider the efficiency of the three drugs, but also control the toxic
      reaction. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two-weekly alternative
      regimen of Bevacizumab plus XELOX/XELIRI for First-line Treatment in Unresectable Advanced
      Colorectal Cancer.
