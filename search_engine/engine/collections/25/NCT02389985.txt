      showing progression within six months of platinum-containing therapy, have a poor prognosis,
      with median overall survival (OS) approximately 12 months.Ultimately most patients with
      recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance, and novel strategies are needed.

      In this setting the most active agents are pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), paclitaxel
      and topotecan. Multiple trials have demonstrated that combination therapy produces increased
      toxicity without improved efficacy.

      This study proposes to examine the combination of CRLX101 in combination with weekly
      paclitaxel. Preclinical studies show synergistic activity in the SKOV3 human ovarian cancer
      xenograft ovarian cancer cell lines (14), as well as in vivo (15,16), perhaps via an
      antiangiogenic mechanism.
