      treating LTBI in adults. For people living with HIV-1, the risks of LTBI is increased.
      Individuals living with HIV-1 are often on chronic antiretroviral drugs that prevent
      immunodeficiency and complications associated with infection. Unfortunately, antiretroviral
      drugs are subject to many DDIs especially with RPT which induces drug clearing enzymes.

      Doravirine (DOR) is a newly approved non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated
      for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Because RPT induces the metabolic pathway in which DOR
      is removed, there is concern that taking both concomitantly will result in an unwanted DDI
      leading to reduced DOR concentrations in the blood. Reduced levels will result in loss of
      efficacy for the drug and therefore not provide adequate viral suppression in those living
      with HIV. This study investigates the DDI potential of the once weekly regimen RPT and INH
      together with DOR in healthy volunteers.
