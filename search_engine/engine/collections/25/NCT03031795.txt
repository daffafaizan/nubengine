      With typical use, unintended pregnancy rates in the first year of IUD contraception are 0.8%
      (Copper T) and 0.2% (LNG). It is known that long-acting, reversible contraception methods
      reduce the long-term cost of unintended pregnancies. A common deterrent to intrauterine
      contraception is the fear of pain during placement. Methods of pain relief during IUD
      insertion must be fast-acting but have minimal sedation. There have been many attempts to
      find effective pain relief during IUD placement. Neither ibuprofen nor naproxen have been
      shown to be effective in reducing pain. Misoprostol has been used to increase cervical
      ripening; however, pain was not decreased, and side effects of nausea and vomiting were
      increased. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by
      reversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and 2.Time to peak plasma concentration ketorolac in
      the oral form is 44 minutes. Studies have shown that one dose of ketorolac can be as potent
      as morphine. Ketorolac is also well established for pain control in the immediate
      post-operative period. A recent study showed that intramuscular ketorolac wais effective in
      reducing pain after IUD insertion, but 20% of the participants reported that after the
      procedure, the injection site was as painful as the IUD placement. The current study was
      designed to evaluate if there is reduced pain during IUD placement using oral ketorolac 40-60
      minutes before the procedure compared to a placebo.
