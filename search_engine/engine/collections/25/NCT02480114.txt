    
      Primary Objectives:

      - To determine whether gabapentin used as a preventive measure during chemoradiation can
      reduce radiation-induced mucositis associated pain in head and neck cancer patients as
      measured by: 1) pain scores on the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey (VHNSS version
      2.), and 2) analgesic use.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety (grade 3 or 4 adverse events) and tolerability of using gabapentin
           (discontinuation of drug due to side effects - yes or no)

        -  To correlate pain severity with frequency and severity of general systemic symptoms.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      - To determine whether pain control is associated with weight loss (in pounds) and duration
      of use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy utilization (in days).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Standard of Care (usual care) - Patients receive consisting of oral health measures,
      oral rinsing, miracle mouthwash, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and opioid analgesics.
      Patients also undergo an education session at the beginning of chemoradiation treatment to
      review foundations of oral care and pain management.

      ARM II: Standard of Care plus Gabapentin - Patients receive standard of care and undergo an
      education session as in Arm I. Patients also receive gabapentin orally (PO) three times a day
      throughout chemoradiation treatment (approximately 5-7 weeks) and until mucositis resolves
      and pain subsides.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.
