      is one of the most used indices to predict weaning outcome. The diaphragm plays a key role in
      generating VT and, in the case of diaphragmatic dysfunction, inspiratory accessory muscles
      may contribute to support ventilation. If this occurs during a spontaneous breathing trial
      (SBT), it will probably result in delayed weaning, since the accessory muscles are more
      fatigable than the diaphragm.

      The diaphragmatic tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is an ultrasonographic technique derived from
      ultrasound evaluation of heart's motility. Being a muscle doppler assessment, it can be
      easily used on the diaphragm to calculate the speed of muscles displacement that could be
      associated with patient's respiratory drive, as well as other derived index of muscle
      function.

      The aim of the study is to measure the variations of diaphragmatic displacement velocities
      before and during the spontaneous breathing trial, useful to check if the patient is ready to
      breathe spontaneously. An observational study will be performed. Patients who are ready to be
      weaned will be subjected to a spontaneous breathing test (Cpap 5), that consists of applying
      a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O for 20 minutes. A tissue Doppler evaluation
      will then be performed by analyzing the diaphragmatic displacement velocity during
      inspiration and expiration in the modality of ventilation which precedes the trial and during
      the SBT.

      Vital parameters will be monitored during the study. Mechanical ventilation length, incidence
      of tracheostomies, ICU and hospital recovery duration and hospital mortality will also be
      acquired.
