      at risk for falling out of clinical care. Social capital, which refers to the resources in a
      person's social network, has been shown to be beneficial for people living with HIV in other
      places. The study wants to understand and build upon social capital in the YBMSM population
      in Atlanta, with the goal of ultimately improving HIV-related outcomes for these youth.

      To achieve this study is conducted in 3 phases. In Phase I, study will conduct interviews
      with YBMSM and community leaders to get advice about developing a social capital intervention
      that will improve social capital. Phase II is a randomized controlled trial of groups of
      YBMSM implementing the social capital intervention versus groups of YBMSM receiving a general
      health promotion intervention (Health for Life; H4L). This is followed by Phase III which is
      mainly to measure the social capital and engagement in care with the HIV-positive YBMSM at 3
      and 9 month timepoints.

      The study plan to enroll 180 total participants (120 in the randomized controlled trial and
      60 in preliminary interviews) over the four year study period.
