      pulse variability index are the recent parameters to evaluate the tissue microcirculatory
      condition. This study is aimed to assess the effects of intravenously administered three
      fluid types on perfusion index and pulse variability index in patients during preoperative
      period. Patients will be taken to recovery room in the operating theatre and wait for 15
      minutes to balance the skin temperature of the patients to the environment. Patients will be
      randomly divided into three groups using closed envelope technique as Group L (received 500
      ml of Ringer's lactate), Group S (500 ml of saline) and Group H (received 500 ml of 6%
      hydroxyethylstarch). Baseline, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th min non-invasive blood
      pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, room temperature, perfusion index and pulse
      variability index will be measured and recorded.
