      male and female adults, 18 to 30 years of age, will be enrolled into the trial. Subjects will
      be randomized to one of three treatment allocations: 32 subjects to 7.5 mcg/dose vaccine (low
      dose), 32 subjects to 15 mcg/dose vaccine (high dose) and 12 subjects to placebo. This sample
      size was selected to enable at least 30 evaluable subjects in each of the groups receiving
      active vaccine. The study will utilize a "block randomization" to assure a balance of 8:8:3
      vaccine and placebo when all subjects are enrolled. The study will be double blinded, meaning
      the study subjects, investigators, and the sponsor will be unaware of the treatment allocated
      to each subject until the clinical trial database is declared final and locked.

      Since this is a first-in-human study, all injections of study product will be sequential and
      staggered and there will be a safety evaluation between a sentinel cohort of 19 subjects and
      the remaining 57 study subjects for both the 1st and 2nd doses in the study.

      A sentinel group of 19 participants' enrollment and vaccination will precede the remainder of
      the study group by approximately 2-3 weeks.

      Product administration for both injections of vaccine or placebo will be sequential and
      staggered.
