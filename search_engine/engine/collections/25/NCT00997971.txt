      4 visits are forecasted in pediatric surgeries: V1(inclusion), V2 (2 months), V3 (4 months)
      and V4 (6 months). The last visit corresponds to the beginning of the food diversification
      decided by the pediatrician. Ideally it takes place at 6 months. If the food diversification
      starts at 4 months, then V3 and V4 constitute the same last visit.
