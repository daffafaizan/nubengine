      instability and mortality, all patients with a recently diagnosed pulmonary embolism are
      treated in hospital. The clinical course of most patients is without complications. In
      practice most of the patients are only waiting in hospital in a good, clinical stable
      condition until their INR range is stable.

      This prospective management study is to investigate the safety of treatment of pulmonary
      embolism in an outpatient setting based on normal pro-BNP levels (< 500 pg/ml). The incidence
      of complications due to the pulmonary embolism or its treatment will be followed during the
      first ten days of treatment.
