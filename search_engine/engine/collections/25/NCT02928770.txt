      (diagnostic) sleep study without wearing the device. Subjects are then fitted with the device
      and then subjects wear the device for at least 7 nights during their sleep while at home.
      Subjects then return for a repeat in-laboratory sleep study while wearing the device. The
      primary outcome is to assess the effectiveness of the device by change in the apnea-hypopnea
      index (number of sleep-related abnormal breathing events per hour of sleep) while wearing the
      device compared to baseline.
