      discharge in various clinical scenario. In this particular study, the investigators focus on
      challenging the contemporary Norwegian practice where every body stays over night.

      Only patients with stable angina pectoris will be included in the study. After informed
      consent and successful procedure, the patients will be randomised to same day discharge or
      standard care. Same day discharge patients will be contacted by telephone the day after the
      procedure for follow-up conversation with particular emphasis on access site complications.

      Both groups will receive quality of life questionnaire within a month for assessment of
      difference between the two strategies.
