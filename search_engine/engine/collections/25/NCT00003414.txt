      the relapse rate for lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease after autologous bone marrow
      transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Stem cells are harvested and cryopreserved. All patients
      receive busulfan/cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine/total body irradiation as a preparative
      regimen. Arm I: Patients randomized to the graft versus host disease (GVHD) induction arm
      receive oral cyclosporine twice a day beginning on day 0 and continuing for at least 28 days,
      followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion. At the time the white blood cell
      count begins to recover, subcutaneous interferon gamma is administered for 10 doses, followed
      2 days later by subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 18 doses. Arm II: Patients do not
      receive autologous GVHD therapy after the PBSC transplant. Both arms should receive radiation
      to the site of lymphoma after recovering from the stem cell transplantation. Patients are
      followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years posttransplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
