      neurodevelopment disorders, and these impairments often impact the individual's ability to
      engage in organized physical activity programs (OPA). While many studies have identified
      dance and creative movement to be retrospectively and anecdotally therapeutic, there remains
      a paucity of literature regarding outcomes associated with these programs, and specifically,
      their impact on (1) perceived and objective gross and fine motor skills, (2) perceived
      ability to succeed in related or divergent goals or tasks, (3) quality of life for affected
      individuals and their caregivers, (4) Adaptive function and socialization, (5) social
      communication.

      This study explores the impact of organized dance and creative movement classes on children
      with neurodevelopmental disorders (ages 4-17) and their caregivers. Participants will
      complete a set of surveys and assessments designed to measure the above metrics (labeled 1,
      2,3, 4, 5) at their first study visit. This initial assessment is expected to take place
      within two weeks prior to beginning the intervention (either a wait period or a series of
      1-hour dance classes, which children will attend weekly for 10 weeks). The second and final
      study visit will consist of a similar set of surveys and assessments designed to measure the
      same metrics within the two weeks following completion of the dance class series.
      Participants who have completed the wait period at this point will then begin their set of 10
      weekly dance classes.
