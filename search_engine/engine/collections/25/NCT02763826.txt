      that can modulate cortical excitability of targeted brain regions. Various studies have
      investigated tDCS use in stroke patients with motor impairments (cumulatively about 200
      cases). Although these studies are mostly "proof of concept" with small sample size, they do
      suggest that tDCS may improve motor function. However these two questions have not been
      addressed systematically:

        1. What is the optimal current for stroke patients?

        2. What is the optimal tDCS electrode montage for stimulation?

      This proposal lays the scientific foundation for systematic application of tDCS in stroke
      recovery research by progressively increasing tDCS currents and montages that are both safe
      and efficacious in population with stroke.
