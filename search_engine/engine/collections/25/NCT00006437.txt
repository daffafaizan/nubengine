      prolonged time to heal, does not heal, or recurs" (Wysocki, 1996). Venous leg ulcers,
      pressure sores, ischemic ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers are examples of chronic wounds.
      These kinds of wounds affect over 4 million Americans each year and cost over $9 billion to
      treat. The pathophysiology of these wounds is not well understood and therapies directed at
      healing these wounds are not always successful for unknown reasons. To better understand the
      pathophysiology of these wounds we propose to collect blood by venipuncture from healthy
      volunteers. Blood will be used to prepare blood and plasma derived serum for use in an in
      vitro wound healing model and Boyden chamber assays to study cell migration, adhesion,
      genetic expression, expression of cell surface receptors, and protein expression to construct
      a profile of various healing processes. This baseline data will be used for studying the
      effect of acute and chronic wound fluids on cell migration, adhesion, genetic expression,
      expression of cell surface receptor and protein expression in an in vitro wound model
      (protocols to be submitted for each patient population).
