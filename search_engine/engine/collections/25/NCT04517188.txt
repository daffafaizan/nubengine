      volunteers hospitalized with COVID-19. Baseline nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed on all
      individuals. Halodine Nasal Antiseptic will then be applied to the anterior nares. Serial
      nasopharyngeal samples will then be collected at specified time points after the application.
      All samples will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assay.
