      training program, Strong People Strength Training, on cardiometabolic risk factors in a
      pragmatic, community-based randomized intervention trial among rural men and women 50 and
      older. We hypothesize that individuals randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate
      statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk
      factors as well as physical function, quality of life, and physical activity compared to
      those randomized to the delayed intervention control group.
