    
      This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which
      approximately 310 participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who
      have failed, or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy, were to be randomized (1:1) to
      one of the following treatment groups:

        -  Treatment A (N = 155): Capecitabine + ruxolitinib

        -  Treatment B (N = 155): Capecitabine + placebo

      Treatment consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was self-administered for the
      first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered daily for each
      cycle. Treatment for all participants continued as long as the regimen was tolerated, and the
      participant did not meet discontinuation criteria. Participants who discontinued study
      treatment before study termination were monitored for safety up to 30-35 days from the end of
      treatment. All participants were followed for survival until study termination or the safety
      follow-up visit.
