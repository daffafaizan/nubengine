      students choose less often surgery for their career. To elaborate burnout prevention
      programs, the assessment of the prevalence of burnout during the early career stage of the
      surgeons and associated risk factors, becomes central.

      Residents from the University of Bologna were asked to participate in an anonymous online
      survey. The residents completed a set of questions regarding their training schedule and
      three standardized questionnaires: 1) the Maslach Burnout Inventory, assessing the three
      dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal
      accomplishment (PA); 2) the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale; 3) the Psychosomatic Problems
      scale. High scores in either the EE or DP subscale categories predicted professional burnout.
