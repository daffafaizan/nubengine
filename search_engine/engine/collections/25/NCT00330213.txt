      mortality. Cardioprotective effects of red wine may be partly related to its ability to
      improve endothelial function. Red wine increases endothelium-dependent flow-mediated
      dilatation of the brachial artery acutely after ingestion. Moreover, a heavy dose of red wine
      (ethanol 1.0 g/kg) has been shown to increase coronary flow reserve (CFR) as measured with
      transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. CFR depicts the relative increase of coronary blood
      flow in response to maximal myocardial hyperemia induced by adenosine. It is reduced in
      atherosclerosis and various conditions associated with the dysfunction of coronary
      microcirculation, such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.

      Both ethanol and antioxidative polyphenols have been implicated in beneficial endothelial
      effects of red wine. However, their relative contributions remain uncertain in vivo. It has
      been suggested that red wine has stronger vasoactive properties than other alcohol beverages,
      and even de-alcoholized red wine may be sufficient to improve flow-mediated dilatation of the
      brachial artery. Cognac is also known to contain polyphenols, but its effects on coronary
      circulation have not been evaluated.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled cross-over study was to determine with
      transthoracic echocardiography whether moderate doses of red wine improve CFR in response to
      adenosine in healthy humans. We also studied contributions of ethanol and antioxidants by
      comparing the effects of equal doses of alcoholic and de-alcoholized red wine, and cognac on
      the plasma antioxidant capacity and CFR.
