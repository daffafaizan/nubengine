    
      Thirty-eight patients will be randomized to a (4 times/day; 30 min/session) for 5-day program
      of TENS (n = 20) or to placebo-TENS (P-TENS, n = 18) applied on cervical region (C7-T4).
      Acute sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor test (CPT), Maximal voluntary contraction
      (MVC), Femoral blood flow (FBF) and femoral vascular conductance (FVC) will be measured as
      primary outcome pre and post-CABG, even as the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), Inspiratory and
      expiratory muscle strength (PImax and PEmax) and Î²-endorphin as a secondary clinical
      parameters. In addition, amount of opioid analgesic and pain intensity also will be measured
      throughout at first 24 hours after CABG (immediately, 6, 12 and 24 hours).
