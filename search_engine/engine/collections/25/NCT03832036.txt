      from the Region of Southern Denmark and Capital Region. Participants will undergo MRI
      scanning of the lumbar spine, fillout a questionnaire and undergo assessment with the two
      clinical tests. An 8-week follow-up will be made with patients completing a questionnaire.
      The two quantitative clinical tests include: electromyographic measurements using Paraspinal
      Mapping and pain responses using Quantitative Sensory Pain Testing.
