      offers a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than conventional culture methods in
      the identification of UTI pathogens as determined by a previous prospective comparison study.
      This is a retrospective record review comparing PCR and culture-based assessments for UTI in
      patients receiving Botox injection to treat overactive bladder (OAB). Investigators aim to
      determine whether M-PCR/P-AST can be utilized as a screening method for UTI in these patients
      and whether whether antibiotic prophylaxis, peri-procedural antibiotics, and post-injection
      antibiotic therapy based on patients' pre-procedural M-PCR/P-AST results in improved response
      to Botox injection compared to standard of care. The attributes and advantages of PCR testing
      over the use of traditional urine cultures, and the potential identification of polymicrobial
      infections with complicated resistance sharing mechanisms, may significantly improve patient
      care.
