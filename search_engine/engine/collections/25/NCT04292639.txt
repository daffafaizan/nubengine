    
      Purpose of Clinical Investigation Respiratory Rate is an important physiological measurement
      in the healthcare setting. End Tidal Carbon Dioxide (EtCO2) is considered to be the highest
      level of safety and accuracy in Respiratory Rate monitoring by the American Society of
      Anesthesiology and the American Association of Respiratory Care.

      The purpose of this study was to conduct a Respiratory Rate accuracy validation comparing the
      Vital Detect to an FDA cleared End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor Reference Standard (GE
      Datex-Ohmeda).
