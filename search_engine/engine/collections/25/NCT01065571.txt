      patients will be adults, who have been in remission for at least one month. They will have
      previously required corticosteroids to induce remission. Subjects will be instructed in a
      no-carrageenan diet and required to follow this diet for the duration of their participation
      in the clinical study. They will be randomized to receive either placebo capsules or capsules
      containing carrageenan 100 mg. In this way, the study will be a double blind study of
      no-carrageenan vs. carrageenan. Main study outcome is the interval to relapse. Since
      ulcerative colitis is associated with relapses, relapse is anticipated. Other outcome
      measures will include scores on questionnaires, including the SSCAI and the SIDBQ, and
      laboratory measurements of inflammation.

      Subjects will participate for one year or until relapse, with study visits every three months
      and telephone contacts every two weeks. After three months, participants will increase to two
      capsules daily, of either placebo or carrageenan.
