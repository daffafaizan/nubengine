      and adults. The promotion of PA is also a key element in the treatment of obesity, along with
      changing eating habits, but usually has very low levels of adherence. Active video games may
      be an alternative for the promotion of PA in the treatment of obesity.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of a physical exercise Web-based
      program with or without support on Body Composition, Physical Fitness and Blood Pressure
      values.
