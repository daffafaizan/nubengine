      retina which can cause lose in visual acuity. Some studies have shown that traditional laser
      treatment (TLT) is effective on CSC, although accompanied with side-effects, such as scar.
      Recent retrospective studies suggest micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be effective
      without obvious complications in this disease. But to date, there is no study on
      effectiveness of CSC between TLT and MPL.

      The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser
      versus traditional laser treatment in central serous chorioretinopathy. It is a
      noninferiority study. The investigators hypothesize that application of 577nm micropulse
      laser in patients with CSC will prompt resolution of CSC as measured by ocular coherence
      tomography and best corrected visual acuity.This will be a pilot study to establish sound
      methods and provide some insights to the safety and efficacy of CSC treatment. The primary
      outcome measures is the change of BCVA in 12 week.
