      After parent-child dyads complete screening and informed consent/assent procedures,
      participants will be invited to complete an online baseline assessment. Following the
      baseline assessment, dyads will be randomized to receive either the FLARE intervention or
      standard education. After randomization, each dyad will receive a unique log-in to a secure
      study website that will be used to review didactic materials prior to each intervention
      session.

      Intervention Sessions

      Dyads will meet with an interventionist via remotely-delivered live session for their three
      intervention sessions. Intervention sessions will be scheduled every two weeks. After
      completion of the last remotely-delivered session, all parents will receive quarterly booster
      messages via text or email.

      Study Assessments

      Dyads will be asked to complete online assessments after consent is given (baseline) and
      within the 4 days prior to Session 3. A first post-intervention assessment will occur 4 weeks
      after the last intervention session is held. A second post-intervention assessment will occur
      4 weeks later. The long-term follow-up assessment will take place 1-year post-baseline. Each
      assessment is expected to take 15-30 minutes. Parents will also receive a brief assessment
      via text or email (depending on parent preference) at monthly intervals between the second
      post-assessment and the 1-year post-baseline assessment, and in the summer months immediately
      following the 1-year post-baseline assessment. All assessments will be completed
      electronically.
