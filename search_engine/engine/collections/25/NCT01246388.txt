      standard to date. Unfortunately, being an invasive diagnostic method, liver biopsy has a
      significant morbidity. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, sampling error (over- or
      underestimating severity of liver disease) is a serious problem in diagnostic of chronic
      liver disease.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate non-invasive diagnostic methods (MRI,
      elastography, ultrasound and serum parameters) in comparison to the gold standard to
      establish criteria for diagnostic in liver disease and reduce the necessary amount of liver
      biopsies in the future and allow regular follow up.
