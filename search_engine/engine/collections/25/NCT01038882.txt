      A randomized, prospective study has been carried out; double blind and controlled with
      placebo to be treated with midazolam. This included 152 patients, randomized into two groups:
      Group A - 79(51.9%) patients which received midazolam before the FB, and Group B - (49.1%)
      patients which received placebo. The patients were given a questionaire of 13 questions about
      different aspects of perception of the procedure after the respiratory endoscopy and another
      was given to the Bronchoscopist.

      RESULTS:

      Both groups started off with a similar assessment of fear and nervousness before the FB.
      Nevertheless, Group A gave a much higher score than Group B referring to variables related to
      symptoms and feeling. The patientsÂ´ cooperation was assessed by the Bronchoscopist in a
      similar way in both groups, although the length of the procedure and difficulty was higher in
      the group treated with placebo (Group B).
