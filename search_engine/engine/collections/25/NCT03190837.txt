      records. Health information will be extracted from medical records for patients followed at
      Duke. Medical records will be requested from treating physicians outside of Duke. The PI,
      (Dr. Kishnani) a recognized expert in Gaucher disease, is a consultant to the treating
      physician of virtually all subjects in this study. Subject health status will be monitored at
      least on an annual basis and as regularly as the medical information is obtained from the
      treating physician. Enrollment in this study will not alter the standard of care treatment
      for patients with Gaucher disease.
