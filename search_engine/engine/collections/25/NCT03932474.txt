      person's thoughts, behaviour, tendencies, feelings, and sense of well-being.

      Several literature findings suggest that an oral combination of the two food supplements SAMe
      (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) and probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum might be favourable in
      relieving some of symptoms of depression, particularly in the mild to moderate forms of this
      condition. This double blind placebo controlled clinical study aims to evaluate this
      hypothesis. In particular, the primary objective is to assess, versus placebo, the efficacy
      of SAMEUp in improving the overall symptomology of depression after 6 weeks of treatment.
      Subjects with mild to moderate depression were identified according to ICD-10 diagnostic
      criteria and confirmed by mean of Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale.

      SAMEUp, the investigational food supplement, is an oral formulation (tablet) containing
      S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) 200 mg and Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9 1x109 CFU, already
      notified to the Ministry of Health as food supplement.

      Placebo is an oral formulation of inert tablet. Placebo and SAMEUp are indistinguishable.
