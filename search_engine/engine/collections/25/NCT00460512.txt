      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) 6-month
      study. Participants can be transitioned to an effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral
      antipsychotic medication due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of
      compliance or other reason. A transition period of maximum 4 weeks will be allowed.
      Throughout the study, participants will receive flexible dose of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) of
      paliperidone once daily orally for 6 months. Adjustment of the dosage will be done at
      Investigator's discretion, based on the individual participant's clinical response and
      tolerability of the study drug dosages. Participants who complete this 6-month study and
      would like to continue will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until
      paliperidone ER is available. The starting dose of the extension phase will be the same as at
      the end of the 6-month study and may be changed throughout the extension period. The
      extension phase will consist of a main extension phase (ending with an End of Main Extension
      Phase Visit) and a modified extension phase (ending with an End of Study Visit). Efficacy
      will primarily be evaluated by positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Safety will
      primarily be evaluated by Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).
