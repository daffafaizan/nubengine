      device or hand driven device). A pain questionnaire in the form of a Visual Analogue Scale
      will be used before the treatment to determine a baseline level of pain and after the chosen
      treatment to determine the effect or the intervention on pain experience.

      After a washout period of 6 weeks the participants will crossover to have the opposite
      intervention carried out. A VAS will be filled in before and after the intervention again to
      determine a baseline pain score and pain score associated with the intervention.

      The data will be gathered and entered electronically into a statistical package whereby
      appropriate statistics will be carried out to determine if there is a significant difference
      in pain experienced between the two methods of enamel reduction.

      A secondary aim willl be to determine if there is any correlation with pain experienced and
      age or gender.
