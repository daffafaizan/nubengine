    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the confirmed response rate (>= partial response [PR]) of ixazomib citrate
      (ixazomib), used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with
      previously treated multiple myeloma (MM) with extramedullary disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities associated with ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in patients with previously treated MM with extramedullary disease.

      II. To determine the differential response rates (biochemical versus extramedullary disease)
      with ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously
      treated MM with extramedullary disease.

      III. To determine the progression free survival following treatment with ixazomib in
      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously treated MM with
      extramedullary disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, pomalidomide PO on days
      1-21, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 3
      years.
