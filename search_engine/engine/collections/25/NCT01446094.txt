      angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the profile of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of a novel rapid regadenoson
      stress CMR protocol for detection of >= 70 coronary artery stenosis on invasive coronary
      angiography. Additionally the objective will be to compare the time for performance of this
      novel rapid regadenoson stress CMR protocol in comparison to the standard stress CMR
      protocol.
