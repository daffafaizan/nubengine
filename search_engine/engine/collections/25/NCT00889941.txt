      after wavefront-guided LASIK.

      Methods: Fifty-one patients underwent LASIK for low myopia and completed questionnaires
      regarding specific visual symptoms before and after surgery. Each eye was evaluated
      postoperatively at 1-week, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months. Pupils were stratified according to
      size: small (<5.5mm), medium (5.5 to 6.0mm) and large (>6.0mm). Mesopic pupil size and
      preoperative and postoperative variables were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). A
      regression model was also performed to determine the correlation between mean spherical
      equivalent and cylinder and visual symptoms.
