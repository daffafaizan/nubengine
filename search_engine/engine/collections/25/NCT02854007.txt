    
      Economical evaluation study of the efficiency of Absorb in a cohort of patients with ischemic
      heart disease who have undergone revascularization with Absorb based on the criteria
      established according to standard clinical practice. A comparison group without Absorb cannot
      be used for ethical reasons. Thus, each patient will act as his/her own control, and a
      before-after comparison will be done. This is therefore a prospective, observational cohort
      study with concurrent data collection.

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess utility (QALYs gained) in patients implanted Absorb in standard clinical
           practice conditions.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess effectiveness (clinical outcomes) in patients who undergo coronary
           revascularization with Absorb implantation.

        -  To assess costs (direct and indirect) derived from coronary revascularization with
           Absorb implantation.

        -  To assess efficiency in terms of cost/utility (cost per QALY gained) and
           cost/effectiveness (cost per MACE -major cardiac adverse events- free patient).
