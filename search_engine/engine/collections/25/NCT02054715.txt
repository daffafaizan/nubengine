      I. To determine the effect of intervention assignment on patients' preparedness for decision
      making about clinical trial participation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of intervention assignment on indicators of the quality of
      patients' decision making about clinical trial participation.

      II. To examine mechanisms by which multimedia psychoeducation (MP) exerts its expected
      positive effects on preparedness for decision making.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of intervention assignment on clinical trial participation.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants undergo a print educational intervention during which they meet with a
      site coordinator and are instructed to read the National Cancer Institute (NCI) booklet
      titled Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Studies, comprised primarily of information about the
      nature and conduct of cancer clinical trials.

      ARM II: Participants undergo a multimedia psychoeducational intervention during which they
      meet with a site coordinator and are instructed to view a digital video disk (DVD) and read a
      booklet titled Clinical Trials: Are They Right For You? Participants are encouraged to watch
      the DVD and read the booklet again at home.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-7 and 49-56 days.
