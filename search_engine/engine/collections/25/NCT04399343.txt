      outcomes. However, patients with neurological illness are usually excluded from previous
      researches. Recently, limited studies have shown that the incidence of postoperative delirium
      in neurosurgical patients is approximately 20%, which is comparable to the results in other
      major surgery. Potential associations between postoperative delirium and adverse outcomes
      have also been found in neurosurgical patients. These results indicate that early prevention
      of postoperative delirium should be employed in this population.

      As a highly selective Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine has been investigated
      as a preventive agent for postoperative delirium. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      randomized controlled trials have shown that perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine
      may decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients after either cardiac or
      non-cardiac surgery. However, neurosurgical patients are often excluded in clinical trials of
      postoperative delirium.

      In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial
      with two parallel arms, ICU admitted adult patients after intracranial operation for brain
      tumor will be enrolled. Low-dose dexmedetomidine will be applied during the early
      postoperative phase. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose
      dexmedetomidine for prevention of postoperative delirium in this patient population. The
      primary hypothesis is that, compared to the placebo group, the prophylactic use of low-dose
      dexmedetomidine can decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium without significant
      adverse events in patients after intracranial operation for brain tumor.
