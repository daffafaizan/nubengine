      effectiveness of an integrated clinic-community model of child obesity treatment. The
      investigators will engage four communities in North Carolina, facilitate a local
      clinic-community partnership, support the development of an integrated child obesity
      treatment program, and monitor outcomes. To evaluate implementation feasibility the
      investigators will measure fidelity, reach, acceptability, uptake and cost. To evaluate the
      program model the investigators will conduct a classical program evaluation by monitoring
      aggregate referral, enrollment and attendance data, as well as safety and patient
      satisfaction. To report patient outcomes associated with participation in the integrated
      model, the investigators will measure participant-level outcomes over a 6-month period,
      including changes in nutrition and physical activity behaviors, quality of life,
      cardiovascular fitness, and body mass index.
