    
      qSOFA has been reported as a good tool for risk stratification in the ED for patients with
      infection.

      However, it is not clear whether qSOFA remains stable during the ED stay, nor whether its
      kinetics can have prognostic added value.

      Patients with a qSOFA of at least 2 in the ED, and suspicion of infection will be included.

      After treatment is initiated and fluids challenge performed, we will collect qSOFA value at 1
      hour and 3 hours.

      Our hypothesis is that a decrease in qSOFA between H0 and H3 is associated with better
      outcome. We assume that 50% of patients will have a deltaqSOFA >0, with an overall mortality
      of 23% (according to previous cohort). Under the hypothesis of difference of at least 15% in
      mortality between the two groups (DeltaqSOFA > 0 and Delta qSOFA<=0), with a power of 90% and
      an alpha of 0.05, we need to recruit 322 patients.
