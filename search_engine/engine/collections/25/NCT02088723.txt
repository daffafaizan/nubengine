      apnea-hypopnea index(IAH). In supine position the IAH will increase comparing with lateral
      position during th sleep. However few studies were done with the elevation of the head of the
      bed.

      First the investigators will do a standard polysomnography and see if the patients are
      included analysing the criteria like apnea-hypopnea index equal or more than 5. Within 2
      weeks the patient will do the second polysomnography but this will be with a elevation of the
      head of the bed (15 cm of elevation of the bed doing a inclination). Then the investigators
      will compare the data of apnea-hypopnea index in the standard polysomnography versus the
      index with the elevation of the head of the bed.The main outcome will be to analyze the apnea
      hypopnea index comparing standard polysomnography (sPSG) with elevated polysomnography
      (ePSG).
