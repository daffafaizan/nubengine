      and middle-aged adults. Both patching and atropine are accepted treatment modalities for the
      management of moderate amblyopia in children. Despite best efforts with conventional
      amblyopia treatment, many older children and teenagers with amblyopia fail to achieve normal
      visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. In a previous PEDIG study where children 7 to 12 years
      old were treated with atropine and patching, only 36% of the children with moderate amblyopia
      and only 23% of the children with severe amblyopia achieved 20/40 or better acuity.

      Many clinicians have recognized that conventional therapies with patching and atropine have
      not been universally successful and have sought alternatives. PEDIG has discussed for several
      years the problem of residual amblyopia and how the remaining visual acuity deficit could be
      reduced. A number of research groups have evaluated the short term use of oral
      levodopa-carbidopa as an adjunct to patching therapy for older children.
