      shown that denying firearm purchases by individuals who are at high risk for committing
      violent crimes, thereby restricting their access to firearms, is an effective violence
      prevention strategy. The Armed and Prohibited Persons System (APPS) is a new violence
      prevention initiative undertaken by the California Department of Justice (CalDOJ). APPS is
      used by law enforcement to systematically identify persons who, having legally purchased
      firearms in the past, have become prohibited persons in the present-usually as the result of
      a criminal conviction. Such individuals are at increased risk for future violence.

      APPS uses existing data to identify firearm owners among persons who have become prohibited
      from owning or possessing firearms under California or federal law. CalDOJ then uses this
      information to contact and attempt recovery of firearms in the possession of prohibited
      individuals.

      This controlled prospective longitudinal evaluation of APPS relies principally on data
      collected by CalDOJ in the course of APPS operations or on data in the public domain, such as
      community characteristics published by the U.S. Census Bureau.

      To maximize fairness during the implementation of APPS, approximately 1,000 California
      communities will be stratified by region, population, and violent crime rate and randomized
      into two groups that will be exposed to APPS at different times during the study period.
      Hierarchical analysis will examine outcomes for individuals clustered at the community level.
      The principal analysis will be on an intent to treat basis. A secondary per protocol analysis
      will also be conducted.
