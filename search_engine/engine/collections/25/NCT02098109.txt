      (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02
      filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor. The FDA has determined that Granix is biosimilar to
      Neupogen, which means that they are similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy;
      however, Granix has not been tested in the context of stem cell mobilization to see how its
      effectiveness compares to that of Neupogen
