      to one of two hypothetical genetic testing scenarios (rare, life-altering genetic condition
      or common, life-threatening genetic condition). The genetic testing scenarios include brief
      detailed information about genetic testing (i.e. how results may influence treatment
      decisions) as well as information about standard approaches to treatment. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive a framing conditions (e.g. choice, opt-in, opt-out, enhanced choice).
      Participants will select a preferred testing option to the hypothetical scenario and will
      complete several validated instruments.
