      patients will be treated by DuoStim protocol: The first phase of ovarian stimulation is
      started on the second day or third day of period. GnRH agonist will be used to trigger when
      at least two follicles ≥ 17 mm. Approximately 36 hours later, oocytes will be retrieved
      vaginally under ultrasound monitoring and ICSI will be performed. Five days later after
      oocyte retrieval, the second stimulation will be started. All embryos will be cryopreserved.

      _ In control group, patients will be treated with antagonist protocol: The cycle of ovarian
      stimulation is started on the second day or third day of period. hCG will be used to trigger
      when at least two follicles ≥ 17 mm. Approximately 36 hours later, oocytes will be retrieved
      vaginally under ultrasound monitoring and ICSI will be performed. If serum progesterone on
      the day of trigger ≥ 1.5 ng/ml, all embryos will be cryostored; otherwise, fresh embryos will
      be transferred.
