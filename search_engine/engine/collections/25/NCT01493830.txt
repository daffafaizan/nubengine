        -  To determine the expression of UBE4B, hrs, and members of the ubiquitination protein
           complex in previously banked primary neuroblastoma tumor samples from the Children's
           Oncology Group.

        -  To determine the correlation of expression levels and cellular localization of the UBE4B
           and hrs proteins with growth factor-receptor tumor cell-surface expression.

        -  To determine the 1p36 deletion status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
           analysis and their association with expression levels of UBE4B and hrs in previously
           banked primary neuroblastoma tumor samples from the Children's Oncology Group.

      OUTLINE: Banked tumor tissue samples are analyzed for expression of UBE4B, hrs, members of
      the ubiquitination protein complex, growth factor receptors, and 1p36 deletion status by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent microscopy, and fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH).
