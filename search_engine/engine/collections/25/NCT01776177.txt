      will be collected for any asthma-related event (see evaluation criteria below), omalizumab
      dose, asthma-medications, spirometry, asthma control test (ACT) and any respiratory infection
      and/or antibiotic use since last visit. Data will be analyzed to compare the clinical
      phenotypes and outcome among patients to identify, characterize and define 'responders' and
      'non-responders' to omalizumab. Periodic assessments for demonstrated level of response and
      need for continued therapy will be evaluated quarterly. Also, real-life patient adherence
      data to long-term omalizumab therapy will be analyzed and the factors for withdrawal and
      non-adherence will be identified.

      Reduction in annualized rate of asthma exacerbation, steroid bursts and oral steroid dosage,
      ER/unscheduled doctor's visits, hospitalization and improvement in spirometry and ACT score
      and review of asthma medications will be evaluated quarterly. 'Cluster analysis' will be
      performed by grouping variables (such as age, asthma duration and severity, dosage, therapy
      duration, sensitization profile, IgE levels etc.) in effort to identify groups of responders.
