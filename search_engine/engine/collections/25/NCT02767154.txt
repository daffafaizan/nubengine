    
      This is a prospective, single center, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial.
      Eighty patients are randomized 1:1 to either cardiopulmonary bypass with the dextran-based
      solution or standard priming with Ringer-Acetate and Mannitol.

      Primary endpoint will be oncotic pressure during cardio pulmonary bypass. Secondary endpoints
      include perioperative fluid balance, coagulation, platelet function, postoperative bleeding
      volume, transfusion requirements, renal function, liver function, pulmonary function,
      inflammatory activation and markers for brain and heart injury.

      Blood samples for oncotic pressure measurements will be collected from an arterial line
      before and during surgery. Organ function will be assessed before surgery and 2 hours cardio
      pulmonary bypass.
