    
      -  To compare regional myocardial uptake of FDG on images obtained on a standard PET camera
           with the new PET/MR camera, in patients with coronary artery disease.

        -  To compare viability maps obtained with cardiac MR images and FDG-PET for delineation of
           myocardial infarct core and border zone, in patients with coronary artery disease.

        -  To correlate MRI myocardial strain with relative myocardial FDG uptake in patients with
           a previous myocardial infarction.

        -  To interrogate if simultaneous acquisition of cardiac PET and viability cardiac MR
           differ from acquisitions obtained independently, with special focus on attenuation
           correction methods

        -  To combined MRI scar map with FDG-PET uptake in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and
           myocarditis.

        -  To correlate morphologic characteristics of atherosclerotic disease in the thoracic and
           abdominal aorta with FDG uptake and ferumoxytol enhancement, as a marker of
           inflammation.

        -  To evaluate cardiac strain and myocardial scar burden in obese patients with and without
           diabetes.
