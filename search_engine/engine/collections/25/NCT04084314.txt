      during long-term treatment with erenumab. This 128-week open-label study will provide further
      treatment to patients of the study CAMG334ADE01 (Eudract number:2019-002201-22) and will
      provide data about the long-term safety and tolerability of erenumab and patients' quality of
      life during long-term treatment.

      Besides options to adjust the dose, an optional drug holiday is included in this open-label
      study and the effects of a treatment interruption on safety, tolerability, efficacy and
      quality of life will be investigated.
