      to investigate whether Lexacure is effective in preventing depression and related symptoms at
      3 months after the drug administration.

      Patients with acute stroke (within 21 days after onset) will be enrolled and take the study
      drug 5mg during the first week and then 10mg (from the 2nd week) until 12 weeks.

      The first visit should be performed at 4 weeks after drug administration. Drug safety,
      depression and related symptoms will be evaluated and the following 12-week visit will be
      performed. In the 13th week after the drug administration, the study drug will be reduced to
      10mg every other day for one week, and the schedule of drug administration will be completed.

      At the 14th week, all subjects will be instructed not to take the study drug for assessing
      maintenance effect. At the 24th week, subjects will have follow-up visits to assess
      poststroke depression and related symptoms.

      If a subject discontinues the study before termination for severe depression, aggressive
      intervention will be initiated at the 4th week, and the 12-week visit will be performed
      unless the subject disagrees. If investigators judge the patients have severe depression at
      the 12-week visit, they should be treated. All the patients who need to treat depression will
      be followed until 12th week.
