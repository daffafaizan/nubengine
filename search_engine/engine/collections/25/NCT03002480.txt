      available agents known collectively as bypassing agents, which negatively impacts the
      treating physician's ability to manage these patients, leaving decisions on the dosing
      regimen to trial and error. Both agents, FEIBA and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa),
      are approved for the treatment of bleeding in inhibitor patients with recommended dosing
      regimens that are based on clinical trials. However, a significant amount of "experimenting"
      with other dosing regimens is used by physicians and patients.

      The goal of this project is to demonstrate that TEG is an excellent biomarker for predicting,
      managing and individualizing the treatment with FEIBA and rFVIIa of this rare and difficult
      to treat patient population.
