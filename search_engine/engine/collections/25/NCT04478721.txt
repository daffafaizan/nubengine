      hours, intravenous) to carbapenems (meropenem 1g each 8 hours, intravenous) in terms of
      efficacy and safety in the targeted treatment of bacteraemia due to Enterobacteriaceae
      resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, and therefore provide evidence for the use of
      temocillin in these infections.

      The duration of treatment will be between 7 and 14 days. From the 5th day of intravenous
      treatment, the sequential oral treatment is permitted if the patient meets appropriate
      conditions.
