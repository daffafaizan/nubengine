      study, phase 2 trial of pirfenidone vs. placebo in 200 persons with Chronic Kidney Disease
      (CKD) with an eGFR â‰¥ 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 and a risk of progression to End Stage Renal Disease
      (ESRD) of at least 1% over five years. Participants receive treatment for 12 months, followed
      by a 6 month off-treatment follow-up period. Kidney scarring, also known as fibrosis, is a
      dominant factor in the development of kidney disease. This study will evaluate several tests
      to determine the severity of scarring without requiring kidney biopsies, using MRI imaging
      scans and evaluating markers of scarring that we can measure in the urine. We will use these
      measures to evaluate pirfenidone as a promising potential new treatment for patients with
      CKD.
