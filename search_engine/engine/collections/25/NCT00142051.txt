      oxide (INO) for the treatment of acute vaso-occlusive pain crisis in pediatric patients with
      sickle cell disease. Nitric oxide (NO) deficiency is known to be central to the
      pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion. The aim is unchanged from the original application. The
      study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial with eligible
      patients randomized to receive either NO (with 21% O2 final concentration) for 16 hrs with 8
      hr wean (80 ppm 0-8 hrs, 40 ppm 9-16 hrs, 20 ppm 17-20 hrs, 10 ppm 21-24 hrs) or placebo (21%
      O2 alone) for 24 hrs. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in change in mean
      pain score after 16 hours between patients treated with NO and placebo. The primary outcome
      measure of the study remains the difference in mean change in pain scores between groups as
      assessed using a 10 cm visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures also
      remain the same. The study is a next step to our completed FDA Orphan Product Development
      Grant funded study (FD-R-001686) that evaluated safety and efficacy of NO used for 4 hrs for
      treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.
