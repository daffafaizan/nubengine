      lower limb ipsilesional motor area. The anodal electrode was positioned on the hotspot
      previously identified with TMS. The cathode was placed above the contralesional orbit. The
      pseudo stimulation reproduces during the first and the last 30 seconds of the stimulation,
      tingling feelings due to current flow experienced during tDCS. In this way there is no
      possibility for the patient to recognize the difference between the real and the placebo
      stimulation.
