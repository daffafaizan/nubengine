      in Europe and Canada. All patients will receive the same immunotherapeutic treatment with
      GSK1572932A, but they will be recruited into four cohorts according to the details of their
      disease. Cohort 1: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are due for
      standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will receive chemo-and
      immunotherapy in parallel. Cohort 2: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who
      are due for standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will first
      receive chemotherapy and then immunotherapy.

      Cohort 3: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are not due for
      chemotherapy. These patients will receive immunotherapy only. Cohort 4: Patients with
      unresectable stage III tumors, following standard chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These
      patients will receive immunotherapy only. Immunotherapeutic treatment will comprise eight
      doses of GSK1572932A. Doses will be administered at three-week intervals; in Cohort 1 this
      may be adapted to fit in with the patient's chemotherapy. During the study, adjuvant
      radiotherapy is allowed in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 for patients in stage III only and is
      prohibited in Cohort 4. Chemotherapy during the study is allowed in Cohort 1 only as
      described above, and is prohibited in Cohorts 2-4. The total maximum duration of the study
      for a patient will be 30-35 weeks.
