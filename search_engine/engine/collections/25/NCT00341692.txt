      the feasibility of obtaining samples of normal breast tissue from organ donors and collecting
      risk factor data from next-of-kin. The underlying goal of this initiative is to determine the
      associations between stages of breast development, risk factors for breast cancer, and gene
      expression. The study investigators are members of DCEG, CCR and the Transplant Resource
      Center of Maryland (TRC), a non-profit organization certified by HCFA and the state that
      processes most organ and tissue donations in Maryland. Trained staff or social workers
      employed by TRC who routinely obtain consent for donation from next-of-kin will also obtain
      consent for this study. The existing consent form for organ or tissue donation also includes
      informed consent for donation of tissue for research. Following organ procurement from 20
      volunteers, trained surgical technicians employed by TRC who routinely assist
      intra-operatively, will sterilely remove tissue from each breast quadrant and split the
      samples; one portion will be embedded in OCT and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and the other
      fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Samples of adipose tissue, blood, urine and endometrium (for
      menstrual dating) will also be obtained. MES in conjunction with SMH and BKV will assess the
      samples histopathologically and determine the quantity and quality of macromolecules (RNA,
      DNA, protein) contained within the tissues. Pending demonstration of the feasibility of this
      general approach, we will pursue additional funding for a larger study with optimized
      procedures. We have stopped recruiting patients.
