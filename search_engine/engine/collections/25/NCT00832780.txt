      escalation in treatment regimens for cancer. Several studies have shown a radiation
      dose-response relationship for survival and local control for tumors of the lung, including
      cancer that originates in the lung (such as non-small cell lung cancer) as well as cancer
      that metastasizes to the lung.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and toxicity of SBRT treatment of
      patients with lung tumors. This study will use a dose of 60 gray (Gy) in 5 fractions of 12
      Gy. This provides a biological equivalent dose with alpha/beta ratio of 10 (BED10) of 132 Gy
      with the anticipation of achieving local control without increased toxicity. Previous studies
      have shown that the response rate with SBRT across multiple studies is approximately 50%,
      with an additional 25-40% of patients having stable disease. We hypothesize that this regimen
      will achieve a response rate of 70% with grade 3 toxicity of less than 5%.
