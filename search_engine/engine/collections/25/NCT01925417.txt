    
      This is the first study of a microbiota suspension derived from intestinal microbes. The
      primary assessments for this open label, multi-center study are (i) occurrence of
      product-related adverse events and (ii) resolution of CDAD at 56 days after administration of
      RBX2660. Subjects will also be assessed for time to CDAD recurrence, quality of life changes,
      and number of hospitalizations and length of stay for recurrent CDAD. Study visits will be at
      7, 30, and 60 days after RBX2660 administration with additional follow-up at 3 and 6 months
      post treatment. Patients who have had at least two recurrences of CDAD after a primary
      episode and have completed at least two rounds of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or
      have had at least two episodes of severe CDAD resulting in hospitalization may be eligible
      for the study.
