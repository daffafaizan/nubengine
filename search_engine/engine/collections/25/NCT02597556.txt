    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
      400 mg albendazole treatment against placebo on the incidence of diarrheal disease caused by
      viral and bacterial pathogens in school children in southern Vietnam. Children will be
      enrolled from three primary schools in Cu Chi district in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Children
      will be screened for infections by the four most common soil-transmitted helminths, Ascaris
      lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, and Ancylostoma duodenale. Infected
      and uninfected individuals will be recruited into the study and randomized to either receive
      albendazole treatment once every three months for 12 months, or to placebo once every three
      months for 9 months, after which albendazole treatment will be given at month 12, in
      accordance with the current deworming schedule in Cu Chi district. A questionnaire regarding
      the participant's demographics, his/her daily habits, and potential sources of infection will
      be administered at baseline. Weekly active and passive surveillance of diarrheal cases will
      be conducted throughout the study, and a health questionnaire will be administered during all
      cases of diarrhea and at the end of the study.
