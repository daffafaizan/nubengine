      OSA is still undiagnosed. Maxillofacial profile can influence OSA severity. Morphological
      characteristics can be identified but are not enough measurable and analysable by physicians.
      3D acquisition of maxillofacial characteristics with a user-friendly tool, quick and
      low-priced could be used to obtain a predictive model as an OSA risk indicator. Thus, the aim
      of this study is to establish and evaluate a predictive model to diagnose OSA with
      maxillofacial characteristics 3D acquisition.
