      I. To estimate the efficacy of TRC102 (methoxyamine) and temozolomide, as measured by
      response rate, in bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma. (Arm I) II. To estimate the efficacy of
      TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by response rate, in bevacizumab refractory
      glioblastoma. (Arm II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the toxicities of oral TRC102 and temozolomide in this patient population.

      II. Estimate the efficacy of TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by progression-free
      survival, progression-free survival at 6 months and overall survival, in bevacizumab naïve
      glioblastoma.

      III. Estimate the efficacy of TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by progression-free
      survival in bevacizumab refractory glioblastoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the tissue correlates of N-methylpurine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) glycosylase
      (MPG), topoisomerase II-alpha (topo II a), and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
      status, with response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive methoxyamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.
