      adverse postoperative outcomes regarding all organ functions. However, all evidence is based
      upon conventional care programs and none has been done on fast-track surgery, neither in
      total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      The purpose of this study series is therefore to evaluate the importance of conventional risk
      factors in an optimised fast-track TKA and THA set-up. These studies will be performed in the
      Lundbeck Foundation Center for fast-track THA and TKA, based on an established database, but
      with additional detailed risk information to be included in studies of certain types
      co-morbidity.

      The Lundbeck Foundation Center Database prospectively registers patient characteristics and
      co-morbidity in all patients receiving hip and knee arthroplasty. This is done using a
      questionaire and with dedicated staff available to help in case of doubt regarding specific
      questions. Additional information is collected by scrutinizing the patients medical charts.
      Completeness of data has been shown to be about 95%.
