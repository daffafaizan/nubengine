      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in the Center for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Disorders
      (CANDO) at VAMC in Oklahoma City. Dr. Shea provided the pills (nutriceutical and placebos)
      from the same batches he used in former studies of Alzheimer's disease patients (produced by
      Nutricap Labs, Farmingdale, NY). Pills were dispensed by the OKC VAMC research pharmacist,
      using a random numbering system. The PI completed five cognitive testing sessions, lasting 1
      to 1.5 hours, for each subject during the 12 months of participation in the study. Subject's
      spouse or family member completed 4 questionnaires about the subject's behavioral changes,
      and kept daily records of the times each day when the subject ingested the study pill
      assigned by the pharmacist. All subjects are patients in the VAMC memory loss clinic (CANDO)
      who are monitored by their neurologists (2 co-investigators in this study).
