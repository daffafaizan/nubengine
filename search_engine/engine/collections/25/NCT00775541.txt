      hyperglycemia in diabetes and reflect changes in the cerebral antioxidant defense system.
      Inhibition of cellular uptake of Asc by hyperglycemia further hampers maintaining adequate
      antioxidant capacities. Reduced concentrations of these antioxidants might serve as good
      indicators of increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, impaired cellular uptake or the
      antioxidant, and further, as sensitive in vivo biomarkers to assess early manifestations or
      progression of diabetic complications and the efficacy of the antioxidant therapy in the
      human brain. Specific aims (1) to determine cerebral concentrations of GSH and Asc in the
      living brain of healthy controls and type 2 diabetic patients; (2) to quantify the effect of
      chronic hyperglycemia on cellular uptake of Asc across the blood-brain barrier.
