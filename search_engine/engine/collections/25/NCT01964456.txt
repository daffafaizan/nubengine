    
      Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder, with high level of mortality. Anorexic
      patients often experience a serious disturbance in body and their own shape perception.

      We hypothesize that bodily self-consciousness is co-constituted by four subjective dimensions
      which are all inter-subjectively open: in encountering others, one's body is experienced as

        1. objectified,

        2. the bearer of inter-subjective feelings,

        3. an inter-subjective agent and

        4. the anchor of an inter-subjectively negotiated perspective.

      Across several experiments, we sought to determine which dimension of bodily
      self-consciousness is altered in Anorexia Nervosa compared to healthy subjects.
