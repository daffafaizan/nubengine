    
      A Randomised, Double-Masked Study to Compare The Safety and Efficacy of Bilateral 0.5%, 0.1%
      & 0.01% Atropine Treatment In Controlling Progression of Myopia In Children

      Study Duration and Visit Schedule Total of 5 years with 15 scheduled visits.

        1. Phase I: 2 years with 8 scheduled visits

        2. Phase II: 3 years with 7 scheduled visits

      STUDY DESIGN This study consists of 2 phases, each with a different design. Phase I is a
      double-masked single-centre clinical trial wherein 400 children aged 6-12 years, with myopia
      of -2.00 D or worse in each eye, and from whom assent and parental/guardian consent have been
      obtained, will be randomised to receive 0.5% atropine, 0.1% atropine or 0.01% atropine once
      nightly in both eyes. Participants will be assigned to treatment in the ratio of 2:2:1,
      respectively. Each child will receive treatment for a period of 2 years during which they
      will be reviewed every 4 months.

      Phase II is an open-label study wherein all children will continue to be followed-up
      regularly for changes in their refractive error after stopping atropine treatment. Those
      children who demonstrate myopia progression of -0.5 D or more, at least on one eye after a
      minimum of 8 months washout period will restart atropine treatment in both eyes. The
      appropriate dose will be determined by analysis of the data from Phase I of the study.
      Treatment will be for a further 2 years and all children, including those not receiving
      treatment, will be reviewed every 6 months.
