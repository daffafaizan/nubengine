    
      This study investigate mycophenic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics and their
      impact on the clinical outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. Lupus nephritis patients
      (both active or inactive) will be recruited. MPA levels will be checked at 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12
      hrs after MMF administration by an enzymatic assay upon recruitment, then at 6-months'
      intervals and also when clinically significant events occurred. The MPA levels will be
      correlated with clinical parameters and outcomes. For active patients, the MPA levels will be
      correlated with treatment response (CR or PR) and side effects. For patients in remission,
      the MPA levels will be correlated with drug tolerability and relapse. Pharmacogenomics
      studies will also be carried out and correlated with MPA exposure and clinical outcomes.
