      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Two parallel treatment groups include double-blind
      colesevelam or placebo. A screening period may be up to 18 weeks to withdraw non sulfonylurea
      antidiabetic treatment or withdraw or adjust sulfonylurea antidiabetic treatment. To evaluate
      hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, subjects will undergo a two-step
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a tritiated glucose infusion at pre randomization and
      after 8 weeks of treatment. To evaluate oral glucose absorption, subjects will undergo two
      oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) at pre randomization, one without colesevelam and one
      with colesevelam, and one OGTT at the end of the treatment period..
