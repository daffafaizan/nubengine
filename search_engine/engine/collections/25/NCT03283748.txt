      medical application sensors from Analog Devices will be worn around the wrist and legs of the
      participants. These sensors will continuously collect the motor movement data. The data will
      be send to the cloud from where it will be collected at a central hub for digital signal
      processing and detection. The data analysis results will be compared with the standard EEG
      results for Tonic Clonic seizures and results will be verified.
