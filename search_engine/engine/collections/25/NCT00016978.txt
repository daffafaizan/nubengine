      I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients treated with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin calcium for metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with irinotecan.

      II. Determine the time to tumor progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
      of patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. IV. Assess the
      quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and leucovorin calcium and
      fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a confirmed complete
      response for 2 consecutive courses may discontinue study treatment at the investigators
      discretion. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, approximately every 6-8 weeks during
      treatment, and then after the last course of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 5 years.
