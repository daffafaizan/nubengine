      functional antibodies in the form of increased peptide binding and development of
      neutralizing antibodies. Evaluation of an antigen dose having potentially greater
      immunogenicity is therefore of particular interest.

      Twelve healthy volunteers receive injections of 100 mcg Env 2-3 in MF59 emulsion and two
      volunteers receive MF59 only on days 0, 30, 180, and 365. Follow-up continues for 6 months
      after the last injection.
