      arthritis. The Genetics and Genomics Branch of the Intramural Research Program of NIAMS [now
      the

      Inflammatory Diseases Section of the Intramural Research Program of NHGRI] has joined with

      several extramural centers to form the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium

      (NARAC). The Consortium intends to identify and obtain clinical specimens on a total of 1000

      sibling pairs with rheumatoid arthritis; up to 100 sibling pairs will be recruited at the
      Clinical

      Center. Samples from parents and other family members will also be obtained, where

      appropriate. Rheumatoid factors, HLA-DR typings, and hand films will be obtained on all

      sibling pairs. In addition, DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood or buccal scrapings.
      The

      DNA from all 1000 sibling pairs will be typed for a set of approximately 350 genetic markers
      in

      order to identify chromosomal regions likely to harbor genes conferring susceptibility to

      rheumatoid arthritis. For those chromosomal regions that are positive in this initial screen,

      families will be genotyped for additional markers to define disease-associated haplotypes,
      and high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis will be conducted to narrow
      the regions of interest. Candidate genes will be chosen from the narrowed regions of
      interest, and/or based on functional considerations, and will be screened for mutations in
      rheumatoid arthritis.
