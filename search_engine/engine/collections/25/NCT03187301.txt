      Positive Control study designed to evaluate the QT interval prolongation potential of 10 mg
      to 60 mg doses of APL-130277 compared to placebo and the positive control, 400mg moxifloxacin
      in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience motor fluctuations ("OFF" episodes)
      The patient is titrated to the highest tolerated dose from 10mg to 60mg, and then is
      randomized to one of six crossover sequences. Each sequence includes treatment with the
      following:

        1. Treatment A: APL-130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration Phase,

        2. Treatment B: Matched placebo,

        3. Treatment C: A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin
