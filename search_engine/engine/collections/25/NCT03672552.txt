      long-term care facility. Participants will be randomly assigned into control or intervention
      groups. Both groups will be assessed at study onset for swallowing and oral health and
      continue with agreed upon diet texture and fluid modifications. The intervention group (FFWP
      and improved oral hygiene) will receive a dental hygienist cleaning at onset of the study and
      have supervised tooth brushing before thin water between meals. The control group will
      continue with standard oral care and offered the full dental hygienist cleaning at the end of
      the study. If findings indicate no difference between groups on outcome measures (eg.
      respiratory illness, hydration, nutrition) then the intervention is considered efficacious in
      long-term care residents. If improvements in outcome measures are evident for the treatment
      relative to the control group, then this intervention may provide opportunity for improved
      healthcare and cost-savings.
