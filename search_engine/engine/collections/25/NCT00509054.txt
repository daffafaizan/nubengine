      anterior muscle or to the same procedure with the addition of a prophylactic mesh in a sublay
      position. Randomisation is by opening closed envelopes.

      A low-weight,partly absorbable mesh is used. Patients are followed for 5 years. Clinical
      follow up after one month to register early complications such as wound infection or mesh
      infection.

      Clinical follow up after 12 months to register parastomal herniation, fistula formation,
      stenosis.

      Clinical follow up after 5 years to register parastomal herniation, fistula formation,
      stenosis. At this clinical follow up radiologic examination is added.
