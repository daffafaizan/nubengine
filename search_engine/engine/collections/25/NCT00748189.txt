      especially, but not limited to the ailing and elderly patient population. Several other more
      aggressive treatment options are available (e.g. fludarabine), however they are not suitable
      for all CLL patients, especially the ailing and elderly, due to greater toxicity. Ofatumumab
      is effective with low toxicity. The addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil offers potentially
      a more effective therapy, with limited toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall response and overall survival in subjects with
      previously untreated CLL with ofatumumab added to chlorambucil versus chlorambucil.
