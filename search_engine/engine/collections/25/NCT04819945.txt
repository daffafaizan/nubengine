    
      The GATT-Patch study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter, pre-market, first-in-man
      clinical investigation, that intents to determine the clinical safety and performance of
      GATT-Patch for management of haemorrhage during elective open liver surgery.

      The clinical investigation will be carried out in a maximum of 7 sites in The Netherlands,
      treating an estimated total of 51 participants. All participants will be thoroughly screened
      and if found eligible, treated with GATT-Patch during open liver surgery. Participants will
      be followed for 6 weeks with an additional ultrasound assessment at the 6 week follow up
      visit.

      The participant enrolment period is expected to take approximately 6 months, with a total
      expected duration of the clinical investigation of approximately 8 months.
