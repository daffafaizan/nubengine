      Recruitment Patients were recruited as they seek for treatment in the clinics of Dentistry of
      the local university. No advertisement was made for participant recruitment. Patients were
      recruited in the order in which they reported for the screening session, thus forming a
      sample of convenience.

      Eligibility criteria A total of 183 participants were examined by two calibrated dental
      students to check if they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Sample size calculation The annual retention rate to one-step self-etch adhesives in NCCLs
      was reported to be 4.4% in a recent systematic review. Considering that this decline follow a
      linear trend, the overall retention rate of one-step self-etch adhesives will be
      approximately 78% after 5-year of clinical service. With an of 0.05, a power of 80%, and a
      two-sided test, the minimal sample size will be 41 restorations in each group in order to
      detect a difference of equivalence of 15% among the test groups.

      Interventions A total of 221 restorations were randomly placed in 35 patients assigned in
      four groups to two different etch-and-rinse two-step adhesive PeakÂ® Universal Bond (P)
      (Ultradent Products Ind) and Single Link (SL) (Angelus Dental Products Industry).

      The adhesives systems were applied on the NCCLs follows: P1 - applied according to the
      manufacturer's; P2X - applied for the double time; SL1 and; SL2X. The resin composite
      Amelogen (Ultradent) was placed incrementally. The restorations were evaluated imediataly
      (baseline), 6 and 12 months, using the FDI and USPHS criteria. Statistical analyses were
      performed using appropriate tests (=0.05).
