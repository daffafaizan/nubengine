    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To define the optimal dose and toxicity of PF-04136309 in combination with FOLFIRINOX
      (fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin) in patients
      with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the safety of PF-04136309 and FOLFIRINOX by grade 3 or 4 toxicity for
           clinical use.

        -  To determine the tumor control rate (TCR) as defined by stable disease (SD), partial
           response (PR), and complete response (CR): TCR = SD + PR + CR.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the prevalence and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in
           the bone marrow, peripheral circulation, and tumor before and after treatment with
           PF-04136309 and FOLFIRINOX.

        -  To determine the prevalence and function of MDSC in the bone marrow, peripheral
           circulation, and tumor before and after treatment with FOLFIRINOX.
