    
      Targeted therapy in this study can be either off label-use of a U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved drug or a clinical trial that includes investigational drugs.
      Matched targeted therapy outcomes will be compared to the outcomes of patients who were not
      matched to a treatment.

      In order to find a matched treatment, a patient's sample will undergo a test known as a "gene
      chip algorithm." This is will be done by having a sample of a patient's tumor analyzed at a
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) laboratory that specializes in molecular profiling.
      Molecular profiling is a process used to study a tumor's genetic characteristics. DNA will be
      taken from the tumor sample and will be screened for "actionable genes." These genes are
      called actionable because mutations (structural changes) in these genes have FDA-approved
      matched therapies or are eligible for current clinical studies.
