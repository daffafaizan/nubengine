      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) might have positive effects in enhancing
      cognition and improving clinical symptoms in patients with depression. This study will
      investigate the effect of rTMS on cognition and long-term outcomes (12 month) of bipolar
      patients.
