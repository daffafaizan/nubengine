    
      A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentre study (Toronto General Hospital and
      Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Canada.) The investigators are planning to replace
      the standard intravenous opioid analgesia with a continuous paravertebral block using local
      anesthetic after trans-apical aortic valve replacement.

      Anesthesia management will be standardized to minimize any impact that anesthetic type may
      have on neurological outcomes.

      Metrics to evaluate outcomes: Assessment of delirium will be performed utilizing the CAM-ICU
      preoperatively (baseline) and postoperatively every 12 hours or as needed according to the
      patient's condition during the first 7 postoperative days or until discharge.

      The CAM recognizes both, hyperactive and hypoactive, forms of delirium. It includes four-step
      algorithm and assesses 1) an acute onset of changes or fluctuations in the course of mental
      status, 2) inattention, 3) disorganized thinking and 4) an altered level of consciousness.
      The patient is determined to be delirious (CAM positive) if he/she manifests both features 1
      and 2, plus either feature 3 or 4.

      Primary screening for delirium will be performed by the nursing staff. Diagnose of delirium
      will be confirmed by the psychiatry consult. Assessment of Sedation and Pain: Standardized
      according to institutional guidelines.

      Cost Calculations: The total cost (summation of direct-variable, direct-fixed, and overhead
      costs) for each patient will be determined for both study groups.
