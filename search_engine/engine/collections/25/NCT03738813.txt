      with hands-on physiotherapy, in the reeducation of upper arm in the patient affected by
      stroke from cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage that had occurred â‰¤ 30 days before.

      The principle purpose of this study will be to evaluate:

        1. The feasibility of this new device

        2. Efficacy in improving arm function abilities in the rehabilitation of patients with
           stroke in the sub-acute phase.

      Post-stroke patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to the Neurological Rehabilitation
      will be screened for enrolment and randomized in a controlled trial.

      All the patients will be informed about the aim and experimental procedures before enrolment,
      thus written informed consent will be obtained from all of them. Patients included in the
      study will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group according to simple
      randomization technique (computerized random numbers).
