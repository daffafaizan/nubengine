      While a very effective anti-cancer treatment, ADT is associated with significant toxicity
      including but not limited to major metabolic disturbances including impaired glucose
      tolerance, insulin resistance, and weight gain. We hypothesize that limiting carbohydrates
      within the diet will prevent or at least minimize these consequences.
