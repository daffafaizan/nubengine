      heart failure in patients with dyspnea of unknown etiology presenting to the emergency room
      and admitted to the medical wards.

      Patients will be consented and randomized to open or blinded NT-proBNP test performed within
      90 minutes in a venous blood sample.

      Evaluation of the ER diagnosis and final discharge diagnosis in admitted patients will be
      carried out in light of the NT-proBNP results.
