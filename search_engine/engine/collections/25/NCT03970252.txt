    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate development of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula in the post-operative
      period after neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab and fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride,
      leucovorin calcium and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) (FFX).

      II. To evaluate pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant nivolumab and FOLFIRINOX
      (FFX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate early efficacy measured by percent change of CA 19-9 response rate, R0
      resection rate, overall response rate (ORR) and disease free survival (DFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES, OTHER ASSESSMENTS:

      I. To determine degree of changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of nivolumab and
      modified (m) FFX on cell proliferation and apoptosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      fluorouracil IV over 10 minutes and over 46 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90-120
      minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 120 minutes, and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days
      1 and 15. Treatments repeat every 28 days for 3-6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-4 weeks after treatment, patients with
      resectable disease undergo surgery. Within 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients with successful
      resection may receive 6 additional cycles of fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride,
      leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.
