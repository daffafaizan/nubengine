      cardiovascular pathology which may impact outcomes, no study has evaluated it's perioperative
      use in pulmonary endarterectomy surgery.

      Most pulmonary endarterectomy patients suffer from severe pulmonary hypertension, right heart
      dysfunction and central venous hypertension. Postoperative complications are closely related
      to the importance of residual postoperative pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular
      dysfunction. A portal vein pulsatility fraction of 50% or more in the perioperative setting
      might indicate right ventricular dysfunction and/or hypervolemia-related severe venous
      congestion, which may be responsible for multiple organ dysfunction and significant morbidity
      or mortality in critically ill patients.

      The investigators believe pulmonary endarterectomy patients with a high portal vein
      pulsatility fraction immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass have a greater
      risk of developing postoperative persistent organ dysfunction and/or death. In this
      prospective descriptive study, the investigators will evaluate portal vein pulsatility as a
      predictor of the composite outcome of persistent organ dysfunction plus death 7 days after
      pulmonary endarterectomy.

      Left and right global longitudinal strain after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass will also
      be evaluated as potential indicators of a higher risk of persistent organ dysfunction plus
      death 7 days after surgery.
