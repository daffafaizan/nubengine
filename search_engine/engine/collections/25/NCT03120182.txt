      significantly higher prevalence among patients older than 65 (69%) versus younger (31%)
      explains why 41% of the patients are taking blood thinners. Antiplatelet therapy in patients
      with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) presents significant neurosurgical challenges. Studies
      investigating the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in cranial neurosurgery are sparse and
      mostly based on case reports. Given the lack of guidelines regarding perioperative management
      with antiplatelet therapy, it is difficult to balance the patient's increased cardiovascular
      risk and prevalence of cSDH. The aim of our randomized, blinded, placebo controlled clinical
      study is to compare the peri- and postoperative bleeding and cardiovascular complication
      rates of patients undergoing burr-hole trepanation for cSDH with and without discontinuation
      of low-dose ASA. We will include patients receiving low-dose ASA as secondary prophylaxis for
      various reasons (e.g. coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, etc.) and will
      randomize them either to a Placebo- or Aspirin-arm. The patients will receive placebo or ASA
      for 12 days whereas the normal ASA treatment will be resumed 12 days after randomization. Our
      study primarily seeks to evaluate the risk of recurrence after burr-hole trepanation for cSDH
      under low-dose ASA treatment compared to placebo treatment. Secondary objectives are to
      assess the rate of thrombotic events, perioperative blood loss, postoperative anemia, intra-
      and postoperative blood transfusion rate, and clinical outcome (mRS, GOS, Markwalder score).
      The study will be performed in cooperation with the Department of Cardiology of the
      University Hospital of Basel.
