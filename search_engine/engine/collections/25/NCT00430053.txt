      Primary

        -  Follow the disease course of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

        -  Provide a patient population for study by proteomic and molecular analysis.

        -  Develop a mechanism for screening by a Tumor Board for enrollment of patients in
           therapeutic clinical trials.

      Secondary

        -  Develop a tissue bank for future disease study using specimens from these patients.

        -  Provide community outreach by offering a second opinion regarding treatment of this
           disease in these patients and, in limited cases, provide standard-of-care treatment to
           these patients.

        -  Develop an algorithm for screening and evaluating this disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo disease assessment by physical examination, full-body photographic
      documentation of skin disease, biopsy, and blood sampling at baseline and then at least
      annually thereafter. Proteomic and molecular methods are used to analyze samples. Biopsies
      may be examined using histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Blood may be analyzed by
      polymerase chain reaction for clonal T-cell gene rearrangements or by flow cytometry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
