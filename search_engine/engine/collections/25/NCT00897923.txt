        -  Determine the number of indium In 111-labeled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
           and indium In 111-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) trafficking into lymphoma
           tumors prior to therapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Compare the number of PBMC and PMNL trafficking prior to vs after therapy in these
           patients.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, the number of in vivo baseline (i.e., pre-therapy) trafficking
           of PBMCs vs PMNLs in these patients.

        -  Gather important data regarding the inter- and intra-patient variability of effector
           cell trafficking into these tumors.

        -  Assess the relationship between response at 8-12 weeks and the magnitude of baseline
           effector cell trafficking or the magnitude of post-rituximab effector cell trafficking
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive autologous indium In 111 (^111In)-labeled peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells on day 0.

        -  Group II: Patients receive autologous ^111In-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes on day
           0.

      In both groups, patients undergo blood collection on day 0. Patients then undergo full-body
      single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) scan 4 hours after cell infusion and on
      day 2. The labeling and imaging process may be repeated after at least 1 course of anticancer
      treatment.

      Cellular uptake is measured by reader/visual interpretation, a semiquantitative grading
      system, and tumor-to-background uptake ratios.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
