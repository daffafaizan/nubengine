    
      Subjects meeting study criteria will be enrolled into one of two study cohorts: a) outpatient
      individuals with current, moderate-to-severe major depressive episode (experimental group)
      and b) individuals without current major depressive episode that have been matched at the
      group level for age and gender (control group).

      All subjects will undergo two separate psychiatric interviews to confirm current depression
      episode presence or absence. Thereafter subjects will wear a heart rate monitor on the chest
      to capture data over the course of 72 hours. Subjects will return approximately 1 week after
      initial placement of the monitor for equipment return and a safety check. Subjects will wear
      a heart-rate monitor over the course of 72 hours. Subjects will return within a week from the
      last visit for equipment return.
