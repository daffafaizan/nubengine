      cases per million and with over 600 new cases in the United States each year. A major
      challenge in treating acquired SAA is the management of patients who are refractory to
      immunosuppressant therapy (IST) or have relapsed after IST. HSCT is the only curative option
      for these patients but many are ineligible because they lack a suitable donor. The Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) seeks to increase options for these
      patients by using novel therapeutic strategies of GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy to expand the
      donor pool to include haploidentical donors. The goal of this protocol is to test whether
      optimized approaches using haploidentical donors will achieve acceptable outcomes in SAA
      patients.
