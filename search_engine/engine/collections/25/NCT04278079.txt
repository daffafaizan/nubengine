      the standard of care for patients with myopic traction. A variety of findings are seen by
      Optical Coherence Tomography. Epiretinal membranes, retinoschisis, lamellar macular holes,
      and full thickness macular holes are seen. Undergoing vitrectomy, with or without tamponade,
      in our center, is retrospectively evaluated. Visual acuity change, as well as improvement of
      the retinal structure by OCT will be examined.
