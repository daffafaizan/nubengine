      (SBRT : no SBRT), with all patients continuing to receive background treatment with TKI
      therapy as clinically indicated and as per standard care. Patients randomised to receive SBRT
      will receive a dose and fractionation schedule dependent on OPD lesion site and proximity to
      critical normal tissues. All patients will be seen 8 weeks post randomisation, then 3 monthly
      in line with routine care.

      HALT aims to assess whether in patients with mutation positive advanced NSCLC the use of SBRT
      to â‰¤ 3 sites of OPD with continuation of TKI improves progression-free survival (PFS)
      compared with continuation of TKI alone.
