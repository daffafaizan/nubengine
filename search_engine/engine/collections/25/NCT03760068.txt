    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group phase 3 study in subjects with
      T1DM comparing the safety and efficacy of MYL-1601D with NovoLog速.

      After up to 3-week screening period, all subjects will be titrated on NovoLog速 during a
      4-week run-in period, and will be shifted from their current basal insulin to study insulin
      Lantus速. After run-in period, subjects will be randomized; one group will receive MYL-1601D,
      while the other group will receive NovoLog速 for 24 weeks. A follow-up visit, via telephone
      call, will be scheduled 4 weeks after last dose of MYL-1601D.
