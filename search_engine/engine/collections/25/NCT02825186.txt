    
      This is a randomized prospective study that will involve 100 patients (males and females)
      undergoing strabismus surgery. All patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      study drugs (Loteprendol etabonate 0.5% (Lotemax) drops or Dexamethasone 0.1% (Sterodex)
      drops) after undergoing strabismus surgery. In addition to the study drug all patients (in
      both groups) will receive topical Ofloxacin 0.3% (Oflox) eye drops. All patients will undergo
      a complete ophthalmological evaluation before surgery including orthoptic assessment of their
      strabismus and measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP). Topical treatment with the study
      drug and topical Ofloxacin 0.3% (Oflox) eye drops will begin on the evening of the surgery,
      following a schedule that will be the same for both groups: 4 times daily during the first
      week, 3 times daily for the second group, twice daily for the third week, and as needed for
      the fourth week. All patients will be examined at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after
      surgery by a masked investigator (not the strabismus surgeon).

      The parameters to be checked will include:

        1. Patient pain and discomfort

        2. Conjunctival chemosis

        3. Conjunctival hyperaemia

        4. Conjunctival discharge

        5. Conjunctival gap

        6. Intraocular pressure (IOP)

        7. Number of pain control medications taken
