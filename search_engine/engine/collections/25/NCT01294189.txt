      been made (Sprung et al. 2003). On September 1st 2009 the "advance-directives-law" was inured
      in Germany considering a written advance directive of an adult binding for physicians and the
      patientÂ´s surrogate decision makers if it fits into the medical context (BGBL 2009). There is
      a lack of data describing the process and the factors associated with end-of-life-decisions
      in ICUs in Germany in detail.

      The purpose of this observational study is to describe the decision making process as well as
      the practices of end of life care in an ICU of a German university hospital during a period
      when changes of German legislation occurred.
