    
      SORT OUT IX is a randomized, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing
      the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer
      Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent in treating atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions.

      Patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly allocated to treatment groups
      after diagnostic coronary angiography and before percutaneous coronary intervention. Block
      randomization by centre (permuted blocks of random sizes (2/4/6)) will be used to assign
      patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent
      (Biosensors) or the biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent (Biotronik). A web
      based Trial Partner randomization system will be used.
