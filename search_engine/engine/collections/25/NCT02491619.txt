    
      Class III dentofacial deformity is associated with important functional, psychological and
      aesthetic changes and thus individuals affected by this type of deformity are motivated in
      seeking treatment. The sample will consist of three-dimensional images of 40 individuals with
      Class III dentofacial deformities. From these images generated by CBCT scans, the
      buccolingual inclinations of all teeth and maxillo-mandibular alveolar bone thickness in
      three different heights will be measured (3, 6 and 8 mm) from the cementoenamel junction
      through the Dolphin 3DÂ® program. The 3D scans of the sample will be evaluated in two stages:
      the initial stage and after dental decompensation at the end of pre-surgical orthodontic
      phase. Pearson correlation test will be used to verify the relationship between tooth
      inclination and bone thickness. The thickness measurements and buccolingual inclination will
      be compared between treatment times (initial and pre-surgical) using paired Student t-test.
