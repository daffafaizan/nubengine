    
      This study aims to reveal the effect of initial periodontal treatment together with
      bisphosphonate on sclerostin (SOST) and dickkopf-related protein-1 (DKK-1) in gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with osteoporosis.

      Clinical recordings and GCF were obtained from postmenopausal women; with chronic
      periodontitis and those using bisphosphonate (Group A, n=12), with chronic periodontitis and
      otherwise healthy (Group B, n=10), without chronic periodontitis and those using
      bisphosphonate (Group C, n=11), systemically and periodontally healthy controls (Group D,
      n=10) at the baseline.

      GCF sampling were recorded and repeated at the 6th and 12th months in Group A, B and C. SOST
      and DKK-1 values were measured by ELISA.
