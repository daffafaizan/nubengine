    
      In this phase I/II trial, patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma will be
      assigned to receive interventional treatment of irreversible electroporation (IRE).

      IRE will be performed by laparotomy under general anesthesia in the operating room.

      All patients enrolled in the study will have a biopsy at the time of laparotomy. Blood will
      be collected for regular blood tests and correlative studies at baseline and during the
      study. Computed tomography (CT) scans will be done at baseline, 4 weeks post treatment, 12
      weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks follow up. Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be
      completed at baseline and during the study. Patients will be given optional consent for
      storage of any leftover tissue and blood samples for future analysis. Patients will be
      followed up 4 weeks post treatment, then every 12 weeks until death.
