      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of capecitabine
           administered in combination with oxaliplatin and irinotecan in patients with
           unresectable advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, irinotecan IV
           over 1 hour on days 8 and 22, and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-29. Treatment
           repeats every 5 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive capecitabine at the MTD and irinotecan and oxaliplatin as in
           phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then
      every 4 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-32 patients (3-12 for the phase I portion and 20 for the
      phase II portion) will be accrued for this study within 2.75 years
