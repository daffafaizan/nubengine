    
      Iron deficiency (ID) in pregnant women can cause iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). ID is defined
      by low iron stores, measured by a low level of s-ferritin. Iron is essential for the
      synthesis of haemoglobin (Hb). Anaemia is defined by a low Hb level (<11.0 g/dL in 1st
      trimester, <10.5 g/dL in 2nd, and <10.5 - 11.0 g/dL in 3rd trimesters).

      In Danish pregnant women, who do not take iron supplementation approximately 50 % have ID and
      21 % have IDA. According to WHO anaemia, defined as Hb <11.0 g/dL, regardless the cause is
      estimated to occur in 24 % of Danish pregnant women.

      This trial is designed to evaluate and compare the effect of IV iron isomaltoside to a fixed
      dose of oral iron administered as tablet ferrous fumarate with ascorbic acid as correction of
      IDA in pregnant women after 4 weeks of standard treatment.
