           the function of the brain changes in response to antipsychotic medication, to better
           understand and effectively treat disorders with these drugs. This information can be
           used in other disorder as well, as there are many psychiatric disorders that are
           targeted by the newer atypical antipsychotics.

        -  The objective of this application, which is the next step in pursuit of the long-range
           goal, is to compare response on a series of cognitive tests (verbal learning, working
           memory, and attention) and changes in brain activity in a group of patients with
           schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are taking risperidone, olanzapine, or
           risperidone Consta injections and who switch to aripiprazole, and in a group of normal
           control subjects evaluated twice to control for learning effects.

        -  The central hypothesis of this application is that patients with schizophrenia or
           schizoaffective disorder that are taking aripiprazole will have improvements in
           cognition consistent with the medication's efficacy. We expect that changes in brain
           activity (from fMRI and EEG) will be correlated with this improvement, as determined by
           performance on cognitive tests. Further, changes in regional connectivity of affected
           brain regions will reflect these specific cognitive changes related to aripiprazole.

        -  The rationale for this proposed study is that, once we have a better understanding of
           which drugs improve cognition and what brain regions respond differently to aripiprazole
           and risperidone, olanzapine, or risperidone Consta, we will have a better understanding
           of the functional differences tied to the differential actions of the drugs. This is
           important, because we really don't understand how these medications affect cognition.
