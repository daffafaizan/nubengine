      diagnostic value of pressure pain in the diagnosis of CRPS has not been investigated. We
      compared the pressure pain thresholds of the carpus, metacarpophalangeal and proximal
      interphalangeal joints to a region of interest-based (ROI) analysis of a TBPS in patients
      with CRPS and patients with limb pain of other origin (non-CRPS-group).Additionally, the PPTs
      were established for a healthy control group to get reference data.
