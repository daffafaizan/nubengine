      among women with diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, the effects of resistance
      exercise training among those with subclinical, or analogue-Generalized Anxiety Disorder is
      unknown. This protocol details the full methods of two parallel, randomized controlled trials
      of an eight-week resistance exercise training intervention compared to a wait-list control
      condition among young adults with and without analogue-Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
      Analogue-Generalized Anxiety Disorder status was determined using validated cut-scores for
      both the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire Generalized Anxiety Disorder
      sub-scale score of 6 or greater, and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire score of 45 or
      greater. The ecologically-valid resistance exercise training was designed according to World
      Health Organization and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.
