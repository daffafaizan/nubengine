      have impact on both physical and mental health, leading to significantly reduced quality of
      life. It has been associated with a slower and more complicated postoperative recovery and
      has been established as an independent predictor of pain and pain related outcomes after
      surgery.

      Pharmacological interventions and provision of information about surgical processes are two
      ways that pre-operative anxiety is currently addressed. Mindfulness-based interventions have
      shown positive results in reducing psychological distress and improving pain related outcomes
      and may be a promising treatment avenue to evaluate in a surgical population.

      With the goal of conducting a full-scale definitive trial to investigate the effectiveness of
      a brief mindfulness-based intervention on post-operative pain and disability among anxious
      patients with chronic pain undergoing total hip arthroplasty, this pilot study has been
      developed to demonstrate proof of concept, test/refine the intervention, recruitment, and
      data collection procedures, and test the intervention's acceptability in the peri-operative
      setting.
