      three arms: one randomization, one self-selection, and one a low-contact waiting list one. In
      the randomization arm (R) 95 persons are randomly assigned to Panic Control Treatment (PCT)
      or Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP); in the self-selection arm (SS) 95
      persons are offered, after adequate information, to choose which of the two they prefer.
      Twenty-six persons are initially randomized to a three-month waiting list (with sparse
      contact over telephone), after which they will be re-randomized, either to further
      randomization (to PCT or PFPP) or to self-selection. The four groups (R/PCT; R/PFPP; SS/PCT;
      SS/PFPP) will be compared on the basis of intake and repeated outcome/follow-up assessment.
