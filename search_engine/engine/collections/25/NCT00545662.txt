      alone approximately 1.4 million sustain a TBI each year, of which 50,000 people die, and over
      200,000 are hospitalized. Despite numerous prior clinical trials no standard pharmacotherapy
      for the treatment of TBI has been established in either the acute or post acute setting.
      Citicoline is a naturally occurring endogenous compound. This compound offers the potential
      of employing neuroprotection, neuro-recovery and neurofacilitation to enhance recovery after
      TBI.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of citicoline compared to placebo on
      functional and cognitive outcome in participants with traumatic brain injury.
