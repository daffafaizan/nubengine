      This pain can oftentimes be severe enough to limit participation in physical therapy and
      ultimately delay discharge resulting in increased cost. Several strategies have been
      developed in an effort to decrease postoperative pain following TKA while maintaining lower
      extremity strength and maximizing participation in physical therapy. Recently, adductor canal
      blockade has gained popularity as it is reported to provide analgesia to the anterior knee
      without resulting in significant quadriceps muscle weakness. One downside of single shot
      peripheral blockade is the duration of analgesia can oftentimes be short lived. The advent of
      depot local anesthetics has made this an attractive option, especially in busy practices
      where placing peri-neural catheters may not be practical or cost effective. This study aims
      to carefully evaluate this relationship using a physical therapy evaluation method that
      relies on both motor strength and pain control. In addition, we hope to carefully evaluate
      motor strength using a novel method of strength measurement in an effort to further evaluate
      the impact of depot local anesthetic injection into the adductor canal on physical therapy
      and analgesia.
