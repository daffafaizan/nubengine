      radiation therapy (RT) to the chest. Typically, cardiotoxicity is identified years after
      radiation exposure. Emerging clinical data show that subclinical injury can be identified
      immediately after treatment. Early identification of subclinical injury may enable
      intervention to reduce the risk of progression to clinically significant toxicity. The
      investigators hypothesize that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) will detect early
      cardiac injury after RT and that imaging changes will be associated regionally with cardiac
      radiation dose.
