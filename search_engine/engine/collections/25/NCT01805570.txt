    
      50 consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin (GP IIb/IIIa not allowed)
      will be randomized to receive Prasugrel (n= 25) or Ticagrelor (n= 25) before PPCI ( primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention) in a open label fashion. The loading dose of Prasugrel
      will be 60 mg, the loading dose of Ticagrelor will be 360 mg in 25 patients. The loading dose
      will be performed as soon as possible in the Emergency Room or in the Cath Lab. In the case
      of vomit in the first hour after drug loading dose a new reduced loading dose will be
      administered (30 mg Prasugrel or 180 mg Ticagrelor). All interventions will be performed by
      the femoral approach according to current standards. The use of thrombectomy before
      infarct-related artery stenting, of everolimus eluting stent and of closure devices will be
      strongly encouraged. Bivalirudin will be administered as a bolus 0.75 mg/kg followed by 1.75
      mg/kg/h infusion during PCI. After PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) a reduced
      bivalirudin infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for 4 hours will be allowed. Dual antiplatelet therapy
      (100 mg aspirin associated with 5 or 10 mg Prasugrel or 180 mg Ticagrelor) will be
      recommended for 12 months.

      Residual platelet reactivity will be assessed in all patients at baseline (time of LD), and
      after 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours by a point-of-care test VerifyNow bedside available in the
      Intensive cardiac care Unit. High residual platelet reactivity will be defined as a Platelet
      Reactivity Units (PRU) > 240 by VerifyNow. At the same time point, Aspirin Reactivity Units
      (ARU) by VerifyNow will be also assessed. Follow-up will be performed by outpatient visits or
      telephone interviews at 6 months.
