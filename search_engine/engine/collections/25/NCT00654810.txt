      randomized to high-intensity exercise rehabilitation completed the study. The 6-month
      exercise rehabilitation programs consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal
      claudication pain three days per week at either 40% (low-intensity group) or 80%
      (high-intensity group) of maximal exercise capacity. Total work performed in the two training
      regimens was similar by having the patients in the low-intensity group exercise for a longer
      duration than patients in the high-intensity group. Measurements of physical function,
      peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life were obtained on each patient
      before and after the rehabilitation programs.
