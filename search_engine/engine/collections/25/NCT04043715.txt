      stimulation to improve walking in people with incomplete spinal cord injury. By directly
      comparing non-invasive transcutaneous (TransQ) stimulation with implanted epidural
      stimulation, investigators hope to guide the field toward the most beneficial method for
      restoration of lower extremity function. In addition, the investigators may identify
      subgroups of people that respond better to each type of stimulation, informing personalized
      treatment for people with different types of spinal cord injury. The research team will
      explore the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via transcutaneous
      spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.

      Aim 2: Quantify additional improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via
      epidural spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that epidural stimulation leads to greater
      improvements than an equal dose of transcutaneous stimulation. To compare these 2 stimulation
      methods the study team will evaluate voluntary control of muscle activity via EMG and
      kinematic parameters of locomotion, as well as improvements in bladder and other autonomic
      functions and overall quality of life.
