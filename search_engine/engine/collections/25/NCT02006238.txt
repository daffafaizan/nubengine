      fabric containing Farabloc (experimental), and the other a similar-appearing fabric made of
      Nylon (placebo).

      All eligible participants will be selected by the initial interview. The following
      information will be collected during interview process.

        -  Address

        -  Medical history

        -  Concomitant medication

        -  Allergies

      Participants will be asked the following:

        1. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much are you bothered by your hot flashes?

        2. Do these hot flashes wake you up at night? Around how many times do they occur at night?

        3. What are you expectations about this study?

      A Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire will be completed by the potential participant to
      assess symptoms Eligible patients from each group will initially undergo a 7 day washout
      period before intervention in order to eliminate any effects of hormone replacement therapies
      (HRT) or herbal supplements that subjects may be using prior to participation in the study.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive a Farabloc fabric or placebo fabric for one week.
      After this, the two groups will undergo a second 7 day washout period before crossing over to
      the other fabric. Once crossed over, participants will use the allocated fabrics for another
      week.

      Participants will be asked not to take their usual HRT or herbal supplements for the entire
      experimental duration in this study in order to produce impartial, precise and reliable
      results.

      The manufacturer will assign codes for placebo fabric or experimental Farabloc. The
      randomization code will be broken at the completion of the study for data analysis.
