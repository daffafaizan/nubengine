    
      Prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international study in a population with an
      accepted indication for an implantable automatic defibrillator.

      The main objective is to know the different values of the rates of inappropriate therapies,
      of serious cardiac and cerebrovascular adverse events, and of the appropriate detections in
      single-chamber ICD devices, with optimized programming according to the patient's arrhythmic
      history, using the three discrimination methods. arrhythmias: Smart, Onset and Stability, and
      Morphmatch.

      The device under investigation is a single chamber with a floating atrial dipole for the
      detection of atrial signals.

      Patients who are included in the study will present an indication for an automatic
      cardioverter-defibrillator device according to clinical practice guidelines for an ICD and
      who also do not have an indication for permanent stimulation in the right atrium. For this
      reason, the indication of patients will be those that require an ICD without the implantation
      of an electrode in the atrium, that is, single-chamber ICDs or DX ICDs since both, from the
      therapeutic point of view, are equivalent.

      The centers will follow standard clinical practice to diagnose patients
