      Primary

        -  Determine the median time to disease progression in patients with stage IV malignant
           melanoma treated with everolimus.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical benefit rates (i.e., stable disease, partial remission, and
           complete response rates) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine changes in serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily for 8 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression and then every 4 months for up
      to 5 years after registration.
