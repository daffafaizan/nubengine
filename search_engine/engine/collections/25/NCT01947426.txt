      infantile Hospital of Granada. The pregnant women will be assigned from random form to one of
      2 groups that are described later:

      Group A: balanced diet Mediterranean, intake of 2 glasses / day of the dairy drink control.

      Group B: balanced Mediterranean diet together with the consumption of 400mg/day of DHA in the
      dairy product (2 glasses / day). The dairy products will be distributed in white packages
      without any indication that reflects the type of product that contains (double blind). Every
      volunteer will be assigned a key that guarantees the confidentiality of their analytical
      values.

      The dietary intervention will begin in the sixth month of pregnancy and will conclude to the
      third month of lactation (though there will improve itself the importance of a mother
      lactation up to 6 month postpartum). There will be obtained samples of blood (5 mL) of the
      mothers in the moment of the capture, in the childbirth and to 3 postpartum months. There
      will take a sample of blood of umbilical cord (5mL) in the moment of the childbirth (vein and
      artery). In addition there will take a sample of blood of the child (5mL) to 2.5 months.
      There will take also samples of mother milk (10mL), concretely of colostrum (2-3 postpartum
      days) and of mature(ripe) milk to 1, 2, 3 months. The samples will be preserved in freezer
      of-80ÂºC and sent to the different laboratories due preserved participants in order that there
      does not break the cold chain ( dry ice). In the first year of life of the child there will
      be practised tests of motive and cognitive development (Bayley's test and Fagan's test) in
      order to evaluate the influence of the dietetic intervention on the mother in the development
      of the child.
