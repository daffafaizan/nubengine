      mandatory. It is well known and published that the use of Vitamin c may contribute to the
      healing process of such burns, including burns from chemicals or heat. We believe that the
      route pf administration of the medicine is as important as the kind of medicine and that
      subconjunctival injection will have better effect and will influence in a favorable manner on
      the the end result as well as on the time of the healing.

      In order to be able to compare between cases we made a new definition of the severity of the
      burn according to the extension of the damage on the cornea, conjunctiva and limbus, and
      according to the severity and depth of the ischemia.

      In 3 medical centers 3 protocols of treatment and followup will be compared while only in
      Baruch Pade Medical Center the main route of administration will be subconjunctival on top of
      the topical treatment.
