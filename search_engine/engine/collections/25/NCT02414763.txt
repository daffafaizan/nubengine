      psychiatry unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The PI, other Attending
      Psychiatrists, Psychiatry Resident Physicians, Clinical Psychology Trainees, Psychiatric
      Nurse Practitioners, Psychiatric Social Workers, and Psychiatric Nurse Case Managers will
      serve as study therapists. A member from the Vanderbilt University research team will obtain
      informed consent for the participants and then administer the baseline assessment battery.
      Patients will then be randomized to either (1) a group receiving care as usual plus an
      experimental intervention targeting suicidal thoughts and behaviors or to (2) a group
      receiving care as usual. Patients randomized to the experimental group will receive the
      intervention prior to discharge from the medical center, most likely on the same day as the
      baseline assessment battery. Patients receiving the experimental intervention will then be
      asked to complete a brief post-intervention client satisfaction survey. All study
      participants will then complete telephone follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 12 months. The
      intervention will consist of no more than 90 minutes of 1:1 interaction with a study
      clinician. The baseline assessment battery will take approximately 30 minutes, the
      post-intervention measures will take approximately 10 minutes, and the 1-, 3-, and 12-month
      assessment batteries will take approximately 30 minutes. Maximum length of time in the study
      is approximately 3.75 hours.
