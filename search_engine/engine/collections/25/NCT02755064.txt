      performed at the screening visit. At each visit, GE was evaluated by 13C-spirulina breath
      tests.

      Phase 1:

      After the baseline assessment (GE1), the second and third GE tests were performed during
      treatment with intravenous (GE2) and oral erythromycin (GE3) or placebo. Subject arrived
      fasting at each study visit. Prior to gastric emptying study, there was placement of an
      intravenous line. Subject continued to take insulin and other medications as usual. Subjects
      were required to do finger-stick glucose readings 4 times a day or as instructed by their
      physician. Subjects were provided with a log sheet to keep track of meal times, insulin
      dosing and times, glucose readings, and activities. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and
      gastric emptying were evaluated for the duration of the study (11 days) and thrice
      respectively. GE was evaluated at baseline (GE1) and after randomized to intravenous saline,
      erythromycin (2 mg/kg) or erythromycin (3 mg/kg).

      Phase 2:

      Thereafter, patients were randomized to erythromycin ethyl succinate suspension (250 mg tid)
      or placebo for a total period of 7 days. GE3 was preferably performed on day 7, after oral
      erythromycin or placebo was started.

      An EKG was performed at baseline to identify (and exclude) patients who have
      contraindications to erythromycin. An EKG was also repeated at the end of the study, i.e., on
      GE3 for safety. No change to insulin (apart from those that patients do with their self
      management skills) or other medications was made during this research study.
