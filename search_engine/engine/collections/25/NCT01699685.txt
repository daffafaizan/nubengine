    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, single-dose, cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study. The primary endpoint was chosen to demonstrate the superiority of a
      single-dose of the combined inhalation vs. the mono inhalation regarding the Inspiratory
      Capacity (IC) peak value. A total of 78 patients will be randomized to complete two visits
      with two single doses of treatment. Patients will be randomized in a cross-over manner.
      Treatment visits will be separated by a study medication wash-out period.Treatments will be
      administered in a blinded fashion.

      The patients will be male and female patients, ≥40 years of age, with a documented diagnosis
      of moderate or severe COPD according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
      Disease (GOLD) criteria and >10-pack years history of smoking, FEV1 <80% and ≥30% of the
      predicted normal value.
