      sensitivity. The strongest relationship between hypogonadism and insulin resistance appears
      to reside in men with the metabolic syndrome who have a normal BMI. The causal relationship
      between these two conditions is unknown. Therefore, we propose to determine if testosterone
      replacement in hypogonadal non-obese men with metabolic syndrome will improve insulin
      sensitivity. Data obtained from this preliminary investigation, will hopefully result in a
      hypothesis that can be tested in a larger, more rigorous trial in the future.
