      secondary form. About 30% of RA are associated with sSS (1) Tumor necrosis factor alpha
      inhibitors (TNFa-Is) have been tried in this population without success. Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig)
      is comprised of the ligand-binding domain of CTLA4 plus human immunoglobulin and represents a
      novel therapeutic costimulation blocker that modulates the signal required for full T cell
      activation. Studies have shown that activated CD4 T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of
      SS, indicating Abatacept might be a useful therapeutic intervention in SS. Subjects who are
      receiving non-biologic immunosuppressive medications consisting of hydroxychloroquine,
      methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, or leflunomide, at the time of enrollment will remain on
      these medications without dosage alteration. Efficacy and Safety data will be collected at
      the time of each clinic visit. The treatment closing date will occur 6 months after
      enrollment of each subject. Subjects will be followed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months.
      Laboratory studies associated with the clinical trial will test potential autoantibody
      production for systemic autoimmune diseases.
