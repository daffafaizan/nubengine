           cardiopulmonary mechanics during stress in patients with exertional dyspnea,
           establishing a comprehensive multimodality diagnostic approach to the evaluation of
           exercise intolerance.

        -  The specific objective is to prospectively compare established and novel parameters
           derived from echocardiography and CPX with simultaneous, gold standard invasive measures
           of cardiovascular hemodynamics at rest and with exercise stress to define the role of
           noninvasive testing in the diagnostic workup.

        -  The primary hypothesis is that combined ExE and CPX can noninvasively identify HFpEF.
