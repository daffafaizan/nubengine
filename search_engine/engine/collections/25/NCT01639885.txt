      efficient therapies. Ovarian cancer is highly immunogenic and good survival is tightly linked
      to the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells and the absence of immunosuppressive immune
      cells. This anti-tumor immune response might be primed by chemotherapy.

      Gemcitabine has immune-modulatory properties in addition to its direct cytotoxic effect in
      platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Additionally, Peg-Intron allows the full maturation of
      dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response. Moreover, the tumor-associated
      self-antigen p53 is commonly over-expressed in ovarian cancer and can serve as a target for
      immunotherapy. Therefore, chemo-immunotherapy with gemcitabine and Peg-Intron plus/minus p53
      SLP vaccination seems an attractive treatment for recurrent, p53+ ovarian cancer patients.
