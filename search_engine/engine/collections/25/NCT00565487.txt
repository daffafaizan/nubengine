      for the treatment of locally advanced non-operable pancreatic cancer. However, the survival
      of these patients is disappointing. The majority of the patients suffer either local
      progression or metastatic disease. With the availability of Capecitabine, a few pilot studies
      showed the the drug is convenient, tolerable and safe in combination with radiation therapy.
      Capecitabine demonstrated its superior anti-tumor activity with 14 months of median survival.
      However, these are small Phase I studies and the survival benefit needs to be further
      validated with larger studies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in
      tumor growth and angiogenesis. Inhibiting EGFR by Tarceva has demonstrated effective
      treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Anti-epidermal growth factor therapy in
      combination with radiotherapy has been demonstrated efficacious in other solid tumors such as
      head and neck cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of Tarceva and Capecitabine has
      synergistic anti-tumor effect. Hence, improvement of median survival could be potentially
      achieved with this novel combination.
