    
      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and expansion (Phase 1) and Phase 2.

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to establish the recommended dose of selitrectinib to
      treat neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusion cancers in patients a) aged 12 years and
      older and b) younger than 12 years. Secondary objectives of Phase 1 are to characterize the
      pharmakokinetic properties of the test drug, its safety and tolerability, and to assess the
      objective response rate (ORR) of NTRK-tumors.

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the overall response rate in NTRK fusion cancer
      patients as determined by an independent radiology committee (IRR). Secondary objectives of
      Phase 2 comprise the safety and efficacy of selitrectinib at the recommended dose.
