    
      This 2-period 2-sequence cross-over clinical study intends to explore the profile of nicotine
      uptake (rate and extent of nicotine absorbed and associated variability) in healthy smokers
      switching from (CC) to THS 2.1 (single or ad libitum use) compared to smokers continuing to
      use CC, as a comparator. This study will serve to optimize blood sampling schedules and
      sample size estimation for further studies. This study will also provide preliminary
      information on the relationship between nicotine absorption and urge to smoke/withdrawal
      symptoms when using THS 2.1 as compared to CC, as well as the safety profile, which is
      related to the use of THS 2.1.

      After screening, enrolled subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 8 days. This study
      duration includes 2 consecutive periods. Each period consists of 1 day for single use of the
      product preceded by a 24-hour nicotine deprivation, and 1 day for ad libitum product use.
      After leaving the clinic, the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7
      days.

      This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on
      Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use
      (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the
      applicable regulatory requirements.
