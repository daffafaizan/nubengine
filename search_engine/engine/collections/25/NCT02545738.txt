      treatment, possibly independent from blood pressure reduction. The mechanism behind is
      unclear and the magnitude of albuminuria reduction needs to be verified. Antiproteinuric
      effects are usually renoprotective and potentially also cardioprotective and may suggest an
      additional benefit from liraglutide treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the magnitude of the antiproteinuric effect of
      short-term liraglutide treatment (12 weeks) in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria.
      In addition, possible mechanisms causing the antiproteinuric effect will be explored.
