    
      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study. It is designed to
      evaluate the effects of metal-on-metal acetabular articulating bearing surfaces.

      The device will be used in conjunction with a cemented metal femoral resurfacing prosthesis.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the metal-on-metal Recap Total Resurfacing System.

      Performance will be assessed trough Harris Hip Score, radiographic evaluation at various
      postoperative visits. Adverse events and revisions will be documented for safety assessments.

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Total Harris hip score

        -  Device revisions or removals

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Total Harris hip score

        -  Radiographic changes as evidenced by:

      I. Acetabular component migration, change in angle of inclination or presence of osteolysis
      II. Femoral component subsidence, femoral neck Fracture or presence of osteolysis
