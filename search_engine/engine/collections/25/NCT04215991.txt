      than 12 years with suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections and a
      randomized multiple-dose, active-comparator (SOC) phase in children aged 3 months to less
      than 18 years with cUTI, HAP, or VAP to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of
      cefiderocol in hospitalized patients requiring systemic antibiotics for an expected 5 to 14
      days.
