      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with lung metastases during aerosol interleukin (IL)-2
      (aldesleukin) therapy using self-report, remote spirometry and pulse oximetry.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine dose and schedule of an acceptable aerosol IL-2 regimen and correlate with
      absolute lymphocyte count (ALC).

      II. To determine serum IL-2 levels on day 1 of therapy for evidence of spillover into
      circulation and correlate with absence or presence of toxicity.

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of aerosol IL-2 treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the histology in post-surgical specimens in patients who undergo surgery for
      lung metastases following aerosol IL-2 treatment as an optional procedure.

      II. To evaluate immune correlates from optional pre-treatment biopsy and post-surgical
      specimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive aerosolized aldesleukin once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
