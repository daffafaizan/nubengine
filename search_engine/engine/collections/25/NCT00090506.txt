      health benefits of yoga. This study will comprise two substudies that will evaluate the
      effects of yoga in two distinct populations.

      Participants in the first study will be people who are at risk for developing diabetes;
      participants in the second study will be people with both HIV and depression. All
      participants will practice yoga 3 to 6 days per week for 3 months. Blood collection will be
      done and weight and blood pressure measurements will be taken in study 1 participants;
      questionnaires will be used to measure depression and stress in study 2 participants. All
      study participants will be assessed at entry and at 3 and 6 months.
