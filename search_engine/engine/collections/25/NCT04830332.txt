      by dilatation and curettage. Preoperative serum CA-125 levels were determined in all
      patients. Serum and abdominal washing fluid CA-125 levels were measured with a double
      antibody sandwich immunoenzymatic method, using Beckman Coulter DXI (Ireland) analyzer. In
      addition to routine preoperative investigations, MRI was done in patients who were thought to
      have an extension outside the uterus.

      During surgery, abdominal exploration was performed first, and then an abdominal fluid sample
      was obtained for cytological examination and measurement of CA-125 level. One hundred
      milliliters of normal saline was used as the abdominal washing liquid to obtain the sample
      for CA-125 measurement. Subsequently, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH + BSO) were performed.
