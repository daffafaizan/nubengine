      performed after the events under the study have occurred), registry study where data was
      collected from 3 different registries sponsored or supported by Centocor. Registries are
      Centocor-sponsored Therapy Resource Evaluation and Assessment Tool (TREATâ„¢) Registry of
      Crohn's Disease, and in the following two Centocor-supported registries the Consortium of
      Rheumatology Researchers of North America, Inc. (CORRONA) registry and the Infliximab RA
      Registry, a subset of the National Database Registry of Rheumatoid Arthritis (NDBRRA) and of
      the National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB). A registry is data collection in a real
      life physician-patient setting. Physicians prescribe medications for rheumatoid arthritis
      and/or Crohns disease in accordance with their usual clinical practice and then record this
      information and provide it to Centocor. For this registry study, Centocor collected data from
      3 registries to evaluate the risk of getting lymphoma if you have rheumatoid arthritis and/or
      Crohns disease and you have taken infliximab. Patients who were in one of the 3 registries
      and had rheumatoid arthritis and/or Crohns disease and did not take infliximab were also
      evaluated. This registry study does not involve the use of any investigational drugs.
