    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study conducted in North
      America (U.S. and Canada) and Europe (Romania and Ukraine) in patients with mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis. Treatment consisted of one of 2 doses of HMPL-004 (1200 mg daily or 1800
      mg daily, administered in 3 divided doses) or matching placebo. Assessment of treatment
      effect is based on the Mayo score. Subjects eligible for the study will include those ≥18
      years of age with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, having a Mayo score of 4 to 10, with
      activity confirmed by endoscopy within 2 weeks prior to study entry, and having a Mayo
      endoscopy score ≥1. Subjects who are using concomitant mesalamine could enter the study. The
      randomization will be stratified by mesalamine use or non-use.
