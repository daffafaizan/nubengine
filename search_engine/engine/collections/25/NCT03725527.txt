      somatic pain signals derived from the abdominal wall. The central portion of anterior
      abdominal wall components (skin, muscles and parietal peritoneum) is innervated by sensory
      neurons branching from the anterior rami of spinal nerves T7 to T1. These neurons lie between
      the rectus abdominis muscle and posterior rectus sheath, and pierce the rectus muscle close
      to the midline. The tendinous intersections of the rectus muscle do not fuse with the
      posterior rectus sheath, thereby allowing the injectate to spread cephalo-caudally within
      this potential space. Rectus sheath (RS) block has been described for any midline abdominal
      incisions (epigastric and umbilical hernia repairs). As visceral pain becomes attenuated by
      the 2nd postoperative day, rectus sheath block can also be administered for midline
      laparotomy.

      As a single bolus of the local anesthetic has a maximum duration of 12 hours. it is necessary
      to insert a catheter into this space to allow either a continuous infusion of local
      anesthetic, or repeated boluses of local anesthetic every 8 to 12 hours for 48 to 72 hours
      post-operatively.

      However, the effects of rectus sheath block catheter analgesia on the respiratory function
      after abdominal surgery with midline incisions are still under investigation.
