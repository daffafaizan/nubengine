      t with dental implants for fixed prosthesis rehabilitation with a minimum period of 12 months
      after final prosthesis delivery. Patients were contacted and informed to participate in a
      cross-sectional assessment to identify the presence of peri-implant diseases. Eligible
      implants had to be in an ideal prosthetically driven position, otherwise they were excluded
      from the analysis. Moreover, implants that could not be accurately recorded the probing depth
      due to inadequate prosthesis design were further excluded. Baseline periapical x-ray at time
      of prosthesis delivery was retrospective assessed to exclude implants with early peri-implant
      bone loss before function. A detailed description of risk factors and indicators of
      peri-implant disease were explained at the same stage. Additionally, patients were thoroughly
      instructed on plaque control home care strategies including but not limited to interdental
      brushes with nylon-coated core wire, soft toothbrushes (manual and power) and floss with
      stiffened end to clean under multiple units fixed-prosthesis. Moreover, treated patients were
      encouraged to routinely enroll in a peri-implant maintenance therapy program.

      The present case-control study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration
      of human studies and received approval from the ethics committee from the University of
      Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain). An informed written consent was signed from each subject
      enrolled in the present study.
