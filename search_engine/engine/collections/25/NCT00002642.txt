      given concurrently with continuous, fractionated chest irradiation followed by surgical
      resection and boost chemotherapy in patients with Pancoast tumors without mediastinal or
      supraclavicular nodal involvement. II. Assess the objective response rate, resectability
      rate, and proportion of patients free of microscopic residual disease after such treatment.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive Induction on Regimen A and, in the absence of progression,
      proceed to Regimen B, then C. Patients who refuse or are medically unfit for surgery
      following Regimen A proceed directly to Regimen C. Regimen A: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy
      plus Radiotherapy. Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; plus
      irradiation of the tumor and ipsilateral supraclavicular region using megavoltage equipment
      (photons with peak energies of 4-15 MV). Regimen B: Surgery. Tumor resection. Regimen C:
      2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. CDDP; VP-16.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 99 patients will be accrued over 2-4 years.
