    
      The goal of BeliLES-GEAS registry is to create an observational, non-randomized,
      non-controlled, national multicenter prospective and retrospective cohort with the aim to
      explore the real performance, with its lights and shadows, of Belimumab, either IV or SC, in
      a real-world population of lupus patients.

      The intention is to perform a longer-term follow up, so that the measure of hard outcomes,
      such as improvement in mortality, could be feasible, but also reliable data regarding the
      safety profile could be recorded.

      In order to achieve that, the following variables will be included: individual criteria as
      part of 2019 EULAR/ACR, SLICC or ACR 1997 classification criteria, gender, age at diagnosis,
      age at symptoms onset, duration of the disease, age at first Belimumab administration, mean
      time of follow-up prior to, and from Belimumab administration, complete medical history
      including other systemic autoimmune diseases, type/s of organ/systems affected by SLE, prior
      immunosuppressants received, number of flares 2 years prior Belimumab onset, number of
      medical visits, number of days of sick leave, type of disease, treatment and laboratory data.
      As a measure of damage, Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics-Damage Index
      (SLICC-DI) score will be calculated at baseline and at 12, 18, 24 months and yearly of
      follow-up. All centers will be requested to provide the SLICC-DI calculated annually of the
      last five years before the initiation of belimumab, when available.

      The efficacy will be evaluated as time to reach any of the definition of remission included
      in the DORIS (definitions of remission in SLE) consensus, or LLDAs (lupus low disease
      activity state). Regarding the safety of Belimumab in real-world setting, it will be defined
      and evaluated by documenting adverse events.
