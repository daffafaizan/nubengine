    
      This study is designed to assess whether increasing the consumption of natural food folates
      from a mixed diet is as effective as supplemental folic acid or supplemental natural folate
      in raising folate status, reducing biomarkers of cardio vascular disease (CVD) risk, and
      improving vascular function. Randomised placebo-controlled parallel studies will be
      undertaken in groups of individuals in Norwich and Sheffield. There will be four treatment
      arms: a) 200 µg folate per day from folate-rich foods, b) 200 µg folate per day from
      supplemental folic acid, c) 200 µg folate per day from supplemental Metafolin® (6S
      5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid) and d) a placebo group. Results from the two centres will be
      combined, thus ensuring a wide population is covered. Folate status, biomarkers of CVD risk
      and vascular function (pulse wave velocity) will be measured before and following the
      intervention period of 16 weeks, together with possible confounders (such as vitamins B2 &
      B12 status, and MTHFR genotype). 7-Day weighed intakes will be used to measure habitual
      B-vitamin intake during baseline and intervention, to determine changes in folate intake and
      assist compliance. Additionally, folate content of selected folate-rich foods will be
      determined for each volunteer. The results will aid the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in
      formulating public health policy related to improving folate status and reducing CVD risk.
