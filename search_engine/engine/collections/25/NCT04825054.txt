      the preload of the heart will be influenced by the variation of the intrathoracic pressure.
      The cardiopulmonary interaction during mechanical ventilation will be an important influence
      factor on hemodynamics after surgical repair for these patients. As a new mode of mechanical
      ventilation, NAVA delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to patients' neural effort
      avoiding over ventilation.

      The investigators designed a crossover study to evaluate the cardiopulmonary effect in
      patients with congenital heart disease with right ventricular hypertrophy when ventilated
      with NAVA postoperatively, compared with the conventional mode of pressure control
      ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Each patient will undergo three 60-min trials
      during the study period in randomized order. The cardiac output and volume status will be
      evaluated by a transpulmonary thermodilution device through a pulse contour cardiac output
      (PiCCO) catheter at the last 10min of each trial. At the mean while an arterial blood gas and
      echocardiography will perform.

      Data are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. Datas from the three registrations will be
      compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA. The comparison of each mode will be assessed by the
      SNK methods post hoc test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
