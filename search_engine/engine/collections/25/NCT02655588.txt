      electronic version of problem solving therapy for depression (imbPST). The program was
      entirely automated and did not require the involvement of a live clinician, even though it
      was designed to provide a "virtual therapy" experience that feels more like interacting with
      a person than with a computer. The imbPST program was built to help individuals who did not
      have access to traditional therapy due the living conditions or individual preferences (e.g.
      rural, poor and persons desiring privacy or with significant time constraints). This
      computer-based treatment of depression offered several advantages. It can be used anywhere
      without a therapist present, and offered a standardized and consistent therapeutic approach.

      The aim of this study is to reduce symptoms of depression in subjects through the use of a
      new, electronic Problem Solving Treatment (imbPST). Adult participants with moderate to
      severe depression symptoms are randomly assigned to either treatment or a wait-list
      condition. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was used as the primary outcome measure
