      continuity care intensivist (CCI) program. The study will evaluate how effective the modified
      communication training for providers is to perform this new role. The primary outcome for the
      study is whether a CCI will affect several patient level outcomes for patients who have been
      admitted to the PICU longer than 7 days. Patient length of stay, hospital acquired
      conditions, time to limitations of interventions and new medical technology will be assessed
      comparing the intervention and usual care arms. The study will also determine the impact of
      the CCI program on parent/family satisfaction with provider communication and decision-making
      for their child.
