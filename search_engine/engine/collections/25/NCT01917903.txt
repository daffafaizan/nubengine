      whether a new walking intervention that combines cognitive training with walking on a
      treadmill improves walking more than gait training or cognitive training alone. Participants
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) will come to the lab for a complete gait assessment using a
      motion analysis system that will record leg motion and muscle activity during comfortable
      walking. During the initial evaluation, participants will also complete cognitive assessments
      and surveys about community activities and quality of life related to PD. Participants will
      be divided into two training groups and asked to come to the lab three times a week for four
      weeks during the intervention. One week and one month after training, participants will
      return to the lab to complete all the same assessments that were performed during the initial
      visit. The results of the three testing sessions (initial, one week and one month) will be
      compared between and within groups to see if any of the interventions provided unique
      benefits to the health of persons with PD.
