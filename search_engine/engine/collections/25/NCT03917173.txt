    
      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter study with two different arm:

        -  experimental: prophylactic surgery plus HIPEC CO2 performed with mitomycin and cisplatin

        -  comparator: standard surgery Adjuvant treatment after surgery is mandatory except for
           documented cases of non-eligibility.

      Patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed during surgery if
      the total resection of tumor will be reached according to center and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      as stratification variables.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of prophylactic surgery
      (radical gastric resection, appendectomy, round ligament of the liver resection and bilateral
      adnexectomy) plus HIPEC CO2 versus standard surgery in terms of disease free survival (DFS).

      Patients affected by gastric carcinoma at high risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis
      will be randomized in this study.
