    
      OBJECTIVES

      Our broad objectives will be to:

        -  Survey and recruit patients with ischaemic heart diseases in a randomized sample
           representative of the Mauritian population (ethnicity, gender, age, social and
           economical status) and record their medical history,

        -  Collect fasting blood serum and urine at baseline and after supplement of control volume
           of tea infusion and water from study group and control group respectively,

        -  Optimize techniques to determine levels of specific biomarkers from above body fluid
           samples,

        -  Investigate existing correlation between tea consumption and risk of cardiovascular
           diseases in Mauritian population

      Our specific objectives will be to:

        -  Select a randomised group of the Mauritian population, with ischaemic heart disease, who
           has been referred to the Cardiac Centre, Pamplemousses for Angiography and a group of
           people showing no risk of cardiovascular diseases

        -  Inform the people about the motives of the study and seek consent from those willing to
           participate in the study,

        -  Evaluate the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL,
           triglycerides, homocysteine, atrial natriuretic peptides, brain natriuretic peptides,
           8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, isoprostanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, products of protein
           damage, uric acid and glycosylated haemoglobin) from 8-10 hr fasting blood serum and
           urine at baseline from all participants

        -  Supply the study group with a control volume of tea infusion and the control group with
           the same amount of water for a defined period of time followed by a two week wash out
           period with water.

        -  Study biomarkers as above from 8-10 hr fasting blood serum and urine in two week
           intervals during the supplement regime

        -  Investigate the existing correlation between tea consumption and levels of biomarkers of
           cardiovascular diseases in a Mauritian sample population.
