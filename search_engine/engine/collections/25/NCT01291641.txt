    
      Hyperlipidemic patients who are currently receiving HMGCoA reductase inhibitors(Statins) will
      be randomized Group A(Control), Group B(Probucol only added group) or Group C(Probucol and
      cilostazol added group) . Randomization will be done by the minimization method, controlling
      for the following factors: Country(Korea vs China) and max IMT (â‰¥2.0mm vs.<2.0mm).

      Group A : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued

      Group B : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued + Probucol 250 mg PO, BID

      Group C : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued + Probucol 250 mg PO, BID +Cilostazol 100 mg
      PO, BID
