      secondary objectives are: 1) to compare the level of HRQoL of DTF patients to the general
      population, 2) to identify patient subgroups who are at risk for developing certain HRQoL
      problems, 3) to evaluate patient preferences regarding their health care needs for DTF.

      Outline: All patients, aged above 18 years, with a histopathological proved DTF tumour and
      sufficient Dutch language skills who have received their last check-up in the hospital within
      the last five years (April 2014). Patients treated in one of the participating centres, will
      be asked to fill out a set of questionnaires (baseline questionnaire, health care
      utilization, decision making, EORTC QLQ-C30, DTF-specific questionnaire, and the EQ-5D-5L).
      Patients will only have to fill out these questionnaires once.
