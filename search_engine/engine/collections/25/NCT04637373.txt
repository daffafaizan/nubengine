    
      This is a descriptive, prospective study. Women aged 18-40 years admitted for surgical
      evacuation in cases of early missed abortion in a single university affiliated medical center
      are being recruited. All procedures performed under general anesthesia following cervical
      ripening with vaginal Misoprostol.

      Before the evacuation, a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed to identify the pregnancy's
      implantation wall. Subsequently, ultrasound guided suction and curettage directed to the
      implantation wall is done. Finally, the uterine cavity is evaluated by hysteroscopy for RPOC.
      Participants are scheduled for follow-up diagnostic office hysteroscopy 2 months after
      termination of pregnancy for assessment of IUA and RPOC. However, due to restrictions on
      elective surgical procedures brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the follow-up hysteroscopy
      examination was postponed until 5 to 6 months after termination of pregnancy.
