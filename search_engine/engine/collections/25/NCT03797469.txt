      detect progression is visual field testing. Visual field testing is the reference standard to
      measure visual function in glaucoma. It is called called standard automated perimetry (SAP).
      However, this test is very subjective, often unreliable, and variable. One of the main causes
      of unreliable tests is the lack of attentiveness or concentration during the test. Previous
      studies have shown that listening to Mozart or taking vitamin B12 can improve the reliability
      of this test. Recent studies have suggested that over-the-counter medications such as
      nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and pyruvate can also improve the performance during this test.
      This can ultimately reduce costs due to repeated testing and increase doctor's certainty when
      analyzing the results of this test.
