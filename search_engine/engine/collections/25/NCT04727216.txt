    
      Intermittent Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation (DRG-S) dosing consists of preprogrammed cycles
      during which stimulation is delivered with standard DRG-S parameters alternated with periods
      during which no stimulation is being delivered.

      In this study the investigators propose to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of Intermittent
      DRG-S at 1 minute on: 1 minute off and 1 minute on: 2 minute off dosing in comparison to
      standard continuous DRG-S dosing and determine if there is noninferiority between the
      intermittent and continuous paradigms in chronic pain patients with permanent DRG-S implants.
