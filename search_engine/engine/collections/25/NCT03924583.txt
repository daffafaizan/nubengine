      Investigators:

        1. General nurses - trained and able to perform duplex ultrasonography examination of
           venous circulation

        2. Doctors - experienced specialists in intensive care or urgent medicine

      Every patient with central venous catheter enrolled in clinical study is examined with duplex
      ultrasonography within 24 hours by both investigators, doctor and nurse. Each examination
      includes ultrasonography of a whole vena cava venous system with central venous catheter,
      bilaterally. Results of both examinations are blinded until the end of study, with one
      exception. In case of positive result - catheter related thrombosis is present, investigator
      ( nurse )informs patients attending physician.

      Results of investigations are recorded in Investigation Form with some other routine medical
      data.
