      Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of four periods.

      First, a computer based education program on the accuracy of predicting polyp histology with
      NBI (NICE and WASP classification) will be performed by 15 endoscopists (less experienced in
      NBI) during Septepber 2015.

      In the second period from October 2015 till Deceber 2015, 1st phase real- time optical
      diagnosis for diminutive and small colorectal polyps will be activated. All endoscopists will
      have weekly feedback on their accuracy of optical diagnosis for polyps, and discuss the NBI
      findings that mismatched by histologic diagnosis all together per one month.

      Third, the result of 1st phase real-time optical diagnosis will be analyzed from January 2016
      till April 2016. In this period, endoscopists with low accuracy of 1st phase real-time
      optical diagnosis will be re-educated.

      The last period from May 2016 till September 2016, 2nd phase real-time optical diagnosis for
      polyps will be activated. Performance will be evaluated by comparing optically predicted
      diagnosis with actual histologic diagnosis. Cumulative sum analysis will be used to determine
      the learning curve for each endoscopist. Negative predictive value for the prediction of
      nonneoplastic polyp and concordance of surveillance intervals for diminutive polyps diagnosed
      optically with high confidence will also be measured.
