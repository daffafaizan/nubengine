      the rehabilitation of ankle sprains. However, research evidence on the efficacy of this type
      of training is still weak, mainly owing to the methodological limitations of relevant
      studies. In addition, there is paucity of evidence concerning the effects of such training
      for the outcomes of functional performance, pain, ankle range of motion, and contradictory
      results have been reported for postural control.

      This study aimed to substantiate the benefits of supervised training for the rehabilitation
      of ankle sprains, and elucidate the effects of two different proprioceptive protocols on the
      above-mentioned outcomes.
