      recently have clinical trials begun to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions
      in the management of postoperative pain beyond the immediate postoperative recovery period
      and after discharge home following tonsillectomy. Given the fact that approximately 50% of
      pediatric surgeries are done on an outpatient basis, this study has the potential to improve
      the home pain management of thousands of children. This study is one of the first to evaluate
      in a systematic fashion the use of an around-the-clock dosing of a weight appropriate dose of
      a nonopioid/opioid combination analgesic compared to as needed dosing. Because the study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of both a behavioral intervention and two different pharmacologic
      interventions, it will provide important information that should have a direct clinical
      application in the management of children's pain.
