      centers. All patients will meet the stringent diagnostic criteria for CSA, including the
      requirement for the regular use of Step 5 medications (i.e. oral prednisone and/or
      omalizumab). The experimental design of the proposed study will take the form of a
      double-blind parallel-randomized placebo-controlled trial consisting of a total of eight
      visits including run-in and run-out periods. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive
      either MTX or matched placebo once a week as add-on therapy to their existing medication
      after run-in. Physiological, laboratory and clinical assessments will be measured regularly
      throughout the study and compared with baseline assessments.

      We expect that MTX will reduce Step 5 medications dosage in patients with CSA without
      compromising the overall disease control. Improvement in several indicators of asthma
      severity and control will be also investigated
