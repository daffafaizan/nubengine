      cardiovascular event. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is critical for making
      appropriate clinical decisions. Guidelines have been issued on standard blood pressure
      measurement procedure for the detection of hypertension and the follow-up of patients with
      hypertension. In hospital adherence to guidelines is low (Manzoli, Simonetti et al. 2012).
      Whether these guidelines are followed in dialysis patients is not known. Thus it would be of
      great interest to investigate the BP measurement procedures that are effectively applied in
      dialysis centers.

      This project is an international survey across 10 dialysis centers. The current study is
      conducted on 10 physicians, 10 head nurses and 100 to 200 patients in Switzerland, in Europe
      and in the Mediterranean basin.

      The adherence to BP measurement guidelines will be assessed thanks to two questionnaires of
      20 items; one addressed to the patients and the other to the medical staff (clinicians and
      head nurses).

      The project is scheduled to last a total of 4 months. Two months are dedicated to the
      presentation of the project, the recruitment as well as to the participation of the
      volunteers, and two months to the analysis.

      The research project is carried out in accordance to the research plan and with principles
      enunciated in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH), the Essentials of
      Good Epidemiological Practice issued by Public Health Schweiz (EGEP), the Swiss Law and Swiss
      regulatory authority's requirements as applicable.
