      Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention (including daily posts, and weekly live
      group sessions, tailored to sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults; (2) Pride Posts Plus,
      the Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention plus a gamification element, or (2) a
      usual care condition which includes referral to smokefree.gov, a federally-developed
      web-based intervention which includes similar digital treatment elements. All participants
      will have access to up to six months of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to provide biochemical
      verification of smoking status using a portable carbon monoxide measurement tool. All
      intervention and assessment procedures will be conducted digitally.
