      whether the dose of VKA is high or low. Randomisation will be balanced and stratified
      depending on the average dose of VKA before the inclusion in order that each arm would have
      the same number of patients receiving a dose lower than the used anticoagulant treatments.

      The level of vitamin K intake will be determined during the study visits using dietary
      questionnaire.
