      (NERD) with abnormal levels of acid reflux, NERD patients with normal levels of reflux and
      healthy volunteers. Participants were assessed for cough reflex sensitivity (CRS) to citric
      acid and bronchial-hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine challenge, both before
      (baseline) and after esophageal acid infusion (HCl, 0.15M) or normal saline control
      (8ml/min). The order of CRS and BHR was randomized, as was the order of the acid/saline
      infusions.
