      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with metastatic or locally advanced
           pancreatic cancer treated with calcitriol and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median and one-year survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the change in pancreatic cancer-induced pain in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on days 1, 8, and 15 and docetaxel IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
