    
      The trial is a retrospective observational study, with the aim to compare two cohorts of
      patients with suspicion of PCa who will undergo MRI. Group A is composed by patients with
      previous negative biopsy, while group B is composed by men with no previous negative prostate
      biopsy.

      To reach primary aim, men with positive MRI (clinically significant lesions with PI-RADS
      score >= 3) and biopsy data will be considered.

      In men with negative MRI (clinically insignificant lesions or regions classified as PI-RADS 2
      at MRI), follow-up with PSA data and repeated MRI and/or biopsy will be considered.
