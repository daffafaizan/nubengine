      biotherapies. The success of this therapeutic strategy is based on several factors, including
      the medication adherence. Whatever the method used, adherence evaluation is not sufficient,
      around 66% of the treated patients. Nevertheless, studies analysing the predictive factors of
      medication adherence in RA are rare.

      RA patients are also educated about the infectious risk related to RA and treatments, and the
      importance of vaccination. These recommendations are not always respected by the patients,
      without knowing the exact factors leading to this decision. Furthermore, a lot of patients
      take personal initiatives without the agreement and the help of their practitioner, like
      diets or special feeding behaviors. Lastly, plenty of patients affected bv chronic diseases
      claim and use electronic health tools without any real evidence of the efficacy of such
      device.

      The aim of this study is thus to evaluate RA treatment adherence considering demographic
      data, vaccination coverage, feeding behavior and the use of e-health tools.
