      legs. Electrodes will be placed on the skin of your lower legs and a box that delivers
      electrical current will cause a tingling feeling in the legs. Subjects will be asked to
      perform three gait tasks with the device on and off to compare the effects of the sensory cue
      on the speed/time to complete gait tasks and the frequency and duration of any freezing
      events. This use of the device (TENS unit) is investigational. While it has been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pain, it has not been approved for the
      treatment of freezing. Because the TENS unit can provide a sensory cue, it may help to
      prevent or reduce freezing. If it is found that this cue works, it could lead to new
      treatments for the treatment of freezing.
