      be conducted. If participants are eligible, they will be asked to come in for three separate
      visits. During the first visit, participants will complete questionnaires as well as a
      structured interview with one of the study's staff members at Palo Alto University in Los
      Altos. During the second visit, participants would come to Palo Alto University in Los Altos
      and complete questionnaires as well as a testing session involving various tasks. During the
      third visit, participants would undergo a non-invasive brain scan in which participants would
      complete a task as well as various questionnaires at Stanford University in Stanford.
