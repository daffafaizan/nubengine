      general, for these patients anti-hormonal therapy is the therapy of first choice. Despite
      good responses in 50-60% of the patients, unfortunately all patients develop (acquired)
      resistance. Patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance can be subdivided into three
      different groups: (1) patients that have lost ER-expression (~25%), (2) patients with
      preserved ER-expression (~55%) and (3) patients with enhanced ER-expression (~30%). Several
      studies suggest different treatment strategies for these three different ER-phenotypes in
      antihormonal resistant breast cancer. In patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance,
      ~30% of the patients still respond to hormone-additive therapy with estrogens. In vitro
      studies have shown estrogen-induced apoptosis in long-treated estrogen deprived cells
      (simulating aromatase inhibitor resistance). It is suggested that this
      estrogen-hypersensitivity is accompanied by increased ER-expression.

      Whole-body imaging of ER-density is now possible with positron emission tomography with the
      16-alpha[18-fluoro]-17beta-estradiol tracer (FES-PET). FES-PET has shown to be a predictive
      biomarker for response to first line anti-hormonal therapy.

      In this study we will include 50 patients, heavily pretreated with anti-hormonal therapy. All
      patients will undergo FES-PET at baseline and start estrogen therapy. Investigators and
      patients will be blinded for FES-PET results. Responders and non-responders will be defined
      using RECIST criteria and clinical follow-up. After response has been determined, FES-PET
      results will be analyzed. We hypothesize that patients responding to estrogen therapy can be
      identified on basis of high ER-expression determined by FES-PET.
