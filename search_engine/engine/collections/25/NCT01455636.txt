      with an improved MNP (plus nutrition education) to prevent infections, improve feeding and
      ultimately to improve growth among LBW infants in Bangladesh.

      Specific Objectives Although the applicants clearly understand that the primary purpose of
      the Alive and Thrive RFP is to improve infant feeding, we believe that by preventing
      infections, feeding will improve and growth will accelerate. Thus our primary objective is to
      determine the relative effect of intervention packages to improve feeding and thus prevent or
      reverse linear growth faltering and reduce rates of stunting among LBW infants (Ha:
      Combination of all three interventions will improve feeding and prevent or reverse linear
      growth faltering and reduce rates of stunting)

      Secondary objectives (i) Investigate the effect of intervention packages on rates of diarrhea
      and acute respiratory tract infection (ARI).

      (Ha: Combination of all three interventions will reduce on rates of diarrhea and acute
      respiratory tract infection) (ii) Explore the effect of the intervention packages on energy
      and nutrient intakes of infants and their feeding behaviors.

      (Ha: Combination of all three interventions will increase energy and nutrient intakes of
      infants and improve the feeding behaviors) (iii) Determine the impact of the improved MNP on
      iron status (hemoglobin level in blood) in a subgroup.

      (Ha: The group receiving the improved MNP will have increased hemoglobin level in blood and
      reduced rates of anemia)
