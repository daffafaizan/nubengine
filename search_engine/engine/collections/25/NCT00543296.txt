    
      Purpose: To collect medical information on a sustained release drug delivery system that
      delivers the corticosteroid, fluocinolone acetonide, directly into the vitreous cavity of the
      eye. This system has the potential to maintain therapeutic drug levels in the eye while
      reducing systemic exposure to the drug to negligible levels. RetisertTM is the trade name for
      the intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant.

      Hypothesis: The RetisertTM will be a safe and effective method to manage patients with severe
      uveitis
