      is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there are
      no successful interventions to address these impairments. Prospective memory impairment is a
      particularly functionally- and clinically-relevant problem in PD. The investigator's project
      will determine if a targeted intervention strategy improves PD participants' prospective
      memory. The investigator will use a randomized controlled design and a laboratory-based
      assessment of prospective memory to test the effect of the strategy in a controlled
      environment. The investigator will also see if PD participants, with support from an
      occupational therapist (OT), can generalize the strategy to their complex, real-world
      environments and tasks. Our goal is to improve PD patients' everyday prospective memory so
      they can successfully perform desired activities and roles.
