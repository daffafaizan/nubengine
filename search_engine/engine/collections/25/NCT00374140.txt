    
      This is a phase II, two-stage, open-label, single-agent study of the experimental drug RAD001
      (everolimus) in patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer. Patients may have
      received up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for small cell lung carcinoma, but no prior
      therapy with an m-TOR inhibitor. RAD001 will be administered orally at a dose of 10 mg daily.
      A cycle will be defined as 3 weeks of study drug administration, and patients will have tumor
      measurements every 2 cycles. Study participation will continue until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicities. In addition, in patients who consent, archival tumor tissue (paraffin
      block from original biopsy) will be collected for research purposes.
