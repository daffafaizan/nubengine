      provided by participants will be evaluated by Human Multigene Methylation Detection Kit
      (Fluorescent PCR). The kit will be used to qualitatively detect methylation levels of
      multiple genes in human stool samples in vitro by using Quantitative Methylation Specific PCR
      (qMSP). The principle of the method is as follows. First, the target DNA in human stool is
      extracted by magnetic bead-capture technology and then treated with sodium bisulfite. The
      sequence of unmethylated DNA will be changed while that of the methylated DNA remains the
      same after sodium bisulfite treatment. Subsequently, qMSP is employed to detect methylation
      levels of target genes in addition to ACTB gene (a reference gene). Controls of ACTB gene
      with and without methylation are tested simultaneously. Result of qMSP is dichotomized as
      positive and negative based on Ct value obtained. The test result is then verified by Sanger
      sequencing and compared with that from colonoscopy examination and pathology report. The main
      evaluation indexes for test performance are sensitivity, specificity, consistency rate, kappa
      coefficient.
