    
      The study is a longitudinal cohort study of all eligible ankle injuries per the eligibility
      criteria presenting to Sheffield Children's NHS Fountain Trust. These children and their
      parents/carers are presented with an information sheet regarding the study and are then
      invited to enter the study.

      Once consented - by appropriately trained research and/or clinical staff - those recruited
      are treated in either cast or boot on the basis of block randomisation.

      Patients are followed up per protocol and outcomes completed by patients and clinicians.

      Study information is kept securely for future analysis and write up.
