    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 555 patients
      were randomized to one of three treatment groups (secukinumab 150 mg Load, secukinumab 150 mg
      No Load or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1):

        -  Group 1 (secukinumab 150 mg Load): secukinumab 150 mg (1 mL, 150 mg/mL) s.c. prefilled
           syringe (PFS) at baseline (BSL), Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by administration every four
           weeks starting at Week 4

        -  Group 2 (secukinumab 150 mg No Load): secukinumab 150 mg (1 mL, 150 mg/mL) s.c. PFS at
           BSL, placebo at Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by secukinumab 150 mg PFS administration
           every four weeks starting at Week 4

        -  Group 3 (placebo): placebo (1 mL) s.c. PFS at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, 3, followed by
           administration every four weeks starting at Week 4 Based on the clinical judgment of
           disease activity by the investigator and the patient, background medications, such as
           NSAIDs and DMARDs, may have been modified or added to treat signs and symptoms of
           nr-axSpA from Week 16 on.
