      Pittsburgh in 1990s. It was primarily designed for children and it has been used in pediatric
      cardiac surgery in Boston's Children Hospital since 1994.

      There are few studies regarding the del Nido cardioplegia. A prospective, randomized trial
      was designed to determine the efficiency of the del Nido cardioplegia when compared to
      multidose cold blood cardioplegia in cardiac procedures with short and moderate cross-clamp
      times.

      For the analysis of two cardioprotection protocols, it is essential to compare groups equal
      in terms of the surgery and perioperative care, with the same surgical risk and cross-clamp
      time. The research required elimination of all the unnecessary variables.

      The patients undergoing aortic valve replacement procedure were selected as a study
      population. A group of 150 patients will be randomized either into del Nido cardioprotection
      protocol (75 participants) or into the cold blood cardioplegia protocol (75 participants).

      The intraoperative and perioperative outcomes of using each solution will be presented and
      compared (see the endpoints).
