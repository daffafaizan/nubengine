      platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 pathway, and has been reported in 1 to 61 % of patients
      treated with ASA. Impaired response to ASA has been associated with an increased risk of
      ischemic events in patients with known coronary artery disease. We sought to investigate the
      incidence of ASA-R in clinical practice.

      All consecutive patients under chronic ASA treatment (100mg/d) seen at our outpatient clinic
      were systematically included in the registry. All patients were on acetylsalicylic acid for
      CAD for at least 1 month. Patients were informed of ASA testing at start of consultation in
      the outpatient clinic. Eligible patients provided written informed consent. Peripheral venous
      blood samples were analyzed using the whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry Multiplate
      analyzer. The Multiplate analyzer device allows to measure platelet aggregation by the
      attachment of platelets to two silver coated copper electrodes leading to a rise of
      electrical resistance in the sample. The measurements are expressed as arbitrary aggregation
      units (AU) and the manufacturers defined cutoffs were used: normal values were 76-136 AU,
      partial antiaggregation was defined as ASA values between 31 and 75 AU and complete
      antiaggregation was defined as ASA values < 31 AU.
