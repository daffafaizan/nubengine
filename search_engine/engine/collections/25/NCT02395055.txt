      tolerance and safety of single subcutaneous injection of BCD-057 (CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) and
      Humira in healthy volunteers. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that BCD-057 is
      equivalent to Humira in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety after single
      subcutaneous injection in healthy volunteers.

      The study will enroll 94 healthy volunteers, who will be randomized into 2 groups (1:1
      ratio): volunteers from the first group will receive BCD-057; volunteers from the second
