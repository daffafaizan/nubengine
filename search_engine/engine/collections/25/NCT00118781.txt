    
      Patients will be randomized and receive their first dose of Study Drug within 24 hours of
      oral/nasal intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The Study Period will
      begin with the first administration of Study Drug (Study Day 1). Three mL of Study Drug (9 mg
      iseganan or matching placebo) will be applied to all visible surfaces in the oral cavity and
      the oral portion of the endotracheal tube (for non-tracheostomy patients) every 4 hours
      through Study Day 14, or until the diagnosis of microbiologically-confirmed pneumonia (based
      on central laboratory results) or extubation, whichever occurs first.

      All patients will be evaluated for clinically defined pneumonia at least once daily and, if
      diagnosed, blood specimens will be collected and cultured, and a bronchoscopic alveolar
      lavage (BAL) specimen (for intubated patients) or a respiratory secretion specimen (for
      extubated patients) will be obtained PRIOR to initiating or changing any systemic
      antimicrobial therapy.
