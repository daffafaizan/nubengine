      greater risk for fractures than women with normal bone mineral densities (BMD). Low
      BMD-related fractures are associated with significant long-term impairment, high morbidity
      rates and high medical costs. Optimal preventive and sustainable interventions for osteopenic
      women are not yet well-defined.

      Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise that is growing in popularity in the U.S., shows may be an
      effective, safe and practical intervention for women with low bone density. Preliminary
      studies suggest Tai Chi can reduce rates of BMD decline in post-menopausal women. While
      suggestive, these studies have numerous design limitations.

      We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and feasibility of Tai
      Chi as an adjunct to standard care for post-menopausal osteopenic women. Eight-six osteopenic
      women ages 45-70 will be recruited from a large multi-specialty group practice. Our primary
      aim is to assess the feasibility for recruiting and retaining osteopenic women into a
      randomized controlled trial of 9 months of Tai Chi. Our secondary aim is to collect
      preliminary data on the efficacy of Tai Chi in reducing rates of bone loss in osteopenic
      women using sensitive markers of bone turnover and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The
      results of this study will inform the design of a future trial evaluating the benefits and
      safety for Tai Chi for osteopenic women, as well as the physiological and biomechanical
      mechanisms through which Tai Chi may impact BMD and fracture risks associated with
      osteopenia.
