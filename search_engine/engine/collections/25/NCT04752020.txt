    
      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria will be identified by Massachusetts Eye and Ear cornea
      surgeons during their pre-operative assessment and invited to participate in the study.
      Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient. The patients will then be added
      to a shared Epic patient list with a shared to-do column (outside of the patient record)
      indicating their subject ID and date of recruitment. All subjects will be asked to provide
      their best contact phone number which will be updated in the chart.

      Upon obtaining informed consent, subjects will receive a bottle of Netarsudil from the
      Massachusetts Eye and Ear research pharmacy with post-operative instructions to use the drop
      once a day at bedtime starting on post-operative day 1 . Each patient will then receive
      regular, scheduled post-operative monitoring with a post-operative day 1 visit,
      post-operative week 1 visit, post-operative month 1 visit, and then every 2 month follow up
      for twelve months. Clinical examination, including best corrected visual acuity and
      intraocular pressure, will be recorded during every visit. Corneal topography and specular
      microscopy will be performed during the pre-operative assessment and during each bi-monthly
      visit in order to monitor for post-operative outcomes.

      A retrospective chart review will be performed prior to new patient enrollment for patients
      who had previously had DWEK and did not receive a rho-kinase inhibitor. These patients will
      be included for pre-operative and post-operative vision, pachymetry, corneal topography
      results, and specular microscopy results with minimization of data acquisition as no informed
      consent can be obtained from these patients.
