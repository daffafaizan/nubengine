      symptomatic heart failure with preserved or mid-range ejection fraction and increased left
      ventricular wall thickness. The prevalence of CA among patients with heart failure and left
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is approximately 13%. However, diagnosis of CA is challenging
      because specific clinical signs are often lacking.

      Amyloid fibrils deposit in the extracellular space of the myocardium increases myocardial T1
      values on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Therefore, native T1 imaging provides a promising
      non-invasive method to identify CA.

      A preliminary retrospective analysis of 128 patients with increased LV wall thickness
      identified an area under the curve of 0.9954 (p<0.0001) for native T1 to detect CA. The
      optimal cut-off value was 1341ms, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%.

      The investigators aim to test the diagnostic accuracy of native T1 mapping with the threshold
      of 1341ms for the diagnosis of CA compared to the reference method prospectively. Moreover,
      the web-based ATTR probability estimator for the diagnosis of CA will be evaluated.
