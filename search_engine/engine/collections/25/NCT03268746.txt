      study. Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 9 study visits over a
      4-5-month period. Of these 9 visits, 1 is preoperative, 2 are operative, and the remaining 6
      are postoperative visits. Primary endpoint data will be collected at the Month 3 visit (Day
      90-120 post second eye implantation). The second eye implantation will occur 2-30 days after
      the first implantation.
