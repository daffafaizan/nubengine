      the A7+TouchCare® (Medtrum) patch pump for type 1 & 2 diabetes management.

      Main objective is an estimation of Patients A1C based on the average blood glucose (obtained
      from a Flash glucose monitoring) and to compare it in both groups.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  comparison of mean A1C (laboratory values) between the two groups at Baseline and study
           end. Comparison to be established in a non-inferiority

        -  Observe Skin & overall Tolerance, Technical incidents with the device (failure,
           disconnection, catheter obstruction…)

        -  Colllection of Glucose metrics (minimum, maximum, average/median, standard deviation,
           out of range value, percentage of time in range, glucose variability)
