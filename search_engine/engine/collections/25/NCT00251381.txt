    
      -  To determine the 1-year rate of locoregional disease control in the experimental arm,
           using a control arm to avoid selection bias.

        -  To determine the 2 and 3 year rate of locoregional disease control.

        -  To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab and
           concomitant-boost accelerated radiotherapy followed by 12 weeks of complementary
           treatment with cetuximab. Both acute and chronic toxicity will be assessed.

        -  To determine specific disease-free survival, event-free survival, disease-specific
           survival and overall survival

        -  To determine acute and late toxicity

        -  To determine EGFR, p53, Ki67, and evaluate its value as a prognostic factor.
