    
      Methods :

      Descriptive, bi-centre study on 10 cord blood samples from newborn infants with neonatal
      asphyxia (5) according to pre-defined criteria, compared healthy neonates (5). The total
      duration of the study will be 2 years. Parents will be informed and a signed parental consent
      will be asked in the hours following birth before the in vitro study.

      Biological analysis will include elementary analyses for cell quality control, endothelial
      progenitor exploration, and investigation of mesenchymal stem cells function and of their
      neuronal differentiation potential (on fresh and frozen samples).

      Statistical analysis: comparison between the 2 groups (neonatal asphyxia versus control)
      would use non parametric test (Mann-Whitney)

      This study will allow to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cord blood stem cells
      autologous transplantation in neonatal asphyxia. It will contribute to the determination of
      the feasibility of a clinical trail of autologous, cord blood stem cells therapy in such
      disease.
