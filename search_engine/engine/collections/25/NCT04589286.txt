    
      This is a single-center, Phase II randomized study of MM patients comparing 16 weeks of DLC
      access versus quasi-usual care (quasi-usual because both arms will receive generic
      wellness-related electronic handouts alongside requests for patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      assessments).

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate DLC's impact on B/Z drug usage (excluding lorazepam prescribed for
      chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, or CINV)

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported general quality of life every 1-2 weeks

        2. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported psychosocial distress every 1-2 weeks

        3. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported insomnia every 1-2 weeks

      Exploratory Objectives:

        1. To explore DLC's impact on rates of communications between patients and their treatment
           teams

        2. To explore DLC's impact on clinical outcomes

      Participants may continue study treatment (DLC platform access) for 16 weeks from the time of
      initiating treatment. Participants will not be contacted by the DLC platform vendor after
      this point. Patients will be followed up at Day +101 after SCT, corresponding to
      approximately 3 months after SCT.
