      Dyslipoproteinaemia, reflected by elevated plasma triglyceride and reduced high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, is a cardinal feature of MetS that independently predicts
      CVD and is accordingly a therapeutic target for risk reduction. GW5015156 is a new PPAR-delta
      agonist that could be used to treat dyslipidemia in insulin resistance and obesity. However,
      the precise mechanisms of action of this agent on lipoprotein kinetics in MetS subjects have
      not yet fully been investigated. We therefore carried out a study to study the effect of
      GW5015156 on lipoprotein transport in subject with metabolic syndrome.
