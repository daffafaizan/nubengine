      controls without RBD. In all groups, neurological examinations, olfactory testings, nonmotor
      symptoms evaluations, neuropsychological evaluations (detailed outcomes are in the outcome
      section) will be performed at baseline evaluation after enrollment. Image data will be
      obtained on following modalities: brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      18F-N-ω-fluoropropyl- 2β-carbomethoxy- 3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane ([18F]FP-CIT) positron
      emission tomography (PET), and 18F-fludeoxyglucose([18F]FDG) PET.

      To assess progression toward Lewy body disorders, patients in iRBD group will be evaluated at
      2, and 4 years of follow-up visit. Clinical, neuropsychological tests, brain MRI, and two PET
      scans will be administered. After 4 years, patients who are willing to participate will be
      additionally followed-up yearly as a routine clinical visit with clinical and neurological
      examinations until obvious signs of Lewy body diseases will develop.

      In PD-RBD group, patients will be evaluated at 3-year follow-up period amongst days of
      routine clinic visits with administering clinical and neuropsychological tests.
