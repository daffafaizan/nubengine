      ascertainment bias plays a role in this sexual dimorphism, no plausible mechanism to fully
      explain this difference has been proposed.

      This investigator initiated study will provide currently unavailable data on sexual/age
      differences in response to GH stimulation testing. Data obtained from the study may provide a
      basis for developing appropriate normal ranges for adult GH testing, may provide a plausible
      mechanism for the enhanced hormone responsiveness observed in females, and may provide data
      on when the sexual differences to GH stimulation may develop.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Confirm the sexual dimorphism in growth hormone responses for adult growth hormone
           testing in healthy male and female subjects

        2. Correlate peak Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH)/arginine induced growth hormone
           responses with G protein levels in healthy subjects and in patients with a history of
           childhood GH deficiency

        3. Determine whether sexual dimorphism is acquired during puberty
