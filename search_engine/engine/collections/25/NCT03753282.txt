    
      The study is to describe the course of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head from
      initial diagnosis and to collect data on treatment options and the further course in these
      cases. The duration from initial diagnosis of AVN to joint replacement as total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) will be analysed and the course after joint replacement with potential
      short- and long-term complications will be evaluated.

      The impact of THA after AVN on activities of daily living will be assessed by Euroquol 5
      Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)
      questionnaires.
