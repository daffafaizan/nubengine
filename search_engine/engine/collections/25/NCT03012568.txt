    
      This is a prospective, multi-center clinical study designed to confirm the safety and
      effectiveness of St. Jude Medical low voltage pacemakers, high voltage dual chamber
      Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
      Defibrillators (CRT-D) with various leads in an MRI environment.

      The study will enroll subjects across multiple geographies and sites. Sites in geographies
      where MRI labelling is not yet approved may also be included after appropriate IRB/EC and
      local regulatory approvals, as applicable, are obtained. A prospective, multi-center study
      design is chosen for generalizability of study results.

      The clinical study will be conducted in approximately 40 centers worldwide. Approximately 88
      subjects total (with a minimum 22 subjects for each of the four device/lead combinations)
      will be enrolled in this study.

      Enrollment in the study is expected to take approximately 6-8 months. Subjects will be
      followed for 1 month following the MRI scan. The total study duration of the study is
      expected to be 10 months, depending on the rate of enrollment.
