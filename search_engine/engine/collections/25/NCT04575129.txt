      functional losses. As a result, this situation is associated with many disabilities.
      Evaluation of neck joint motion is essential in patients with chronic neck pain. It is used
      to evaluate the neck pain level and functional deficit level of the patient. In this way, it
      is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment applied to the patient during the
      rehabilitation process. Generally, this evaluation can be made and interpreted by an
      experienced clinician. However, patient perception provides a better understanding of
      patients' needs and problems by converting clinical data into a patient-centered measure.
      Moreover, the patient's perspective can add valuable information to the examination by
      creating a holistic picture of the patient's problems, possible needs, and expectations. In
      2018, the "Self Administered Neck Mobility Assessment Tool (S-ROM-Neck)" survey was developed
      by Langenfeld et al. With this questionnaire, developers purposed to evaluate the neck joint
      motion perception of the patients, subjectively. There is no Turkish version of the
      questionnaire. The aim of our study is to develop the Turkish version of the S-ROM-Neck
      questionnaire, to analyze its cultural adaptation, and to reveal its validity and
      reliability.
