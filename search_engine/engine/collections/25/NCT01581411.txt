           ophthalmic artery (the blood vessel feeding the eye), in patients with recent severe
           central retinal vein occlusion, may reopen the central retinal vein and improve retinal
           blood flow, which may in turn improve visual acuity and prevent the long-term
           complications of the disease.

        2. Experimental intervention: An outpatient procedure during which the ophthalmic artery is
           selective catheterized (with a small plastic tube called a microcatheter introduced from
           the artery of the leg) and infused with t-PA during two hours.
