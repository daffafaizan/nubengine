      breast cancer, who have received no prior chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy for advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer.

      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan, alone or with
      pertuzumab compared with the standard of care treatment (taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel],
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab). This study aims to see if trastuzumab deruxtecan allows patients
      to live longer without the cancer getting worse, or simply to live longer, compared to
      patients receiving standard of care chemotherapy. This study is also looking to see how the
      treatment and the cancer affects patients' quality of life.
