      COVID-19. No treatment is available for early disease stages and non-hospitalized patients to
      date. This trial focusses on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with pre-existing risk factors for
      a moderate or severe COVID-19 disease course. This study is a 4-arm, multicenter, randomized,
      partly double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent
      serum (CP) or camostat mesylate with control or placebo in adult patients diagnosed with
      SARS-CoV-2 and high risk for moderate/severe COVID-19. Camostat mesylate acts as an inhibitor
      of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and prevents the virus from entering the cell.
      Convalescent plasma (CP) represents another antiviral strategy in terms of passive
      immunization. The working hypothesis to be tested in the RES-Q HR study is that the early use
      of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate (FoipanÂ®) reduces the likelihood of disease
      progression to modified WHO stages 4b-8 in SARS-CoV-2 positive adult patients at high risk of
      moderate or severe COVID-19 progression.
