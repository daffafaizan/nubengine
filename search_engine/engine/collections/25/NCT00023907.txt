        -  Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent
           platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
