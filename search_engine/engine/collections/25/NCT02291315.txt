    
      Postmenopausal Thai women (n=22) will be recruited from the community surrounding Bangkok and
      Nakhon Pathon, Thailand. They will be invited to participate in an isotope study comparing
      the fractional calcium absorption from milk and cassia. Upon arrival, a fasting blood sample
      will be drawn on the morning of the absorption study to analyze serum markers of vitamin D
      and bone metabolism (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25OHD], parathyroid hormone [PTH], and
      beta-crossLaps) and to determine their impact on calcium absorption. Following this blood
      draw, women will receive a stable calcium isotope (42Ca) intravenously. Then for breakfast
      and lunch respectively, the women will be randomly assigned to orally ingest a stable calcium
      isotope from either the milk (44Ca) or cassia (43Ca) test meals. On day two, women will
      receive a breakfast, snack, and lunch meal. Urine samples will be collected over the entire
      28 hour period and the 24-hr urine collection will be used to measure urinary calcium
      concentration and to calculate fractional calcium absorption.
