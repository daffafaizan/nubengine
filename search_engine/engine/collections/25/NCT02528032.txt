      with a descriptive purpose and identification of the computed parameters should be
      secondarily test a large multicenter cohort . Patients in the study will be explored in
      RICART preimplantation as then in the manner used in current clinical routine. The use of
      data by cons will focus on the study of new tools ever compared in the same patients.

      Data echocardiography (as with other techniques) are those used in clinical routine. Then,
      the data processing to be carried characterized the asynchrony posteriori, regardless of
      initial clinical data on a dedicated search software. Each quantitative parameter will be
      compared with others in order to predict the response to resynchronization. Response
      prediction of threshold values to the resynchronization can be obtained and compared to each
      of the tools. The value of relative and an addition to another may be tested.

      The predictive value of the change (delta) of each parameter between the pre- and
      post-implantation to predict response to al resynchronization, will be evaluated.
