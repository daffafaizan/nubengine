    
      MOT115816 will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study to investigate the ability of the motilin receptor agonist GSK962040 to improve L-DOPA
      pharmacokinetics (PK) by enhancing gastric emptying via motilin receptor agonism. Subjects
      will be randomized to receive 50 mg GSK962040 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio administered orally
      once daily for 7-9 days. The study will consist of a screening/baseline period, a treatment
      period, and a 14-day post treatment safety follow-up visit. During this period participants
      will be asked to attend the study center for 5 visits 3 of which will last approximately 5
      hours. The duration of each patient's participation in the study from screening to follow-up
      visit will be approximately 7-8 weeks. For three of the visits, subjects will visit the
      clinical unit fasted and prior to taking their first morning L-DOPA dose. Volunteers will
      undergo a complete physical (including cardiovascular monitoring (ECG), vital signs, blood
      samples, and medical history), measurement of plasma L-DOPA levels, completion of patient
      diary to capture the amount of awake time (in hours) spent "on" without dyskinesias, "on"
      with troublesome dyskinesias, "on" with non-troublesome dyskinesias, and "off" and gastric
      symptoms, non-motor and motor symptoms assessments (MDS-UPDRS rating scale and "finger taps")
      and measurement of gastric emptying rate.
