      influence exercise performance (Perret and Abel, 2016). One major problem is the limited
      thermoregulation, especially in subjects suffering from a tetraplegia (Griggs et al., 2015;
      Price et al., 2006). There are only few studies, which investigated the thermoregulatory
      response during real life conditions in wheelchair athletes such as during a wheelchair rugby
      match (Griggs et al., 2017). However, to implement strategies to reduce heat stress (e.g.
      precooling methods) or to determine the influence of heat stress on exercise performance and
      to determine the effects of specific interventions the following two issues seem to be a
      prerequisite: First of all, we need to understand, which thermoregulatory response is induced
      under real life conditions, e.g. by a wheelchair rugby or basketball match. Second, if we
      want to study the effects of potential interventions, a standardised and reliable study
      protocol has to be available, which closely mimics match conditions and induces a similar
      amount of heat stress. Thus, the aim of the study is to measure thermoregulatory and physical
      performance outcomes during a real life wheelchair rugby and basketball match. A further goal
      is to develop and validate a standardised field-based protocol, which induces a similar
      thermoregulatory response as during a wheelchair rugby or basketball match. These knowledge
      builds the basis for future thermoregulatory studies based on a reliable and standardised
      field-based testing protocol.
