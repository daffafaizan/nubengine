    
      The COMPASS Trial (TMI-09-01/NCT01085357) was a prospective, randomized, comparative
      multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CyPass Micro-Stent in
      subjects with primary open angle glaucoma who were undergoing cataract surgery. In the
      COMPASS Trial, 374 subjects undergoing cataract surgery were randomized to the CyPass group
      and received the CyPass Micro-Stent, whereas 131 subjects underwent cataract surgery alone.
      All subjects were to be followed for 2 years postoperatively. Four hundred eighty (480)
      subjects completed this study.

      The COMPASS XT Trial (TMI-09-01E/GLD122b-C001/NCT02700984) was designed to collect safety
      data beyond 24 months postoperatively for subjects who completed the COMPASS Trial. In
      COMPASS-XT, clinical data was collected at 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months
      postoperatively for a total of 5-year follow-up across the 2 studies.

      In this trial, COMPASS XXT, clinical data will be collected annually for the subjects who
      were implanted with the CyPass Micro-Stent in the COMPASS TRIAL until the subject reaches 10
      years post-CyPass implantation. For some subjects, the first visit will be at or after 10
      years post-CyPass implantation, and therefore the first visit may coincide with the Exit
      visit.
