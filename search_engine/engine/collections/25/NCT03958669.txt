      for the treatment with sorafenib that have been identified in a separate patient cohort with
      HCC (Study title "Fingerprint characterization of advanced HCC to optimize treatment
      decisions and enable an early prediction of therapy resistance", ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier NCT02372162). Based on these previous findings, predefined parameters that have
      been found to correlate with therapy responses will be determined for the patients in this
      observational trial. Diagnostic procedures include an image fingerprint (MRI and multi-phase
      CT scan of tumor manifestations, radiomics analysis of defined tumor areas, ultrasound
      elastography and a molecular fingerprint with exome and transcriptome sequencing from tumor
      tissue, liquid biopsy for circulating tumor DNA and miRNA, MR spectroscopy for metabolomics
      analysis of blood and urine. These parameters at baseline will be used to predict therapy
      outcome, which will be prospectively compared to the clinical outcome under treatment with
      sorafenib. A second fingerprint will be collected at 4 weeks treatment and optional at tumor
      progression. New hypothesis generating parameters will be investigated in this patient cohort
      (circulating miRNA, liquid biopsy of predefined genetic alterations, ultrasound elastography
      of liver tumor areas).
