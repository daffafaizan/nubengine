      4-5 tatoos of mucosa at the tumour border should be performed before the onset of treatment.
      Next, the long-course radiochemotherapy or short-course radiotherapy is randomly allocated.
      After 6 weeks interval, the full thickness local excision should be carried out with 1 cm
      margin. Patients with good pathological response (complete response or downstaging to ypT1
      disease)are followed up. Conversion to open surgery is offered to patients with poor
      pathological response (ypT2-3 or positive margin). Close follow-up is carried out in order to
      detect an early local recurrence either in a bowel wall or in mesorectal lymph nodes. Rescue
      surgery is offered in patients with local recurrence.
