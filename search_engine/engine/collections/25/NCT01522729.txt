      development of muscle fatigue, cardiorespiratory response and exercise tolerance to
      constant-workrate endurance cycling exercise in patients with COPD.

      In a double-blind randomized design, patients with GOLD stage II-III COPD will be recruited
      and will complete a constant-workrate cycling test following either the injection of a
      placebo [NaCl, interspinous L2-L3] or an opioid [Fentanyl 25 Âµg, intrathecal L2-L3]
      inhibiting central feedback of peripheral muscles sensory afferents. Quadriceps force (TwQ)
      will be measured by magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve and central chemoreceptors
      response will be assessed by CO2 rebreathing, both performed before and after the injection.
      Finally, TwQ will also be measured after the endurance cycling test to assess the magnitude
      of quadriceps fatigue induced by symptom-limited exercise.
