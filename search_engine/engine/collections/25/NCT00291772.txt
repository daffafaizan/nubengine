      for individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) stopped or delayed the onset of long-term health
      problems. Insulin management is aimed to control blood sugar as near to normal as safely
      possible. However, the possibility of low blood sugars still remains. Low blood sugars the
      major limiting factor in gaining "tight" control of blood sugar. Insulin (the hormone that
      lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (hormone that raises blood sugar) play a key role in keeping
      this careful balance. There is a lack of insulin and failure of glucagon to work correctly in
      diabetes. This leads to high blood sugars right after a meal.

      It is very difficult to have normal blood sugars when someone has diabetes. This may be due
      to another hormone called amylin. This hormone may be too low in people with Type 1 diabetes.
      Amylin is made in the pancreas (the part of the body that makes insulin). Amylin works by
      lowering blood sugars after a meal. Pramlintide is the name of the study drug. It is the
      man-made form of amylin. It is given as a shot (under the skin) like insulin. Pramlintide has
      been FDA approved.

      Studies in adults have shown that amylin lowers the high levels of glucagon made after a
      meal. This results in improved "after meal" high blood sugars and overall blood sugar
      control. Currently, the drug is given as a separate shot from insulin. When given as a shot
      (one dose shot given all at once) to children and young adults, it seems to cause low blood
      sugars right after a meal. The "slowing down" of food digestion may be the cause of the low
      blood sugars with pramlintide use. Another possible cause of the low blood sugars may be the
      way drug is being given (instant shot versus a slow infusion through a pump).
