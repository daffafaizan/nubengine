      pain (NP) after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). NP is a common complication following SCI that
      significantly decreases quality of life. Treatment options are limited, and current
      treatments can have significant side effects. Those with SCI have identified a need for
      additional treatment options, particularly those that are not medications.

      As pain is a subjective outcome, awareness of group allocation could influence treatment
      expectations and participant rated scores of neuropathic pain. It is therefore important to
      ensure that an adequate placebo intervention is utilized. This pilot study will assess
      whether the placebo diet to be used in an upcoming RCT provides sufficient group allocation
      concealment (i.e. ensure participants are unaware of whether they are on the
      anti-inflammatory diet or placebo diet). This pilot study will also assess whether the
      placebo diet is in fact inflammation neutral (ie. induces no reductions in inflammation).
