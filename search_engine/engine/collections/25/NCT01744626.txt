      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Treatment will consist 28 day treatment cycles with a single
      Rituximab infusion per cycle for 6 cycles and twice daily (days 1-28) administration of
      CC-292 with a starting dose cohort of 375mg twice a day. Following safety review of the data
      from the initial cohort and confirmation that the initial dose is tolerable, the next dose
      level will be enrolled with a once per cycle Rituximab infusion for 6 cycles and twice daily
      CC-292 at 500 mg.

      Determination of the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimal biologic effect will be used to
      establish a dose for evaluation in an expansion cohort of 24 subjects. Evaluation of the data
      for subjects in the expansion cohorts will result in establishment of a RP2D.
