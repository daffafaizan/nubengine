      combination of drugs, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carfilzomib has on cancer.

      In part 1 of the trial, small groups of children will be enrolled in steps. The first group
      will be given a certain dose of carfilzomib. If these children do not have side effects which
      are too bad, the next small group of children enrolled will receive a higher dose. This
      increase in doses with groups of people will continue until we find the highest dose of the
      drug that can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects.

      Part 2 of this study will enroll additional patients at the highest tolerable dose found in
      Part 1 in order to get more information on side effects and make sure the dose is tolerable.
