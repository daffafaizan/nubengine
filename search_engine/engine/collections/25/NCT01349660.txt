    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase I study of patients with advanced refractory
      solid tumors followed by a Phase II study for the second-line treatment of patients with
      relapsed/refractory glioblastoma multiforme.

      In the phase I part of the study the optimal dose of BKM120 when combined with bevacizumab
      was determined. In the Phase II part of this study, patients with relapsed/refractory GBM
      following first line therapy are being treated with the BKM120/bevacizumab combination.
      Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed on all patients treated during
      this part of the study. Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after 2 cycles
      (8 weeks). Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment, with
      subsequent reevaluations every 8 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      occurs.

      Two populations of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM will be treated in the Phase II
      trial: 1) patients with no previous exposure to bevacizumab (N= 55) and 2) patients who
      received bevacizumab as part of first-line combined modality treatment (N= 20).
