    
      Adult (>18 years old), advanced heart failure NYHA Class IV patients who are refractory to
      advanced heart failure management and meet study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the EVA2 by
      demonstrating non-inferiority to commercially approved LVADs when used for the treatment of
      refractory NYHA Class IV heart failure.

      Subjects will be followed for 6 months (short-term cohort) and 24 months (long-term cohort)
      after EVA2/HM3 LVAS implantation or until outcome events of transplantation, explantation,
      death or withdrawal, whichever occurs first. Whereas subjects experiencing the outcome events
      of "Severe RHF" and "Disabling stroke" will remain in study follow-up.
