    
      Phase I study proposed to evaluate:

        -  Tolerability of IV regimen carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab in the neoadjuvant
           setting prior to surgery.

        -  Safety/Toxicity of IV regimen in this patient population

        -  Treatment is Carboplatin area under the concentration curve (AUC) 5, Bevacizumab
           15mg/m2, and starting dose of paclitaxel of 60mg/m2 and will be escalated in intervals
           of 10mg/m2 to a maximum dose of 80mg/m2.

        -  Patients will receive cycles 1-3 of carboplatin, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel and then
           cycle 4 will be carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by surgical intervention within 6
