           root canal treatment, will be asked to participate in the study. After cleaning the
           teeth following a standard protocol, a sterile cotton wool will be placed in the pulp
           chamber. provisional restoration with (test group-40 patients) and without (control
           group- 40 patients) nanoparticles will seal the teeth between apointments. After a month
           the cotton wool will be taken out and tansferred to the laboratory. The root canal
           treatment will continue following the standard protocol.

        2. patients with single canal teeth diagnosed with infected pulp and periapical lesion, and
           need root canal treatment, will be asked to participate in the study. Two study group
           (40 patients on each group) will have their canal sealed with a two types of endodontic
           sealers each + the nanoparticles. The control group (40 patients) will have their canal
           sealed with the conventional sealer alone. The patients will be invited to 4 follow ups:
           2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year during which a clinical and radiological
           examinations will be performed.While preparing the post, a small example of the sealer
           will be taken to a test in the lab.
