      1500 grams) admitted to a single patient room in the NICU have improved long-term
      neurodevelopmental outcomes when compared to very preterm infants admitted to an open bay in
      the NICU?

      Babies who will be admitted to NICU will be randomized to either the open-bay unit or single
      room care. The randomization will be achieved through the use of the WANNNT (Winnipeg
      Assessment of Neonatal Nurses Need Tool) and current patient census; this involves taking 1/3
      of the fraction of the patient census on each team and adding it to 2/3 of the fraction of
      the WANNNT. This methodology was reviewed by several IWK Committees including Ethics, Family
      Leadership Council, Neonatal care Committee and the Family Centered Care Committee. This
      randomization is designed to ensure fairness and an equitable workload between the two units.

      Eligible study infants are also enrolled in the Perinatal Follow-Up Program (PFU) as a
      standard of care at the IWK Health Center. The baby's legal guardian signs a consent to be
      enrolled in the PFU Program and to allow collection and use of data for their child as long
      as their child cannot be identified from the use of the data. All families of infants
      admitted to NICU, whether or not they have been enrolled in the PFU Program will receive an
      information package explaining the single patient room NICU compared with the open bay NICU.

      At three years of corrected gestational age, all eligible infants will have the Bayley Scales
      of Infant and Toddler Development - version 3 assessment completed which evaluates cognitive,
      language and motor skills. These infants will also be examined for the presence or absence of
      cerebral palsy.
