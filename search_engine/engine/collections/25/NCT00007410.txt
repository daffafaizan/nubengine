      Abnormalities in the plasminogen activator system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      arterial and cerebral thrombosis. In particular, elevated plasma levels of plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and t-PA/PAI-1
      complexes have been found to correlate with increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI)
      and/or stroke. Vascular fibrinolytic balance is, to a large part, determined by the competing
      effects of t-PA and PAI-1, and reflects a complex interplay between genetic and environmental
      factors. The present collaboration focuses on the common hypothesis that the association
      between activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and atherothrombotic
      events derives from an interaction between the RAAS and the fibrinolytic system.

      The study is part of an initiative "Thrombosis of the Arterial and Cerebral Vasculature: New
      Molecular Genetic Concepts for Prevention and Treatment" which was released in April 1999.
      The objective of the initiative is to establish collaborative teams of closely interacting
      investigators with diverse, complementary areas of expertise to elucidate the molecular
      genetic mechanisms of thrombosis in the arterial and cerebral vasculature.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators will use two population-based samples of unrelated individuals to address
      their aims: 1) study subjects in the PREVEND study in Groningen, The Netherlands in whom DNA
      and plasma samples and clinical data have already been collected and 2) an estimated 2000
      unrelated study subjects from Ghana, Africa in whom data need to be collected. The
      collaborative study focuses on the common hypothesis that the association between activation
      of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and atherothrombotic events derives from
      an interaction between the RAAS and the fibrinolytic system.
