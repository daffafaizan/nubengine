    
      This is an open-label expanded access program to make appropriately matched convalescent
      plasma available for the treatment of patients in acute care facilities infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 who have severe or life-threatening COVID-19, or who are judged by a healthcare
      provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease. COVID-19
      convalescent plasma will be obtained from the Jefferson Blood Bank and will meet all
      regulatory requirements for conventional plasma and FDA's additional considerations for
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma
