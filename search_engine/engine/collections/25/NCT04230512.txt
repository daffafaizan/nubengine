      single 3 hour visit wherein participants will initially stand and then continuously walk at
      their self-selected speed for ten minutes on a level treadmill with the prototype under two
      randomly presented conditions of the mechanical system: 1) fully functional, and 2) locked to
      restrict axial displacement. After written informed consent is obtained, information on
      socket comfort and mobility capability will be collected. A load-cell will be installed
      proximal to the prototype and in-line with the prosthesis to measure instantaneous
      socket-reaction moments.
