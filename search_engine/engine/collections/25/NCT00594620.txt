      deprivation but with a high risk of thromboembolic events. Soy derivatives that contain
      isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen, have been evaluated in peri-menopausal women as a
      possible safer alternative to synthetic estrogens but there has not been a similar study
      performed on their effect in men on androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.
