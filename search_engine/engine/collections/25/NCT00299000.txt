      Naglazyme in preventing the progression of skeletal dysplasia in infants under the age of one
      year who have MPS VI by monitoring physical appearance, x-ray of the skeletal system and
      growth.

      The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the two dose levels of
      Naglazyme in preventing several measures of disease progression in infants under the age of
      one year who have MPS VI by monitoring urinary GAGs, gross and fine motor function, cardiac
      function, vision, hearing, and use of health resources.

      The safety objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of two dose levels of Naglazyme
      in infants under the age of one year who have MPS VI.
