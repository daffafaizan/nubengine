      cardiovascular surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this
      patient population is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment
      techniques and validated outcomes in all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The
      study is therefore aimed to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient
      population and to characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and
      efficiency. In addition, the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and
      dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis,
      reintubation, and discharge status. Participants will undergo two research visits (one pre
      and one postoperative) where they will undergo an instrumental swallowing test and complete
      several patient report outcomes and quick clinical tests. Finally, health-related outcomes
      will be indexed in enrolled participants to determine the impact of dysphagia.
