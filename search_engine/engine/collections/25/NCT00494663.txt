    
      DIO-902 may lower blood glucose by lowering levels of a naturally occurring hormone called
      cortisol. Elevated cortisol may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Clinical
      trials with ketoconazole have been carried out in patients with type 2 diabetes. Three
      clinical trials with DIO-902 have been completed in which 37 patients with type 2 diabetes
      and 42 normal healthy volunteers (people without type 2 diabetes) were enrolled. Patients in
      these studies received multiple doses of DIO-902. DIO-902 may reduce the level of cortisol in
      your blood and therefore may provide you with better control of your blood glucose levels.

      STUDY DRUG ASSIGNMENT

      You will be randomized, that is, given a 1 in 4 chance of receiving either 150mg/day of
      DIO-902, 300mg/day of DIO-902, 450mg/day of DIO-902 or DIO-902 placebo and a 1 in 2 chance of
      receiving 10mg/day of atorvastatin or atorvastatin placebo. The study drug is a tablet and
      will be taken by mouth with water. You will take 3 tablets of DIO-902 or DIO-902 placebo and
      1 tablet of atorvastatin or atorvastatin placebo each day. The tablets will be taken at the
      same time each day (2200h or 10:00pm). Neither you nor your doctor will know which dose of
      DIO-902 or DIO-902 placebo you are on or whether you are taking the atorvastatin or
      atorvastatin placebo. If necessary, your doctor has a way of finding out which dose you were
      assigned.

      Atorvastatin

      If you are taking any cholesterol-lowering drugs, these drugs must be discontinued on the day
      prior to the Pre-Treatment Visit (Week -4) and for the duration of the study. At Visit 1
      (Week 0) you will be assigned to DIO-902 or DIO-902 placebo and to either atorvastatin or
      atorvastatin placebo. You will continue to take the assigned drug until Study Visit 4 (Week
      8). At Study Visit 4 (Week 8) all patients will begin taking atorvastatin through the
      remainder of the study. Your DIO-902 or DIO-902 placebo assignment will remain the same.
      Atorvastatin tablets will be supplied to you until Study Visit 6 (Week 16). At this visit you
      will be given a prescription for a 28 day supply of atorvastatin 10mg.day to last until Study
      Visit 7 (Week 20).

      There will a total of 9 study visits. At each visit all or some of the following will occur:
      blood and urine samples will be taken, physical exam, assessment of side effects, and ECG
      will be performed.
