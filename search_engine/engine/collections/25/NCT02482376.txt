      the intact breast tumor with acceptable cosmetic outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators
      anticipate that pre- and post-radiation breast tumor samples will provide an avenue for
      understanding breast cancer radiation response

      Rationale for single-fraction preoperative technique

      This trial is proposed to build on the favorable results of the investigators' phase I trial
      by extending the findings to a larger cohort of subjects. The preoperative approach has
      several advantages:

        1. a small intact breast tumor results in significantly less uninvolved breast tissue
           receiving high radiation doses which likely decreases toxicity;

        2. more accurate targeting of the high-risk areas of subclinical disease surrounding the
           tumor is possible,

        3. smaller treatment volumes are amenable to dose escalation which can further accelerate
           treatment and improve accessibility for subjects,

        4. this technical approach is widely utilized in other tumor sites and can be delivered at
           most radiation facilities

        5. the pre-operative approach provides a novel opportunity to study breast cancer radiation
           response.
