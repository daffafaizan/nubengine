      in end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA) while preserving motion and physiological load. The
      Cadence™ is a fourth-generation, two-component, fixed-bearing implant with minimal tibial and
      talar resection. It has been in clinical use since July 2016, the purpose of this study was
      to compare the clinical outcome and radiological outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty with
      use of the Cadence™ prosthesis at St. Michael's Hospital.
