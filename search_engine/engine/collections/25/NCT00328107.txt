      hen's eggs. There are several well-recognized disadvantages to the use of eggs as the
      substrate for influenza vaccine. Eggs require specialized manufacturing facilities and could
      be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to an emerging need such as a pandemic. It is
      usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high-yield growth in eggs, a process
      that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and can select receptor variants that
      may have suboptimal immunogenicity. In addition, agricultural diseases that affect chicken
      flocks, and that might be an important issue in a pandemic due to an avian influenza virus
      strain, could easily disrupt the supply of eggs for vaccine manufacturing. Therefore,
      development of alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production has been identified as
      a high-priority objective.

      One potential alternative method for production of influenza vaccine is expression of the
      influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) using recombinant DNA techniques. This alternative avoids
      dependence on eggs and is very efficient because of the high levels of protein expression
      under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.
