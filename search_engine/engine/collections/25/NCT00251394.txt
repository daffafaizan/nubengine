    
      -  Patients will receive four weekly infusions of Rituxan which is standard treatment for
           B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Approximately 30 to 60 minutes after the second, third
           and fourth infusions of Rituxan, the patient will receive up to 3 injections of 1018 ISS
           under the skin. The number of injections will depend upon the patients weight. One week
           after the last Rituxan infusion the patient will receive a fourth and final injection of
           1018 ISS.

        -  After completion of the 5-week treatment period, a physical examination and blood work
           will be performed. The patient will also be examined to see if the tumor has gotten
           smaller, bigger, or stayed the same size and in the same places by either CT scan or
           MRI. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done to examine any changes in bone
           marrow cells.

        -  The following tests will be performed to determine whether or not a patient is eligible
           to participate in this clinical study: Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; lymph node
           biopsy; skin biopsy; standard x-ray tests (x-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasounds, and/or
           radioactive drug scans); and blood work.

        -  While receiving treatment patients will have the following procedures done; Physical
           examination once a week for 4 weeks, blood testing for any changes in the blood, blood
           chemistry and other blood components. Patients will also be requested to keep a diary
           between each study visit to record any health changes or any over-the-counter medication
           or herbal preparation they may have taken.
