      safety and tolerability of single doses and 7 days multiple doses of TAK-020 in healthy
      volunteers. This study will look at the PK characteristics (how the drug acts throughout the
      body) of the drug and safety and tolerability (lab results, vital signs, ECG, and side
      effects) in healthy participants who take TAK-020.

      The study will enroll a total of approximately 120 participants. This study is designed to
      consist of 2 sequential parts: Part 1-a SRD, and Part 2-a MRD. Healthy participants for Part
      1 will be enrolled into 9 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized participants with
      receiving a single dose of TAK-020, and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions.
      In Cohorts 1-9 doses of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 4.4, 8.8, 17.5, 35, 70 and 105 mg will be evaluated.

      Healthy participants for Part 2 will be enrolled into 7 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8
      randomized participants, with participants receiving one dose of TAK-020 on Day 1, followed
      by a washout on Day 2, then daily dosing on Days 3-9 of TAK-020 with 2 participants receiving
      matching placebo under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1-4 doses of 3.75, 5.75, 13 and 25 mg
      will be evaluated. For Cohorts 5-7, the subsequent dose level is to be determined based on
      data from Part 1 and review of safety, tolerability and PK data from Part 2 Cohorts 1-4.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 45 days. Participants in Part 1 will make multiple visits
      to the clinic including a period of confinement to the clinic and will be contacted by
      telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants
      in Part 2 will make multiple visits to the clinic including a period of confinement to the
      clinic and will be observed at the clinic 17 days after the last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
