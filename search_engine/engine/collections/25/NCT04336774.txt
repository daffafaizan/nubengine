      acquire images in patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID-19. By leveraging the
      capabilities of the Caption AI which is designed to train novice users on how to acquire TTE,
      this would minimize the risk of sonographers to be exposed to COVID-19. Additionally,
      minimizing sonographer interaction with patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID 19
      minimizes the risk of sonographers as vectors for transmission to other patients. Lastly,
      since the Caption AI device will be dedicated to the COVID wards and COVID ICU and not
      transported to other locations, use of the CAPTION AI device will help to limit viral
      transmission via the surfaces of the ultrasound machine. These images will be assessed by
      qualified medical professionals for diagnosis.
