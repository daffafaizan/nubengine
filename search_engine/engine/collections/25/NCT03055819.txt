      browlift for patients with age-related brow ptosis. It is a single arm, open label
      multicenter study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Zift Lift System. Up to 20
      subjects in up to 3 sites will be enrolled in this study. Data from this trial will be used
      to confirm the device safety and efficacy and provide inputs to further refine the device
      design and procedure technique for future device iterations Subjects with signed informed
      consents and who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and are treated
      with the device will be considered enrolled in the study. An interim report will be created
      after the first 20 patients has completed their 90 follow up and the data monitored. The 20
      patients, 90 day report may be submitted to FDA and other agencies for product clearance and
      registrations. After FDA clearance has been obtained, the study may be converted to a
      post-market study for the long term follow up.
