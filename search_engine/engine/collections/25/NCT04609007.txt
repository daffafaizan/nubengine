    
      The current study is a pragmatic randomized pilot trial examining the feasibility and effects
      of a brief therapist guided online self-help program based on Cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) . Participants will be randomized to either a treatment as usual condition (TAU) or to
      TAU plus CBT.

      Participants will be recruited via the Swedish national gambling helpline. After assessment
      for eligibility participants will be randomized, using block randomization to ensure balanced
      groups, to either TAU or TAU+CBT.

      The participants will be measured; at baseline, weekly during the intervention (6 weeks),
      immediately after the intervention and at 6 weeks after treatment termination. Informed
      consent will be collected prior any data collection.
