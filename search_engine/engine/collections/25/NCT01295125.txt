      biologic graft versus repair with native tissue.

      The current study seeks to evaluate XenMATRIXTM, an FDA approved biologic graft for repairing
      contaminated abdominal wall defects.

      This study will provide significant insight for the reconstructive surgeon and patient to
      determine whether a biologic graft is necessary for the reconstruction of a contaminated
      ventral hernia repair to provide a durable single staged repair.
