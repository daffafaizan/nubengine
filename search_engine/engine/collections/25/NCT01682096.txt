    
      Design and Aim: This is a prospective pilot study to evaluate the role of multidetector row
      computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out Acute Coronary Syndrome among patients
      presenting to the ER with chest pain complaints, non-diagnostic ECG and normal troponins and
      intermediate pre-test probability for significant CAD.

      Methods: Following the initial clinical evaluation and the results of initial ECG, blood test
      and X-ray, patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to undergo either a CTA
      scan or a Exercise Stress Echocardiogram to rule out significant coronary artery disease.

      CTA will be carried out in a 64 or 128 slice-CT Scanner (SIEMENS,Somaton Sensation 64 or
      128-Flash Definition)following iv administration of iodinated contrast (bolus: 5cc x
      acquisition time (seg)+ 10 cc). Images will be interpreted by two experienced physicians
      (radiologist and cardiologist)

      Stress Echocardiography will be performed and interpreted by an experienced Echocardiographer
      (cardiologist).

      Clinical decision making: Patients with a positive or inconclusive test in each arm will be
      admitted to the hospital for treatment or further additional testing, while patients with
      negative results will be discharged from the ER.

      Safety issues: A phone call and chart review will be performed one month and 6 months
      follow-up to register the occurrence of any major adverse cardiac events, as well as new
      consultation for chest pain.
