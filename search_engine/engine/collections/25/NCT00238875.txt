      following questions should be answered. Can SRT be an alternative standard treatment modality
      for inoperable patients? Can SRT can be a comparable standard treatment modality with
      lobectomy for operable patients? 12 Gy is the daily dose at the isocenter，and 48 Gy in total
      by 4 fractions will be irradiated by stereotactic irradiation over 4 to 8 days.
