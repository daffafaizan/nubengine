      incontinence (MUI) for whom therapy is initiated with surgery to those for whom therapy is
      initiated with non-surgical treatment. Women who are bothered by symptoms of both stress and
      urge incontinence will be randomly assigned to initiate treatment with a surgical (surgery
      for stress incontinence) vs. a non-surgical (drug and behavioral therapy) approach. Follow-up
      will be a minimum of 12 Months.
