    
      This is a single center, open-label, mechanistic study designed to determine the variance of
      the antibody response in non-atopic and ADEH- participants receiving a single dose of the
      2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone® Intradermal vaccine administered per label.

      Twenty non-atopic and 20 ADEH- (mild to severe AD) adults aged 18 to 64 years will be
      enrolled. Enrollment will be closely monitored to ensure that there is a similar distribution
      of non-atopic and ADEH- participants by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

      Eligible study participants will provide a pre-vaccination blood sample (Day 0) for
      assessment of baseline HAI antibody titers, cellular immune response, total IgE, and allergen
      sensitization, and will then receive a single injection of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone®
      Intradermal vaccine administered per label. A subset of participants will also provide blood
      for microarray analysis at Baseline (Day 0) and will return to the clinic 3 and 7 days
      post-vaccination to provide additional blood for microarray analysis. All participants will
      return to the study site 28 days post-vaccination for a blood draw for HAI antibody titers
      and cellular immune response assays.

      Study participants will be followed for safety, including serious adverse events (SAEs),
      throughout the entire duration of the study and will be asked to record solicited AEs on a
      diary card (Days 0-7).
