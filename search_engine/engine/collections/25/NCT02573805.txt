      provided by the Rigiscan manufacturer based on a clinical study on 500 American males.
      Original studies of NPTR parameters on Chinese males are warranted. On the other hand, during
      the past decades, several new NPTR parameters have been developed, like tip TAU (tip
      tumescence activity units), tip RAU (tip rigidity activity units), base TAU (base tumescence
      activity units), base RAU (base rigidity activity units), but their diagnostic values have
      been less evaluated. Basd on the these background, we determined to observe the clinical
      manifestation of these new parameters and to establish the "normal criteria" of NPTR
      parameters in Chinese males. This could be clinically beneficial in the differential
      diagnosis of organic and psychological erectile dysfunction.
