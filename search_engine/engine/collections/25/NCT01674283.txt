      established by the clinic ovo or the fertility clinic of CHUM. On the day of embryo transfer,
      the investigators will administer 1 mg of Glucagon or placebo intramuscularly 10 minutes
      before the embryo transfer. The uterine contractility will be measured by ultrasound before
      and after injection to document the impact of Glucagon on it and we will proceed to embryo
      transfer.
