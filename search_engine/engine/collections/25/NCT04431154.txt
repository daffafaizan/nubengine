      HIV Institute (WRHI) in South Africa. This study will leverage on the existing research
      infrastructure of Ezintsha, including, HIVSS testing through the STAR initiative (Self-Test
      Africa), as well as HIV positive persons identified through other Ezintsha research studies
      and at Eztinsha affiliated health clinics.

      This study will use a randomized trial design to test the effectiveness of incentives to
      increase confirmatory testing, linkage to care and viral suppression. The aim of this study
      is to determine whether HIV-infected men and women are more likely to achieve or maintain HIV
      virologic suppression if offered financial incentives vs. no incentives (standard of care).

      Individuals who report receiving a reactive HIVSS test result on the STAR programme, or a HIV
      reactive test in another research study or at a affiliated clinic, will be randomized into
      one of two groups: a) a control group that receives the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to
      care; and b) an intervention group that receives financial incentives for confirmatory
      testing, linkage to care, and viral suppression.
