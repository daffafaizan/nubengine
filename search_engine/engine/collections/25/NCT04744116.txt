      I. To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus [vs] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each
      of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may
      consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid
      doses have been discontinued.

      ARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of
      cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4
      consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.

      ARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of
      cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks
      for 8 total doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6
      months.
