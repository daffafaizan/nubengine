    
      The Potlako+ trial is a pair-matched, community-randomized study involving 20 rural and
      peri-urban communities in Botswana (population ~190,100 with ~100,000 30 years or older).
      Communities will be randomized 1:1 to the Potlako+ intervention versus standard care. The
      goal of the intervention is to identify individuals with symptoms/signs suggestive of cancer
      and expedite diagnosis (and treatment).

      The trial includes a community education component focused on cancer awareness and importance
      of early diagnosis and a patient navigation component that aims to expedite the diagnostic
      evaluation. Community education will be directed at approximately 50,000 community residents
      (30 years and older). We anticipate approximately 1500 cancer suspects will be identified by
      their clinic providers.
