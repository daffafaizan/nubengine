      accelerated by immunological mechanisms. Genes involved in regulation of inflammation and
      protection against infectious agents may affect picture of the disease . Major
      Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region carries genes involved in innate and adaptive
      immunity and inflammation. We have for the first time, identified genetic factors located in
      HLA region, showing several fold risk for disease predisposition likely forming an important
      component to explain the high incidence of coronary heart disease in the Finnish population.

      The aim of this study is to rerun our preliminary results, and further identify genetic loci,
      or gene variations contributing to the development of CHD. The strategy is to collect
      altogether 5000 patients assigned to coronary angiogram in Helsinki University Central
      Hospital. We will compare the angiogram results to genetic findings first in patients with
      normal coronaries, and in patients with different stages of CHD. Secondly we will compare
      phenotypic changes in inflammation and try to find out if the phenotype differs in different
      genotypes. Thirdly we will collect patients from hospital discharge registry, and compare
      mortality and morbidity results in different gene groups.

      Finally, we aim to record echocardiograms of the aortic valves in altogether 3500 consecutive
      patients undergoing coronary angiography. We try to identify genetic loci and gene variations
      contributing to the fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve.

      The results of the study provide a possibility to develop a gene test to recognize patients
      at risk at its early stage, and needing for preventive medicine.
