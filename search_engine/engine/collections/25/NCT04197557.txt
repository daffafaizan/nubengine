      and Utilization of Survey Findings "(ChiCTR1900022825), more than 20,000 children age 3-18
      years old was recruited from 28 sites of 14 provinces within the framework of the
      ChiCTR190002282 study protocol. The population of this study was proportional to the
      ChiCTR190002282 study. The X-ray of no-dominant hand and wrist was taken with a mobile X-ray
      unit with shielding. A step wedge was imaged along the side of the hand at the same time for
      bone mineral density measurement. The bone age of the hand and wrist was assessed by trained
      MSK radiologists according to Chinese standard. The bone mineral density of the wrist was
      measured with radioabsorptiometry (RA). The demographic parameters were collected by the
      study of ChiCTR190002282 protocol.
