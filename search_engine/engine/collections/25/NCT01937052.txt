      therapy and if a person's genetic information may help us to develop a way to predict the
      side effects a patient may have and how best to treat them. In addition, the investigators
      hope to look at how the side effects from hormone therapy influence a patient's willingness
      to continue hormonal treatment.

      Men and women being prescribed hormone therapies including Tamoxifen, Raloxifene (Evista),
      Anastrozole (Arimidex), Letrozole (Femara), or Exemestane (Aromasin), by their oncologist for
      either prevention of breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer may join.

      The decision of which hormone therapy to receive is the decision of the patient and
      physician, this study will collect samples and patient-reported outcomes during this routine,
      standard of care and will not direct any treatment decisions or interventions in any way.
