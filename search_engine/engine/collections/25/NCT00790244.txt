      patients with high risk to develop metastases. SSG XX is based on a previous SSG trial (SSG
      XIII) regarding use of prognostic markers to identify high-risk tumors and include very
      similar chemo- and radiotherapy treatment schedules compared to SSG XIII, but the new
      protocol also includes a treatment arm with preoperative chemo- and radiotherapy for patients
      with an obvious risk for intralesional surgery initially.

      Patients: In this new adjuvant protocol SSG adopts an inclusion decision algorithm based on
      the following criteria: 1.vascular invasion or 2. presence of at least two of the risk
      factors: tumor size =>8 cm, necrosis or infiltrative growth(all defined microscopically by
      the pathologist. The system was developed retrospectively by evaluation of 434 primary
      histologically high grade (III-IV) STS from the SSG registry, and was later validated in a
      series of 175 patients in which patients with a high risk for metastases (>40 %) and low risk
      (<15 %) were separated (Engellau J et al.Eur J Ca 2007 43: 1927-34). Inclusion criteria: age
      ≥ 18 y and <75 y. Primary end point is metastasis-free survival. Local recurrence and
      toxicity will also be studied.

      Treatment: Six cycles of doxorubicin 60mg/m2 and ifosfamide 6g/m2 will be given adjuvantly
      (to patients ≥ 70y: 50mg/m2 and 5g/m2 ). Dependent on surgical resection margins, 36Gy or
      45Gy (1,8Gy per fraction, two fractions daily) will be given interpolated with chemotherapy.

      Conclusion: SSG XX will evaluate chemo-and radiotherapy given adjuvantly to patients with STS
      and high risk for metastases (arm A). In a specified group of patients also preoperatively
      given therapy will be studied(arm B). Other sarcoma centers are invited to participate in the
      study.
