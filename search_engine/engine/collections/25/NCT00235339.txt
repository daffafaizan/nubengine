      by three hospital rehabilitation units in Norway, one in Trondheim, one in Ã…lesund and one in
      Levanger, compared to an interval treadmill training program. The subjects participating in
      the study are patients with myocardial infarction. The maximal oxygen consumption of the
      subjects will be tested before and after the training period.

      Primary outcome: Maximal oxygen consumption Secondary outcomes: Blood values (for endothelial
      function, blood lipids, etc), flow mediated dilatation, quality of life (SF 36 and MacNew),
      weight, BMI, heart rate fall 1 minute after stopping the maximal treadmill test.
