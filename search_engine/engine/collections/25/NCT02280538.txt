      followed at two Portuguese hospitals (Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Norte - Hospital Santa
      Maria, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental - Hospital Egas Moniz).

      All patients selected will be included in the intention-to-treat group. Then, using blocked
      randomization method they will be assigned to receive either IAHA, or placebo (saline
      solution). At both hospitals the study will consist of four injections of IAHA, 6 months
      apart, plus a 6 month period after the injection, resulting in a total follow-up period of 24
      months. Before each new cycle a follow-up consultation will be performed in order to assess
      pain and function (KOOS), quality of life (SF-36), adverse events and consumption of
      acetaminophen and NSAIDS regarding the week before evaluation. X-rays will be performed in
      the beginning of follow-up, one year after that and 6 months after the last cycle of IAHA or
      placebo injections (24 months).

      Ultrasound evaluation will be performed at the target knee in same time points as X-rays by
      two rheumatologists trained in musculoskeletal ultrasound examination. Additionally, the
      investigators will assess potential biochemical biomarkers of knee OA structural progression
      and response to treatment. Measurements will be performed in both serum and urine and, If
      possible, synovial fluid aspiration will be performed and together with blood and urine
      samples stored at the Biobanco-IMM Instituto de Medicina Molecular for analysis. Biologic
      samples collection will be performed at baseline and repeated at the 4th, 12th, 24th, 36th
      weeks, and then every 6 months.
