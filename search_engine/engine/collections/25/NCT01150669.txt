      I. Determine the potential of lestaurtinib with or without chemotherapy agents in treating
      samples from infants with leukemia.

      II. Determine whether FLT3 protein expression level and/or activation and sensitivity to
      lestaurtinib differ between subgroups of infants with leukemia.

      III. Determine whether lestaurtinib activates STAT5, AKT, and RAS-MAPK and other pathways.

      IV. Determine whether lestaurtinib can synergize with other chemotherapy agents kill infant
      leukemia cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Cryopreserved specimens are studied in vitro with lestaurtinib with or without chemotherapy
      agents. Samples are analyzed for FLT3 protein expression and/or activation; sensitivity to
      lestaurtinib with or without chemotherapy agents; and activation of STAT, AKT, and RAS-MAPK
      and other pathways by western blot. The most effective treatment from this study is then
      validated in vivo in a NOD/SCID xenograft model.
