      occlusion of coronary artery by this plaque rupture. Although current risk assessment for
      plaque rupture have mainly focused on evaluation of plaque vulnerability. However, according
      to the general mechanism of material failure, plaque rupture occurs whenever the external
      hemodynamic stress exceeds the durability of the plaque.

      Recently, we evaluated the axial plaque stress, which is axial component of total traction
      acting on the plaque, and showed that the axial plaque stress possess significantly higher
      magnitude than previously known wall shear stress.

      However, the axial plaque stress in our previous research was measured with computational
      flow dynamics analysis using coronary artery model from coronary CT angiography.

      In this study, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of estimating external hemodynamic
      stress acting plaque with the use of invasively measured hemodynamic data from pressure wire
      pullback tracing.

      In addition, we will also evaluate detailed plaque geometry and vulnerability using optical
      coherence tomography along with the hemodynamic stress.
