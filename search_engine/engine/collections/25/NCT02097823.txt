    
      This will be a pilot study, designed as a randomized, crossover study comparing olanzapine
      and aprepitant in pediatric oncology patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC).
      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of recruitment and data collection for
      conducting a larger trial aimed at comparing olanzapine and aprepitant as antiemetic regimens
      and establishing efficacy of this regimens for pediatric patients receiving HEC. Secondary
      objectives are to obtain preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of olanzapine and
      aprepitant as well as the tolerability of olanzapine in the pediatric oncology population.

      Each patient must be planned to undergo at least 2 cycles of the same cycle of HEC. Each
      patient will be randomized to receive olanzapine or aprepitant in the first cycle of
      chemotherapy, and then will receive the other agent in a second cycle of chemotherapy.
      Patients will also receive ondansetron and dexamethasone with each cycle. Patients with CNS
      tumors will not receive dexamethasone. Response will be measured objectively recording number
      of emesis and use of breakthrough medications. The medications chosen for breakthrough
      medications will be at the treating physicians discretion. A complete response will be no
      episodes of emesis or use of breakthrough medications. A partial response is one or less
      episodes of emesis and one or less use of breakthrough medications. Nausea will be measured
      based on parent and patient scales and will be a separate measure, not included in the
      compete or partial response.
