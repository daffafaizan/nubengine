      marijuana use disorders or on predictors of relapse. Although several factors contributing to
      relapse have been explored in other dependencies (i.e., alcohol, cocaine), little research
      has focused on drug cue-related or stress-induced relapse in marijuana-dependent individuals.
      Cue reactivity is a construct measured in a laboratory procedure where an individual's
      subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses are assessed following exposure to
      drug-related environmental cues or stressors. Investigating the effects of drug-related
      environmental cues and stress in marijuana-dependent individuals will be useful in guiding
      treatment development.
