      of international and local studies, this group has poorer dental hygiene, more severe gum
      disease and more untreated caries. In 2010, a report from the guardians in Hong Kong
      mentioned that most adults with intellectual disability cannot clean their teeth, the have
      dental problems and it is very difficult for intellectually disabled students to co-operate
      during the dental treatment. In order to alleviate their dental problems, supervised
      toothbrushing programme and an oral health education talk are proposed. The investigators
      investigate the effectiveness of the supervised toothbrushing programme and an oral health
      education talk. The target group of the study is mild to moderate grade intellectual disabled
      students of special schools in Hong Kong. A clustered randomised controlled trial design is
      adopted.
