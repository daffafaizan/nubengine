      hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the
      formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the
      legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood),
      hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to
      blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad.

      Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) involves the use of an inflatable cuff placed around
      the limb. This cuff inflates and deflates intermittently in order to squeeze blood from the
      underlying veins. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) leads to a contraction of
      muscles by delivering a series of controlled electrical pulses via skin surface electrodes
      placed over the motor points of the targeted muscle.

      Both IPC and NMES have been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have
      directly compared the two methods and those that have, have used dated NMES techniques.

      The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in terms of lower limb
      haemodynamics.
