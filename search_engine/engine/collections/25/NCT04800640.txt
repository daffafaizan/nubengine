      between 18 and 50 years of age in a hospital in the West of Paran√°. Pain assessment will be
      performed through analogue pain scale, pulmonary function through spirometry and respiratory
      muscle strength through manovacuometry. Four TENS applications will be performed for a period
      of 30 minutes. Through this research, it is expected that the patients who perform TENS
      present a reduction in postoperative pain and, consequently, a lower impact on lung function.
