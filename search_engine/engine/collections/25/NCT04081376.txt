      administration of 4 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride (equivalent to 3.56 mg of
      hydromorphone). The detection of HM consumption can be done by urine immunoassay but several
      immunoassay tests are required to thoroughly detect synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural
      opioids due to the limited cross-reactivity of each assay. Therefore, superior test
      strategies are required to specifically identify low concentrations of opioids.
