    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. TAK-954 is a serotonin (5 HT4)
      receptor agonist and is being tested to treat people who have diabetic or idiopathic
      gastroparesis and who previously reported delay in stomach emptying. This study will look at
      the gastric emptying time of solids in people who take TAK-954 or placebo.

      The study will enroll approximately 41 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-954 0.1 mg

        -  TAK-954 0.3 mg

        -  TAK-954 1 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The duration of treatment is
      3 days and the overall period of evaluation is up to 28 days. The participants will be
      contacted by telephone (Days 10 to 14) for follow-up assessment. There will be another
      follow-up phone call for women of childbearing potential (Days 38 to 43).
