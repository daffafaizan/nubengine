      practice. NG tube is associated with a high rate of morbidity including pulmonary morbidity,
      delayed gastric emptying and finally an increased length of hospital stay. In the era of the
      enhance recovery after major abdominal surgery, the place of the NG tube remains unproven
      after PD even if NG tube is clearly abandoned in liver, stomach and colonic surgery.
      Nowadays, only few retrospective series had reported the feasibility of the absence of
      nasogastric tube after PD, but not with a randomized control trial. The absence of NG
      decompression could be the corner stone of the concept of the enhanced recovery program after
      PD.

      The objective of this prospective randomized monocentric study is to evaluate the impact of
      the absence of NG decompression after PD.

      The aim of the study is to decrease postoperative morbidity after PD including pulmonary and
      delayed gastric emptying complication. The impact of the absence of systematic NG
      decompression could be interesting in terms of public health with a decreased of length of
      hospital stay. Furthermore, this is the first randomized study comparing NG tube
      decompression after PD to absence of NG tube after PD which would bring relevant elements to
      improve the recovery after PD.
