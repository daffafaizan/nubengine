    
      Children with Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) admitted to PICU at Mansoura University Children
      Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt with the need for mechanical ventilation were prospectively
      enrolled in the study.

      Cases were diagnosed according to clinical criteria. The decisions to initiate, wean and
      terminate mechanical ventilation were made independently by the attending consultant in
      accordance with the unit guidelines.

      Outcome variables measured were duration of mechanical ventilation, length of PICU stay and
      ability to walk unaided 4 weeks after PICU discharge.
