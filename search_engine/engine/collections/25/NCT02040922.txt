        -  To investigate how the particular strain of the Campylobacter germ that causes the
           infection, and the strength of the immune response that it stimulates in the bowel,
           affect the risk of long term bowel symptoms.

        -  To explore what changes occur after Campylobacter infection in the bacteria that usually
           live in the large bowel (microbiota) and the chemicals that they produce (short-chain
           fatty acids) when they digest nutrients. We will look for differences between people who
           recover fully and people who have long term bowel symptoms.
