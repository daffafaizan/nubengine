      maximal strength training intervention.

      Methods: Participants will be recruited through invitations at work places and other
      community arenas. The investigators aim to recruit 10-15 subjects in each of the following
      age groups: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70-80 years of age. Both genders will be
      included. All age groups will be matched for age-related baseline maximal strength and
      distribution between the two genders. All participants will be checked via a health
      registration scheme, and excluded if contra indications for hard physical training or testing
      should appear. When in doubt, the projects physician will decide on inclusion or exclusion
      due to a thorough examination. Subjects will give a blood sample to be analyzed for known
      genes such as ACE and ACTN3. The intervention has a pre- post design. Tests of maximal
      strength and power will be conducted in a leg-press machine, using the protocol assessing one
      repetition maximum (1RM) previously described. Force and Power will be measured by the Muscle
      Lab system from Ergotest Tech. (Langesund, Norway). The intervention is an eight week, three
      times per week protocol, each training session consisting of a standardized warm-up, and 4
      repetitions x 4 sets with an intensity of 4 repetition maximum (4RM) performed in the leg
      press machine.There will be a three minutes pause between sets. Participants will be given
      instructions and supervision.

      Hypothesis: Maximal strength training adaptations will be affected by age and baseline
      maximal strength but not by gender or genetic variations.
