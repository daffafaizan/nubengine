      infections typically lead to inflammation and constriction of the airways, which is termed
      bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants with
      respiratory infections, with an average of 120,000 children under the age of one hospitalized
      every year. Viral infection by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, or influenza
      viruses is thought to be by far the major driver of bronchiolitis. The children who need to
      be hospitalized with bronchiolitis have a drastically increased chance (about 45%) of
      developing chronic respiratory diseases such as wheezing or asthma. The disease of asthma
      affects children more than adults, and the Centers For Disease Control states that asthma is
      the most chronic condition among children under the age of 18, affecting more than 6 million
      (or 8.4%) children in the US. Due to this prevalence, asthma is the third leading cause of
      hospitalization among children under the age of 15 years, with the annual direct healthcare
      costs at ~$50 billion every year. The economic costs associated with parental lost
      productivity is another ~$6 billion every year. The American Lung Association states that
      asthma is also one of the leading causes of school absenteeism, with an estimated 13.8
      million lost school days every year. While asthma can be managed with bronchodilator
      inhalers, there is not a single treatment designed to prevent or reverse asthma disease.
      Understanding how viral infection causes initial bronchiolitis and maintains the chronic
      inflammation that leads to asthma will lead to new treatments that prevent or reverse chronic
      lung diseases. This research has the potential to change everyday life for millions of
      children and their families in the US.
