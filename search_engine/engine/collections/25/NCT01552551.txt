    
      This falls prevention program is offered in 11 senior housing sites. Trained instructors from
      the research team provide the Healthy Steps in Motion exercise classes. Participants provide
      a signed form indicating physician clearance for participation. Falls case management
      involves monthly calls to speak with participants about home safety checks, perceived risk
      for falls, and physician contact or other visits to health care professionals to reduce falls
      risk.

      This study is a pilot. The research team is interested in participation and adherence, as
      well as the primary outcome of falls incidence.
