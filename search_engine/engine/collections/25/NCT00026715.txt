      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely used test to measure renal function in
      research studies. However, current GFR tests are lengthy, costly, and too complicated for
      general use in clinical settings. At the present time, therapies for acute renal failure are
      generally unsatisfactory. However, it is likely that effective therapy will need to be given
      early in the course of acute renal failure. We recently developed a simple Fast intravenous
      GFR test that can be performed in 45 minutes that may assist in identification of patients
      with the earliest stages of acute renal failure. This test has been validated in ambulatory
      adults with chronic renal failure. The current protocol will compare the fast intravenous GFR
      test to a reference standard subcutaneous GFR method in patients with acute renal failure,
      sepsis, congestive heart failure, edema, or chronic renal failure.
