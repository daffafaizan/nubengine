    
      Case participants complete case report forms at quarterly encounters throughout an entire
      year, whereas control participants complete a case report form only at an initial encounter.
      Prior to 2021, case participants may have completed case report forms for a period of four
      years or longer.

      A series of validated or recommended research instruments are used or adapted by the registry
      for deployment in its case report forms. These may include some or all of the following at a
      given encounter:

        -  National Institutes of Health Minimum Dataset for Research on Chronic Low Back Pain

        -  Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire

        -  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)

        -  History of Medical Conditions Inventory

        -  Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire

        -  Pain Catastrophizing Scale

        -  Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire

        -  Non-Pharmacological Treatments Inventory

        -  Pharmacological Treatments Summary

        -  Drug Adverse Events Index

        -  Physician Profile

        -  Physician Communication Behavior Questionnaire

        -  Physician Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure

        -  Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18)

      These instruments include measures that may serve as the independent or dependent variables
      in various substudies conducted by the registry over time, including observational studies
      (e.g., case-control studies, cohort studies) and randomized controlled trials.

      The registry also maintains a biobank of biological specimens that have been collected from
      enrolled participants, including saliva and blood that may be used for DNA sequencing or
      biomarker analysis.
