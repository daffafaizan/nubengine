      feature, are useful in predicting survival and determining timing for liver transplantation.
      Preliminary feasibility studies in patients with PSC using high resolution CT with a contrast
      agent (CT cholangiography), has shown excellent depiction of bile ducts. CT cholangiography
      also has the potential to allow quantification of intraductal volume by using sophisticated
      computer programs. This assessment may be an important clinical feature to assess disease
      severity and progression.The information about cholangiographic features could be important
      for therapeutic decisions (e.g., in determining the usefulness of balloon dilatation or
      stenting for a dominant extrahepatic duct stricture), for counseling patients, and for
      therapeutic trials in stratifying patients and assessing efficacy of treatment.
