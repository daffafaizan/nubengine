    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Remsima™ in ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) patients, in comparison with patients receiving other anti-TNF drugs, by
      evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) for up to 5 years from the first visit of each
      patient.

      In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated:

      Identified risks:

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  Opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis)

        -  Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infection and tuberculosis)

        -  Tuberculosis

        -  Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions )

        -  Haematologic reactions

        -  Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome

        -  Demyelinating disorders

        -  Lymphoma (not HSTCL)

        -  Hepatobiliary events

        -  Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL)

        -  Serious infusion reaction during a re-induction following disease flare

        -  Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions

        -  Leukaemia

      Potential risks:

        -  Malignancy (excluding lymphoma)

        -  Skin cancer

        -  Pregnancy exposure†

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy and additional safety of
      Remsima™ in AS patients, in comparison with patients receiving other TNF blockers.
