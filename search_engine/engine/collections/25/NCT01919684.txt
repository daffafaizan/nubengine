    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, sequential, ascending, single oral
      dose study conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will consist of evaluation of LGD-6972 in healthy
      subjects (6 groups of 8 subjects each),and will be followed by Part 2, evaluation of LGD-6972
      in subjects with T2DM (1 group of 8 subjects).

      There will be a Screening Period of up to 30 days. Subjects who qualify for Group G (T2DM)
      will discontinue any anti-diabetic medication on Day -9 (1 week prior to confinement) for
      that group. Subjects in Groups A, B, C, D, E and F will be admitted to the study site on Day
      -1 , and Group G will be admitted to the study site on Day -2. Groups of 8 subjects will be
      randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either LGD-6972 or placebo (6 active:2
      placebo) as a single dose. Group D will receive treatment under fasted and fed conditions
      separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and up to 21 days. Each subject will be
      administered a specified dose of LGD-6972 or placebo under fasting conditions (and fed
      conditions for Group D to evaluate the effects of food on the LGD-6972 PK profile) and will
      be observed through the morning of Day 3 (48 hour post dose assessment). Safety assessments,
      LGD-6972 PK sample collection, and PD assessments will occur during this time. Subjects will
      be discharged from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to the study site
      on Day 7 for a follow up evaluation. After the follow up evaluation for each subject and
      evaluation of all safety and tolerability data, and any available PK data, the dose for the
      next group of subjects will be determined by the Safety Monitoring Panel (SMP).
