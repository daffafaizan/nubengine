      psychosocial consequences. Hypertension is one of the comorbidities associated with obesity.
      Changes in lifestyles through eating behavior and physical activity level are the critical
      components in the prevention and treatment for hypertension and obesity. Data from several
      studies indicate that the usual procedures to promote these healthy habits in health services
      are inadequate. ICTs has been demonstrated as an effective tool for implementation of
      psychological interventions focused on this type of population. This study aims to describe a
      totally self-applied online program (¨Vivir Mejor¨) to promote healthy lifestyles (eating
      behavior and physical activity) for obese participants with hypertension. Participants
      (BMI=25-35) will be recruited from users of a hypertension unit of a public hospital and will
      be randomized into two groups: experimental group "Vivir Mejor" and control group (treatment
      as usual). "Vivir Mejor" program is composed by 9 modules aimed for promoting healthy eating
      habits and increase physical activity. Modules will be sent via Internet periodically. After
      6 months, a follow-up testing phase and a tracking module will be set. The outcomes variables
      will include anthropometric data, changes in eating behavior and physical performance and
      cardiovascular variables.
