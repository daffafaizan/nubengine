    
      This is a single center, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the efficacy, as
      defined by biochemical endpoints, and safety profiles of ACTIMMUNE in ADO2 subject.

      The investigators will treat 12 ADO2 subjects (children or adults age 3-65) with Actimmune®
      via a dose escalation protocol to a dose of 50 µg/m2 subcutaneously three times per week
      (TIW) for 8 weeks. If serum CTX does not increase by more than 25% by week 8, the dose will
      be increased to 100 µg/m2 subcutaneously TIW.

      Individual subjects in whom ACTIMMUNE administration increases bone resorption markers during
      the 14 weeks of this trial will be eligible for a 1 year extension trial.
