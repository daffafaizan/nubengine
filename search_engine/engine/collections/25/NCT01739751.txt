      mortality of this condition. Unfortunately, usual advice is not good enough to reverse the
      sedentary condition in COPD patients. Pedometers are broadly used to measure and to enhance
      physical activity in COPD but their effects in COPD are not well known. The aim of the study
      is to determine the effects of a program using pedometers as a feedback in stable ex smokers
      COPD patients. Patients are recruited for a 3 months individual program promoting daily
      physical activity enhancement and are randomly assigned either to a pedometer-based program
      (experimental group) or to usual care (control group, the measurements at the beginning and
      at the end of the study are: anthropometrics, Spirometry, dyspnea, quality of life, exercise
      capacity and the average one week daily steps. Also the number of acute exacerbations during
      the follow up are recorded.
