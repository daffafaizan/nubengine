      have non tumor portal vein thrombosis will be enrolled. The baseline parameter will be
      recorded and the patient will be randomized into either interventional (vagus
      nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection) or control
      (conventional laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection) group. From
      postoperative day 3, all patients will receive 100 mg oral aspirin enteric-coated tablets
      (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) once daily for 1 year, low-molecular-weight heparin (CS Bio,
      Hebei, China) subcutaneously (4.100 IU/day) for 5 days, and 25 mg of oral dipyridamole (Henan
      Furen, Henan, China) thrice daily for 3 months. At months 3, 9, and 12 after operation,
      electron gastroscopy examination for delayed gastric emptying will be done for all patients.
      Postoperative complications of the digestive system (including diarrhea, epigastric fullness,
      bloating, nausea, and vomiting), liver and renal function, and body weight will be recorded
      at the seventh day, months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after operation. Then one year monitoring will
      be done in the both groups as per the primary or secondary outcome.
