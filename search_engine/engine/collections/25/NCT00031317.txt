      reduction in symptom severity and improve functioning. While numerous pharmacological
      approaches have been used to treat PD, these treatments are limited by variable response
      rates, up to a 6-week lag period prior to the onset of clinical response, and sub-optimal
      side effect profile, including possible worsening of anxiety and insomnia.

      There is recent evidence that the benzodiazepine clonazepam prescribed with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can facilitate a rapid reduction of symptoms in PD. The
      improvement in symptoms was maintained despite tapering the clonazepam prior to the end of
      the study. However, it was unclear if co-morbid depression influenced the treatment response
      to this regimen. In addition, a recent study in patients with major depression demonstrated
      that combined fluoxetine-clonazepam treatment resulted in a more rapid antidepressant
      response than the fluoxetine-placebo combination.

      The proposed study will examine whether combined treatment with a clonazepam and paroxetine
      in patients with PD and comorbid depression will accelerate the onset of clinical response at
      both panic and depression symptoms. PD with comorbid major depression is a more severe
      disorder than PD alone. We will also examine whether the rapid and clinically meaningful
      benefits will be sustained until the end of the study, despite tapering off clonazepam at the
      midpoint of the study. If this study turns out to be the case combined SSRI-benzodiazepine
      treatment may become a standard initial therapeutic approach to PD and comorbid major
      depression.
