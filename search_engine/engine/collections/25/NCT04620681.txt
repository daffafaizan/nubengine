      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after the first therapy (such as azacitidine or decitabine)
      stops working or after progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      Patients with advanced MDS are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine
      or decitabine. These medications can be effective for a few months to a few years, but
      usually lose effect eventually. This study is attempting to design a therapy called
      "non-engrafting, CD8 depleted donor lymphocyte infusion" or "NE-DLI" as a treatment for these
      diseases.
