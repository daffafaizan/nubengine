      (CER). CER was being tested to treat participants who had muscle spasms associated with acute
      painful musculoskeletal conditions. This study looked at medication helpfulness, relief from
      muscle spasms and pain, and improvement in range of motion and daily living activities.

      The study enrolled 180 participants. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups which remained undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study:

        -  CER 15 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looks like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the Russian Federation. The overall time to
      participate in this study was up to 45 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic,
      and were contacted by telephone after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
