      tenaculum to stabilize the cervix. Patient's often complain that tenaculum placement is one
      of the most uncomfortable parts of these procedures. Patient's who agree to be in the study
      will be randomized into one of two groups, either slow tenaculum placement or fast tenaculum
      placement. Throughout the procedure patient's will be asked to rate the amount of pain they
      are experiencing using a visual analog scale. The researchers will then compare the two
      groups. The providers will also rate what they perceived the patient's pain to be with the
      procedure.
