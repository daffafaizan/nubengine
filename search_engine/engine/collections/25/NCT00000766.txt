      patients treated, relapses are common and may accelerate due to development of drug
      resistance, deteriorating immune function, or other factors. Treatment strategies currently
      being investigated include switching patients from one drug to the other or combining the two
      drugs.

      Patients are randomized to receive foscarnet, ganciclovir, or a combination of the two drugs
      (administered sequentially). Initially, patients undergo single or multiple cycles of
      induction therapy for 14 days followed by maintenance therapy. Patients in whom the retinitis
      continues to progress or who are intolerant of the initial treatment switch to the
      alternative drug for further cycles of induction and maintenance. Patients on the combination
      arm in whom retinitis continues to progress are given further cycles of the combination at an
      increased dose, or, if one drug is causing toxicity, are given further cycles with the
      alternative drug. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
