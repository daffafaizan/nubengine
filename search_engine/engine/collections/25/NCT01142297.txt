      implants in the mandible or maxilla to assess implant integration. One implant will be a
      regular SLA implant; the other will have a SLActive surface. The primary objective of this
      randomized controlled study is to evaluate the stability of Straumann 4.1 mm diameter
      implants in the posterior mandible or maxilla of type 2 diabetic patients during the first 12
      weeks after implantation using resonance frequency analysis. The control implant is a
      standard Straumann implant with an SLA® surface and the test implant the same implant design
      with SLActive® surface. Assessments will utilize resonance frequency analysis (RFA), as a
      measure of implant integration, and clinical outcomes of implant success. This study will
      enroll type 2 diabetes patients having glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from 8.0% to 12% at
      baseline.

      The primary objective is to test for statistically significant differences in ISQ values
      between the test and control implants at 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 weeks and 3 months after surgery.
      If a difference of 2 Osstell RFA ISQ units is detected at any time point it will be
      considered that the implant having achieved the higher value is better osseointegrated. This
      split-mouth study design will assess changes in implant stability from baseline as the
      primary outcome at the implant level. This study will require 20 patients to detect this
      difference (SD=2.0 ISQ units) with a power of 80% at the P=0.05 level.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  Implant survival and implant success at 1-year post loading.

        -  The nature and frequency of adverse events/complications between the 2 groups will be
           compared.

        -  Prosthesis success
