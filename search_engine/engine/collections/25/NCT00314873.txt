      and shorter overall survival, in comparison to their lesser-malignant thymoma counterparts.
      This necessitates the need for systemic therapy. Due to the paucity of thymic carcinoma
      cases, the ideal regimen for locally advanced or metastatic thymic carcinomas is not
      defined.To this point, there has not been a study using imatinib in thymic tumors expressing
      the KIT tyrosine kinase protein or PDGF tyrosine kinase protein. This study is important to
      demonstrate if single agent activity is noted for patients with thymic tumors over expressing
      c-kit and/or PDGF. If this current trial is positive, it opens the door to evaluate other
      combination of drugs with imatinib in thymic tumors.
