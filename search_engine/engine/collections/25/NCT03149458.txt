      program (experimental group) or a upper-limb rehabilitation program (control group) for 8
      one-hour sessions. These activities are carried out in the form of a workshop and are already
      proposed in common practice in the service. They are carried out by the physiotherapists of
      the service. Patients are assigned in one of two study groups. It is specified that they will
      be able to carry out the program of the opposing group at the end of the study in order to
      limit the "disappointment" effect. The evaluations will be carried out at 4 and 8 weeks and
      will mainly rely on data of balance, function, quality of life and satisfaction
