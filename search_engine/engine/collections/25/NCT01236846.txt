    
      In a 12-week randomized controlled trial ( double-blind study), based on data on serum
      25(OH)D changes from other studies (35), to achieve 1 standard deviation difference in
      circulating 25(OH)D with two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2 after a 12-week
      intervention period, the sample size was calculated 40 individuals per treatment group.
      Considering 3 polymorphic variant groups and one control group which receives plain yogurt
      drink, 160 subjects are needed. Allowing for 10% attrition over 12 weeks of intervention, a
      total of 180 subjects are required. In treatment groups, all patients receive 500 ml per day
      of low-fat (1%) Yogurt Drink fortified with approximately 500IU of vitamin D3 . Control group
      receives 500 ml per day of plain (unfortified) Yogurt Drink. Metabolic, inflammatory and
      oxidative stress markers are evaluated at the beginning and in the end of the interventional
      period.
