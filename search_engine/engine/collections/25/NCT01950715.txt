    
      Twenty four patients with IBS-D or IBS-M according to the ROME III criteria, will be enrolled
      in the study.

      Having meet inclusion criteria, the patients will be examined with Multimodal Stimulation at
      baseline and at six weeks in the sacral nerve stimulation test period.

      During the Multimodal Stimulation the patients will have impedance planimetry conducted
      before and after a standardised meal to evaluate on their gastro-colic response without and
      during sacral nerve stimulation.

      The patients enrolled in the study will in the same time period participate in another study
      evaluating subsensory sacral nerve stimulation. A study registered at clinical trials.

      Here patients are randomised to receive either OFF-subsensory or subsensory-OFF stimulation
      in a 2+2-week period followed by 2 weeks of suprasensory stimulation. Hereby rendering a
      stimulation test period of a total of 6 weeks (a permanent electrode is used).
