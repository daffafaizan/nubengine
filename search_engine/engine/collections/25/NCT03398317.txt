      quality, and implantation rate. And a positive correlation with miscarriage rate in the 1st
      trimester.

      Sperm selection methods like PICSI and MACS have been developed for selecting a healthy
      mature non apoptotic sperm with healthy membrane for Oocyte injection so as to obtain best
      embryo quality and achieve higher ongoing pregnancy rates.

      A sperm selection technique based on sperm membrane binding to hyaluronic acid (PICSI Dish),
      the main substrate of the oocyte zonapellucida, could improve the likelihood of obtaining
      better sperm for ICSI with non fragmented DNA. Another sperm selection technique based on
      Magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) that depends on the binding of protein Annexin V to
      phosphatidylserine which is a marker for apoptosis, giving a resulting (eluted) spermatozoa
      without DNA fragmentation.

      In order to determine which sperm selection technique is better for dealing with DNA
      fragmentation patients we need to study both techniques on two different groups of patients
