      scenarios that preclude the placement of arteriovenous fistulae. There is scarcity of
      evidence to support the current preference of synthetic conduits over biologic grafts in
      clinical practice. Advances in the design of AVG's warrant contemporary comparisons between
      synthetic and biologic AVG options. This is especially important as biologic conduits may
      confer an advantage by virtue of their inherent similarity to the native human vasculature.

      The overall goal of this project is to compare one and two year patency (functional, primary,
      primary assisted and secondary), complication rates and re-intervention rates between BCA and
      standard ePTFE grafts. The investigators hypothesize that vascular patient who will receive
      the BCA graft will have improved patency as well as lower complication and re-intervention
      rates compared to the standard ePTFE graft.
