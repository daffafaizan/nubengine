      the actual source of infection. The objective of antisepsis is to eliminate or significantly
      reduce the number of microorganisms in the surgical field at the time of surgery. The eyelids
      and the conjunctiva are considered to be quite common sources of bacteria that can lead to
      endophthalmitis. Thus, it is believed that by reducing the number and growth of bacteria on
      the ocular surface and adnexa before surgery, the risk of postoperative infection would be
      lower. Povidone-iodine 5% eye drops has been used in preoperative cataract surgery to prevent
      endophthalmitis and is the standard prophylactic action in preventing postoperative
      endophthalmitis being widely compared with other antibiotic eye drops and their associations.
      The standard procedure of prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis corresponds to
      applying a single drop of povidone-iodine 2min before any intraocular surgical procedure.
      However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 5% eye drops using
      different dosing regimens to achieve the best bactericidal effect. The aim of this study is
      to investigate different dosages with respect to the use of povidone-iodine drops to optimize
      the effectiveness of the agent, ensuring the best exogenous endophthalmitis prophylaxis.
