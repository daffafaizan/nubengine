      for the treatment of cutaneous metastases with standard treatment: electrochemotherapy with
      intratumoral injection of bleomycin. Separate randomisation will be performed and the lesions
      will be treated with either intratumoral injection of calcium or bleomycin. It is a once only
      treatment and the patients will be followed up for 6 months.

      It is a non-inferiority study and we accept a difference in response on 15%.
