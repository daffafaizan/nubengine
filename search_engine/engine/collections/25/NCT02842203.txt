      apoptotic or necrotic tumor cell turnover. Characteristic of the malignant process, ctDNA can
      be assessed in plasma and offers the potential of a sensitive and specific biomarker for
      prognostic information on disease-free or overall survival, and predictive information on
      chemotherapy resistance and probability of lack of response to treatment. This study will
      evaluate ctDNA as a prognostic marker and as a monitor of disease recurrence in stage III
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We will recruit newly diagnosed stage III CRC patients, determine
      their tumor mutational profile, and systematically collect high volume (>10 ml), serial
      plasma specimens every 3 months for up to 3 years and every 6 months in years 4-5 for ctDNA
      and concurrent carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurement. Clinical outcome and survival will
      be tracked. The resulting data will permit assessment of ctDNA as a prognostic marker for
      disease-free and overall survival and as a monitor of disease recurrence in comparison with
      CEA.
