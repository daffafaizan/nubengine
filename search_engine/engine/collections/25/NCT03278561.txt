      nowadays 30% of all asthma patients is over 50 years old. Asthma in the elderly is generally
      more severe and approximately 50% of all deaths drom asthma occur in this age group. With
      rapid aging of the global population, the burden of asthma in the elderly will further
      increase.

      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and the question is whether asthma in the elderly can be
      considered the same disease as asthma in children and young adults. The pathophysiology and
      risk factors of asthma in the elderly are still not completely understood. Good
      characterization of asthma in the elderly requires clinical phenotyping as well as a thorough
      analysis of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. It is hypothesized that in
      older asthma patients, a late age of onset (start asthma symptoms >18 years) is associated
      with more persistent airway/systemic inflammation, worse asthma control, more co-morbidity
      and poorer quality of life despite the use of optimized asthma therapy.
