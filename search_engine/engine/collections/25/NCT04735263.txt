      largely owing to drusen volume providing a transport barrier that slows the transfer of
      nutrients between the choroid and photoreceptors2. Consequently, dark adaptation may provide
      an early indication of response vs. nonresponse, aiding case-by-case decisions on
      continuation of treatment when patients experience adverse side effects (e.g., elevated CPK
      or liver enzymes) or when atorvastatin provides insufficient lipid control in patients also
      at high-risk for cardiovascular disease (and switching to an alternative statin might be
      desirable).
