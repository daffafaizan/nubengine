      Currently, fracture fixation is usually achieved by using K-wire, but pin configurations are
      controversial.The objective of this report is to introduce treatment of shaft fractures of
      middle phalanx with a novel external-fixation technique using combined K-wires and cement.
      For comparison, we also included another group of patients who were treated using open
      transfixion pinning.A total of 98 patients (98 fingers) with shaft fractures of middle
      phalanx were randomly allocated to group A (n=51) and B (n=47). Fingers in group A were
      treated with cemented K-wire fixation, and fingers in group B were treated using conventional
      open transfixion pinning. Time of bone healing, range of motion of the fingers, and joint
      motion were assessed. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
