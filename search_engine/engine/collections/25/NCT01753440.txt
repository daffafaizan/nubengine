      a novel mesenchymal precursor cell type (iMP) during coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in
      patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF < 40 %). Preoperative scintigraphy imaging
      (SPECT) will be used to identify hibernating myocardium not suitable for conventional
      myocardial revascularization for iMP implantation. iMP cells will be implanted
      intramyocardially in predefined viable peri-infarct areas that show poor perfusion, which
      could not be grafted due to poor target vessel quality. Postoperatively, SPECT will be used
      to identify changes in scar area.
