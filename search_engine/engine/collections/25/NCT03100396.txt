      rapid sequence induction, neuromuscular blockade and short duration between anaesthetic
      induction and start of surgery - may contribute to a higher risk of awareness under general
      anaesthesia (AAGA) in these patients. The 2014 Royal College of Anaesthetists/Association of
      Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland National Audit Project 5 highlighted a higher risk
      of spontaneously reported AAGA in obstetric patients, but it remains unclear what the full
      (i.e. non-spontaneously reported) risk is. The aim of DREAMY is to establish the incidence of
      AAGA following general anaesthesia in obstetric surgery patients.

      Methods: A standardised Brice questionnaire will be used to screen for recall of
      intraoperative events in women meeting the eligibility requirements. Questions asked are:

        1. What is the last thing you remember before going to sleep?

        2. What is the first thing you remember after waking up?

        3. Do you remember anything between going to sleep and waking up?

        4. Did you dream during your procedure?

        5. What was the worst thing about your operation?

      The validity of the AAGA incidence will be improved by repetition of the questionnaire on
      three occasions over thirty days and triangulating using structured follow up interviews in
      all participants reporting AAGA in questionnaire responses. Participants will be followed up
      over 12 months and asked for self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      using the PCL-5 checklist. The research is being run as a multi-centre, descriptive study
      over 12 months. General condition and details of the anaesthetic procedure will also be
      recorded for a logistic regression analysis.
