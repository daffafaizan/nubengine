    
      Peripheral Obstructive Arterial Disease (PAD) is a disease with a prevalence of 10 to 25% in
      the population over 55 years, increasing with age, and may have disabling pain as a symptom,
      and sometimes the surgical approach is required. In the context of public hospital in Rio de
      Janeiro, where patients need to wait for surgery, the Anesthesiology and Acute Pain service
      routinely has sciatic nerve analgesic block in the popliteal region as a preoperative
      procedure.

      The primary objective of the present study is to describe a series of cases where the
      technique was applied in order to relieve the pain of these patients, following the Pain
      Score Numerical rating as a reference. Secondary objectives will be to describe difficulties
      associated with the technique and possible associated adverse factors.
