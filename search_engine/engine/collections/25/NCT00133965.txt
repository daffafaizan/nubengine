    
      Primary Objective:

        -  To establish the efficacy of a new and unique individual, brief intervention we call
           "Dignity Psychotherapy" in enhancing a sense of meaning, purpose and overall well-being
           for patients with advanced, end stage cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the effectiveness of "Dignity Psychotherapy" with "Supportive Psychotherapy"
           and "Standard Palliative Care" in bolstering the patients' sense of meaning, purpose,
           generativity, and overall sense of dignity and quality of life, while lessening
           hopelessness, sense of being a burden to others, and suffering.

        -  To explore the impact "Dignity Psychotherapy" has on the bereavement experience of those
           family members/significant others taking part in this arm of the study protocol.

        -  To compare the bereavement experience of bereaved family members/significant others
           whose loved ones took part in any one of the three study conditions.
