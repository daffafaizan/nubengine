    
      The study consisted of four steps. Study duration was up to 240 weeks.

      At the study Step 1 entry, participants were randomized with equal probability to each of the
      three regimens (ET+ART, BV+ART, PTX+ART). The original target sample size was 706.
      Randomization was stratified by:

        1. Screening CD4 lymphocyte cell count (<100, >=100 cells/mmÂ³), and

        2. Country.

      For participants who had an initial Independent Endpoint Review Committee (IERC) confirmed KS
      response and subsequent IERC-confirmed KS progression, and who, in the opinion of the
      investigator and with concurrence of the protocol Clinical Management Committee (CMC), could
      potentially have benefitted from another course of the same chemotherapy utilized in Step 1,
      entered Step 2. (Please see details on Step 2 eligibility.)

      In Step 3, participants were randomized with equal probability to one of the two chemotherapy
      arms not utilized in Step 1. (Please see details on Step 3 eligibility.)

      In Step 4, participants were assigned to the remaining study-provided chemotherapy not given
      in Step 1, Step 2 or Step 3. (Please see details on Step 4 eligibility.)

      Step 1 visits occurred at screening, entry and weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,24, 27, 30, 33,
      36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 from study entry. Visits for Steps 2, 3 and 4 were
      scheduled at entry and weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 60,
      72, 84 and 96 from the corresponding step entry date. Key evaluations included targeted
      physical examination, clinical assessment, KS examination, hematology, chemistry, pregnancy
      testing (for women of reproductive potential), and pulse oximetry for participants on BV+ART.
      CD4 count and HIV viral load were obtained every 12 weeks. Assessment of peripheral
      neuropathy was done at screening, weeks 9 and 21, and for those on BV+ART or PTX+ART,
      additionally at weeks 3, 6, 15 and 18. KS tumor punch biopsy, serum, plasma and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained and stored for use in future analyses.
      Participants also completed ET and ART adherence evaluations and quality of life
      questionnaires.

      Enrollment to ET+ART and initiation of ET+ART in subsequent steps were discontinued in March
      2016, based on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) due to
      ET+ART being less effective than PTX+ART. No safety concerns were identified. ET+ART
      participants in Step 1 or Step 2, in discussion with the local investigator and in
      consultation with the protocol CMC, could discontinue ET and enter Step 3. ET+ART
      participants in Step 3 could discontinue ET and start the remaining chemotherapy regimen in
      Step 4 in discussion with the local investigator and in consultation with the protocol CMC.
      Unless otherwise indicated, comparison between ET+ART and PTX+ART was based on the March 2016
      data. The study remained open to enrollment and the remaining participants were randomized at
      Step 1 entry between BV+ART and PTX+ART. The target total sample size was revised to 446.

      The DSMB recommended stopping the study in March 2018 due to BV+ART being inferior to
      PTX+ART. No safety concerns were identified. Study accrual was stopped. Eligible Step 1
      PTX+ART participants entered Step 2 to receive PTX+ART; Step 1 and Step 2 BV+ART participants
      eligible to receive PTX+ART moved to Step 3 to receive PTX+ART. Otherwise, participants
      permanently transitioned to local care upon arrangement of appropriate oncology and ART, and
      then went off study. Participants who received ET while on study were followed for 144 weeks
      after beginning the last cycle of ET.

      Comparison between BV+ART and PTX+ART was based on the March 2018 data.
