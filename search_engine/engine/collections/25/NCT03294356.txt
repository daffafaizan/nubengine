      healthy adult subjects, consisting of 35 subjects per product group, will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be evaluated for plasma nicotine uptake, as well as overall product liking. The
      study will involve the use of five different marketed ECs or one CC in tobacco consumers who
      are exclusive smokers (i.e., na√Øve EC users) or dual users of cigarettes and ECs (i.e.,
      intermittent EC users).
