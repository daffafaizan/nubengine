      Dosages of ozone and omalizumab

      Ozone:The 0.4 ppm ozone exposures will be conducted in an ozone exposure chamber. Each
      subject will be exposed to ozone for 2 hours. During exposures, subjects will perform four 15
      minute bouts of moderate exercise (minute ventilation or VE = 30 40 L/min) on a treadmill,
      each separated by 15 minutes of seated rest. Minute ventilation is measured for 2-3 minutes
      after about 4 minutes of exercise during the first exercise period, and again at about 12
      minutes of exercise. It is then measured at about 12 minutes into each exercise period.

      Omalizumab: Dosing for omalizumab will be consistent with doses approved for use in moderate
      or severe allergic asthma. The only exception to its indicated use is that we will be
      examining its effect in mild (rather than moderate or severe) allergic asthmatics, a group we
      have recruited for ozone challenge. IgE within the following ranges and body weights for
      subcutaneous omalizumab dosing:

        1. IgE â‰¥30-100 int. units/mL: 30-90 kg: 150 mg every 4 weeks

        2. IgE >100-200 int. units/mL: 30-90 kg: 300 mg every 4 weeks

        3. IgE >200-300 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 300 mg every 4 weeks >60-90 kg: 225 mg every 2
           weeks

        4. IgE >300-400 int. units/mL:30-70 kg: 225 mg every 2 weeks>70-90 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks

        5. IgE >400-500 int. units/mL:30-70 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks>70-90 kg: 375 mg every 2 weeks

        6. IgE >500-600 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks>60-70 kg: 375 mg every 2
           weeks>70 kg: Do not administer dose

        7. IgE >600-700 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 375 mg every 2 weeks

      Subjects for whom the IgE level and weight indicate that no dose will be given will be
      excluded from the study.
