    
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and level of acceptability of an
      Internet-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program in reducing symptoms of
      anxiety. The effectiveness of the intervention will be compared with a wait-list control
      group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design. The participants with high / clinical
      levels of anxiety from the active treatment group will have the opportunity to read seven ACT
      modules and receive personalized feedback for their completed homework assignments.

      The intervention will be delivered online and participants will have seven weeks to complete
      the seven modules (we might add one extra week of treatment for all participants in the event
      they need to compensate the treatment delays accumulated during the previous seven weeks).
