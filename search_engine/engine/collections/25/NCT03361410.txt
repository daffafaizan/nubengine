      a profound impact on healthcare systems, and specifically the emergence of dementia in
      literally epidemic proportions. Numerous studies on the associations between grape
      consumption and dementia and Alzheimer's disease have found evidence to support the use of
      grapes and grape products as a safe and effective way to treat and delay the onset of
      dementia. For the present study, the Investigator aims (1) to identify regional cerebral
      metabolic changes associated with grape intake, (2) to determine whether the presence and
      magnitude of therapeutic responses to grape in patients undergoing neuroimaging evaluation
      for cognitive decline can be predicted by particular patterns of regional brain metabolism,
      and (3) to statistically assess the relationships between brain metabolism assessed by PET
      and cognitive function in randomized experimental arms. A total of 32 patients from a
      community sample of patients referred to UCLA NeuroPET Clinics by their neurologists for
      further evaluation by brain imaging will be studied in this placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded study. Subjects who have met the screening criteria will be randomized to
      receive 72 g of grape powder or placebo, reconstituted in water, per day. Regional brain
      metabolism will be measured with a PET scanner, and cognitive function will be measured by a
      neuropsychologic test battery assessed at baseline, 6 months following initiation of
      consumption, and 1 year following initiation of consumption of the grapes of placebo
      formulation.
