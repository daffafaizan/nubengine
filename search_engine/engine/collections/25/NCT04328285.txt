      participants and will be implemented first in as many centers as possible.

      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment
      groups:

        -  Group 1.1: HCQ 200 mg : 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the morning
           at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards

        -  Group 1.2: Placebo of HCQ, 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the
           morning at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards.

      The COVIDAXIS 2 (Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo will be realized on 600
      participants and will be implemented in already participating and newer centers in a second
      step (when LPV/r becomes available).

      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment
      groups:

        -  Group 2.1: LPV/r 200/50 mg : 2 tablets twice daily

        -  Group 2.2: Placebo of LPV/r, 2 tablets twice daily

      Participants will receive the randomized treatment for 2 months and will be followed upon a
      2.5 months period.

      NB: there is no randomization procedure for participant inclusion in either COVIDAXIS 1 or
      COVIDAXIS 2
