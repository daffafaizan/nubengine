    
      A significant population of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) plus Non-small cell lung cancer
      patients exist that have progressed on or who were intolerant of second generation anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib or alectinib). Brigatinib has demonstrated activity
      in patients who have progressed on crizotinib, but the activity of brigatinib in patients who
      have progressed on ceritinib, alectinib, or other second generation anaplastic lymphoma
      kinase inhibitors is unknown. Based on the preclinical data. 3, , brigatinib has activity
      against known secondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations suggesting it may retain
      activity after second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.

      Patients enrolled in ARI-AT-002 must have previously received a second generation Anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase inhibitor other than brigatinib. We have chosen 20% as a clinically
      meaningful response rate that would justify further study of brigatinib in previously treated
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease.
