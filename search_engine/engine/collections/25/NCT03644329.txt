      collateral effects,such as muscle mass and strength losses, increase of fat mass, fatigue and
      disability and reduced quality of life in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. The
      resistance training is assumed as a non-pharmacologic interventions in postmenopausal breast
      cancer survivors. However, it is unclear whether the manipulation of training variables
      (intensity and volume) maximize the effects of resistance training on body composition,
      fatigability and functional capacity in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.
