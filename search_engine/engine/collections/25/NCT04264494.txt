      recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Rheumatology and Rehabilitation department. All
      patients were subjected to clinical and laboratory assessment, visual analog score (VAS)
      scale and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Fifty patients were injected
      intra-articularly with 3 doses of PRP and 50 patients who serve as a control injected with 3
      doses of placebo at 4 weeks intervals for the tender joints and revaluated at 1, 3 months
      post the last injection regarding the same evaluating tools.
