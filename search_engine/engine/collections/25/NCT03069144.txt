      efficacy and safety of HAT1 when compared to calcipotriol in adult patients with mild to
      moderate chronic plaque psoriasis. The study will include subjects with ages 18 - 65 years
      old inclusive. Group assignments will be balanced by disease severity, age, and body location
      of lesions. The study will consist of a 1 week washout period and a 12 week treatment phase.
      During the treatment phase, subject will be provided one of the two labeled test products
      HAT1 or calcipotriol to use twice daily on all lesions and non-lesional areas as instructed.
      No additional creams, lotions or soaps other than provided test products will be allowed
      throughout the duration of the study. There will also be consumption/compliance checks and
      dermatological evaluations at each visit.
