    
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a combination of medical problems that can increase the risk of
      heart disease and diabetes in some people. People with MS can have some or all of the
      following:

        -  High blood glucose

        -  High blood pressure

        -  Abdominal obesity

        -  Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol

        -  High levels of triglycerides

      Some studies have shown that people with certain disorders have a greater risk for developing
      MS. This may be because of a combination of factors, including but not limited to the type of
      medications used, age, and whether or not someone smokes. This study will also aim to learn
      more about a naturally-occurring stress hormone called cortisol that is made in the body.

      In order to measure these factors, the following things will occur:

        -  administer a number of questionnaires

        -  gather information from medical history

        -  gather information about current psychiatric mood

        -  draw blood and collect a urine sample

      To study the amount of cortisol in the body, a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) will be
      given. This test involves taking a single 1mg pill of dexamethasone, a steroid, and numerous
      blood draws. Like any drug, it has some risks, however it is unlikely any side effects will
      occur because of the low dose administered.
