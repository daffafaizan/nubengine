      Each patient received two series of ten treatments of either FREMS or placebo in random
      sequence, with each series lasting no more than three weeks. Primary outcomes (daytime and
      night-time pain scores) an secondary outcomes (Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity,
      sensory tactile perception, foot vibration perception threshold, quality of life, cutaneous
      microvascular flow, partial tissue tension of oxygen and carbon dioxide) were measured at
      baseline, after FREMS/placebo series and after 4 months follow-up.
