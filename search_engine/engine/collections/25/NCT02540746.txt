      whether motivational enhancement therapy (MET) improved the treatment effects of a 12-week
      psychological intervention, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Training (DBT-ST), for EA
      presenting in the early stages of mental health difficulties. Participants were recruited
      from the Youth Wellness Centre at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and McMaster University's
      Student Wellness Centre in Hamilton, Canada.

      Methods: Seventy-five participants were randomized to receive MET followed by DBT-ST or to
      DBT-ST alone. We assessed psychological distress, emotion dysregulation, and depression and
      anxiety symptoms as outcomes. Results: We found that both treatment groups had significant
      reductions in emotional dysregulation, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety at
      post- treatment and at the 3-month follow-up. Participants assigned to MET pre-treatment
      experienced greater improvement in psychological distress at the end of treatment.
      Conclusion: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the potential augmentation of
      DBT-ST using MET in a real-world setting. Future studies should examine whether MET uniquely
      augments DBT-ST through the use of a comparable pre-treatment control group.
