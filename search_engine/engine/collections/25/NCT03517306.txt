      display startling intratumoral heterogeneity in various features including histology, gene
      expression, genotype, and metastatic and proliferative potential, which is often associated
      with adverse tumor biology. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess intratumoral
      heterogeneity with random sampling or biopsy as this does not represent the full extent of
      phenotypic or genetic variation within a tumor. Given the limitations of current biopsy
      strategies, there is an important potential for medical imaging, which has the ability to
      capture intratumoral heterogeneity in a non-invasive way.

      Borrowed from the concept in genomics and/or proteomics, radiomics was specifically proposed
      for medical or radiological images. It is a promising technique for improving diagnosis,
      staging, prognosis, treatment response prediction and potentially allowing personalization of
      cancer treatment. It is a process of extraction and analysis of high-dimensional image
      features from radiological images obtained with CT, MR or PET, which could be either
      qualitative or quantitative. The basic assumption of radiomics is that tumor biology could be
      captured by radiomic features .

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of FDG PET/CT based radiomics in lung
      cancer. Four PET/CT centers will be involved in this study, in which more than 1000 patients
      diagnosed as lung cancer will be retrospectively enrolled.
