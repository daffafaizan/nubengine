    
      This is a prospective observational study of patients with clinical Plasmodium falciparum
      infection using parasite DNA from point-of-care fingerprick dried blood spot samples as well
      as a short survey on patient demographics, employment, travel, and mobile phone use to study
      P. falciparum parasite genotypes, population characteristics, and gene flow patterns.

      On inclusion in the study and before standard treatment is administered, dried blood spots
      (DBS) will be obtained through fingerprick blood sampling from patients, with three blood
      spots on one piece of filter paper being obtained from each patient. Each blood spot will
      contain ~20µl of blood, for a total of ~60µl of blood being collected from each patient for
      the study.

      In order to have a greater understanding of the possible sites of malaria transmission and to
      relate genetic diversity to geographic location, patients or their parents/guardians will
      also be asked a short set of questions on demographics, their places of residence and work,
      recent mobile phone use, and their history of travel in the last 2 months. As some of this
      information can be sensitive, during the consent process the patient will be given the option
      of not providing some or all of this information without needing to provide a reason. This is
      explained on the patient information sheet. For those who do not want to provide information,
      this will be documented in the survey form. A duplicate of the sample barcode will be placed
      on this same form, so the information therein can be matched with the relevant blood spot and
      its related genetic data, while retaining sample anonymity.
