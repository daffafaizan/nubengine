    
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, time, cost, safety,
      limitations, and efficacy of the use of institutionally processed SVF for management and
      closure of aero-digestive and enterocutaneous fistulae. This pilot study would help identify
      design issues and the potential success of fistulae closure by the means of autologous SVF
      administration before a full-scale trial is performed.

      A secondary aim is the closure of aero-digestive and enterocutaneous fistulae along with
      characteristics such as size, etiology, recurrence, localization, and the association of
      these factors withoutcome after SVF administration. The SVF quantification, characterization
      and differentiation in vitro will be described.

      This process will help identify the type of fistulae that are susceptible to closure with
      human cell therapy.
