      consecutive women patients) treated with cosmetic upper blepharoplasty by a single surgeon.
      Patients were randomized to receive traditional upper blepharoplasty with a single running
      suture skin closure versus orbicularis oculi muscle fixation to periosteum (brassiere
      sutures) prior to skin closure. Patient age, follow-up length, complications and treatment
      were analyzed. The mean of TPS, BFS and TPS/BFS ratio was measured before and after surgery
      at 3 anatomic landmarks.

      56 eyelids (28 patients) were treated with traditional single suture blepharoplasty and 44
      eyelids (22 patients) had brassiere sutures. After surgery, the mean change in TPS was 2.10
      mm with brassiere sutures compared to 2.04 mm without (p <.001). The mean change in BFS was
      3.33 mm with brassiere sutures compared to 3.19 mm without (p <.001), The mean change in
      TPS:BFS ratio at all 3 anatomic landmarks was statistically significant in both groups but
      the change was statistically greater with the use of brassiere sutures (p <.001).

      Brassiere sutures during upper blepharoplasty were associated with a postoperative increase
      in TPS decrease in BFS, and increase in TPS/BFS.
