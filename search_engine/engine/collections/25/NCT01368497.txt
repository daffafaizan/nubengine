      Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)-sponsored Hepatitis B Research
      Network (HBRN). Children age 3-<18 years with immunotolerant chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
      infection who fulfilled the entry criteria received entecavir as monotherapy for 8 weeks and
      then combination therapy with entecavir and pegylated interferon by weekly subcutaneous
      injection until week 48. Children were to be followed for 48 weeks after discontinuation of
      therapy (week 96 for those who completed 48 weeks of treatment).

      Assessment was undertaken at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, & 16, then every 4 weeks until
      week 48, and then 4, 8, 12, 24,36, and 48 weeks following treatment discontinuation
      corresponding to weeks 52, 56, 60, 72, 84 and 96 for those who received treatment for 48
      weeks. Blood work was drawn to measure markers of viral and liver disease status and for
      research biospecimen banking.

      Participants were to receive therapy until week 48 and enter 48 weeks of follow-up
      thereafter. Participants who experienced a sustained elevation of alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) were eligible to receive treatment as recommended by their hepatologist and continued
      to complete the study protocol.
