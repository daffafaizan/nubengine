    
      The study will be a parallel, two-groups, assessor-blind, single-center, pilot randomized
      controlled trial with participants (surgical trainees) individually allocated on a 1:1 ratio
      to intervention group (guided video-based self-evaluation in addition to traditional
      intraoperative teaching by faculty surgeons) and a control group (traditional intraoperative
      teaching alone).

      All the trainees participating in this trial will be asked to submit intra-operative
      video-recordings of 5 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by them as the
      primary operator.

      In this trial the intervention group participants will be asked to perform a guided
      self-assessment of their intra-operative skills by watching their operative video-recording.
      The trainee's self-assessment will be guided by validated intra-operative performance
      assessment tools. The control group will not have access to their recorded video submissions
      during the duration of this study.

      Outcomes assessed will include trainee's intra-operative performance and time to completion
      of surgical procedure, Information generated from the pilot study will help inform a
      full-scale RCT by testing the study procedures. Feasibility outcomes will include number of
      trainees and surgeons approached, consented and randomized and adherence with
      intervention(surgeons: intra-operative assessments; trainees: video-based assessments). Data
      from this pilot study will inform the calculation of sample size requirements for the
      full-scale RCT.
