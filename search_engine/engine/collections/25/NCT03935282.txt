    
      In this hybrid effectiveness-implementation group-randomized clinical trial, 6 intervention
      practices will receive an EHR-based cardiovascular health assessment tool (Automated Heart
      Health Assessment for Survivors: AH-HA) and 6 practices will serve as usual care (control)
      practices without access to the AH-HA tool. AH-HA renders a visual, interactive display of
      CVH risk factors, automatically populated from the EHR. This tool was first implemented in
      primary care and now incorporates EHR data on receipt of cancer treatments with cardiotoxic
      potential. Providers at each intervention site will be trained to use the tool during routine
      follow-up care with survivors. Eligible survivors with breast, prostate, colorectal,
      endometrial, or Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancer (n=600) will provide baseline data
      before and immediately after seeing their oncology provider and complete 6-month and 1-year
      study follow-up visits. The study team will compare changes in outcomes from baseline to
      1-year in survivors at the intervention and usual care clinics using data from survivor
      self-reports and the EHR. The primary outcome is CVH discussions defined as the number of
      patient-reported discussions with their provider regarding up to seven non-ideal CVH
      conditions identified for that patient during oncology visits. Secondary outcomes include
      referrals to primary care and cardiology, provider efforts to manage CV risk, survivors'
      completed visits with primary care providers and cardiologists, and control of CVH factors
      and behaviors. Implementation metrics will be assessed using data from the EHR and
      semi-structured interviews with providers and administrators (n=24-30) at intervention
      clinics.
