      half a million patients undergoing an endovascular or surgical revascularization procedure in
      order to treat the disease. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of patients still have blockages
      in the leg arteries, even after these procedures.

      Advances in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer promise for understanding the mechanism of
      failure through insights into vessel wall composition, remodeling, and inflammation.
      Restenosis has a known relationship to inflammation. Advances in micro-catheter technologies
      offer the ability to deliver anti-inflammatory medications such as Dexamethasone (DEX)
      directly to the adventitia and advances in drug delivery on balloon surfaces to deliver
      paclitaxel to the intima of the artery.

      This study aims to investigate if patient-specific parameters affect angioplasty outcomes, if
      DEX has a biological effect on the vessel wall, and if this effect is through the reduction
      of inflammation.
