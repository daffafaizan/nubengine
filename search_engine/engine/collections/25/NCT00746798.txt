      vectors associated or avoidance of mosquito bites, which has proven largely ineffective.
      Developing a safe, effective vaccine and making it widely available will enhance the
      prospects of prevention and control of this disease. In addition, natural infections with the
      YF virus and WN virus are more severe in the elderly. Therefore, a study among healthy older
      subjects or those with well controlled chronic diseases will provide data to determine a
      ChimeriVax-WN02 vaccine dose that is immunogenic and well tolerated.
