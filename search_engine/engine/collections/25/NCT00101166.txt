      melanoma cells which were removed by surgery and then processed in the Cell Therapy
      Laboratory, and 2) experimental "bystander" cells. All the cells in the vaccine will be
      treated with high-dose X-rays to make sure that none of them grow and cause more cancer. The
      bystander cells, called "GM.CD40L", are human cells that have been genetically changed. The
      original cells, called K562, had the genes for human GM-CSF and CD40L inserted into them.
      These changes are designed to help boost the patient's immune system to better fight the
      cancer in their body.
