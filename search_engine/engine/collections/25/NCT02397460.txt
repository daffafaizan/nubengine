    
      Up to 30 participants (male and female) who meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned
      to treatment with gefapixant or matching placebo.

      There will be a Screening Period, a Baseline Visit (cough participants only), and four
      Treatment Periods, with a washout period between treatments. Participants will return after
      their last Treatment Visit for a Follow-up Visit.

      At the Screening Visit and during the Treatment Periods, cough sensitivity will be measured
      by standard clinical methodology incorporating two cough challenges: 1) capsaicin; 2) ATP.
      The ATP challenge will only be performed during the study treatment period. The Baseline
      Visit (cough participants only) will occur prior to Treatment Period 1. Daytime cough
      monitoring will be performed at the Baseline Visit and during each of the four Treatment
      Periods (cough participants only).
