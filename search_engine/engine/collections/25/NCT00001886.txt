      coronary artery disease. Its accuracy has been shown to be superior to that of the exercise
      electrocardiogram and comparable to that of myocardial perfusion imaging. The adequacy of
      stress echocardiography with conventional two-dimensional imaging, however, is highly
      dependent on operator expertise. Further, interpretation of test results is subjective and
      qualitative, and is based on analysis of wall motion after arbitrary segmentation of the left
      ventricle. Real time 3-dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography is a new technique that permits
      the unrestricted assessment of left ventricular wall motion and function in a single cardiac
      beat without ECG or respiratory gating. We hypothesize that RT3D echocardiography will have
      similar or greater accuracy for the detection of wall motion abnormalities compared to the
      conventional two-dimensional examination. We therefore propose to acquire RT3D
      echocardiographic images in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease who
      undergo stress echocardiography. We will correlate these results with findings from coronary
      angiography and compare the ability of RT3D echocardiography to detect coronary artery
      disease with that of the conventional two-dimensional exam.
