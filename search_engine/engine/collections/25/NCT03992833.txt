      rounds. At baseline, the first CT scan will be performed in all participants and their data
      will be collected. One-year after the baseline, a second CT scan will be performed and data
      will be collected again. CT images of each participant will be read twice independently by
      two groups of readers after the baseline and 1-year follow-up scans. In the first reading,
      the detected lung nodules are evaluated for diameter and managed according to a routine
      diameter-based protocol. The clinical management of participants are based on the first
      reading. In the second reading, each scan will be interpreted again by radiologists, blinded
      to the first reading. Semi-automated volumetry software will be used. The lung nodules will
      be evaluated for volume and management will be simulated according to a European volume-based
      protocol. Participants will be followed up and any diagnosis of lung cancer and related
      information will be collected at the fourth year through the hospital information system and
      by contacting the participants or their relatives.
