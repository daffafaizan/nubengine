      an early clinical signal for higher activity and better response with lenalidomide in
      patients with non deletion 5q Low and INT-1 MDS patients. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory
      agent. Thalidomide, the parent compound, has both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic
      properties which could confer anti-tumor and anti-metastatic efforts. Lenalidomide has been
      demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of basic fibroblast
      growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced endothelial cell migration (movement of cells in preparation
      to form new abnormal blood vessels for cancer cells), due at least in part to inhibition of
      Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.

      In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects. Lenalidomide stimulates
      T cell proliferation, and the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10 and interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma), inhibits IL-1 beta and IL-6 and modulated IL-12 production.

      Although the exact anti-tumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a number of
      mechanisms are postulated for the activity of Lenalidomide in MDS.
