      the cortical representations of the altered body part are affected when there is chronic
      pain. Occasionally, the primary motor cortex is smaller on the affected side than on the
      contralateral side.

      Recognition of the body schema is altered in the presence of painful disorders. The most
      common way of assessing the body schema is by motor imagery through the laterality
      discrimination of the left and right.
