      Department of Youth Services in the last year. Consent will be obtained from parents or
      guardians for the youths' participation. The participating teens will come to Oregon Research
      Institute for a baseline assessment. During this visit, the teens will complete an assent
      form and spend spent 20-30 minutes completing an online survey with an assessor; topics
      covered in the survey include emotion regulation and drug and alcohol use. Teens will have
      the app loaded onto their phones and be provided with instructions for its use during this
      visit. Participants are asked to use the app over the next 2 weeks, completing 4 modules and
      spending 5-10 minutes each day answering questions about recent emotions and substance use.
      Teens will be contacted via email for follow up assessments at 2 weeks and 2 months
      post-baseline. These emails will contain links to the follow-up survey which also asks about
      emotion regulation and drug and alcohol use; surveys should take 20-30 minutes to complete.
