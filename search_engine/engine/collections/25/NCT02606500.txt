      adjusted according to the patient's body weight. Meaning, in women with a body weight â‰¤ 60
      kg, a single dose of 100 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa is administered for COH and in women
      with a body weight > 60 kg, a single dose of 150 micrograms of Corifollitropin alfa is
      administered for COH. These two protocols are comparable in safety and efficacy of follicular
      stimulation.

      On the other hand, knowledge about the clinical efficacy of 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa
      in obese women (BMI>30 kg/m2) is lacking.

      Cumulus cells (CC) surround the oocyte and bi-directional communication between oocyte and CC
      is necessary for the development of mature and quality oocytes. It has been proposed, that
      analysis of genes, expressed in CC, can serve as an objective indicator of the oocyte's
      maturity and developmental potential. Expression of genes in CC as hyaluronan synthase 2
      (HAS2), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), versican (VCAN), progesterone receptor
      (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), serine protease inhibitor E2 (SERPINE2),
      glutathione peroxidase (GPX3), pentraxin 3(PTX3) was reported to correlate with oocyte
      maturity and developmental potential.

      The effect of Corifollitropin alfa on expression of these genes however, is unknown.
