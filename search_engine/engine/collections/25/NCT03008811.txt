    
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      pulmonary vein isolation with either the second generation cryoballoon (Arctic Front
      Advance™) or a radiofrequency ablation technique with an irrigated ablation catheter
      (TactiCath™ Quartz) . A total of 128 patients with persistent or longstanding persistent
      atrial fibrillation will be randomized for either radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation
      treatment. With both techniques, pulmonary vein isolation will be performed and confirmed by
      a circular mapping catheter. The primary endpoint is freedom of any atrial arrhythmia
      recurrence at 12 months.Treatment success will be evaluated by using 12-lead
      electrocardiography and 7-day Holter recording.
