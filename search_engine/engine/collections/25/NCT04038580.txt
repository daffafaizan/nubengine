      adjustable sockets and inform clinical decision making. The investigators will explore a
      range of outcomes that have been found to be important for prostheses users and specifically
      assess the claims made by device manufacturers. Thirty adults with a transfemoral amputation
      will participate in four test sessions; one with their clinically prescribed, laminated
      socket, and three with different adjustable sockets. This data will be used to test the
      following aims: 1) does socket design impact socket comfort and prosthetic satisfaction? 2)
      does socket design impact of prosthetic socket on patient mobility and confidence, 3) how
      does prosthetic socket design influences prosthetic use in the home?, and 4) Are individual
      characteristics associated with benefits of specific socket designs?
