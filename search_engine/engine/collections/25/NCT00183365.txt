      the fact that economic hardship is a strong risk factor for both maternal depression and poor
      child development, little research has been conducted to develop prevention programs for
      low-income urban families. This randomized, open-label study will address the research gap by
      developing and pilot-testing the Protecting Families Program (PFP), a family-based,
      multi-component prevention program. The PFP will offer its services to low-income, urban,
      depressed parents and their children between the ages of 9 and 14.

      Prior to the interventional portion of the study, several small focus groups composed of
      mental-health care providers and depressed parents will meet. The purpose of these focus
      groups will be to gather information that will help maximize the effectiveness of the
      remainder of the study. The interventional phase will compare PFP combined with individual
      parent training versus parent training alone. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of these two intervention groups. The study will last a total of 10 weeks. Both groups will
      meet once each week. PFP will include a community meal at the beginning of each session, a
      parent skills training group, and a concurrent cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group for
      the focal child. Participants' symptoms, diagnosis, functional status, family functioning,
      cognitive factors, and parenting practices will be assessed at the study start date,
      immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention.
