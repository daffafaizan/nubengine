    
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial with 40 families. Twenty families will be
      randomly assigned to receive usual care consisting of diabetes education delivered through
      Fairview Health Services. An additional 20 families will be randomized to a family-based,
      in-person program that focuses on nutrition education, the development of meal planning and
      cooking skills and promotion of healthful eating for families; the program will augment usual
      care and diabetes education received from Fairview Health Services for the parent with
      diabetes. Parents with diabetes who are randomized to the intervention group will also
      participate in one goal-setting phone call with intervention staff at one point during the
      intervention program.

      Adult patients and their families will be recruited in two ways:

        1. from Fairview Health Service's clinics in the North metropolitan area with the
           assistance of Fairview Health Service diabetes educators, and

        2. through MyChart messages informing them about the study.

      Adults between the ages of 25 and 55 years who have a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, who have
      participated in at least some diabetes education through Fairview Health Services, and who
      have at least one child between the ages of 7-12 years of age will be invited to participate
      in the study. Successful recruitment, measurement and randomization of patients and their
      families will provide data for our aim of assessing feasibility. Patient and family
      participation in the intervention and feedback via the post-intervention surveys will provide
      data for our aim of acceptability.
