      sarcoma. The current clinical studies of molecularly targeted drugs are focused on the
      advanced treatment stage of soft tissue sarcoma. Anti-angiogenic drugs are not yet available
      in the neoadjuvant treatment stage of soft tissue sarcoma. Strong evidence. Therefore, this
      study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pegylated doxorubicin liposomes
      combined with the anti-angiogenic drug Anlotinib for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with
      soft tissue sarcoma.
