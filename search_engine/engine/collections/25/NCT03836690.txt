    
      Phase I study using a Bayesian Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) to determine
      safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD62L- Tem.

      Eligible patients and HLA-identical sibling donors will be registered prior to stem cell
      transplant (SCT). Donors will undergo an additional steady state apheresis for the collection
      of T cells between day -14 and day +24 of the allo-SCT according to logistics. Selection of
      Tem at the required dose will be performed at UCL Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue
      Therapeutics (CCGTT) before distribution of the cryopreserved cells to the trial centre.
      Doses of Tem selected and infused will be: 1x10^5, 3x10^5, 1x10^6 or 3x10^6.

      Donor Tem will be infused on day 24-32 following allo-SCT. Patients will be followed-up for
      12 months with specific evaluation points just prior to Tem infusion and at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months following allo-SCT.
