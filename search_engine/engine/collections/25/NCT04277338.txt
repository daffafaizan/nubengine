      possibly in axillary lymph node metastases before neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy.

      Phase I. Distribution of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in patients with primary breast cancer. The study
      should evaluate distribution of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in patients with primary HER2-positive and
      HER2-negative breast cancer.

      The primary objective are:

        1. To assess distribution of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in normal tissues and in tumours over time;

        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-HE3-G3;

        3. To obtain initial information concerning safety and tolerability of 99mTc-HE3-G3 after
           single intravenous injection:

      The secondary objective are:

      1. To compare the tumour imaging data with the concerning HER2 expression obtained by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of biopsy
      samples:

      Methodology:

      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of
      the labelled tracer.
