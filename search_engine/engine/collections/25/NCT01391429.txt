      study. The specific aim of the study is to assess the effect of a video decision support tool
      on preferences for end-of-life care in patients and surrogate decision makers consulted on by
      an inpatient palliative care service. The first seven months of the study, or until 25
      patient subjects are recruited, will be the observational phase. All participants recruited
      will receive the usual standard of care provided by an inpatient palliative care service.
      Using a battery of surveys, data will be collected regarding treatment preferences near the
      end of life, level of certainty with decision making, pain and symptom management, resource
      utilization and whether patient subjects die in accordance with their stated preferences.
      Once the observational phase is complete, the intervention phase of the study will begin.
      Over the following seven months, or until 25 patient subjects are recruited, all participants
      will view a six-minute digital video outlining different options for care near the end of
      life. The same endpoints will then be followed. In addition to the primary analysis involving
      patient-proxy dyads, an additional exploratory analysis will be performed. This analysis will
      involve surveying additional medical staff including attendings, residents, interns and
      nurses regarding their perceptions of patients' symptoms at the time of the palliative care
      consult. This data will be used to measure concordance between patient subjects' and staffs'
      ranking of symptoms.
