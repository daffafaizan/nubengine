      Caucasian Americans (CA). Poor sleep, which is more common among AA, may serve as an
      important pathway in understanding these disparities. Race-based rejection has been
      cross-sectionally related to poor sleep and negative cardiovascular outcomes. To test the
      links between social experiences and sleep, participants will spend two nights in the sleep
      laboratory. One night will be a control night where participants complete low arousal tasks
      prior to bedtime. On a second night, the investigators will randomize 80 AA and 80 CA to
      either race-based social rejection (i.e., being rejected by an out-group member) or same-race
      social rejection prior to bedtime to test the causal influences of race-based rejection on
      objective sleep parameters, measured using polysomnography, and nocturnal cardiovascular
      functioning. The investigators will test group differences on these outcomes as well as
      within subjects by testing impact of rejection compared to a non-rejection control night in
      the sleep laboratory. The order of the control and rejection task night will be
      counterbalanced.
