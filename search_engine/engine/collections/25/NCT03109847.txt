      I. To evaluate if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin) inhibits radioactive
      iodine (RAI)-induced myelosuppression and induces faster recovery of white blood cell count
      to baseline values, the blood counts will be compared in the pre- and post-treatment samples.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of metformin treatment in subjects undergoing RAI treatment
      for differentiated thyroid cancer.

      II. To assess the effect of metformin treatment on symptoms of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and
      dysgeusia as assessed by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ), the modified Vanderbilt Head and
      Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), University of Washington Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)-Head and Neck (H&N)35.
