      mothers whom breastfeed have greater total fat and trunk fat mass and accumulate fat mass at
      a greater rate from ~ 1 month to 6 months of life compared to breastfed infants from normal
      weight mothers.

      Specific Aim 1: Understand how maternal obesity and breast-feeding impact body composition of
      the offspring. Based upon the investigators preliminary data and counter to accepted dogma
      the hypothesis is at six months of age total fat mass, particularly in the trunk will be
      elevated at 6 months of age in infants whose mother was either overweight or obese vs.
      infants from normal weight mothers.

      Specific Aim 2: Identify adipocytokines in breast milk. The postulate is breast milk from
      overweight and obese mothers will have greater levels of insulin, glucose, Ghrelin, IGF-1,
      IL-6, TNFÎ±, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lower Leptin levels than breast milk
      from normal weight mothers and will be correlated with offspring fat mass.
