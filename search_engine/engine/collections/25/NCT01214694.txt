      efficacy of 7-week Internet-based Interacting Together Everyday, Recovery after Childhood
      Traumatic Brain Injury Express (I-InTERACT Express) and 24-week long web-based positive
      parenting skills programs Internet-based Interacting Together Everyday, Recovery after
      Childhood Traumatic Brain Injury (I-InTERACT) to an internet resource group (IRC) involving
      access to internet resources and education about brain injury. The project builds upon the
      feasibility and efficacy findings from an ongoing randomized trial comparing the efficacy of
      a 24-week positive parenting skills program to access to internet resources. However, it
      differs in size and scope by including multiple sites, and by including an abbreviated
      parenting skills training arm in response to family feedback that the existing 24-week
      intervention was excessively long, resulting in adherence difficulties. The investigators
      anticipate that the improvements in parenting skills and psychological functioning will
      translate into improved parent-child relationships and reductions in child behavior problems.
      Over time, such improvements in child and parent functioning should contribute to academic
      and social success and more successful community integration.
