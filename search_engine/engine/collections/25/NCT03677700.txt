      conventionally prescribed for a duration of 1 month. However, frequently, during the
      post-operative control at one month, there may be signs of ocular inflammation or symptoms of
      discomfort justifying the prolongation of post-operative treatment. A 2012 study evaluated
      post-operative flare follow-up in 22 vitrectomized patients for retinal detachment, and
      showed a significantly higher flare 3 months after surgery, compared to the other eye and
      pre-surgery value.

      In this study, the investigators wish to study postoperative inflammation in patients
      operated for posterior segment ocular surgery (vitrectomy or preindentation) measured by
      laser flashmeter on a follow-up of one year.
