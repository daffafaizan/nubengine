      Primary

        -  Test the efficacy of long-acting methylphenidate in patients with cancer-related fatigue
           as measured using an item of the Brief Fatigue Inventory.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the tolerability and adverse events associated with this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Study the effect of this drug on quality of life (QOL)-related variables (vitality,
           sleep quality, overall QOL, QOL domains, other fatigue measures, and perceived treatment
           efficacy) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease stage (0, I, or II vs III or IV), level of fatigue at
      baseline (4-7 vs 8-10), concurrent biological therapy (yes vs no), concurrent chemotherapy
      (yes vs no), and concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral methylphenidate daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily on days 1-28.

      Patients in both arms complete questionnaires to assess their symptoms of fatigue, overall
      mood, quality of life, sleep quality, and adverse effects from treatment at baseline and once
      weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also complete a Symptom Experience Diary.

      McNeil Consumer & Specialty Pharmaceuticals provided medication support for NCCTG N05C7.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.
