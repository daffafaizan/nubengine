      body. Lack of vitamin D is associated with cardio-vascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes,
      and also with risk factors for these diseases like hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin
      resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. However, intervention studies with vitamin D have
      been inconclusive regarding diseases and risk factors. Most of these studies were done in
      white, Western populations in subjects fairly vitamin D sufficient, and accordingly, no
      benefits were to be expected. Also, in many studies the doses of vitamin D have been too low,
      and the studies underpowered. To firmly establish the role of vitamin D regarding CVD risk
      factors we will in the present study include 600 subjects with vitamin D deficiency (serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 30 nmol/L) and randomize to high dose vitamin D (3000 IU per
      day) versus placebo for four months. The subjects will be recruited based on 25(OH)D
      measurements in the forthcoming 7th survey in the TromsÃ¸ study where more than 20 000
      subjects are expected to attend. If our hypotheses are correct and the vitamin D supplement
      has a positive effect, this will be of great importance not only in countries with low sun
      exposure, but particularly for subjects in developing countries where vitamin D deficiency is
      highly prevalent.
