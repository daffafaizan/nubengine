      been administered in a previous trial. The previous trial participants will be contacted and
      asked to attend a clinic or to have a telephone interview, where they will answer a
      questionnaire. They will be assessed clinically for visual fields, as well as undergoing an
      MRI scan of their head to assess tumour size (unless they have had a scan anyway in the
      previous 12 months), these tests would ordinarily form part of the routine outpatient workup
      for patients with pituitary tumours. There is no significant risk to the physical well-being
      of the patients with any of the methods to be used.
