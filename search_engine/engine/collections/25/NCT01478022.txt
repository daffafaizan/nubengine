    
      This trial is designed to define drug interactions following the combined administration of
      Isosorbide Dinitrate, a NO donor, and ibuprofen, NSAID, a through pharmacokinetics approach.

      Both ibuprofen and Isosorbide Dinitrate were licensed worldwide. Ibuprofen is approved for
      use in adults and children; Isosorbide is approved for use in adults. Ibuprofen is currently
      used in pediatric patients as a first line anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent. Consensus
      exists that among NSAIDs ibuprofen is the one endowed with less adverse effects (see note 66
      of the Italian Drug Agency AIFA and MEA). No specific studies concerning safety and
      tolerability of ISDN in pediatric patients have been reported.
