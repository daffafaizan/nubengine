      human lens in vivo and non-invasively, called Dynamic Light Scattering Device (DLS).
      Preliminary studies have shown its potential in the detection of the earliest changes
      occurring in cataract, at the stage where anti-cataract treatment would theoretically be most
      effective in reversing, delaying or preventing cataracts. A new DLS device has been developed
      by NASA physicist Dr. Rafat Ansari using lower energy lasers, miniaturized and contained
      within a fiber optic tip, and further developed and tested under an NEI-NASA Inter Agency
      Agreement. We recently conducted a pilot study to evaluate the usefulness and reproducibility
      of this instrument for quantitating lens changes, and found good reproducibility. We also
      determined that a useful parameter is mean particle size. We therefore propose to use the new
      NEI-NASA DLS device to detect and study, non-invasively and in vivo, the earliest molecular
      cataractous changes that develop rapidly in the lenses of patients less than 55 years of age,
      otherwise called pre-senile cataracts.
