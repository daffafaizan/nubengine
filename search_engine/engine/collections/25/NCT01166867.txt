      saturation (SpO2) in infant patients in a hospital setting. The plethysmographic signal is
      typically strong on children. This provides a reliable heart rate monitor. However, to
      measure oxygen saturation, a quantitative value of the strength at two wavelength regions
      (green and red) is required. It is also not known if the normal ambient light is spectrally
      appropriate to analyze the video signals for oxygenation. With the current prototype of our
      system, we can monitor heart rate reliably and estimate oxygen saturation in adults, using
      normal artificial light or daylight, entering through a window.
