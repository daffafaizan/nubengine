    
      One hundred twenty-two patients over the age of 50 with COPD, admitted to Charing Cross
      Hospital in 2000-2004 with an acute exacerbation of their condition will be recruited and
      randomised to routine and opportunistic care (n= 61) vs study care package (n=61) for 2
      years. The patients randomised to the study package will take part in an initial pulmonary
      rehabilitation programme of 8 sessions of physical therapy and education (2 sessions a week
      for 4 weeks). Health related quality of life will be measured in the intervention and routine
      care groups using validated instruments (SF-36 and Canadian Respiratory Diseases
      Questionnaire). This will be followed by a baseline home visit and assessment from an
      experienced specialist respiratory nurse (Grade G), followed by monthly telephone calls and a
      home visit every 3 months. Each interview and visit will be a structured intervention
      addressing specific issues related to the management of COPD, with four possible specific
      outcomes including history taking; measurement of vital signs; discussion of treatment;
      appropriate vaccination and discussing and reinforcing self-management education. At the end
      of the 2 year study period the routine care and intervention groups will be compared for the
      following outcomes: number of admissions to hospital for exacerbations of COPD; number of
      unplanned visits to a general practitioner (with those initiated by study nurse identified
      separately); measures of quality of life (SF-36; CRDQ).
