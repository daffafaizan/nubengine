      and may kill more tumor cells and may have fewer side effects. Dose escalation in
      unresectable stage III NSCLC has been safely achieved up to LEVEL 3 (PTV-G60.5Gy/22Fx,
      2.75Gy/Fx; PTV-C 49.5Gy/22Fx, 2.25Gy/Fx). Acute toxicities were well tolerable. Further stage
      II clinical study has found that hypofractionated RT can significantly improve the efficacy
      of patients with a low toxicity profile. The aim of this study is to compared with
      hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated concurrent chemotherapy , and evaluate
      whether hypofractionated RT can improve local control and overall survival in unresectable
      stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
