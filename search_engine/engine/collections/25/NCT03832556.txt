    
      This is a study on diagnostic performance, non randomized, versus Gold standard (a
      prospective multicentric cohort).

      All eligible patients will be proposed consecutively to participate to the study, to undergo
      preoperative CT scan and MRI examination as usual procedure. The only additional action in
      this study will be a neurography sequence of type fluorescence subtraction imaging (FSI)
      during MRI, permitting to obtain more details in visualization of nerve structure and their
      relations of the ossifications.

      The enrollment visit will performed by neuro-orthopaedic surgeon during preoperative
      consultation.

      The follow-up visit will be an usual post-operative visit, non-specific for the study.

      The duration for each participant will compound 1 month (the duration between preoperative
      imaging and surgical resection) added by up to two months of post-operative follow-up.
