      back pain perceptions in participants who receive either chiropractic treatment or foot
      massage. In this study, the researchers will:

        1. Measure the participant's back pain and function using research forms.

        2. Test the participant's ability to discern different touch sensations in the low back.

        3. Assess the participant's perceptions of the study procedures on research forms during
           the study and in a short interview at the end of the study.
