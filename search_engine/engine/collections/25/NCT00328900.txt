      and mean skin conductance level, reflect the activity in the sympathetic postganglionic
      cholinergic fibers which innervate the palmar and plantar sweat glands. Skin conductance,
      especially numbers of skin conductance fluctuations, may be a promising tool to monitor
      anesthesia. Atropine, an anticholinergic agent, acts as an antagonist on the muscarinic
      receptors of the sweat glands and inhibits their secretion in a dose-dependent way. The aim
      of this study was to find out to what degree SC is influenced by i.v. administration of
      atropine.

      Study hypothesis: SC is not influenced by i.v. administration of atropine.
