      BecomeAnEX.org, a well-established smoking cessation website.

      Phase I involves the initial development and optimization of the text message intervention.
      The investigators will examine the impact of 4 experimental text message intervention
      features on smokers' adherence to a web-based cessation intervention during the first 3
      months of program enrollment. The investigators will utilize a full factorial design where
      participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following features: 1)
      personalization (yes/no), 2) integration (yes/no), 3) dynamic tailoring (yes/no), and 4)
      message intensity (standard vs. decreasing). The primary outcome in Phase I will be a
      composite metric of utilization.

      Phase II involves a 2-arm randomized trial that compares WEB alone to WEB plus the text
      message intervention from Phase I that yields optimal adherence (WEB+OA_TXT). The randomized
      trial will use a repeated measures design, with assessments at baseline, 3, 9, and 15 months.
      Follow-ups at 3, 9, and 15 months correspond to 0, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The
      primary outcome is 30-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 9-months. The investigators
      will assess and validate smoking status at all follow-ups. Other outcomes include motivation
      to quit, quit attempts, and continuous abstinence.
