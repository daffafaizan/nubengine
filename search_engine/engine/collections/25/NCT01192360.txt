      the lungs. Specifically, some areas of the lung may receive less blood supply than others. We
      would like to do a research study in children and adolescents who have a heart condition or a
      chronic or stable lung condition. We are doing this study to see if measuring the circulation
      of blood in the lungs in children is possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a
      special dye (contrast medium) injection called MagnevistÂ®.
