    
      -  Identification of Sentinel node(s)

             1. Step 1: Identification using the technique Nanocis Sub-areolar injection of
                Tc99m-Nanocis ® the day before or the day of surgery

             2. Step 2: Identification using the technique SentiMag ® / Sienna+ Injection Sienna +
                ™ should be done just after induction of anesthesia and before the injection of
                Patent Blue dye

             3. Step 3: Identification using the technique of Patent Blue Dye or Lymphotropic dye
                injection or Patent Blue is performed after induction of anesthesia, the injection
                and production Sienna + ™, the operating theater by the surgeon

        -  Detection of Sentinel node(s)

             1. Step 1: probe SentiMag ® (study)

             2. Step 2: hand probe gamma radiation detection and / or colorimetric detection
                (standard)

        -  Sentinel node's excision of radioactive and / or blue and / or magnetic (colored
           brown-brown)

        -  After the procedure:

      Characterization of the size and weight of lymph nodes, histological and / or molecular OSNA
      and linking nodal status with the detection rate of sentinel nodes for each technique.

      NB: In case of synchronous bilateral cancer, 2 records are possible
