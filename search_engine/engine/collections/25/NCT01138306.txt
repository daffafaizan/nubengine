        -  Determine the extent and prognostic implications of variable s-SHIP expression and SHIP
           gene mutations in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the effects of aberrant s-SHIP expression on the PI3K/Akt pathway in these
           patients via electrochemiluminescence and phosphospecific flow cytometry assays.

      OUTLINE: RNA samples are analyzed for variable s-SHIP expression and are screened for SHIP
      mutations. Cryopreserved cells (with known high- or low-s-SHIP expression) are analyzed for
      the levels of various components of the PI3K/Akt pathway via electrochemiluminescence and
      phosphospecific flow cytometry.
