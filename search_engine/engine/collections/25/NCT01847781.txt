      together with 10 age and sex- matched controls. Blood-samples will be drawn at base-line and
      after 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Serum will be analyzed for opsonophagocytic
      antibodies. Peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) will be isolated, frozen and later
      analyzed for all time-points simultaneously. PBMCs will be stimulated with vaccine-antigens
      for 3-5 days and cellular activation markers will be measured together with cytokines
      (Interferon-gamma, Interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22). In addition, levels of
      antimicrobial peptides in nasal fluid will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks
      post-vaccination.
