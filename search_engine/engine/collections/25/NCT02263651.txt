    
      Eligible patients are patients with operable breast cancer (invasive carcinoma and/or
      carcinoma in situ) for whom mastectomy is recommended or preferred by the patient either
      alone or in association with sentinel lymph node biopsy or standard level I/II axillary node
      dissection

      Randomization will be stratified by center and by type of surgery (mastectomy alone/
      mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy / mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection).

      Two follow-up visits will be performed: at 21 days and 9 months after surgery, these
      appointments are conventional, thus our trial will not modify usual follow-up.
