        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of time to treatment failure at CNS level and 4-months
           treatment failure rate, in patients with brain metastases treated with external-beam
           radiotherapy in combination with indinavir sulfate and ritonavir versus external-beam
           radiotherapy alone.

        -  Prospectively investigate the efficacy of a potentially antiangiogenic agent, indinavir
           sulfate.

        -  Investigate the antineoplastic activity of indinavir sulfate in combination with
           ionizing radiation in cancer patients with metastatic disease to the brain.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy to the brain once daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks
           (10 doses total). Patients also receive oral indinavir sulfate and oral ritonavir twice
           daily for 35 days beginning at day 1 of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy to the brain once daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks
           (10 doses total).

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires, including QOL-30 and the Mini Mental Status
      Examination, at baseline, 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, and at 1 and 3 months
      after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 4
      months.
