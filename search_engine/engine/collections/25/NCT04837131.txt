      taken on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle for 6 cycles in 12 participants
      having diffuse systemic sclerosis/scleroderma of less than 5 years duration with non-severe
      interstitial lung involvement as identified from chest CT scan completed within the preceding
      3 months or at study screening visit. All 12 participants will receive oral ixazomib.
      Reflecting the common use of mycophenolate in the management of scleroderma with complicating
      interstitial lung disease, 6 of 12 participants who will be enrolled will be already taking
      mycophenolate at a stable dose for the preceding 3 months and will be allowed to continue
      taking mycophenolate throughout the entire study prescribed as routine care. Ixazomib will be
      added to their medications. The remaining 6 of 12 participants meeting the same eligibility
      criteria will not be using mycophenolate or any other treatment for scleroderma interstitial
      lung disease at the time of enrollment and will subsequently take ixazomib study medication
      during participation in this study. Ixazomib dose modification or interruption is allowed for
      safety and tolerability reasons at any time during the study.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ixazomib on scleroderma skin
      tightness/thickening and its effect on scleroderma interstitial lung disease.

      The study includes approximately 13 clinic visits over up to approximately 10 months. Study
      procedures include medical examinations, blood tests, chest CT scans, pulmonary function
      tests, echocardiogram, EKG, skin biopsies, and questionnaires.

      There is no cost for participation in this study.
