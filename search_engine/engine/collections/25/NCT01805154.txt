      patients will be followed at every 3 months for the first 12 months from the implant. The
      responder/non-responder evaluation will occur at 6 months from the implant date. The criteria
      used for determining the response to CRT will be captured.

      During the office follow-up visits, arrhythmic episode diagnoses, device data and stored
      electrogram will be collected. All clinical events such as hospitalization for heart failure
      (HF), all-cause hospitalizations, and all-cause death will also be collected. For patients
      who are non-responders to CRT, any re-optimization of the device, i.e., atrioventricular and
      ventricle-to-ventricle interval optimization, left ventricular (LV) lead repositioning and
      pacing vector reconfiguration as well as modified/new clinical therapies administered in an
      attempt to improve HF condition will be collected.
