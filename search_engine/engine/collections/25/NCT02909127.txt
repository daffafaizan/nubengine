      techniques. The clinical evaluation is important for clinical decision-making and to assess
      the need for an instrumental evaluation of swallowing. A recent systematic review suggested
      that the currently available non-instrumental assessments for clinicians to evaluate
      swallowing and feeding function in the pediatric population have wide variations in design,
      assessment domains, and target groups. It was concluded that there is a significant need for
      standardized assessment tools with good psychometric properties in the pediatric population.
      The existing instruments measure the presence or absence and frequency of challenges related
      to eating/feeding problems in pediatrics, they do not comprehensively measure oropharyngeal
      phase swallowing problems or do not reflect the severity of oropharyngeal dysphagia symptoms.
      The 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), which was designed for adult patients, is a good
      model for this current research. It has proven highly successful in quantifying initial
      dysphagia symptom severity and in monitoring treatment efficacy in a vast array of dysphagia
      etiologies. Although the EAT-10 is a symptom survey, it has been able to predict objective
      evidence of swallowing dysfunction. There is no dysphagia spesific and patient/parent
      centered outcome instrument in the pediatric population such as the EAT-10. The purpose of
      this investigation is to develop the Pediatric version of the Eating Assessment Tool
      (PEDI-EAT-10) and investigate its validity and reliability.
