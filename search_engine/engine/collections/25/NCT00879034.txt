      leading to strokes and heart attacks. It is a multisystem disease with objective clinical
      markers for disease progression. These include abnormalities in growth and body composition,
      bone mineral density, join function, endocrine function, alopecia, and vascular disease.
      There is currently no therapy proven effective for any of the progressive and deleterious
      aspects of this disorder.

      Progeria is caused by a gene defect in the gene LMNA, coding for the nuclear protein lamin A.
      Lamin A is normally expressed by most differentiated cells, and requires posttranslational
      farnesylation to incorporate into the nuclear membrane. This trial proposes to use three
      agents (zoledronic acid, pravastatin, and lonafarnib) to inhibit farnesylation of abnormal
      lamin, the disease causing protein in Progeria. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of administering intravenous zoledronic acid, oral pravastatin and
      oral lonafarnib, to patients wtih Progeria for a minimum of 4 weeks.
