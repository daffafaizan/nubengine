      dose escalation test. Based on the number of CART cells per kg body weight which was proved
      to be safe and effective, all the subjects were treated with one single dose of CD19 UCART
      cells per treatment course. The dose escalation test was designed to evaluate the three dose
      levels of CD19 UCART (1 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,3 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg,5 × 10 ^ 6 cells/kg). Each CD19
      UCART infusion will be carried out on day 0. Each subject was observed for at least 4 weeks
      after the last infusion. If there was no dose-limited toxicity (DLT), it is necessary to
      continue multiple treatment courses at this dose level. The detailed administration time and
      dose were decided by the researchers.
