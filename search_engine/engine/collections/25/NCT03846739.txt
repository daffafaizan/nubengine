      effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD
      fMRI) in the amygdala and striatal regions (putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum)
      vary as a function of dose. In particular, the investigators plan to compare effects of three
      different IN-OXT doses (6, 12, and 24 international units, IU) on established neural and
      behavioural correlates of emotion processing in women. Results will be discussed in
      comparison to a previous study of OXT kinetics in men.
