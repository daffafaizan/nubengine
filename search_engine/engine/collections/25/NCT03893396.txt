      treatment in almost all types of coronary lesions. In percutaneous transluminal treatment of
      coronary lesions, balloon angioplasty and bare stents have not shown satisfactory results in
      the past. The so-called active drug-eluting balloon could represent a new therapeutic option
      for the treatment of de novo lesions.
