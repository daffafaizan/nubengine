        1. The principal investigator at MCW, or her appointed representative or collaborators at
           other sites, will review the study protocol and consent form with you and answer any
           questions- this can be done over the phone.

        2. If you choose to participate, the investigator will obtain informed consent for study
           participation, consent to obtain medical records, and a small amount of logistical
           information such as address and phone number.

        3. Subjects and parents may have a blood draw, saliva sample or buccal swab done.

        4. If the subject undergoes surgery for another reason and there is tissue which would
           otherwise be discarded, we may ask to receive this sample for research purposes.

        5. We will request completion of surveys about the individual's medical history as it
           relates to this condition.

        6. The purpose of this study is to promote the understanding of the inheritance of
           hemangiomas associated with brain, eye and heart anomalies. The DNA obtained from
           participants are stored in a DNA repository and genetic data bank for current and future
           research projects related to their genetic disorders. The DNA specimens will be used to
           map disease-related genes. The principal investigator uses her discretion to decide
           which investigators will have access to this resource. The analysis of the specimens
           will vary depending on the investigator and his/her specific protocol.
