      strategy to attenuate postprandial hyperglycemia-induced impairments in vascular function.
      The central hypothesis is that a green tea confection will protect against vascular
      endothelial dysfunction by suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia. The central hypothesis of
      this application will be assessed by providing research participants 75 grams of carbohydrate
      in the form of a confection that contains no green tea concentrate or green tea concentrate
      at a level equivalent to approximately 3 cups of freshly brewed tea. Blood glucose and
      brachial artery flow-mediated dilation will be assessed at regular intervals during the 3
      hour postprandial period to define the extent to which green tea attenuates postprandial
      increases in blood glucose and decreases in vascular function that otherwise occur in a
      hyperglycemia-dependent manner.
