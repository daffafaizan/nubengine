    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-man clinical trial to be conducted in Europe.
      Eligible subjects with stage 2 resistant systemic arterial hypertension currently being
      treated with a minimum of three (3) anti-hypertensive drugs, who consent to study
      participation will be assigned to treatment with the MobiusHD system.

      Potential study participants will be consented and then screened at two (2) baseline visits
      beginning at least 30 days prior to MobiusHD placement. Qualified patients will undergo
      placement of the MobiusHD under angiographic visualization, and will then be followed for 36
      months.
