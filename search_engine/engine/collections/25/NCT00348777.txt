    
      Gonarthrosis is a frequent pathology and the prevalence increase with age (prevalence: 6,1%
      in an adult population more than 30 years old and 40% after 75 years). It has a large impact
      on the quotidian life of the patients and it cause important costs for social protection.
      Relative to the treatment, numerous recommendations have been proposed (EULAR, ACR
      specifically). But no one of them recommends thermal treatment even if it is largely used in
      Europe and especially in France for the treatment of this pathology. Several prospective
      controlled randomized studies have evaluated the effect of the thermal treatments in
      rheumatology and some of them are relative, in part, to Gonarthrosis. So, we conduct a phase
      III randomized, controlled, single blind study evaluating the therapeutic effect at 6 month
      of a thermal cure on gonarthrosis.

      In a situation of physical treatment, it's impossible to use a placebo as control: blind
      can't be respected. Whatever the methodology employed, non blind of the patient create a
      bias. So, we hope that the Zelen method for randomization will reduce the bias due to the
      dissatisfaction of the patients in the control group.
