    
      Background: Although 99mTc MDP bone scintigraphy is a sensitive tool for screening metastatic
      bone status, it is not a satisfactory imaging modality in evaluating residual disease after
      therapy. 18F-FDG PET has been an effective imaging tool for many malignancies including
      breast cancer, not only in diagnosis and staging, but also in monitoring response and
      following up disease status after therapy.

      Purpose: This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET in following up of
      metastastic bone lesions and in predicting outcome for breast cancer patients after therapy.

      Method: Breast cancer patients with bone metastases, age 20-90 year-old, will be included in
      this study.

      Primary outcome: Using 18F-FDG uptake to evaluate the metastatic bone status after treatment.
      The PET results will be compared with the results in Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy.

      Secondary outcome: Evaluate the relationship between the 18F-FDG uptake of the metastatic
      bone lesions and (1) breast cancer related tumor marker, (2) patients' survival.
