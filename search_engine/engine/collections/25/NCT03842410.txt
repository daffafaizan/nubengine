      incisions. There is a 15 mm suburethral incision with the sling being attached with anchors
      to the obturator muscle on each side. This procedure has potentially lesser side-effects
      compared to the longer slings however, the literature has not found the SIMUS to be as
      effective as the long slings. In our recently published study, the DISSTTM technique has
      significantly improved the success of the SIMUS procedure as the sling can be tested for
      proper application in vivo.

      As we have performed several of these procedures in the operating room entirely under local
      anesthesia, we have decided to perform this procedure in an office setting using the same
      safety precautions as in a hospital operating room.

      Performing this procedure in the office has significant benefits for the patient, the
      healthcare industry, and the economy overall. Moving away from a hospital setting has
      significant psychological benefits. This will increase patient acceptance and therefore will
      become appealing to many more women who may be shying away from treatment.

      It would also eliminate the risk of nosocomial infections for the patient and family members,
      improve efficiency as the wait time would be negligible, and would reduce the expense of the
      entire treatment as hospital costs would not feature in the equation.

      This study will assess the feasibility and success of performing the SolyxTM SIMUS in the
      office using the Dynamic Interactive Standing Sling Technique (DISSTTM). Study endpoints will
      be feasibility, composite success, complications, and patient and physician acceptance.
