      ischemic complication may occur. These morbidity results in poor clinical outcomes. The
      incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic event has been reported to be up to 19.7%.
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a concept that a brief ischemic reperfusion of
      upper or lower extremity can transfer protection to the other vital organs from sustained
      ischemic reperfusion injury. Although RIPC is extensively studied in high risk cardiovascular
      surgery, it has not been tested in a non-cardiac surgery patients with a history of ischemic
      heart disease. Major organ injury including heart, lung and kidney will be evaluated in this
      randomized controlled trial.
