      other complex human characteristics. The main areas of interest are tobacco smoking, excess
      alcohol consumption, psychological traits, and HIV/AIDS susceptibility and progression. The
      subjects will be adult male and female probands who display one or more of the phenotypes of
      interest together with their brothers, sisters and parents. Information on tobacco and
      alcohol use, psychological and personality traits, sexual behavior, HIV status and
      progression, and other characteristics with possible genetic components will be obtained
      through structured interviews and questionnaires. DNA will be prepared from blood samples and
      typed for a series of candidate genes chosen for function and for random polymorphic markers.
      By correlating the genotypic and phenotypic information, we hope to identify individual loci
      that interactively contribute to many different aspects of human health and disease.
