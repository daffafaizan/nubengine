      progressive installation of a multi organ injuries. Despite the progress in its management,
      particularly since the introduction of hydroxycarbamide, the median age of death in sickle
      cell patients was about 40 years in a recent US study. Severe forms resistant to hydroxyurea
      or cerebral vasculopathy require transfusion programs throughout susceptible to risks of iron
      overload and alloimmunization. The bone marrow transplantation cures almost 95% of children
      and adolescents transplant from an HLA-identical siblings. In patients without HLA-identical
      donor, interesting results have been reported in haploidentical transplants marrow without ex
      vivo T cell depletion taken after non myeloablative conditioning regimen and GvHD prevention
      with cyclophosphamide high dose injection after bone marrow transplant . This approach
      performed in 14 patients was effective to cure 50% of the patients and 50% have rejected the
      transplant . No death or severe GvHD were related to the procedure.

      DREPHAPLO protocol aims to evaluate that approach in a population of sickle cell patients
      with severe complications of the disease, bringing direct benefit to patients with a cure of
      the disease in at least half of them.
