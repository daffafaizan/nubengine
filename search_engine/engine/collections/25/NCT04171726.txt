      consequences. There is currently no evidence-based guideline on prevention of thromboembolic
      events after TAVI and the current standard of care with DAPT 3-6 months is based on expert
      opinion. Recently multislice computed tomography (MSCT) studies identified bioprosthesis
      leaflet thickening and impaired leaflet motion after TAVI. The goal of this study is to
      investigate whether in TAVI patients, treatment with edoxaban leads to a reduction in leaflet
      thickening incidence after 3 months and whether it is safe and clinically efficient.

      Objective: To investigate whether treatment with edoxaban leads to a decrease in incidence of
      leaflet thickening and is clinical efficient and safe.

      Study design: A single-center, investigator-initiated, open-label, observational study.

      Study population: Patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement in
      the Erasmus University Medical Center with no formal novel oral
      anticoagulants/vitamin-K-antagonist (NOAC/VKA) indication.

      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be treated with edoxaban for a period of 3 months
      following TAVI. Afterwards they will switch to acetylsalicylic acid.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The incidence of leaflet thickening on MSCT 3 months after
      TAVI and edoxaban treatment.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Thus far edoxaban has proven to be safe and non-inferior to treatment with
      warfarin in several indications. The role of anticoagulant agents in TAVI still has to be
      unravelled. Subjects participating in this trial are possibly at higher risk for bleeding
      complications than patients being treated with dual antiplatelet therapy after TAVI.
