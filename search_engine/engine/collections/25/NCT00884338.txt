      will be stratified for allogeneic or autologous blood stem cell transplantation. Patients in
      the exercise group will carry out an endurance training consisting of walking on a treadmill
      at a speed corresponding to 80% of the maximum heart rate. The exercise program will be
      carried out 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. Patients in the control group will receive counseling
      about exercise and behavioural techniques to reduce fatigue, but they will not participate at
      a structured exercise program. Physical performance (VO2max), cognitive function, mood and
      quality of life will be evaluated at recruitment and after 8 weeks.
