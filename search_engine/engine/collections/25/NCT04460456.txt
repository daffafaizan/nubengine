      escalating doses of SBT6050 to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the
      dose recommended for Part 2. Part 2 of the study will further evaluate SBT6050 in select HER2
      expressing or amplified advanced malignancies.

      Part 3 will evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of escalating doses of SBT6050 in
      combination with pembrolizumab to estimate the MTD and determine the dose recommended for
      Part 2. Part 4 of the study will further evaluate SBT6050 in combination with pembrolizumab
      in select HER2 expressing or amplified advanced malignancies
