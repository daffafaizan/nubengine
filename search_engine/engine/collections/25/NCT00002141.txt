      arm and 6 patients entering the control arm. Patients in the treatment arm receive 6 single
      escalating doses of 1592U89 separated by at least a 6-day washout period. Patients in the
      control arm receive 6 single oral doses of placebo at least 6 days apart. The second and
      third doses of 1592U89 are equivalent. During these doses, investigators study the effects of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of 1592U89 by giving half of the patients the second dose with a
      standardized, high-fat breakfast and giving the other half the dose in a fasted state. During
      the third dose, patients are crossed over so that patients who received the second dose with
      a meal now receive it in a fasted state, and vice versa. Following the sixth dose,
      investigators break the blind. Patients who received 1592U89 take a seventh dose in solution
      form and return for follow-up at least 7 days later; patients who received placebo receive no
      further treatment or follow-up. Serial blood and urine samples are collected before and after
      each administration of 1592U89 (or placebo) for determination of plasma and urine
      concentrations of 1592U89, and investigators monitor patients closely for adverse events or
      abnormal laboratory test findings.
