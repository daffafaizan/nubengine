      the irrigation protocol, passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI, n = 20) and syringe and needle
      irrigation (NI, n = 20). Microbiological sampling was performed before (S1) and after the
      root canal preparation (S2), after the tested irrigation protocols (S3). Total bacteria
      counts were determined by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay; and the endotoxin levels by the
      LAL assay.
