      study. The subject must be treated at the Dorothy P. and Richard P. Simmons Center for
      Interstitial Lung Disease. Subjects, if consented, are required to perform tests so that
      research data can be collected. At the initial visit, patients are subject to having a blood
      draw, pulmonary function testing, echocardiograms, and CT scans as well as completing several
      questionnaires designed to measure how the patient is feeling. Follow up visits are then
      scheduled in 3-4 month intervals. Every 3-4 months blood samples will be collected while
      every 6-8 months the questionnaires will administered. If the patient enters a stage of
      accelerated decline in lung function, a bronchoscopy will be performed to collect residual
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for testing. All of the results of clinical and laboratory
      testing will be placed into the subjects research file.
