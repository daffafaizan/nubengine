      optimal aging. Optimal aging within the Health TAPESTRY program means supporting people to
      move through life with good health in the best possible way: Being Alive Well. Health
      TAPESTRY is a health and social care approach that centres on meeting a person's health goals
      with the support of technology, trained community volunteers, an interprofessional team,
      system navigation, and better links between primary care and community organizations. The
      Health TAPESTRY intervention takes a complex, multilevel approach to integration, from both
      system level and individual level perspectives. The Health TAPESTRY program will provide
      processes and tools to activate and support individuals to access and use the broad range of
      available primary health care, social and community services to achieve their personal health
      goals and strategies to better integrate care at the system level. More specifically Health
      TAPESTRY will promote optimal aging:

        -  through intentional, proactive conversations about a person's life, health and care
           goals within the primary healthcare setting;

        -  through improved connections between inter-professional primary care teams, community
           service providers and informal caregivers;

        -  by training volunteers to serve as a link between the primary care team and a person in
           their home;

        -  by using technology from the home to link directly with the primary health care team
           which includes

        -  the tablet-based Health TAPESTRY app for volunteers to use;

        -  the Personal Health Record (PHR) and

        -  innovative resources (i.e. Optimal Aging Portal).

      It is anticipated that together these will enable transformation of how primary healthcare
      and interprofessional teams provide care to older adults in a manner that provides value for
      resources used and meets needs and goals of older adults.
