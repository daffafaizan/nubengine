      Secondary dystonia are the syndromes that have dystonic symptoms due to brain insult which
      can be associated with neonatal encephalopathy syndromes, trauma, vascular injury,
      infections, demyelinations, or hereditary disorders associated with neurodegenerative
      process. The disability inflected by dystonia encouraged the development of many
      neurosurgical procedures in order to improve the quality of life of these patients.

      The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of different Neuroablative and modulation
      techniques in treatment of secondary dystonia.

      Patients and methods This is a prospective study included 120 patients suffering from
      intractable secondary dystonia. Ablative techniques included the brain lesioning procedure
      and combined anterior and posterior lumbar rhizotomy (CAPR). Modulation techniques included
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) and intrathecal baclofen therapy (ITB). Patients with focal
      dystonia were included in the Botulinum toxin injection group. Patients with generalized
      dystonia were included in either of the brain lesioning or the deep brain stimulation, and
      patients with predominant affection of both lower limbs were included in either of the (CAPR)
      or the (ITB) groups.

      Assessment measures included the evaluation of the muscle tone, range of motion, and the
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale through a follow up period of one year.
