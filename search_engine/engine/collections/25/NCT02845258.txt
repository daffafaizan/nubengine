      pseudocyst are eligible for inclusion. The drainage is performed at the discretion of an
      experienced endosonographer. Thus, the equipment and the technique used may vary among
      patients but no randomization is done before the procedure. Intraprocedural variables are
      registered as well as data and outcome parameters from the clinical follow up according to
      below.
