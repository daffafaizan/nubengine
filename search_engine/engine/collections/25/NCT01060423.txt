      and, however, in spite of the significant progress in the therapeutical strategies for
      metastatic disease, virtually all patients will eventually succumb to their illness. Based on
      prior clinical data there is a good rationale for the expectation that the combination of
      systemic chemotherapy and arterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads may be effective
      in the setting of patients with unresectable or chemorefractory liver metastases. The aim of
      this study is therefore to assess whether the combination of Irinotecan eluting beads and
      intravenous cetuximab is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with unresectable
      liver metastases from refractory colorectal cancer and will result in a prolongation of
      disease control when compared to standard systemic treatment with intravenous irinotecan and
      intravenous cetuximab. In this patient group, intravenous irinotecan plus intravenous
      cetuximab may represent the "standard of care", with a previously described activity. The
      patient group is defined in terms of pretreatment, and the scientific question is whether the
      way of irinotecan administration by eluting beads in feasible and somehow beneficial.
