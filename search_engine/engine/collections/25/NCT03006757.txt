      from the action of jaw elevator muscles modified by the craniomandibular biomechanics
      .Determination of individual bite force level has been widely used in dentistry, mainly to
      understand the mechanics of mastication for evaluation of the therapeutic effects of
      prosthetic devices and to provide reference values for studies on the biomechanics of
      prosthetic devices. In addition, bite force has been considered important in the diagnosis of
      the disturbances of the stomatognathic system .

      Twenty (20) single maxillary completely edentulous patients were selected from the
      out-patient clinic of the Removable Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of Oral and Dental
      Medicine, Cairo University.

      The primary outcome is to measure the biting force of single maxillary complete denture by I
      Load star sensor .
