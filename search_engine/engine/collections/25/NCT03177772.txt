      bereaved dementia caregivers (2014-NIRG-305569), CGGT was administered to participants in a
      prospective, randomized-controlled trial. Participants in 5 treatment groups confirmed
      clinically significant reduction in complicated grief on the Inventory of Complicated Grief.
      In that study, intervention elements suitable for adaption in a preventative care approach
      were identified. The investigators are adapting these elements of CGGT for soon-to-be
      bereaved dementia caregivers at risk for complicated grief-Pre-Loss Group Therapy (PLGT) to
      facilitate healthy death preparedness and eventual bereavement.

      Specific Aims: 1) Assess preparedness for death and grief of bereaved and soon-to-be bereaved
      caregivers. 2) Adapt CGGT treatment elements into a manualized pre-loss preparedness group
      psychotherapy-(PLGT)-for dementia caregivers at risk for complicated grief. 3) Implement and
      evaluate three PLGT cohorts (NTotal = 40) in three long-term care facilities with family
      caregivers at-risk for complicated grief whose care recipient has a life expectancy of 6
      months or less and resides in a long-term care facility.
