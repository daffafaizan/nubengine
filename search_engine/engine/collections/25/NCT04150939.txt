      I. To determine the effect of cryoablation on adaptive resistance to immunotherapy in
      metastatic cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess additional efficacy response to treatment. II. To assess the safety and
      tolerability of cryoablation in this population. III. To compare the radiologic response of
      ablated and non-ablated lesions using Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (iRECIST) and RECIST 1.1.

      IV. To assess the immune effect of cryoablation on the non-ablated lesion using pre- and
      post-treatment biopsies.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the immune microenvironment and systemic changes as a result of cryoablation
      with the goal of biomarker discovery.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 1 week prior to the next scheduled standard of care immunotherapy infusion,
      patients undergo core biopsy of the lesion to be ablated and a non-ablated lesion and also
      undergo cryoablation. Patients undergo a mandatory second core biopsy of the non-ablated
      lesion at 4 weeks after cryoablation.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 12 months after cryoablation and then
      periodically thereafter.
