      but exact mechanism is not well determined in human-beings. Changes in some
      neurotransmitters' status in brain after rTMS have been suggested as a possible mechanism,
      but role of GABA is not clear.

      Twelve healthy people will be recruited. They will receive the rTMS over the primary motor
      cortex of the dominant hand. Individual subject will receive three sessions of rTMS with
      wash-out period (more than 3 days) between the rTMS sessions. Three rTMS sessions are high
      frequency (10Hz), low frequency (1Hz) and sham rTMS. The order of rTMS sessions will be
      randomly decided. After completing each rTMS session, [18F]flumazenil-PET will be checked.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate 1)whether rTMS over the primary motor cortex can
      modulate the [18F]flumazenil binding potential and 2)whether the modulation of
      [18F]flumazenil binding potential by rTMS can be different according to the applied frequency
      of rTMS.
