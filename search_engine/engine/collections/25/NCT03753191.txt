      associated with functional abnormalities in prefrontal regions such as the right inferior
      frontal gyrus (Right IFG) or the left dorsal lateral pre-frontal cortex (Left DLPFC) .
      Clinical studies suggest that tDCS may be a useful therapeutic tool. Post-tDCS improvements
      have also been shown in visuo-motor coordination of healthy controls and performance in
      working memory. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of tDCS stimulation over
      left DLPFC or right IFG on attention, inhibition and working memory and their neural
      correlates in people with dementia (PWD) and healthy controls (HC).This study is planned as a
      double-blinded, randomized case-control interventional study with a duration of 30 months.
