    
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling third-trimester
      pregnant women in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, for up to four consecutive RSV
      seasons in each hemisphere. The trial will enroll 4636 third-trimester pregnant subjects.
      Women in the third trimester of a singleton uncomplicated pregnancy and 18 to 40 years of age
      (inclusive) will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment groups,
      active or placebo, over approximately the three months prior to peak RSV season. After the
      first global season of enrollment, the randomization scheme will be changed to a 2:1
      (active/placebo) ratio to enable more efficient accrual of the safety database.

      All maternal subjects will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 0 with the
      assigned test article, the RSV F vaccine or placebo. Study participation for maternal
      subjects will span approximately nine (9) months from the first dose, ending six (6) months
      post-delivery. Study follow-up for infant subjects who are consented will span approximately
      one (1) year post-delivery.
