      acids of human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and the 15-amino-acid C-terminus of
      Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP). The rationale for selecting CNP, a natriuretic peptide
      of endothelial cell origin, is that it exhibits predominantly venodilating effects, which may
      minimize systemic hypotension. Moreover, its anti-proliferative action is also a highly
      desirable property for novel cardiovascular drugs. However, a limitation of CNP is that it
      does not exert significant renal actions, whereas, DNP is potently natriuretic and diuretic.
      Thus, CD-NP was synthesized with the goal of combining the above complementary profiles of
      CNP and DNP into a single chimeric peptide.
