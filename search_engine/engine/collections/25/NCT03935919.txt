      capillary blood glucose testing. A significant limitation for this method is the frequency by
      which blood glucose testing is typically performed, at most 4-6 times daily. Continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) provides an alternative approach to measure glucose values with the
      advantage of greater frequency of monitoring as it is measured every few minutes.

      Whilst CGM use in the outpatient setting is rising and has demonstrated benefits on glycaemic
      control, the accuracy of these devices perioperatively is less investigated. In this study
      the sixth-generation factory-calibrated real-time Dexcom G6Â® system will be used as a CGM and
      its glucose values perioperatively will be compared to the capillary glucose values which
      will be measured simultaneously by the Accu-Check Inform II (Roche Diagnostics) point-of-care
      blood glucose meter.

      The Investigators aim to assess the feasibility and accuracy of perioperative CGM.
