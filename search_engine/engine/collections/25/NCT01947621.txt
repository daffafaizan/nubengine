    
      Registry is an open-ended study and eligible individuals are assessed at index event and
      follow-up on their phenotypical characteristics. Furthermore, outcome data are collected (by
      clinical visits or telephone follow-up).

      In addition, participants are given the option to consent to the donation of biosamples for
      the purposes to identify TTC specific biomarkers and mutations (sub-study on behalf of the
      registry).
