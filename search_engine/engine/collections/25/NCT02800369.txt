      E7 DNA in HPV16- and HPV18-positive cells. The disruption to viral DNA directly led to
      downregulation of E7 expression and restoration of the tumor suppressor genes retinoblastoma
      1 (RB1), resulting in apoptosis and growth inhibition of ZFN-treated HPV16- and HPV18-
      positive cell lines. On the basis of these laboratory results, there is the potential that
      this may work in humans infected with high-risk HPV (especially HPV16 and HPV18) and block
      the progression of CIN The new treatment to be studied will involve transfecting ZFNs into
      HPV-infected cervical epithelials. Cells modified by ZFN-603 and ZFN-758 will lose the
      ability of immortalization and progress to apoptosis.

      Researchers hope that these agents will be able to block the malignant progression of CIN and
      reduce the incidence of cervical cancer
