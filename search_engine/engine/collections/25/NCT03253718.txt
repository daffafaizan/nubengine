    
      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to get adequate normal values to compare in clinical patient
      studies.

      Study population

      There will be two techniques developed in this study: Somatosensory Temporal Discrimination
      Threshold (STDT) and Acoustic Startle Reflex (ASR). For both studies we will collect data
      systematically in an adequate sample of normal subjects.

      We plan to recruit the following number of healthy volunteers (HV s) for each study.

      STDT: 50 HV

      ASR: 50 HV

      Design

      Subjects will come for up to 3 outpatient visits, during which they will participate in at
      least the STDT or the ASR. Before participation in any study, all participants will undergo
      screening for medical history and physical examination.

      For the STDT, the index finger in both hands will be stimulated.

      For the ASR, auditory stimulation will be administered at varying intervals. Subjects will
      also be asked to complete State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before participation in the
      study.

      Outcome measures

      STDT: discrimination threshold value

      ASR: EMG response from seven muscles, heart rate, and galvanic skin response
