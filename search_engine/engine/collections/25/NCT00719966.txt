        -  Determine the effect of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy on endothelial function in
           postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      according to breast cancer hormone-receptor status (positive vs negative).

        -  Group 1 (hormone receptor-positive): Patients receive aromatase inhibition therapy for
           up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2 (hormone receptor-negative): Patients do not receive adjuvant treatment.

      Endothelial function is measured in both groups at baseline and at follow up by the room
      temperature peripheral arterial tonometry (RT-PAT) index using the EndoPAT method.
