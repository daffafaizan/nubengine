    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined as a disease state characterized by
      the presence of airflow obstruction due to chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The airflow
      obstruction is generally progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyper-reactivity, and may
      be partially reversible. Inflammation in the lungs is triggered by exposure to inhaled toxic
      substances that can lead to tissue damage, mucous secretion, airways narrowing and tissue
      destruction.

      Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a major role in elevating sputum in patients with COPD and may
      contribute to tissue destruction. Therefore, the highly specific antibody to IL-8 (such as
      ABX-IL8) may help to reduce mucous production and tissue destruction.
