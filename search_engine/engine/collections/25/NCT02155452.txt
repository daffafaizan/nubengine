      treat. Neuro-oncology has seen little progress in its treatment despite extensive research.
      Extent of resection remains a very important prognostic factor in these tumors. Better the
      resection, better the outcomes. However resecting these tumors is not very easy primarily due
      to their infiltrative nature and difficulty in discerning tumor boundaries intraoperatively.
      Fluorescence guided resection (FGR) has recently been shown to be a very important and useful
      adjunct in maximizing this goal. FGR involves administration of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to
      the patient prior to surgery. The ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in glioma
      cells. The PPIX is a fluorophore and can be visualized intraoperatively using a suitably
      modified microscope. Neurosurgeons can then resect the tumor radically guided by this
      fluorescence which is superior to the conventional microscopic resection. Selective PPIX
      accumulation in glioma cells is the key to the accuracy of this technique. The biological
      basis of selectivity of PPIX accumulation within glioma cells is however poorly understood.
      Various mechanisms could be involved starting from variable transport (related to blood-brain
      barrier properties), differential uptake (governed by active transport mechanisms) and
      differential metabolism within the cell. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to
      refinements in this strategy, overcoming its present limitations and development of methods
      to extend its scope.
