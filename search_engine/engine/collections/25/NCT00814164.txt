    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Study complete response (CR) and CR without platelet recovery (CRp) following treatment
           with clofarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride in older patients with newly diagnosed
           acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Study disease-free and overall survival of these patients following treatment with this
           regimen.

        -  Compare disease-free and overall survival of patients whose cells do or do not
           demonstrate apoptosis following treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients are assessed
           after induction course 1. Patients with â‰¥ 5% blasts in bone marrow may receive another
           course of induction therapy beginning between 28-84 days after initiation of course 1.
           Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp)
           (after 1 or 2 courses of induction therapy) proceed to consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning between 28 -84 days after initiation of last course of
           induction therapy, patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5 minutes on days 1 and 3. Patients may receive a
           second course of consolidation therapy beginning between 28-84 days of consolidation
           course 1.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically to assess response and for
      pharmacokinetic, cytogenetic, immunophenotyping, and molecular analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 2 years.
