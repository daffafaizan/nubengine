      I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with lapatinib.

      II. Determine the progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival of
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to
      prior epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-88 patients (21-50 epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]
      inhibitor-naive patients [cohort A] and 19-38 EGFR inhibitor-pre-treated patients [cohort B])
      will be accrued for this study within 4-12.6 months.
