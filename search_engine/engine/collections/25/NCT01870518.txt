      (STN) has been accepted as the surgical treatment of choice for patients with advanced
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), demonstrating improvements in motor function that exceed those
      achieved by medical management alone. Unfortunately, a paucity of data exist comparing
      non-motor outcomes between DBS of the available targets. Specifically, a high prevalence of
      concurrent cognitive dysfunction or early dementia exists in PD patients, and it is unclear
      whether DBS target selection may have differential effects with regards to cognitive outcomes
      in PD patients with early evidence of mild cognitive impairment Previous studies indicate
      that stimulation of either the GPi or STN is associated with decrements in patients' verbal
      fluency, visuospatial memory, as well as overall cognitive decline, but those patients were
      randomized without consideration for baseline neurocognitive performance and it is unclear
      whether these effects are due to treatment or rather the natural history of these patients.

      In addition to the clinical arm of this trial, another secondary goal is to evaluate several
      biomarkers obtained from blood and cerebrospinal in order to determine their utility if any
      as prognosticators of patient cognitive and motor outcomes. Specifically, we will be
      evaluating levels of amyloid 1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau 181, and brain derived
      neurotrophic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid as well as genotyping the apolipoprotein-E
      gene. These proteins and genotypes are still currently under investigation as potential
      biomarkers for dementia as well as neuroplasticity.
