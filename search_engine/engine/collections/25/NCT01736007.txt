    
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and response to treatment of the
      use of the 308-nm excimer laser in children (age 6-17 years) diagnosed with patch type
      alopecia areata involving the scalp, present for more than 6 months duration. Patients
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly enrolled in a treatment group or placebo
      group. Response to treatment during and after the 12-week laser treatment course will be
      measured in terms of hair regrowth utilizing the SALT score and 2 blinded evaluations of
      subject photographs.

      Specific Aims Evaluate the feasibility and safety of twice-weekly excimer laser treatments
      over a period of 12 weeks. Measures will include side effects, response to treatment (hair
      growth), tolerability of therapy, attrition, attendance, and overall satisfaction with this
      treatment modality.
