      one of three doses of DIO-902: 150, 300 or 450 mg QHS. All subjects receiving DIO-902 placebo
      and 50% of subjects receiving DIO-902 will be re-randomized to one of three DIO-902 doses.
      The remaining 50% of subjects receiving DIO-902 will be assigned to their original DIO-902
      dose. The re- randomization will be performed by a group independent of study conduct to
      ensure the treatment status of the subject while in Protocol DIO-502 remains blinded. In
      addition, subjects will continue on the same dose of metformin that they had been taking
      during the conduct of Protocol DIO-502. Subjects will continue on atorvastatin 10 mg for the
      first 4 weeks of this protocol. Thereafter, at Study Visits 3 and 4, the dose of atorvastatin
      may be increased up to a maximum of 40 mg daily in order to achieve LDL-cholesterol/non-HDL
      cholesterol goals specified within the protocol. In addition, after Study Visit 4 (Week 12)
      subjects with HbA1c levels of > 7.5% (0.075 Hb Fract.) will undergo a one time titration of
      their oral hypoglycemic regimen as per the algorithm provided in the protocol.
