      on the physical, psychological and quality of life . It is also predictive of entry into an
      institution.

      In this project, the investigators propose to evaluate the patient at home with an IDEG
      (Gerontological Assessment Nurse) working in collaboration with the attending physician,
      whenever the fall triggers a call to the SAMU (without hospitalization or with
      hospitalization of less than 24 hours). In addition to the evaluation, the nurse will propose
      a personalized intervention plan (PIP) based on targeted and prioritized actions.

      The Main objective is to study the effect of a personalized intervention plan (PIP) proposed
      by an IDEG at home in the elderly who used the UAS for a fall (with on-site care or
      hospitalization inferior to 24h), on the delay institutionalization or death before
      institutionalization compared to standard care.
