      that include vegetables to protect children against the development of overweight. There is
      evidence that it is important what weaning infants are offered: starting exclusively with
      vegetables is more successful for the promotion of vegetable acceptance than starting with
      fruits. There is also evidence that it is important how infants are weaned: responsive
      feeding characterised by sensitive responses to infant cues during feeding fosters healthy
      eating. However, the what and the how of infant weaning have never been experimentally tested
      in the same study to determine their relative importance for fostering vegetable acceptance,
      nor have they been combined to test whether a focus on both may be superior to each approach
      separately. This study employs a randomised controlled design testing the effectiveness of
      (a) a focus on the what in weaning, i.e., a vegetable-exposure intervention; (b) a focus on
      the how in weaning, i.e., an intervention to enhance responsive feeding; (c) a combined focus
      on what and how in weaning in an integrated intervention; (d) an attention-control group.
      Vegetable acceptance will be measured before and directly after the interventions when the
      child is 18 months of age, and when the child is 24 and 36 months of age. The proposed study
      is based on a unique integration of expert knowledge from the field of nutrition and the
      field of parenting, which will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the
      development of vegetable acceptance in infants, and ultimately the prevention of overweight.
