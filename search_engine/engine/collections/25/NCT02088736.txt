      In adult and paediatric patients with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in Singapore,
      investigators aim to evaluate the incremental benefit of introducing a resuscitation protocol
      including the use of intravenous (IV) access and/or intraosseous (IO) vascular access
      compared to protocols with only intravenous (IV) access by SCDF paramedics in the
      pre-hospital setting on the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rates.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To compare the success rates of vascular access with IV access and/or IO insertion
           compared to that with intravenous (IV) access alone by SCDF paramedics in the
           pre-hospital setting.

        -  To compare the rates of successful 1st dose adrenaline given in the field to cardiac
           arrest patients in IV+IO and IV groups and whether this translates into a higher
           survival rate at 30 days.

        -  To determine the cost benefit of introducing IO access to the emergency ambulance
           service for OHCA.

      Hypothesis:

      In adult and paediatric patients with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in Singapore, the
      hypothesis is that low vascular access rates could be due to difficulty of setting IV
      cannulas in the field due to certain factors like poor lighting or space constraints. Thus,
      by introducing a protocol including IO access for difficult IV cases, success rates for
      vascular access will be higher and this might lead to a higher ROSC and survival rates.
