    
      Objectives: Follow up of patients infected by HIV-1 for less than three months.

        1. Improve the physiological and pathological knowledge of primary HIV infection

             -  Study of the immune mechanisms involved early after infection

             -  Kinetics of viral replication and establishment of cellular reservoirs at an early
                stage

             -  Relationships between virological markers and immune response kinetics

             -  Impact of resistance mutations, subtype and tropism on the disease progression and
                the response to treatment

             -  Study of sub-groups of specific patients followed since primary infection,
                spontaneous or post treatment controllers, subjects with specific HLA

        2. Assessing the impact of early, transient or prolonged treatment versus deferred
           treatment on the long-term prognosis of patients followed since primary infection, in
           terms of activation / inflammation and decrease in viral reservoirs

        3. Contribute to knowledge in the epidemiology of HIV infection:

             -  Modes of transmission

             -  Sexual behavior after HIV diagnosis

             -  Calendar trend of transmitted viral strains diversity (ARV resistance and subtypes)

             -  Calendar trend of marker levels measured at primary infection

        4. Contribute to national recommendations for therapeutic care, evaluate their
           implementation

        5. Use observational data from the cohort for the development of therapeutic clinical
           trials at primary infection
