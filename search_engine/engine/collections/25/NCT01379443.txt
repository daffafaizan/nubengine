      a new Centre. The purpose of the evaluation is to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of
      this service with the usual care that people receive. 500 Children will be randomized to
      receive either usual care (250) or the co-ordinated, navigated care from CTN (250). The
      primary question to be addressed is whether the more integrated CTN model of service improves
      family-centered services, parent mental health, parenting, family function and the quality of
      the child's life and the families resource needs as well as reduce expenditures for the
      families' use of all other health and social services compared to the outcomes of usual care
      alone. What children and families with what characteristics and circumstances most benefit
      from which approach to the treatment of childhood disability in Simcoe-York? At what cost?

      Agencies providing services to children will be evaluated as to how effective their
      integration of teams are functioning, their partnership with each other and capacity building
      in the community.
