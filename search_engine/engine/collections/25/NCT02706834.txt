      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single oral
      doses of TAK-828 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants.

      The study enrolled 36 healthy participants. An interleaving crossover design with placebo
      substitution was used for Cohorts 1 and 2, and a crossover design was used in Cohort 3. Each
      cohort consisted of 12 participants, and participants were randomized to treatment sequence
      to receive TAK-828 or placebo after undergoing a fasting stage of at least 8 hours through
      intervention periods 1-4 for Cohorts 1 and 2 and through intervention periods 1 - 3 for
      Cohort 3. The assigned treatment sequence will remain undisclosed to the participant and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). An additional
      interventional period 5 (fed state) is planned to be conducted in either cohort 1 or 2, based
      on the dose of TAK-828 that will be chosen to be studied under fed conditions. Cohorts 1 and
      2 were conducted in non-Japanese participants and Cohort 3 in Japanese participants.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. Participants remained confined to
      the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 4 of each intervention period and returned
      7 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
