    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of lenalidomide and ibrutinib for combination
      with rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic
      lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide, ibrutinib and
      rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the combination of
      lenalidomide, rituximab and ibrutinib in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
      small lymphocytic lymphoma as defined by response rate, duration of response, and
      progression-free survival.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (up to 6 cycles), lenalidomide orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (up to 12 cycles), and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months
      for 10 years.
