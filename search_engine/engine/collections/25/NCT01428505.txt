      microglia activation in multiple sclerosis could represent a useful marker of
      neuroinflammation. A novel PET tracer with high affinity to TSPO, [18F]PBR111, is a promising
      tool for PET imaging of activated microglia.

      This is a study aimed to characterize [18F]PBR111 as an in vivo marker of microglial
      activation in Multiple Sclerosis. Regional binding of [18F]PBR111 will be quantified with PET
      in the brain of up to 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and up to 24 age- and gender-
      matched healthy volunteers. A subgroup of patients and healthy volunteers will be scanned
      twice in consecutive days, to test the reproducibility of the measure. Another subgroup of
      patients will be re-scanned with [18F]PBR111 after 4-6 months. MRI-based measures will be
      acquired at baseline and, in those patients with later repeat PET scans, also after 4-6
      months.

      Data from this study will inform about the possible implementation of the [18F]PBR111 ligand
      to monitor the neuroinflammatory process, disease progression, and response to treatment in
      MS patients.
