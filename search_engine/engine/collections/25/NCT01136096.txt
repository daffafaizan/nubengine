    
      This randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate whether a home-based exercise
      could improve adiponectin levels, exercise behavior and metabolic risk factors (insulin
      resistance, metabolic components and physical fitness) in subjects with at least a diabetic
      risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Participants were randomly allocated to either a
      control group or a home-based exercise group. All participants were evaluated for outcome
      measures at baseline, and at 3-month 6-month and 9-month follow-up after engaging in the
      intervention.
