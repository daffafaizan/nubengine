      mobilization of peripheral progenitor stem cells in patients with recurrent or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing platinum based salvage
      chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the role of amifostine in preventing renal toxicity in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive salvage
      chemotherapy with intravenous dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) with or without
      amifostine. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours followed by cytarabine IV for 2 doses.
      Patients also receive dexamethasone orally or IV. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 2-6
      courses. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes prior to all courses of DHAP,
      as a 15 minute infusion, beginning 30 minutes prior to cisplatin administration. Arm II:
      Patients do not receive amifostine. On day 3 of the last DHAP course, patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) until the last day of progenitor stem cell (PSC) mobilization. PSC
      transplant continues daily for 4-10 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
