    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Immunogenicity objectives

        1. To evaluate the magnitude of the antibody responses to one or two 'priming' 0.5mL
           intramuscular (IM) doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1)
           influenza vaccine, each dose containing 7.5μg of H5N1 haemagglutinin, in immunologically
           naïve subjects;

        2. To examine the kinetics of the antibody responses to one 0.5mL 'booster' intramuscular
           dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, or non-adjuvanted antigenically
           drifted vaccine, given at doses of 3.75 or 7.5μg, in subjects primed with one or two
           doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine;

        3. To evaluate the magnitude of the antibody responses to one 0.5mL 'booster' intramuscular
           dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, or non-adjuvanted antigenically
           drifted vaccine, given at doses of 3.75μg or 7.5μg, in subjects primed with one or two
           doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine;

        4. To evaluate the breadth of the antibody responses induced by 'priming' (see 1., above),
           and 'booster' vaccination regimens (see 2., and 3., above), with respect to a
           representative range of antigenically distinct H5N1 viruses (wild-type and attenuated);
           and

        5. To evaluate the persistence of the antibody responses induced by 'priming' (see 1.,
           above), and 'booster' vaccination regimens (see 2., and 3., above).

      Safety objective

      1. To evaluate the safety of the administration of one or two 'priming' 0.5mL intramuscular
      (IM) doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine (each
      dose containing 7.5μg of H5N1 haemagglutinin), in immunologically naïve subjects, followed by
      one 3.75μg or 7.5μg 'booster' dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, or
      non-adjuvanted antigenically drifted H5N1 vaccine.
