    
      This prospective randomized controlled trial aims to examine the effect of fascia iliaca
      compartment block on postoperative pain and opioid consumption in pediatric patients (3yâ‰¤ age
      <18y) who will undergo orthopedics surgery (proximal femoral osteotomy).

      Patients will be allocated to either the FICB(Fascia iliaca compartment block + IV PCA) group
      or the control group (no block + IV PCA). Fascia iliaca compartment block will be performed
      using 0.25% ropivacaine (1mL/kg, MAX 30mL) under ultrasound-guidance at the end of surgery.

      The total opioid consumption at 12, and 24 hours after the surgery, and the pain score at 10
      min after PACU admin, 1,6,24 hours after the surgery, the total dose of additional rescue
      analgesia (intravenous ketorolac or nalbuphine) at 12 and 24 hours after the surgery will be
      recorded.
