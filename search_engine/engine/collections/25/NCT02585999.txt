      pill and the contraceptive ring are often prescribed in an extended manner (12 weeks
      straight). The contraceptive patch, however, is not routinely prescribed in this way.
      Concerns have been raised that hormone levels, in particular estrogen, are higher among patch
      users than those who use oral contraception or the vaginal ring and that this may contribute
      to an increased risk of clot. However, few studies have actually looked at these hormone
      levels in women with extended use of the contraceptive patch.

      The investigators plan to enroll eligible women age 18-39 who are willing to use the
      contraceptive patch continuously for twelve weeks, and can adhere to the study requirements
      for follow-up. All participants will have weekly serum assessments of ethinyl estradiol and
      norelgestromin levels. The investigators will enroll 30 women, in anticipation of a 33%
      attrition rate, with the goal of obtaining completed data on 20 participants. The study
      duration for an individual participant will be 12 weeks and the duration of the entire study
      will be one year.
