      effective recovery. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are limited by their poor tolerability
      and an alternative strategy is food fortification, the addition of
      protein/energy/micronutrients to frequently eaten food. The aim of this pilot study is to
      establish the feasibility and acceptability of delivering fortified foods to older people
      including those who have dementia and frailty whilst in hospital and to assess whether
      fortified foods could increase the energy and protein intake.

      This is a quasi-experimental study on acute medical wards for older inpatient in two UK
      hospitals, with a before and after comparison. The intervention involves the provision of
      additional between-meal fortified foods (enhanced with protein, energy, and micronutrients)
      and meal supplementation. Daily energy and protein intake will be assessed for three
      consecutive days during the baseline period and then in the intervention period. Likeability
      of fortified food and food choices (the number, type, and frequency of fortified foods
      consumed) will be examined. Likeability of fortified food by patients will be assessed using
      likeability scales. Interviews or focus groups will be conducted with staff to assess the
      acceptability of fortified food. Costs related to developing, packing and delivering the
      fortified foods will be calculated.

      The findings of this pilot study will identify whether delivering fortified food is feasible
      in acute elderly care wards, which foods are preferred and their acceptability. The results
      will inform the design of a definitive clinical trial.
