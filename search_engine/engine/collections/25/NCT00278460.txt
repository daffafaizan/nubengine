      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent stage IIIB and IV non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by docetaxel
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued for this study.
