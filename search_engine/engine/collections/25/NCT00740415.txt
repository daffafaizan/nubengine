      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of rituximab, bortezomib, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
           dexamethasone, and chlorambucil as first-line therapy in patients with stage II-IV
           mantle cell lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of complete and overall response, by F18
           fludeoxyglucose scan.

        -  Determine overall, disease-free, and event-free survival of these patients.

        -  Assess tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the impact of factors, described in previous protocols, on response to therapy
           and survival.

        -  Assess the impact of residual disease in cerebrospinal fluid on survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 (days 1 and 8 of the first course only); bortezomib IV
      on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-4;
      dexamethasone IV on days 1-4; and oral chlorambucil on days 20-29. Treatment repeats every 5
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve at least 50% response receive 2 additional courses of therapy.
