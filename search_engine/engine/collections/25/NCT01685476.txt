      activity (cochlear microphonic potential, CMP), with a non invasive method, during invasive
      ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship between ICP variations and CMP
      variations.

      Continuous ICP monitoring has an important place in neuro-intensive care. ICP may be measured
      either within the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or within the brain parenchyma.

      The purpose of this study is to assess prospectively the accuracy and the precision of a new
      method for indirect ICP monitoring (using electrophysiological cochlear activity) compared
      with an invasive gold standard ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship
      between ICP variations and CMP variations.

      Electrophysiological cochlear activities, so called electrocochleography (ECochG), are a non
      invasive and totally passive method used in routine in ENT department. The response measured
      in ECochG is the cochlear microphonic potential (CMP), generated by the outer hair cells
      following by presenting tone burst at 1kHz. CMP is recorded with the help of an EchodiaÂ®
      hand-held equipment.

      Technically, a simple, non-invasive detection of ICP changes and ICP monitoring can be
      afforded by CMP recordings.
