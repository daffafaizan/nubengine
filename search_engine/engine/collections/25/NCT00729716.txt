      and morbidity and lead to early onset osteoarthritis. A classical method of treatment has
      been microfracture where holes are drilled in the subchondral bone to allow influx of bone
      marrow cells which fill and repair the lesion. The resulting repair has been reported to be
      mixed fibrocartilage which is recognized to be less efficient and durable than hyaline
      cartilage, the physiological material making up the joint. In autologous chondrocyte
      implantation, a sample of cartilage is removed from a non-weight bearing region of the joint
      and the cells are grown and expanded in culture and then returned to the knee to repair the
      damaged cartilage. For implantation with BioCart™II, the chondrocytes are grown in the
      presence of proprietary growth factors which maintain the chondrocytes in optimal condition
      for subsequent repair. For implantation, the cells are seeded on a completely human three
      dimensional spongelike scaffold which holds the cells in the correct topology to allow for a
      rapid repair of the damaged joint with true physiological cartilage. BioCart™II is user
      friendly for the surgeon and patient alike giving it an advantage over other methods for
      autologous chondrocyte implantation that are in clinical use.
