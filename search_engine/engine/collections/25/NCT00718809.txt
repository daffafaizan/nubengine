      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in
      patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma treated with AZD0530.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AZD0530 in these patients. II. To evaluate the
      progression-free survival of these patients. III. To evaluate the overall survival of these
      patients. IV. To evaluate the disease control rate, defined as complete response, partial
      response, and stable disease, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral saracatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
