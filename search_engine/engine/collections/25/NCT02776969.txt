      papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This can be accomplished in several ways, including loss
      of heterozygosity studies as well as comparative gene expression analysis. When possible,
      linkage analysis on families with multiple individuals affected with PTC may also help
      identify the putative gene(s).

      Study participants will be asked to:

        1. Complete family history and medical history questionnaires

        2. Sign a medical record release so that thyroid cancer pathology reports can be obtained

        3. Supply a blood sample for genetic studies

        4. Provide study related information to family members who are needed for family studies
