      chewing performance level in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A cross-sectional study was
      conducted in 152 children (ages 2-10y, 51.3% male) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. The Gross
      Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine gross motor function
      levels of children. Chewing performance level was determined by using the Karaduman Chewing
      Performance Scale (KCPS).Children with a diagnosis of spastic CP aged 2 to 12 years who were
      referred due to chewing/swallowing problems by pediatric neurologists were included. The
      inclusion criteria were above the age of 24 months, and had complaints about chewing
      function. Children under the age of 24 months, requiring tube feeding or taking any oral
      nutritional supplements, and used any medicine and/or oral appliances that could affect the
      chewing performance, were excluded.
