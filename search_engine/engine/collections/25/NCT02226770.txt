      comorbidities such as heart focused anxiety and depression often occur. These psychological
      factors may have negative effects on compliance as well as on the development of the cardiac
      disease and therefore on rehospitalization and mortality rates.

      A personality structure where negative affect is paired with social inhibition (the inability
      to communicate ones feelings to others) can often be found in patients with cardiovascular
      disease. This so-called type D personality is also associated with a worse prognosis.

      It is of interest whether, and if so in what way, the implantation of an ICD can affect the
      psychological well-being and through that the prognosis of the heart failure patient.

      The goal of this study is therefore to investigate the effect of ICD implantation on
      heart-focused anxiety, depression, possible traumatization and quality of life in patients
      with heart failure with consideration of a possible moderating effect of the type D
      personality.

      Furthermore, the impact of the above stated psychological factors on rehospitalization and
      mortality, as well as on frequency of shocks shall be examined.

      Vice versa, the frequency of shocks or the impact of being shocked at all on psychological
      factors is of interest.
