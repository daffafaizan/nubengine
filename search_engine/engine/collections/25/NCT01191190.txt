    
      Patients who have relapsed/refractory CLL and require therapy as per iwCLL guidelines will be
      eligible. Subjects will receive a treatment with ofatumumab and HDMP for three consecutive 4
      week cycles. The primary endpoint is to determine the complete response (CR) to therapy and
      the secondary endpoints will assess the safety and tolerability of the regimen, the impact of
      the treatment on progression free, treatment free, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics of
      ofatumumab. Cycles 1-3 will be administered without scheduled interruption every 28 days for
      a total of 12 weeks of therapy. Patients will receive allopurinol for tumor-lysis prophylaxis
      and antimicrobial prophylaxis. Blood glucose levels will be monitored immediately after HDMP
      infusion by finger stick glucometry. Two months following completion of treatment a response
      assessment will occur per iwCLL guidelines. The treatment will be administered as outpatient,
      and each cycle will be four weeks in duration.
