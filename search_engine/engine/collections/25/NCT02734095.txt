      territory. Information such as vessel diameter, stent expansion, residual stenosis, helped in
      better understanding of the disease, treatment and stent behavior.

      However, as a different anatomical territory with major hemodynamic differences, many of
      these concepts could not be reproduced in the femoropopliteal segment.

      The purpose of this study is to correlate data collected by intraoperative intravascular
      ultrasound after the angioplasty procedure with stent placement in femoropopliteal arterial
      lesions and patency of this revascularization within 12 months.
