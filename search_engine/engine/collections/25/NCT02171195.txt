    
      Single centre, Phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate
      single rising oral doses of BIA 2-093 up to 1200 mg in sequential groups of eight healthy
      male adult subjects. Within each group of eight subjects two subjects were randomised to
      receive placebo and the remaining six subjects were randomised to receive BIA 2-093. No
      subject was a member of more than one treatment group. Doses of 20mg, 50mg, 100mg, 200mg,
      400mg, 600mg, 900mg and 1200mg were investigated in ascending order. Progression to each dose
      occurred only after the previous dose level was deemed to be safe and well tolerated by the
      investigator and the sponsor.
