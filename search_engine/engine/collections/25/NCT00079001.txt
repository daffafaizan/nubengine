      metastatic to bone and disease progression after primary hormonal therapy.

      This study is designed to evaluate whether earlier treatment with zoledronic acid will
      further decrease the risk of skeletal related events. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study followed by an open-label study. Patients are
      stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), prior skeletal-related event (no
      vs yes), and serum alkaline phosphatase (< upper limit of normal [ULN] vs â‰¥ ULN).

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment with zoledronic acid at
      the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer will
      delay the time to first skeletal related event. The secondary objective of the study is to
      compare the effect of treatment with zoledronic acid to placebo on overall survival (OS),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy
      for metastatic prostate cancer.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or a skeletal-related event. All patients receive concurrent androgen
      deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist. Patients also receive oral calcium and (vitamin D)
      supplements daily. Patients progressing to androgen-independent prostate cancer proceed to
      the open-label therapy with zoledronic acid IV. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or the first skeletal-related event.

      Patients are followed periodically for approximately 10 years after entry on the study.
