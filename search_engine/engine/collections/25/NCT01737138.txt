      increases with age. The major complications of CKD involve losing renal function and
      cardiovascular disease, which result in significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The main
      measures for treatment of CKD are optimizing drug therapy and renal replacement therapy.
      Optimizing drug therapy, including vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium
      antagonists, diuretic, beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, statins, platelet aggregation
      inhibitor, anticoagulants and so on. However, the situation for treatment of CKD is not
      satisfying. Sympathetic overactivity plays a key role in the development and progression of
      CKD. Sympathetic nerve activity was increased in patients with all stages of CKD, which was
      associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. At the same time, hypertension
      and proteinuria become the most important risk factor for progression of CKD. Recently, many
      clinical researches have verified that Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation can
      safely be used to substantially reduce muscle and whole-body sympathetic-nerve activity
      (MSNA) and whole-body norepinephrine spillover. Simultaneously, a marked reduction in blood
      pressure, sleep apnea severity and urine micro albumin level is apparent, with a improvement
      glucose tolerance. Sympathetic activation, high norepinephrine level, hypertension, glucose
      tolerance abnormity, proteinuria and obstructive sleep apnea are all recognized as
      independent risk factors for the development and progression of CKD. So, we design this
      randomized parallel control clinical study to demonstrate whether RSD can slow the
      progression of CKD and reduce the rate of all-cause mortality effectively and securely.
