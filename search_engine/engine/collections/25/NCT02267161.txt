      diagnosed by ultrasound screening. In half of these prenatal cases, the anomaly seems to be
      isolated. In this setting, there are no prospective data concerning the development of these
      children, preventing any clear information to be delivered to parents. Prenatal diagnostic
      centers therefore face extremely variable rates of termination of pregnancies (TOP), which
      can reach up to 80%.

      This is a multicentric prospective interventional study whose primary objective is to assess
      the neurological development at three years of age of children born after prenatal diagnosis
      of "isolated" agenesis of the corpus callosum.

      Evaluation at three years will include Intellectual Quotient (IQ) quantification using the
      WPPSI-III, 3rd edition of Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and evaluation
      of intra-hemispheric coordination using the Vineland adaptative behaviour scale.

      Secondary objectives will include:

        -  Circumstances leading to the prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum

        -  Causes leading to termination of pregnancies

        -  Determination of criteria allowing to confirm that agenesis of the corpus callosum is
           isolated (family history, imagery, genetics)

      These results could allow to determine the optimal prenatal management of such cases.
