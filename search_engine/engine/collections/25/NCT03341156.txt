      therapies during heart transplantation. The goal is to enroll 60 patients. Informed consent
      will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria before the
      initiation of any study specific procedures. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      either PCC or plasma transfusion. The efficacy of interventions will be evaluated after 30
      minutes of protamine administration. After the heart transplantation, thrombocytopenia and/or
      hypofibrinogenemia may worsen bleeding associated with vitamin K dependent factor
      deficiencies. Transfusion of platelets and/or cryoprecipitate is permitted if abnormal
      laboratory values are observed during the rewarming phase of CPB; platelet count <100 x
      103/Âµl, and fibrinogen <200 mg/dl, respectively. Laboratory tests (hematocrit, platelet
      count, PT, PTT, POC-PT, coagulation factor and inhibitor levels (e.g., factor II,
      antithrombin), thromboelastometry or thromboelastography, endogenous thrombin generation)
      will also be obtained at baseline, twice during surgery and at 12-24 hours after surgery.
