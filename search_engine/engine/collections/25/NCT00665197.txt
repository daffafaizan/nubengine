      to the randomly assigned treatment. Patient registration and randomization are centralized.
      There are two arms to the study, expecting an equal numbers of patients randomized to each
      arm. Stratification will by according to: (1) treating institution/country, and (2) baseline
      Stage (M1 = distant metastases versus M0 = no distant metastases). The primary statistical
      analysis will be conducted as an "intention-to-treat" clinical trial.

      A cost-effectiveness analysis is not required because the main contrast is between 5 and 10
      fractions of EBRT, where 5 fractions are less expensive than 10 fractions. This protocol
      follows the recommendations of CONSORT for the reporting of non-inferiority and equivalence
      trials. The active control is 30 Gy in 10 fractions, and the new therapy is 20 Gy in 5
      fractions.
