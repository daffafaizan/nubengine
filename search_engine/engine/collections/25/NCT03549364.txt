    
      Ten healthy subjects perform a baseline computer tomography (CT) of the heart and routine
      laboratory blood tests (troponin T, hs-CRP, CK-mb etc) for myocardial injury and
      inflammation.

      The same data are collected <24 hours after an endurance race corresponding to a maraton run
      (i.e. about 40 km of running and/or about 2.5 hours hard training or more). A third
      collection of lab tests and CT is done a couple of weeks after the race. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) is also performed in parallell to the CT on occasions 2 and 3 in most subjects,
      serving as a reference for determination of myocardial blood flow. The CT of the heart
      includes contrast injection and blood flow will be determined by a recently developed based
      on very powerful computers using "machine learning".
