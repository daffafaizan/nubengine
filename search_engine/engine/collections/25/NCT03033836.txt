    
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the retention in care of TGW
      treated with DTG-TDF-FTC.

      The primary objective will be assessed by the proportion of individuals that provide
      information on ART use and virological outcomes at the end of the study:

        -  Retention under care: Proportion of enrolled and dosed individuals that provide clinical
           information up to 48 weeks of follow up.

        -  Retention on treatment: Proportion of enrolled and dosed individuals that receive study
           drugs up to 48 weeks of follow up.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the antiretroviral regimen at week 48 ;

        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of this regimen;

        -  To evaluate adherence across 48 weeks;

        -  To determine the patient satisfaction with this regimen;

        -  To identify individual, social and contextual factors associated with adherence and
           retention.

      The secondary objectives will be evaluated using the following endpoints:

        1. Proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of
           treatment by the IIT-exposed snapshot FDA algorithm;

        2. Frequency, type and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities;

        3. Pill count, analogue visual scale for adherence in each visit;

        4. Changes in the scores of stigma and discrimination scales , quality of life, social
           support and anxiety and depression (BERGER, WBI,DUKE,CES-D,STAI) at bsl, 4,24, and 48
           weeks e;.Changes in the score scales of sexual behaviors, use of drug /alcohol at bsl
           and at each visit .

      f. Through association of baseline individual, social and contextual characteristics with
      percentage of adherence and retention at 48 weeks.
