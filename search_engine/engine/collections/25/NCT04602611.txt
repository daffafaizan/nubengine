    
      A randomized controlled prospective trial evaluating the effectiveness of a nurse navigation
      program for gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing oncological treatment. Upon accrual,
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive standard of care plus ONN service (n = 107) or
      standard of care only (without ONN service; n = 107). Patients in both arms will be assessed
      for acute care utilization and overall survival (OS) rate at 6 months. Anticipated accrual
      period will be 30 months.
