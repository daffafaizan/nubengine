    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 8-week, clinical trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of vilazodone and to evaluate genetic biomarkers
      of treatment response associated with vilazodone use in adult patients diagnosed with MDD by
      the DSM-IV-TR criteria. This study will enroll approximately 470 patients at approximately 10
      clinical sites. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at each visit. A DNA sample will be
      collected and analyzed for response to vilazodone.
