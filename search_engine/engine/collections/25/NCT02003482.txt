      undergo definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy have changes in their dose
      distribution that lead to significant changes in dose to tumor and/or normal tissue. It is
      possible for these dosimetric changes could occur in either those patients who undergo
      resection or not. In this study those patients who have undergone a resection will be
      stratified separately for analysis, however, this study is not powered to detect a difference
      between the two groups. The rational for stratification into an operated group of patients is
      that these patients will also lose weight in treatment and will provide us a detection of the
      magnitude of change in dose caused by weight loss independent of tumor shrinkage.
