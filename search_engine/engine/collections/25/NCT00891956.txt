      caregivers of individuals with Rett Syndrome (RS), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting
      primarily females. After an apparently normal prenatal and postnatal period of development,
      individuals with RS lose intellectual functioning, fine and gross motor skills including
      purposeful hand use, and communicative abilities. Individuals with RS also experience a host
      of other medical problems including seizures and respiratory dysfunction. Prior research
      demonstrates that caregivers of individuals with RS experience more stress than normative
      samples and that family functioning plays a role in maternal mental health. However, there is
      much that is not understood about how cognitive appraisals (thoughts that assess the
      circumstances), coping methods, and family functioning are related to caregiver adaptation in
      this population. This study is based on Thompson and colleagues Transactional Stress and
      Coping Model which conceptualizes family functioning and adaptation to being a caregiver of
      an individual with RS. A cross-sectional research design using quantitative methodology will
      explore the relationships between perceived illness burden, self-efficacy, coping methods,
      family functioning and adaptation. In addition, an open-ended section will be included to
      qualitatively describe the role of family relationships on the caregivers perception of their
      ability to care for their child with RS. Caregivers of individuals with RS will be recruited
      through an international RS organization, a national RS educational meeting, and several
      national RS clinics. Eligible participants will be able to complete a paper or online version
      of the survey.
