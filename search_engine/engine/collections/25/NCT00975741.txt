      multidose devices. Capsules to be administered through a monodose device that would offer an
      alternative to MF DPI multidose treatment in terms of cost-effectiveness were developed in
      Brazil. Results of laboratory analysis for respirable fraction, content uniformity of emitted
      dose and of the bulk powder and for percentage of particles < 1 micra of both MF 200 µg and
      MF 400 µg capsules have indicated their equivalent performance in comparison to MF DPI
      multidose.

      Aim: The aim of the present non-inferiority clinical study was to evaluate both devices in
      terms of efficacy and safety.

      Methods: Ninety-seven adult patients with moderate persistent asthma were randomized in two
      groups to receive for 60 days a dose of 400 µg of DPI MF once daily (at evening) using
      multidose or monodose device. Follow-up visits were scheduled at Days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56.
      Efficacy was assessed by means of pulmonary function tests (spirometry - FEV1 and PEFR) at
      each visit. In addition, subjects have recorded twice daily PEFR, symptom scores and use of
      rescue medication throughout the study. Response to therapy was also assessed. Safety
      evaluations included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests
      (plasma cortisol concentrations were assessed at enrollment and repeated after 60 days of MF
      treatment; cortrosyn test was performed at the enrollment and after 60 days of MF treatment),
      and physical examination.
