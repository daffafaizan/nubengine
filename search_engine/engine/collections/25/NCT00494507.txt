      bouts of paralysis, progressive weakness, and diminished quality of life. Two drugs,
      acetazolamide (ACZ) and dichlorphenamide, have been prescribed to treat the disorder,
      however, dichlorphenamide is no longer available.

      In this multi-center, parallel, randomized trial researchers will compare the effects of
      dichlorphenamide vs. placebo in patients with hyperkalemic (HYP) and hypokalemic (HOP)
      periodic paralysis.

      The trial consists of two 9-week studies-one study will enroll persons with hyperkalemic
      periodic paralysis and the other study will enroll persons with hypokalemic periodic
      paralysis. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:
      dichlorphenamide or placebo (an inactive substance). During the studies, participants will be
      asked to keep a daily diary to record the time, length, and severity of each episode of
      weakness (attack). The study coordinator will contact participants weekly to review the diary
      information.

      The 9-week phase will be followed by a 1-year open-label dichlorphenamide extension without
      placebo to determine the long-term effects of dichlorphenamide on the course of the disease
      and on inter-attack weakness.

      Duration of the trial for participants is approximately 65 weeks, including a screening phase
      to determine eligibility, the first 9-week treatment phase, and the one-year open-label
      extension phase.
