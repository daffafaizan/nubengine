      The risk is most dramatically increased in young patients with end-stage renal disease, who
      are almost as likely to die from cardiovascular causes as elderly individuals in the general
      population.

      Early morphological and functional vascular abnormalities can be detected even in adolescents
      with CKD, but information about the prevalence, severity and natural course of vascular
      lesions in different stages of renal failure is lacking and the factors predisposing to an
      early onset and rapid progression of cardiovascular morbidity are still elusive.

      The pediatric population appears uniquely suited to study the effects of CKD on the
      cardiovascular system due to the virtual absence of vascular morbidity related to ageing,
      diabetes and smoking.

      In order to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiovascular
      comorbidity in children with progressive CKD, a consortium of pediatric nephrologists in
      Europe has joined to perform a long-term prospective observational study following the
      cardiovascular health of children as they advance through successive stages of CKD.

      The 4C Study will follow up at least 625 patients aged 6 to 17 years with a glomerular
      filtration rate of 10 to 45 ml/min/1.73 mÂ² in more than 40 pediatric nephrology units in 14
      European countries.

      The morphology and function of the heart and the large arteries is regularly assessed by
      sensitive, non-invasive methods and the findings compared to a large group of healthy
      children.

      Multiple potential clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and pharmacological risk factors
      are monitored prospectively and will be related to the cardiovascular status of the patients.

      A whole genome association study will be performed to identify genetic variants associated
      with the progression of cardio-vascular alterations and renal failure.
