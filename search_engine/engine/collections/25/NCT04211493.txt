      effects which are comparable to conventional strength training. Therefore EMS could lower the
      barrier to physical activity. The present study focusses on acute psychological effects of an
      EMS workout - especially with regard to the reduction of depressive symptoms. Physical
      activity is notably important for patients with depression and shows multiple positive
      psychological and physical effects. But due to disease-related factors like lethargy,
      physical activity is far too rarely implemented. Therefore EMS-whole-body-workouts could
      provide an opportunity to generate positive psychological effects through a less (subjective)
      cost-intense strength training.
