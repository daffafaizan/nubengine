    
      NMDA receptor glycine site partial agonists (GFPAs) have been demonstrated to be efficacious
      in animal models and/or in early human studies of several Central Nervous System (CNS)
      diseases including neuropathic pain, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's
      disease, anxiety including posttraumatic stress syndrome, and cognition in Down's syndrome
      and autism and others, without the psychomimetic side effects of NMDA receptor channel
      blockers. GLYX-13 has demonstrated a wide therapeutic ratio (500:1) between efficacy and side
      effects in animals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
      of GLYX-13 following a single IV dose.
