    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design,
      dose-ranging study. Eligible patients with a DAI score of 6 to 10 (inclusive), plus
      endoscopic evidence of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis as assessed by flexible
      sigmoidoscopy, unless colonoscopy is clinically indicated, and rectal bleeding will be
      randomized to placebo or one of four doses of COLAL-PRED (equivalent to 40, 60, 80, or 120 mg
      of prednisolone). The effectiveness and safety of COLAL-PRED will be evaluated at baseline,
      and after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment. Additional follow-up measurements will take place
      7 days post cessation of treatment.

      The systemic absorption of COLAL-PRED will be determined by measuring blood levels of
      prednisolone, prednisolone sodium metasulfobenzoate (PMSBS) and metasulfobenzoate at Week 4.

      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis response will be monitored by measuring
      morning serum cortisol levels at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, and at follow-up visit and
      cortisol levels following adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation testing at Baseline
      and Week 4.
