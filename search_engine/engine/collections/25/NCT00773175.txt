      multi-national, study of SC versus IV fluid rehydration in mildly to moderately dehydrated
      pediatric patients treated in the Emergency Department (ED), inpatient pediatric unit, and/or
      outpatient urgent care facility. It is expected that up to 186 patients, in order to achieve
      148 evaluable patients, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive isotonic fluid
      rehydration by either SC administration with hylenex (150 Units) or IV without hylenex.
