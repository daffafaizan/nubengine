      primary THA surgery in patients having received one of five Biomet implant types; a MOP
      primary THA, an M2a 38, M2a Taper, M2a Ringloc and M2a Magnum MOM primary THA device in
      308-436 total patients at four centers.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of soft tissue changes in
      unbiased MoM and MoP samples. Secondary objectives are to evaluate whether the occurrence of
      soft tissue changes is related to any of several potential covariates including patient and
      implant characteristics and time in situ.
