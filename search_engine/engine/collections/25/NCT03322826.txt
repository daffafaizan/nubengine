      ground-glass opacity (GGO). In 2011, pulmonary adenocarcinomas were classified into atypical
      adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive carcinoma
      (MIA) and more extensively invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) [1]. Early adenocarcinomas with
      GGO-dominant always mean low-grade malignancy and have an extremely favorable prognosis
      [2-5]. Previous studies have shown that patients with AAH, AIS and MIA have excellent
      survival rates (5-year survival rate is approximate 95%) after resection, and only 0.83% -
      2.91% patients have lymph node metastasis [6-9]. At present, lymphadenectomy is always
      undergone in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with ground-glass opacity. However, for
      MIA patients (especially in T1a-b stage), the appropriate use of lymphadenectomy continues to
      be debated.

      Nowadays, intraoperative frozen pathology is widely used during operation. However, whether
      sampling of lymph nodes or lymphadenectomy should be performed for GGO lesions according to
      intraoperative pathological diagnosis is unclear. The aim of this prospective study is to
      evaluate whether there are any trends regarding the impact of subtypes of invasive
      adenocarcinoma according to intraoperative frozen pathology in sampling of lymph nodes vs.
      lymphadenectomy.
