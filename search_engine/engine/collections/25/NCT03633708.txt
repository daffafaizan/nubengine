      CKD, worsens with declining kidney function, and is associated with serious complications in
      children on dialysis. Children on dialysis experience a wide spectrum of bone abnormalities
      and growth retardation, in addition to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality that manifests early in their adulthood. Traditional therapies for SHPT (eg,
      vitamin D sterols) are widely used in the pediatric dialysis population, and have the
      potential to aggravate complications of the disease by increasing serum calcium (Ca), serum
      phosphorus, and serum Ca times serum phosphorus product.

      Etelcalcetide has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating adult CKD patients with
      SHPT by simultaneously controlling intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), Ca, and phosphorus and
      has recently been approved for use in adult patients with SHPT treated with hemodialysis in
      both the United States and Europe. Although no previous studies have been conducted in
      pediatric patients with etelcalcetide (one single dose pharmacokinetic [PK] study is
      currently ongoing), Amgen anticipates minimal to moderate risk with a possibility of direct
      benefit to the pediatric subject in this study. The burden of complications of SHPT in the
      pediatric dialysis population and the limitations of current standard therapy, underscore the
      need for studies of etelcalcetide in these patients to address this unmet medical need and
      inform the pediatric nephrology community of the potential use of etelcalcetide in children
      on hemodialysis with critical safety and efficacy data.
