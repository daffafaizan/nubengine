      (subclinical nodules were found in half of woman beyond 60 years). The main risk factors
      include age, female gender, parity, smoking and family history of thyroid nodules or
      thyroiditis. The assessment is based on biology, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration and
      intends to determine the benign nature (95%) or cancer (5%) of the nodules and if they are
      functional or not (toxic nodule). Most benign nodules are asymptomatic but some of them
      because of their size and location can cause a functional disorder (compression or swallowing
      disorder) or aesthetic and psychological resounding.In current practice, these nodules are
      sometimes treated with surgery that impact on patient quality of life (need to take
      L-Thyroxine, difficulties related to the possible occurrence of complications like
      hypoparathyroidism or laryngeal paralysis) and socio-economic constraints especially when
      complications occur. To limit the number of unnecessary and potentially risky surgeries,
      patients should therefore be well selected. If surgery is the preferred treatment of thyroid
      cancer, alternative techniques like radiofrequency seem interesting for benign nodules.
