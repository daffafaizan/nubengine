      been effective in decreasing relapse and improving outcomes for bipolar disorders. However,
      samples were often small, compromising statistical power, and with a large variety of
      patients. The investigators therefore tested if a CBT group psychoeducation program + MBCT
      decreased relapses and improved outcomes in a large sample of refractory bipolar I patients
      on mood stabilizers. Patients were tested at recruitment, at 6-month follow-up CBT and at
      2-month follow-up MBCT using clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. The primary
      outcome measure of efficacy was relapse during the follow-up requiring either
      hospitalization, modification of treatment or HDRS ≥ 16 or MRS ≥ 6. The secondary outcome
      measure was symptomatic and functional improvement.
