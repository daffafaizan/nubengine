      in the study. They will be divided into two groups. One group will be treated with Entecavir
      while another treated with Entecavir and Anluohuaxian Pill. Liver biopsy samples and blood
      samples from the patients will be used to validate the non-invasive model. Furthermore, the
      samples will be used to evaluate if Anluohuaxian Pill could reverse liver fibrosis and
      cirrhosis.
