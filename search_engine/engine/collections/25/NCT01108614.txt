      infections among IDUs in China has become stabilized and slowed down, the new HIV infection
      is still on the rise, especially in the Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Xinjiang and Sichuan. This
      study attempts to further reduce the new infection among MMT clients, and particularly to
      prevent the transmission from HIV infected clients to their sexual partners with
      comprehensive intervention.

      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of comprehensive interventions to decrease the HIV/STIs
           incidence among MMT clients.

        2. To prevent the sexual transmission between those HIV+ clients and their spouse/partners
           with intensified intervention.
