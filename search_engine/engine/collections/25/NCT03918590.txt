    
      This is a single masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study that will enroll approximately
      60 subjects with recent active retina related disease requiring intravitreal agents. Subjects
      will be randomized into one of 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, and assigned to receive nepafenac
      0.3% suspension or a sham procedure. Subjects will have a one in three (33%) chance of
      receiving active treatment (no sham procedure), a one in three (33%) chance of receiving
      patching procedure (no active treatment) or a one in three (33%) chance of receiving placebo
      (no active treatment).

      Study participants will then complete the Visual Analog Scale immediately following injection
      and then after 1 hour, and, 24 hours. The VAS data along with relevant data related to each
      subject's injection will also be compiled, including, but not limited to: drug injected,
      diagnosis, co-morbid conditions, history of previous injections, visual acuity, age, and
      gender.
