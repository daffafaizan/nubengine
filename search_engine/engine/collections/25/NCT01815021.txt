    
      Eligible subjects will be treated as follows:

      Phase I Ten (10) subjects previously diagnosed and chronically treated for primary
      hypoparathyroidism will be enrolled. The daily CCS intake will be gradually replaced by
      reduced amount of elemental calcium from ACC. Five (5) subjects will consume the ACC before
      having a meal and the other five (5) subjects will consume the ACC after having a meal. The
      safety and the efficacy of the treatment will be closely monitored throughout this phase.

      The absorption of ACC will be evaluated using weekly serum calcium corrected for albumin (CA)
      value tests. Excretion of calcium in urine will be tested at screening and at the end of
      phase I.

      I-Day -21 (+/-17) Screening: Subjects with a diagnosed primary hypoparathyroidism (see
      section 4.1 for definitions), and who are treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation
      at least 1 year prior to the beginning of the study and are without major renal or hepatic
      disease, will be invited to the Clinical Research Center. At the clinic, subjects will be
      interviewed, their medical history and their current medication will be documented and they
      will sign an informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will be referred to perform blood tests
      for serum calcium, P, creatinine and albumin levels. Calculation of albumin corrected calcium
      (CA) will be performed. Subjects will be instructed to perform 24 hour urine collection for
      Ca, P and creatinine. Subjects will be asked to fill out a food and medication diary for 3
      consecutive days to evaluate their daily dietary calcium intake. Women of childbearing age
      will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Eligible subjects, complying with all inclusion criteria
      and having none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.

      Subjects will be informed by phone or on site whether they are eligible to enter the study.

      I-Day 0: Eligible subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center where they will be
      asked about any changes in their medical condition since their last visit. Blood tests will
      be performed to define serum calcium, P and albumin baseline values. Calculation CA at
      baseline will be performed.

      Subjects will receive a pack of ACC tablets, each tablet containing 50, 100 or 200 mg
      elemental calcium (according to the daily total amount of calcium supplementation, 14 day
      supply + 5 spare tablets). The replacement of CCS with ACC will be calculated according to
      the following formula:

      NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.05×ITDC (mg ACC)]

      *ITDC - Initial total daily calcium intake (mg)

      **NTDC - New total daily calcium intake (mg)

      10% (in mg) out of the initial total daily intake of elemental calcium will be replaced by 5%
      of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake). The
      daily intake of vitamin D will remain the same.

      The calculation for the number of tablets per day will be performed specifically for each
      subject (according to the daily dosage of calcium supplementation) by the doctor.

      Subjects will be instructed to take XXX ACC tablets a day, according to their individual
      calculated NTDC:

        1. Five subjects will be instructed to take XXX tablets in the morning after a meal, XXX in
           midday after a meal and XXX in the evening after a meal.

        2. Five subjects will be instructed to take XXX tablets in the morning before having a
           meal, XXX in midday before having a meal and XXX in the evening before having a meal.

      Subjects will be instructed to continue their routine medications consumption during the
      trial.

      I-Day 3 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium, P
      and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude
      hypocalcaemia (Ca<7.0 mg/dL). If CA values are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0
      mg/dl), subjects will continue to take the calcium doses that were instructed on I-day 0. If
      CA values are below 7.0 mg/dl or above 10.0 mg/dl, changes to the calcium intake will be
      made, according to the doctor's decision.

      I-Day 7 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium, P
      and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed:

        1. Conversion factor 0.5:

           If CA = baseline, then 20% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 10% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).

           NTDC = ITDC - [0.2×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.1×ITDC (mg ACC)]

        2. Conversion factor 0.75:

           If CA < baseline, then 10% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 7.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).

           NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.075×ITDC (mg ACC)] CA <7.00 mg/dl will enforce
           end of treatment.

        3. Conversion factor 0.25:

      If CA > baseline, then 10% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of
      elemental calcium will be replaced by 2.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated
      out of the initial total daily intake).

      NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.025×ITDC (mg ACC)] Subjects will be asked about any
      side effects or AEs that may have occurred and changes in concomitant medications since their
      last visit. Subjects will be asked about symptoms and signs related with a change in serum
      calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches, arrhythmia,
      depression). Subjects will receive instructions regarding the new doses of ACC and will be
      reminded to take XXX tablets a day (according to their individual calculated NTDC), XXX in
      the morning, XXX in midday and XXX in the evening, before or after a meal (based on their
      initial assignment). Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications
      consumption during the trial.

      I-Day 10 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude
      hypocalcaemia (Ca<7.0 mg/dL). If CA levels are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0
      mg/dl), subjects will continue to take the calcium doses that were instructed on I-day 7. If
      CA levels are below 7.0 mg/dl or above 10.0 mg/dl, changes to the calcium intake will be
      made, according to the doctor's decision.

      I-Day 14 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude
      hypocalcaemia (Ca<7.0 mg/dL). If none of the conversion formulas (a-c, I-Day 7) resulted in
      serum calcium values within the desired target range (7.0-10.0 mg/dL), the study will be
      terminated.

      Subjects will be asked about any side effects or AEs that may have occurred and changes in
      concomitant medications since their last visit. Subjects will be asked about symptoms and
      signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing, paresthesias,
      muscle aches, arrhythmia, depression).

      50% of the initial daily supplementation of CCS will be replaced by ACC based on the
      conversion factor found in I-day 7 (formulas a-c):

        1. Conversion factor 0.5: 50% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 25% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).

        3. Conversion factor 0.25: 50% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 12.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).

      NTDC = ITDC - [0.5×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.125×ITDC (mg ACC)] Subjects will receive a pack of ACC
      tablets, each tablet containing 50, 100 or 200 mg elemental calcium (according to their
      individual calculated NTDC, 14 day supply + 5 spare tablets). Subjects will receive
      instructions regarding the new doses of ACC and will be reminded to take XXX capsules a day,
      XXX in the morning, XXX in midday and XXX in the evening, before or after a meal (based on

      asked about symptoms and signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial
      grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches, arrhythmia, depression). If CA levels are below 7.0
      mg/dl, or above 10.0 mg/dl, subject will be excluded from the study (based on the doctor's
      decision). If CA levels are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0 mg/dL), a complete
      replacement of the daily supplementation of CCS with ACC will be performed, based on the
      conversion factor found in I-day 7 (formulas a-c):

        1. Conversion factor 0.5: 100% (in mg) of the elemental calcium initial total daily intake
