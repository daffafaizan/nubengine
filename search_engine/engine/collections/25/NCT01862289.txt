      like Nijmegen, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HAD), Short-Form 36(SF36), and Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The participants will have baseline spirometry and
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide measured at expiratory flow of 50 mL/s (FENO50), blood gases
      at rest, an hyperventilation challenge and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing(CPET) to
      determine accurately the presence or not of chronic hyperventilation syndrome. The diagnosis
      is confirmed by two positive tests (Nijmegen, Hyperventilation challenge and blood gases) and
      the final decision of a medical committee. The first step is to determine the prevalence oh
      this syndrome in this specific population. The second step is to assess the sensitivity, the
      specificity, the false positive rate and the false negative rate of the different parameters
      measured during the tests.
