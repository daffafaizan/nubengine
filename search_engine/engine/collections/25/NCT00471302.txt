      The development of a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum is regarded as a crucial step
      toward control of this disease. Unfortunately, vaccine candidates have resulted in
      short-lived protection at best. The ineffectiveness of current vaccines may reflect the
      kinetics of naturally acquired immunity to malaria in that multiple infections are required
      over years before partial protection is achieved and then immunity is lost, or becomes less
      effective, in the absence of recurrent infection. The mechanisms underlying the delayed
      acquisition and presumably rapid loss of humoral immunity are poorly understood. A more
      detailed understanding of these processes at the cellular level may be important for vaccine
      development. We are currently studying the cellular basis of humoral immunity to P.
      falciparum through research collaboration between the Malaria Research and Training Center
      (MRTC) in Bamako, Mali and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. This
      protocol supports that research by ensuring a supply of blood samples from healthy Malian
      adults in order to establish normal immunologic parameters for this population and to
      optimize research assays performed at the MRTC.
