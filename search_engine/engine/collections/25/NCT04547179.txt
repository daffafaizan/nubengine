      (BLAfit速) in the prevention of migraines for those who suffer from roughly 10-15 migraines
      per month. In order to test the efficacy of this device and its exercise routine,
      investigators will have one arm of our study receive the BLAfit速 device and perform the
      exercises for one minute daily for three months. In Arm #2, there will be another treatment:
      Ajovy速 (fremanezumab-vfrm) injections- which is a known and commonly practiced clinical
      prevention treatment for migraine patients. Patients in this arm will receive three
      injections of Ajovy, which is will be meant to last 3 months. In addition, investigators will
      have a placebo group that will receive three saline injections, which are meant to mimic the
      three Ajovy速 injections. Arms #2 and #3 of this study will be conducted in a double-blind
      fashion, as both the clinician providing the injections and the patients receiving the
      injections will not know if the injecting substance is Ajovy or saline, so as to minimize
      bias. All patients in all three months will log their number and pain level of their
      migraines each day for three months. Upon conclusion, they will meet with our in-house
      neurologist (Principal Investigator & Sponsor) for a final in-person evaluation and
      questionnaire. Results from the three groups will then be analyzed.
