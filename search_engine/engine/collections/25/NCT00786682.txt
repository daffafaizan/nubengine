      Primary

        -  To assess the antitumor activity, in terms of tumor response rate, of docetaxel in
           combination with hydroxychloroquine in patients with metastatic, hormone-refractory,
           chemotherapy-naive prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To measure time to disease progression and overall survival.

        -  To determine the feasibility and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily on days 1-21 and docetaxel IV over 1
      hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days (up to 6 courses with docetaxel) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
