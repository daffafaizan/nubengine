      Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is widely used in the secondary prevention of coronary artery
      disease. There is controversy regarding the prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with
      coronary artery disease and the effect of dose on resistance. Our primary aims were to
      determine the degree of platelet responsiveness to aspirin, and to study the influence of
      dose on platelet inhibition and clinical outcomes after coronary stenting.
