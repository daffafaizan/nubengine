      hallucination and sleep disorders. The progression of dementia can threaten the relationship
      between the person with dementia (PWD) and their relatives. One reason is the possible loss
      of reciprocity and a mutual supportive relationship. This may influence the quality of life
      in both the PWD and their relatives and increase the caregiver-burden. The music therapy in
      this intervention is focusing on increasing positive emotions, increasing reciprocity and
      stimulating communication.

      The 1st, 5th and 10th music therapy-session is video-recorded. The first 5 recorded minutes
      before the sessions will provide a baseline of the observed primary outcomes throughout the
      session. Videos are analyzed to examine changes in social communication behavior and
      emotional well-being. Time-series analysis of the observations will be conducted, enabling us
      to evaluate potential effects of the therapeutic interventions and to find out when, why and
      to what extent changes unfold in real time. The pre-post measures are secondary. The project
      is a merging and further development of two recent music therapy designs. (Articles cited in
