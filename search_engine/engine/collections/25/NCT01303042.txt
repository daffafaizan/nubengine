      investigators will change insulin therapy according to the insulin regimen below and continue
      the therapy for six months.

      Patients will terminate from sulfonylurea treatment at the change of insulin therapy. The
      investigators will not change other oral hypoglycemic agents during the whole study period.

      Regimen: Divide the total units of all insulin per day by three and equally apply the amount
      to mealtime injections of insulin lispro mix 50/50 t.i.d. When the unit is indivisible and
      the remainder is one unit, add it to the mealtime injection of breakfast. When the remainder
      is two units, add each unit to mealtime injections of breakfast and dinner.

      Patients will terminate from the trial when their HbA1c increases by 1% and stays at the
      level for more than three months after the change of insulin regimen.

      When there is a risk of hypoglycemia at the change of insulin regimen, the investigators will
      divide ninety percent of the total insulin units per day by three and equally apply the
      amount to mealtime injections of insulin lispro 50/50. When considered to be safe, the
      investigators will increase the insulin unit per day to the total insulin unit at the
      previous treatment within two months.
