      the research study:

      A two-stage design will be employed in this study where at least 9 of the 20 patients
      enrolled in the first stage need to be progression-free at 16 weeks before the second stage
      can proceed. If this criterion is met, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled in the
      second stage for a total of 44 patients in the study. Patients will be treated with
      cabozantinib 60 mg daily administered orally continuously for 28-day cycles. Tumor
      assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until documented disease progression by RECIST
      criteria or drug intolerance.

      In this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each
      treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the
      participant will be taking the study drug, cabozantinib daily. The diary will also include
      special instructions for taking the study drug(s).

      The participant will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as it is tolerated without any
      unacceptable side effects and the cancer does not get worse.

      The following tests and procedures will be done during the research study:

      Cycle 1 - On days 1, 8 and 15

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs and height and weight

        -  Performance Status

        -  Review of side effects (day 8 and 15 only)

        -  Routine blood tests (day 8 and 15 only)

        -  TSH blood sample on day 1 only

      Additional research procedures during Cycle 1:

      - Biomarker blood sample (about 2 teaspoons of blood) on day 3 and day 14

      Cycles 2-3 - On days 1 and 15

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs, height and weight

        -  TSH blood sample on day 1 only

        -  Urine test

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

      The following tests will be done every 2 cycles during the research study:

        -  CA 19-9 blood sample

        -  Tumor measurements

        -  Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic CT/MRI of your tumor

      Planned Follow-up:

      The participant will return to the clinic between 30-37 days after the last dose of
      cabozantinib for the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical Exam including vital signs, height and weight

        -  Performance Status

        -  Review of side effects
