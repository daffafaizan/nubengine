      rate. However, implantation procedure requires sufficient bone support both vertically and
      horizontally, and sometimes there is bone defect that requires bone augmentation prior to
      dental implant insertion.

      There are some bone augmentation techniques known and used for this purposes, including:
      guided bone regeneration (GBR), distraction osteogenesis, split osteotomy, onlay bone graft,
      and interpositional bone graft.

      One of the techniques is the interpositional bone graft using "sandwich osteotomy" technique,
      in which a cut is made in the bone (one horizontal and two vertical) separating a mobile bone
      portion which is fixed (using bone plate) in its new "ideal" position. The gap between the
      moved bone and the remaining bone is filled with xenograft ("bio-oss"). There is no
      documentation in the literature about histological evaluation of the bone after this well
      known clinical procedure. Four months after the bone augmentation procedure - the fixating
      plate is moved out and dental implants inserted. The first bur of the implantation (the
      smallest in the diameter) will be a trephine from which a histologic slide will be taken for
      check. The continuous dental implants insertion is the normal protocol for dental
      implantation (widening the recipient hole with bur, and insertion of the implant), followed
      by rehabilitation by prosthodontics.
