      endocrine cells from any parts of body. Due to its occult onset and heterogeneity, it is hard
      to be detected by conventional imaging like CT and it is often at late stage when diagnosed.
      New imaging modality such as 18F-FDG PET/CT have been well-accepted as a practical way to
      evaluate the aggressive of tumor. 18F-FDG PET/CT has been used to improve the efficacy in
      assessing the extent and severity of NET, but the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT
      decreased in low proliferation tumor cells and inflammation. Recent studies showed
      somatostatin receptor (SSTR) was expressed in NET cells and SSTR-targeting molecular
      imaging-68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT could be a promising technique to evaluate the extent of NET
      with higher accuracy. Especially in some well differentiated tumor, 18F-FDG PET/CT can be
      negative, while 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT can be positive. However, the results can be varied in
      these two imaging modalities and characterized this disease at multiple levels such as
      clinical presentation, biologic characteristics, treatment response, and clinical
      outcome.This prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT may be
      superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognostic evaluation of
      NET.
