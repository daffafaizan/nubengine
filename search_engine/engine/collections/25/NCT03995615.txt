      leads to a host response resulting in inflammatory breakdown of tooth supporting, osseous and
      soft tissue structures YKL-40 also called as human cartilage glycoprotein-39(HC-gp39), an
      acute phase protein is a novel potential bio marker in relation to both acute and chronic
      inflammations. YKL-40 is a member of "mammalian chitinase- like protein" but has no
      chitinase/ enzymatic activity, with molecular weight of approximately 40KDa. It is named from
      three amino acids of Tyrosine (Y), Lysine (K) and leucin (L) at the N-terminal YKL-40 was
      identified in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum among gingivitis and periodontitis
      individual with or without diabetic mellitus. Investigation was done in association between
      chronic periodontitis and diabetic mellitus in gingival crevicular fluid sample. However, the
      past studies have reported an increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in patient with
      periodontal diseases. They have reported the presence of rheumatoid factor in gingiva, sub
      gingival plaque, saliva and serum of periodontally diseased patient. Treatment of periodontal
      disease has demonstrated significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) which
      in turn have showed improvement of clinical indices on rheumatoid arthritis activity.we
      speculate that presence of YKL 40 an acute phase protein in both chronic periodontitis and
      rheumatoid arthritis. However, till date no studies has been done on the levels of gingival
      crevicular fluid YKL-40 following scaling and root planing, the present study which is first
      of its kind is designed to detect and estimate the gingival crevicular fluid YKL-40 levels in
      healthy patients, chronic periodontitis and patient with chronic periodontitis having
      rheumatoid arthritis at baseline and chronic periodontitis having rheumatoid arthritis 6
      weeks post periodontal therapy (scaling and root planning [SRP]). This could throw more light
      on it and extend our knowledge on its role in both the condition
