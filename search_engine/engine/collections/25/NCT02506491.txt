      falling and contributing to disability. Pilates-based exercise is proposed as a combined core
      and mental training program grounded on learning functionally effective postural sets and
      motor patterns, that will provide better results than a muscular exercise program in old
      women trunk strength, the risk of falling, functional autonomy and other complementary
      physical and mental functions. This is a 30-weeks quasi-experimental randomized controlled
      trial in which 80 independent old women will be allocated to a Pilates-based exercise
      program, a muscular exercise program, and a no-exercise control group. The intervention is
      divided into 18 weeks of supervised exercise and a 12 weeks follow-up. Primary outcome will
      be isokinetic and isometric trunk and hip flexion-extension strength, static and dynamic
      balance, the number of falls, and functional autonomy. Secondary outcome will include body
      composition, habitual physical activity and a standardized gerontological evaluation composed
      of body composition, daily physical activity, the independence to develop basic and
      instrumental activities of daily living, and the cognitive, affective and social function
      assessment. Every item will be measured at baseline, 18 and 30 weeks.
