      is very debilitating and contributes to increased institutionalization, reduced cognitive
      function, and accelerated disease progression. Furthermore, sleep disruption is linked to
      poor health outcomes in caregivers (CGs), such as poor quality of life and increased CG
      burden. Given the potential harmful side effects of pharmacologic treatment,
      non-pharmacologic approaches, such as music, may provide a safer alternative to reducing
      sleep disruption in this vulnerable population. Listening to music has been shown to decrease
      agitation, anxiety and depression in nursing home residents with ADRD. A growing body of
      literature suggests that individualized music may improve sleep quality in older adults with
      early memory loss, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated in older adults with ADRD in
      the community, where most older adults with ADRD live. If proven feasible and acceptable,
      tailored music interventions can then be tested for efficacy in reducing sleep disruption.

      Music selections will be individualized to older adults with ADRD and account for known
      sleep-inducing properties. Feasibility of processes that are key to the success of the
      subsequent study will be examined. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be assessed
      using objective (actigraphy) and subjective (proxy reported) sleep quality measures. In
      addition, qualitative data will be solicited from the dyads examining the acceptability and
      satisfaction with the intervention.
