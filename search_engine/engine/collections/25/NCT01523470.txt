      steroid, antibiotics according to our local bacteriology. Acute NIV was initiated by trained
      respiratory nurses according to standardised protocols. The nurses would be at the bedside
      during the initial acclimatization. BIPAP vision was used to provide bi-level pressure
      support ventilation. Interfacing with different types of nasal or full-mask would be
      individualised. NIV was used for as many as possible in the first day, at least 20 hrs.
      Throughout the NIV treatment, the following parameters will be monitored when NIV is started:
      arterial blood gases, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure, mental state, pulse
      oximetry. If a patient failed to respond to NIV, he or she would be intubated if appropriate.
      Criteria for failure include lack of clinical improvement with increasing dyspnea and
      deterioration of blood gases, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled ventricular arrythmia,
      development of hypercapnic coma and cardiopulmonary arrest.

      A patient would be considered suitable to withdraw from the ventilator if he or she fulfil
      the criteria at rest.
