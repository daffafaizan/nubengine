    
      This substudy is performed within the SERVE-HF Study, a randomised,
      multi-centre,international trial with parallel group design, with patients randomised to
      either control (optimal medical management) or active treatment (optimal medical treatment
      plus use of adaptive servoventilation) in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization will be the same as
      in the parent study. For this purpose, the randomization of the parent study will be
      stratified as to whether a patient is included in the substudy or not. 300 patients will be
      recruited for the substudy overall.

      For the purpose of this substudy, patients will be followed up for a period of 12 months.

      The following extra tests will be performed at the baseline visit, the 3 months follow up and
      the 12 months follow up:

        -  Echocardiogram (for both groups)

        -  cMRI (for both groups)

        -  PSG (at the baseline visit only for patients in the treatment group and at 3 months
           follow up and the 12 months follow up for all patients)

        -  4 questionnaires (for both groups)

        -  Additional blood testing (for both groups)
