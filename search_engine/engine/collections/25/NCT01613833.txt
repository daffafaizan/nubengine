      Pre-procedure diagnosis: Based on chart review and consultation with operating surgeon of
      subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty, patients will be grouped into primary or
      secondary (PTOA) osteoarthritis groups. Primary osteoarthritis will be identified through a
      clinical presentation of generalized osteoarthritis with possible bilateral involvement and
      no identifiable trauma or overuse to knee joint. Secondary osteoarthritis will be identified
      by history of overuse or trauma to the afflicted knee and a clinical presentation that in
      general lacks symmetrical involvement and/or severity, PTOA.

      On the date of surgery, both primary and secondary groups will have 2 cc whole blood
      collected via venipuncture during placement of intravenous access for anesthesia. No
      additional venipuncture is necessary and this study necessitates no
      instrumentation/manipulation of patient beyond that of IV access normally obtained
      preoperatively. Blood will then be placed in refrigerated storage (2-6 C) until analyzed for
      A2M assay.

      On the date of surgery, joint aspirate from both primary and secondary groups will be
      collected by the operating surgeon during knee arthroplasty. At the time of arthrotomy, joint
      fluid that is expressed from surgical site will be harvested and placed into an eppendorf
      tube and placed on ice. The study incurs no further risk to the patient and no further
      instrumentation/manipulation for synovial fluid harvest that is beyond the risk or
      instrumentation/manipulation of the indicated surgical procedure. Joint aspirates will then
      be stored until A2M assay.
