      the dose of interferon and also the use of mitoxantrone, allowing to further reduce the
      conversion rate MS.

      Because mitoxantrone decreases the rate of relapses 2 times more than interferon beta, a (at
      least) 2 times higher benefit on the disease activity is expected with interferon
      mitoxantrone combination than with interferon alone.
