        -  Determine expression levels of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), thioredoxin-interacting protein
           (TXNIP), and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in paraffin-embedded resected
           tumor tissue samples from patients with stage II or III rectal cancer enrolled in
           clinical trial SWOG-9304.

        -  Determine if there is a correlation between Trx-1 and TXNIP expression and HIF-1α
           expression.

        -  Correlate expression of these proteins with tumor stage, disease-free survival, overall
           survival, and risk of recurrence.

        -  Determine interactions for patient age, performance status, and type of therapy received
           on clinical trial SWOG-9304.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Paraffin-embedded resected tumor tissue samples are analyzed for protein expression levels
      (thioredoxin-1, thioredoxin-interacting protein, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha) by
      tissue microarray and immunostaining.
