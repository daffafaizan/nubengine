      acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 will reduce the rate of pooled arteriosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease outcomes (i.e., pooled occurrence of non-fatal and fatal
      arteriosclerotic outcomes, including coronary heart, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular
      disease events) relative to treatment with an identical multivitamin containing no folic
      acid, and Estimated Average Requirement amounts of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, among chronic,
      stable renal transplant recipients
