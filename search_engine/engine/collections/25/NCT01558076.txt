      studies have examined the influence of having SCA on such measures of physical function as
      exercise capacity. Moreover, the physiologic basis of poor physical functioning in children
      with SCA is unknown and has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this proposal is to
      use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to gain a comprehensive understanding of
      longitudinal changes in exercise capacity, and the effect of poor exercise capacity on
      quality of life in children and young adults with SCA. The specific aims of this project are
      to: 1) Measure peak oxygen consumption (VO2), the reference standard for exercise capacity,
      in children and young adults with SCA classified by primary pathophysiologic contributor to
      their decreased exercise capacity, and 2) compare results of this exercise test with the
      results of previously completed exercise tests to determine longitudinal changes in exercise
      capacity. These aims will be performed in 60 subjects with SCA and 30 matched controls who
      participated in a previous study, IRB# 2009-13659; "The Physiologic Assessment of Exercise
      Capacity in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia". In a secondary analysis, we will also study the
      participants quality of life using a set of validated questionnaires. This study is essential
      because it will address several areas of exercise capacity, including the longterm effects of
      physiologic contributors to exercise limitation, that remain fundamental knowledge gaps in
      SCA.
