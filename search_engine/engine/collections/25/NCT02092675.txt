    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in
      developed countries. Acute exacerbations and cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of
      morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. According to the frequency of exacerbations,
      phenotype "frequent exacerbator" is defined and characterised with severe clinical course and
      was recognised as an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies considered
      that systemic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COPD and endothelial
      dysfunction is a suspected link between increased cardiovascular mortality and systemic
      inflammation in COPD patients. Endothelial dysfunction is assessed by determining flow
      mediated dilatation index (FMD index) or plasma markers. Previous studies have suggested the
      presence of endothelial dysfunction in COPD patients, as well as the deterioration of
      endothelial function during exacerbations of COPD. This study will, for the first time,
      systematically explore endothelial dysfunction in two phenotypically distinct groups of COPD
      patients with simultaneous assessment of endothelial function flow mediated dilatation index
      (FMD index) and plasma markers.
