      adults 18 years and older across 14 rural health facilities in Swaziland's Hhohho Region. The
      main trial registration is accessible at:
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02909218.

      This registration is specific to the economic evaluation of the MaxART study which aims to
      quantify the causal impacts of early ART initiation (compared to national standard care) on a
      range of key economic outcomes, including healthcare expenditures, productivity, and
      household wealth.
