      patients diagnosed with thumb CMC OA. Patients presenting to the upper extremity orthopedic
      surgery clinic for thumb/hand/wrist pain will be diagnosed by a Board Certified Hand Surgeon
      as per standard protocols. Patients who are recommended to follow a conservative treatment
      modality and are interested in participating in this study will be randomized into treatment
      or control groups. Both groups will undergo symptom assessment, strength testing, and range
      of motion testing prior to starting the standard conservative treatment of bracing. The
      treatment group will use the TheraWorx topical foam and the compression wrap nightly for 2
      weeks for at least 6 hours per night. Control group will use a compression wrap for the same
      time period. Both groups will return at 1 and 2 weeks for repeat strength and range of motion
      testing and symptom assessment.
