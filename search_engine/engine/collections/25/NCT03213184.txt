      scientific centers working together to identify phenotypes and causes of childhood asthma.
      CREW will include data from a large number of children (over 9,000 at birth, 6,000-7,000 who
      are still being followed, and at least 5,667 expected to enroll in CREW) and their families,
      with broad diversity in terms of ethnicity, family characteristics, neighborhoods and
      geographic locations. One of the primary goals of CREW is to put together sets of data and
      samples of participating cohorts to identify phenotypes of childhood asthma (i.e. specific
      subtypes of asthma that can be distinguished by clinical features such as natural history,
      triggers, exacerbation frequency, concurrent allergies, lung function, sex, etc). As we
      obtain mechanistic insights about personal and early life risk factors, we will connect
      asthma phenotypes with underlying causes and pathogenic mechanisms to define endotypes of
      childhood asthma.
