      follow up where the device parameters, patient condition and arrhythmic events are being
      reviewed, and reprogramming of the device (if needed) is done. Average net time of patient's
      stay in the clinic is between 30-45 minutes.

      Patients implanted with the Lumax device family allows for a better automated follow up
      procedure via remote management (Home Monitoring).
