    
      This is a prospective cohort study of patients seeking care for chronic low back pain. All
      patients will undergo a detailed history and physical examination, followed by other
      indicated diagnostic testing. The analysis will correlate findings from patient history and
      physical examination testing with the eventual diagnosis. The goal of the study is to
      identify key historical and physical examination criteria that raise the suspicion for
      sacroiliac joint pain, which is commonly underdiagnosed. Failure to diagnose a health
      condition could lead to inappropriate surgery.
