      single-center, clinical 'in-use' study to determine the local cutaneous and ocular tolerance
      profiles of 3 developmental cosmetic facial skincare products; a serum, lotion, and cream in
      healthy females with clinically-evaluated sensitive skin as determined by a positive response
      to a Lactic Acid Stinging Test (LAST) with signs or symptoms of cutaneous irritation and no
      ophthalmological conditions. Assessments will be performed and recorded for 21 days.
