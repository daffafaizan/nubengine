    
      LDK378 is a novel inhibitor of ALK that is active in a broad range of ALK-activated tumor
      models, including models driven by mutated versions of ALK known to be resistant to
      crizotinib, and by ALK gene amplification.

      The primary purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or
      recommended dose for expansion in pediatric patients, and to delineate a clinical dose to be
      used in any future pediatric studies, with and without food. This study also assessed the
      safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of LDK378 in
      pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, and other ALK-activated tumors.

      Fasted cohort: each daily dose of LDK378 (including days which involved PK blood sampling)
      was taken at least 2 hours after last meal & subjects did not eat until 1 hour after LDK378
      was taken. Each daily dose of LDK378 was taken with 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 mL) of an
      appropriate food (such as applesauce or non-fat yogurt) & a glass of water

      Fed cohort: each daily dose of LDK378 (including days which involved PK blood sampling) was
      taken with, or within 30 minutes after finishing a low-fat light snack containing 100-300
      calories & 1.5-2 grams of fat.
