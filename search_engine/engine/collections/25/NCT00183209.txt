      for HIV-infected and uninfected mothers with problem drinking. We targeted 118 mothers of
      adolescent children (aged 11-18). The intervention is based on Social Action Theory (Ewart,
      1991) and targets alcohol and drug problems, sexual risk behavior, and parenting. Mothers are
      followed and interviewed at four intervals over 18 months. Because we anticipate that the
      intervention will have effects on adolescent behavior, these youth are also enrolled and
      interviewed at three intervals over 12 months. Adolescents do not attend intervention
      sessions. We hypothesize that mothers in the 14-session intervention condition will show
      improvements in alcohol and drug use, sexual risk behavior, and parenting in comparison to
      the control condition, which receives a one session brief video intervention.
