      established to provide a vanguard of the first 30 subjects who will have more frequent
      monitoring of their safety. If safety is established, the remainder of the subjects will be
      entered into the clinical study (i.e., Part II). All subjects will be males with advanced
      prostate carcinoma judged to be candidates for medical androgen ablation therapy, and all
      will receive two injections of LMIS 50 mg six-month apart in an unblinded fashion.
