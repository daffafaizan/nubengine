    
      This is a phase 2, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial with two parallel
      groups.

        -  H56:IC31 (investigational vaccine)

        -  Placebo

           900 HIV-negative adults with a diagnosis of drug susceptible pulmonary TB are planned to
           be included, recruited from TB clinics with established relationships to the trial sites
           at the start of their TB treatment.

           5 study sites in South Africa: 2 sites from the AURUM institute (Klerksdorp and Tembisa)
           and 3 in Cape Town at TASK Applied Science (TASK), the University of Cape Town Lung
           Institute (UCT) and South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) under UCT,
           respectively.

           1 study site in Tanzania (TZ): 1 site at Mbeya Medical Research Centre (MMRC) under the
           National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR).

      Preclinical data suggest H56:IC31 may be more efficacious if administered while patients are
      still on treatment. Following the national guidelines for TB treatment in South Africa and
      Tanzania, we will obtain sputum samples from patients towards the end of treatment at about
      the same time they are obtained within the national TB control programmes, and if the sputum
      is smear negative, the criterion for successful treatment within TB programmes, the
      individual will be eligible for randomization and vaccination towards the end of their
      six-month treatment period.

      As this is a proof of concept TB vaccine study, HIV positive individuals have been excluded
      as it is not yet known what effect HIV infection may have on the immune response to the
      vaccine. However, HIV positive individuals are an important population to include in future
      studies should efficacy be demonstrated in this study.
