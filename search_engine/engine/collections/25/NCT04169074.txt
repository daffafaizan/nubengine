    
      This is a randomized, parallel, open label Phase II window trial to assess the clinical and
      biological effects of 15-21 days of neoadjuvant abemaciclib (Arm 1) or neoadjuvant
      abemaciclib plus nivolumab (Arm 2) in patients with HPV-negative HNSCC who are planned for
      oncologic surgery, with pre-clinically informed genetic and immune biomarker correlatives.

      In the window-of-opportunity clinical trial, patients planned for oncologic surgery are
      briefly exposed to a novel cancer agent(s) in the window between diagnostic biopsy and
      definitive surgery. Paired, pre- and post-surgical tumor specimens permit ex vivo analysis of
      target modulation in both tumor and the tumor microenvironment - providing insight into
      mechanism of action and paving the way for rigorous companion biomarker development. Clinical
      activity is assessed by quantitative change in tumor size (∆T), which is correlated to
      hypothesis-driven genomic and immune biomarkers of interest.

      Investigators hypothesize that abemaciclib, with or without nivolumab, will significantly
      reduce tumor burden as measured by ∆T. Further, investigators will test the primary biomarker
      hypothesis that the clinical activity of abemaciclib, with or without nivolumab, is
      associated with an increased proportion of tumors that are T-cell inflamed. Investigators
      will evaluate tumor-intrinsic, tumor microenvironment (TME), and microbiome biomarker
      hypotheses in specific genetic contexts, including tumors with specific classes of tumor
      protein 53 (TP53) mutations, p16 loss, and/or CCND1 amplification.
