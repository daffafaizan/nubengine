    
      The main objective of this study is to compare patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and
      clinical and functional outcomes between RTSA with and without subscapularis repair. The
      specific aims for this study are:

      Specific Aim 1:

      To determine if there is a difference in PROM scores between RTSA with and without
      subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative period.

      Specific Aim 2:

      To determine if there is a difference between the two surgical approaches with respect to
      shoulder function, specifically range of motion and strength, during the 24-month
      postoperative period.

      Specific Aim 3:

      To determine if there is a difference in shoulder dislocation rates between RTSA with and
      without subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative period.

      Specific Aim 4:

      To determine if there is a difference in surgical complications, re-operation or revision
      rates between RTSA with and without subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative
      period.

      Specific Aim 5:

      To quantify the operative times for RTSA with and without subscapularis repair, and determine
      if there is a difference between the two approaches.
