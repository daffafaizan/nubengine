      under conditions of natural exposure. The study will be conducted in children 5-17 months old
      at first vaccination living in areas of mid to high malaria transmission, in line with the
      age group recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the implementation of the
      RTS,S/AS01E vaccine. Results from this study will be critical in informing future
      possibilities for the development of vaccine-based strategies which, in combination with
      other interventions, may contribute to the malaria elimination agenda.
