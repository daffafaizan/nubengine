      Phase Ib is a dose escalation phase with 3 dose levels (cohorts) of leronlimab (PRO 140)
      administered in combination with a fixed dose of carboplatin at AUC 5. This dose finding
      portion of study will follow a "3+3" designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of leronlimab (PRO 140) administered as subcutaneous injection in subjects with
      histologically confirmed mTNBC that express CCR5.

      Phase II

      Phase II is a single arm study with 30 patients in order to test the hypothesis that the
      combination of carboplatin AUC 5 intravenously and MTD of leronlimab (PRO 140) SC will
      increase PFS in patients with CCR5 + mTNBC.
