      to the ED or ICU within 24 h of onset of chest pain suggestive of suspected ACS.

      We propose to construct the biobank of ACS and evaluate the potential diagnostic value of
      circulating microRNAs compared with cTnI for suspected ACS patients. All the patients are to
      be followed up for 6 months. Final diagnosis was made by an expert panel cardiologist, based
      on all available clinical information including cTnI measurements, ECG, coronary angiography,
      cardiac exercise tests and information from hospital discharge letters.

      The concentrations of microRNAs will be evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR,
      using highly specific primers and hybridization probes.
