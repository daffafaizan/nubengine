      Urine Test score with the presence of high Gleason grade / score (GS>/=7) prostate cancer on
      a prostate needle biopsy and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men
      presenting to their urologist with or without a previous negative biopsy, and recommended for
      an initial or subsequent biopsy. The results of this study are to support the use of this
      assay as a laboratory developed test. A secondary objective is to develop an assay that
      accurately predicts the presence of any Gleason grade prostate cancer in men at risk for
      prostate cancer.
