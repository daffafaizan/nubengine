      periodontitis with 30 intrabony defects. Patients were divided into three groups; group I was
      subjected to open flap debridement only. Group II was subjected to open flap debridement
      followed by application of curcumin-simvastatin paste (2% curcumin and 1.2% simvastatin).
      Group III was subjected to open flap debridement followed by 24% EDTA root surface etching
      and application of curcumin-simvastatin paste (2% curcumin and 1.2% simvastatin).Clinical
      parameters including plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth and clinical
      attachment level were recorded pre-surgical. Moreover, radiographic examination was performed
      by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) just before the surgery . Vertical bone defects were
      exposed by full thickness mucoperiosteal flap following intrasulcular incision and thorough
      debridement was performed. Group II received local application of curcumin-simvastatin paste
      .Group III received curcumin-simvastatin paste after debridement and 24 % EDTA. The same
      initial clinical parameters were recorded three and six months postoperatively. Radiographic
      measurements were recorded six months post surgically.
