      toxicant metabolites. The toxicant burden will be measured by a percentile score of each
      metabolite and summing all percentile values. A risk level of each metabolite will be
      normalized by the percentile score in order to calculate the total toxic burden for an
      individual. Wilcoxon-ranked sum non-parametric calculations will be used to evaluate whether
      pre and post-intervention reduction has occurred. Because this is a single-arm trial, any
      reduction in the toxicant burden will be correlated with the relative improvement of the
      secondary endpoint and will be measured using Kendall's tau-beta ranked correlation.

      The secondary aim will assess each participant's glucose response to an oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) pre and post-intervention. Because this study is not powered, the
      estimated man reduction from baseline cannot be estimated. Any reduction in OGTT mean values
      will allow us to calculate an effect size for future investigation. The ranking of the
      improvement in glucose response (AUC) will be tested by ranking the reduction of the toxic
      burden by a correlation analysis using Kendall's tau-beta ranked correlation described above.

      Each participant is provided with the first baseline in-person assessment, two online
      avoidance education sessions and the last in-person assessment sessions. The topics of the
      avoidance educational sessions will be individualized. A survey questionnaire assessing
      knowledge, attitude and behavior (KAB) regarding avoidance of environmental toxicants will be
      administered pre and post-intervention.
