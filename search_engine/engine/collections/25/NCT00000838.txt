      resistance mutations. One explanation is that the M184V mutation, which confers resistance to
      3TC, suppresses AZT resistance. This benefit of 3TC may not extend to combination therapy
      with other nucleoside analogs.

      Patients are randomized to either a ddI limb or d4T limb, then randomized a second time to
      one of six treatment arms, as follows: ddI alone, d4T alone, 3TC/AZT (on both ddI and d4T
      limbs), 3TC/ddI, and 3TC/d4T. Treatment is given for 48 weeks. At study week 24, patients on
      monotherapy will have 3TC added to their regimen (in a blinded fashion).

      PER AMENDMENT 10/18/96: A treatment extension phase has been added to the study design in
      order to allow subjects who complete 48 weeks of therapy to remain on their same blinded
      treatment until approximately 2 months after the last enrolled subject completes 48 weeks on
      the study.
