      maintenance. Overweight and obese adults at two study sties (N=426) will be randomized to (1)
      Internet intervention; or 2) Internet intervention with individual MI sessions occurring at
      three month intervals on a fixed schedule (Internet+MI-Fixed). Assessments will be conducted
      every six months and will include measures of body weight and height, diet and exercise
      behaviors, Quality of Life, adherence measures (eg., attendance, compliance with
      self-monitoring), social influence components, motivation, treatment satisfaction,
      demographic data and descriptive information regarding use of website components. A third arm
      was added for the final 3 intervention cohorts. All participants received the program as
      described above with the addition of motivational interviewing contingent on participants'
