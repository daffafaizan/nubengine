      in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of ADHD in these
      children. We hypothesize the rate of ADHD will be higher in the children of the ADHD NOS
      probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings of proband children with
      ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of school failure (as
      measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and placement in special
      classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.

      The proposed study includes a one-time fifteen minute survey derived from the ADHD module of
      the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders - Epidemiological Version (KSADS-E) with the
      proband of an ADHD NOS study regarding his/her children, in order to assess possible ADHD
      symptoms of that child. We also ask "school questions" regarding certain aspects of a child's
      educational experience.
