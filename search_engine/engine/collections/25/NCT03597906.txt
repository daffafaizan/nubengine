    
      Candidates for refractive surgery above 18 years with myopic astigmatism and no previous
      ocular surgery.

      Sample size 60 eyes. surgery:

        -  60 eyes of myopic topography-guided LASIK procedures with the same refractive platform
           (FS200 femtosecond to create a flap between90: 110 Î¼m with diameter 8:9 mm and EX500
           excimer lasers) will be randomized for treatment as follows:

        -  Group A: 20 eyes will be treated using Contoura vision with the standard manifest
           refraction.

        -  Group B: 20 eyes will be treated with Contoura vision using the topographic astigmatic
           power and axis and without change in the spherical power (using the same spherical power
           as the manifest refraction).

        -  Group C [TMR]: 20 eyes will be treated with Contoura vision using the topographic
           astigmatic power and axis and modifying the spherical power to obtain the same spherical
           equivalent as the manifest refraction. This is done by subtracting half of the
           difference between topographic astigmatic power and the manifest astigmatic power from
           the spherical power (topography-modified treatment refraction).

        -  The standard postoperative treatment is combined steroids and antibiotics eye drops 5
           times daily for one week ,then three times daily for three days and lubricant eye drops
           5 times daily for six months.

      Postoperatively, the patients will be examined at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. All
      postoperative follow-up visits included measurement of UDVA, CDVA (if indicated) and
      refraction, besides full ophthalmological examination and performing pentacam and topolyzer
      after 3 months
