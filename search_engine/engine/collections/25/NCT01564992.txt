      Objective:

      To identify genes associated to disease and treatment complication and response.

      Number of subjects: 500

      Study duration : 6 years

      Design:

      Prospective cohort with biological collection

      Primary objective:

      Parkinson disease, directly or with the interaction of treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Prevalence and incidence of disease or treatment complications

        -  Clinical risk factor for disease or treatment complications
