      distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition using the PET tracer [C-11]PiB in participants
      in the UAB-ADC cohort. The amount and distribution of [C-11]PiB in the brain will be
      correlated to demographic, clinical, genetic, and biospecimen data acquired through the
      separate ongoing UAB-ADC study. Assessment of interactions between race and vascular risk
      factors, brain amyloid levels measured with [C-11]PiB-PET, and cognitive status will be the
      primary outcome of this imaging study. As a secondary aim, the investigators will assess the
      ability of the early flow frames from [C-11]PiB-PET and brain volumetric measurements with
      MRI to serve as a marker of neuronal injury and to predict cognitive status in conjunction
      with the amyloid-PET results.
