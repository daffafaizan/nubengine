    
      Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the elongation of the hamstrings after making different
      types of stretching and mobilizations used in physiotherapy. This study is realized with
      university students to be long time studying in sitting position, and each subject is
      randomly assigned to one of three different groups. One group receives 10 minutes of global
      postural reeducation stretching (RPG), another group receives 10 minutes of bilateral
      mobilization of sciatic nerve, and a third group received a placebo treatment. The evaluation
      of these treatments are done previously, immediately after and 20 min later. The test used to
      evaluate elongation are the Sit and Reach and active knee extension (AKE test). The order of
      measurement of each test is also randomized in each subject. The intervention is always
      applied to the same physical therapist, and measurements were always performed by another
      physiotherapist blinded.
