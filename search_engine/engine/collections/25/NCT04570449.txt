      organ failure due to a rapid increase in cytokine production. Fluoxetine has been shown to
      reduce the mechanisms that cause the cytokine storm that leads to COVID-19 fatalities.

      This is a pilot study to assess feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants
      diagnosed with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to observe the early use of fluoxetine
      treatments on illness outcome: primary outcome is hospitalization and secondary outcomes of
      complications including intubation and death. Additional secondary outcomes include effects
      on outcomes for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, two common illnesses which may
      be improved by fluoxetine.
