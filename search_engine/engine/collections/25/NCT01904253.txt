    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized Phase 2 study of TAS-102 versus
      Investigator's choice of therapy in patients requiring second-line chemotherapy for SCLC
      refractory or sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Investigator's choice of
      therapy is defined as second-line chemotherapy with IV topotecan (Europe/Japan) or IV
      amrubicin (Japan). Patients will be stratified by response to first-line platinum-based
      chemotherapy (sensitive vs refractory). Sensitive patients are defined as patients who did
      not progress within 90 days after the last dose, and refractory patients are defined as
      patients who never responded or who responded but had radiologic progression < 90 days after
      the last dose.
