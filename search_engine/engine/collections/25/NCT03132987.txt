      peripheral contributions to quadriceps strength. Neural influences will be quantified using
      the interpolated twitch technique (voluntary activation) and early RTD. Peripheral influences
      will be quantified by examining the stimulus-evoked torque with the quadriceps relaxed
      (resting twitch) and late RTD. Knee joint biomechanics during treadmill walking and running
      will include sagittal plane (flexion, extension) movement variability (Lyapunov Exponent and
      approximate entropy), peak knee flexion angle, and peak external knee flexion and adduction
      moments. Additionally, the clinical relevance of impairments in the ACL reconstruction group
      will be determined by examining the relationship with performance on jumping tasks and
      patient function (secondary outcomes).

      The progressive strengthening program will be performed for 6 weeks and emphasize development
      of strength and power. Feasibility will be established if the researchers can recruit up to 8
      participants and retain at least 80% over the 3 week intervention program. The researchers
      will determine effect sizes for changes outcome measures.
