    
      Major Depression Postpartum Onset (PPD) is a chronic relapsing illness which affects not only
      maternal mood but also the baby and family. Therefore, it is critical to aim for timely
      intervention once the diagnosis is made. Studies have shown that antidepressant medications
      are effective in treatment for moderate to severe PPD. Common reasons for noncompliance and
      discontinuation of antidepressant medications in the postpartum period are the side effects
      associated with different antidepressants. To choose an antidepressant medication with proven
      efficacy and a tolerable side effect profile is key in order to maximize adherence to
      pharmacotherapy.

      A number of studies have been published that highlight the efficacy of escitalopram in the
      treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, there has been no research to date
      investigating the effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of PPD.

      Based upon the preliminary clinical observations in our tertiary care program (Provincial
      Reproductive Mental Health Program) where a postpartum depressed population is frequently
      treated with antidepressant medications, compliance with escitalopram has been impressive.
      Therefore, we propose to conduct an open-label study with escitalopram in postpartum
      depressed, non-lactating mothers to confirm our clinical observation.

      Hypotheses:

      i) Escitalopram will be effective in the treatment of Postpartum Depression and ii)
      Escitalopram will be effective in increasing the quality of life of participants.
