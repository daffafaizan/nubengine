      glucose tolerance test and 40 healthy women, aged 21-41 years, between weeks of 14-28 of
      pregnancy, who attended the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Gulhane Training and
      Research Hospital. Participants with polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic diseases, pre-GDM, or
      multiple pregnancies were excluded. Sociodemographic information was recorded via
      questionnaire and anthropometrics of women were measured.

      Blood samples were taken after an overnight fasting. Dietary information was obtained by mean
      intakes of a 3-day food records (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) and analyzed via nutrition
      analysis software. According to the data obtained from software analysis, animal protein
      (g/day) to potassium (g/day) ratio (AP/K), potential renal acid load (PRAL; mEq/day) score
      and net endogenous acid production (NEAP; mEq/day) were calculated from established
      algorithms to estimate dietary acid load. All nutrients were age and energy- adjusted before
      being introduced into the equation and tertiles of the scores were used for statistical
      analysis. ANOVA, ANCOVA and Logistic regression test were used. The study plan was approved
      by the Hospital&#39;s Ethics Committee.
