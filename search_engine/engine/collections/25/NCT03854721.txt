      design to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) followed by a dose expansion at the
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Both phases of the study will use a Window of Opportunity
      study design where patients with a single, low-grade Ta lesion will receive VAX014 via a
      urinary catheter into the bladder, weekly for 6 weeks prior to undergoing Transurethral
      Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) to assess antitumor activity against the mapped lesion.

      Patients enrolled in this study must have low-grade (Ta) Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.
      However, eligible patients may have up to 5 low-grade Ta lesions at screening, and all but a
      single mapped lesion will be resected prior to receiving VAX014. The mapped lesion is
      assessed for anti-tumor activity.

      VAX014 is a formulation of recombinant bacterial minicells which is designed to selectively
      target two NMIBC-associated integrin heterodimers to de-stabilize tumor cell membranes, with
      the result being tumor cell lysis.
