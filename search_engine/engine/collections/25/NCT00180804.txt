      pathology leading to defective implantation of fetus in maternal uterus may lead to recurrent
      early miscarriages. This project arises from previous work on pre-eclampsia where we found
      combination of maternal immune genes (KIR) with their ligand (HLA-C) in the fetus was
      strongly associated with the disease. We will tissue type the fetus, mother and father in
      cases of unexplained miscarriages. We hope that genetic findings in recurrent miscarriage
      will lead to new insights, prevention and treatment.
