      through review of medical records, internal respiratory databases and electronic hospital
      patient record (OACIS & HOMER) over 3x12 blocks.

      Participants: COPD patients from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital(TQEH) Respiratory Nursing
      Service who were new patients in 2006, 2011, 2013 and 2015 (Jan 1st to Dec 31st ). Data
      collection: Demographics, clinical data, hospital service utilisation, and clinical outcomes
      such as exacerbation frequency and disease progression. All data will be extracted into a
      standardised data extraction form, which a random subset will be checked by a second
      researcher.

      Demographic data will include comparison of % without comorbidities, impact of comorbid
      conditions using Charleston Comorbidity index isolating diabetes, heart failure, anxiety and
      depression. Demographic and descriptive data will be given in means + SD and compared using a
      two-tailed Student t-test. Categorical variables will be compared using chisquared or Fisher
      exact tests, and when appropriate the MannWhitney Utest for nonparametric data. Statistical
      significance will be determined using an alpha of p <0.05. All analyses will be examined
      using SPSS software (version x).
