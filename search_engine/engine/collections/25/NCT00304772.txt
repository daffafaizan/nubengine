      prognosis with attributable mortality of more than 30%. Clinical efficacy of fluconazole for
      the treatment of Candida bloodstream infection has been reported in clinical studies, since
      1985 when it placed on the market. Fluconazole has established a position as the first-line
      drug up to date. However, possibly associated with the increased use of fluconazole,
      increased frequency of Candida species or strains with low susceptibility to fluconazole has
      been pointed out. Micafungin, an antifungal echinocandin with a different antifungal
      mechanism from fluconazole, has been reported to show good in vitro activity to various
      Candida species and strains with fluconazole resistance, and has comparative clinical
      efficacy with fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis, while it has relatively low in vitro
      activity to certain Candida species. There is no comparative study of fluconazole versus
      micafungin against Candida bloodstream infection.
