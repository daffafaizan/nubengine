      (FAOS) before surgery, six months and one year after surgery. At each visit a clinical
      examination is done by a foot and ankle surgeon, according to a protocol. At the same visit a
      gait analysis is performed with force plates, registration of speed and gait length and 3D
      recording. The surgery itself is performed according to the clinic's usual protocol and
      standardised, so all patients are treated in the same way. The physiotherapy is also done
      according to a protocol. The surgeon is not involved in the follow- up, this is done by
      another surgeon, and the gait analysis is done by a physiotherapist.

      The patients are chosen from two groups: primary tear of the peroneus brevis tendon,
      requiring a longus to brevis transfer, and primary tear of the peroneus longus tendon,
      requiring removal of the tendon.

      The first group has a sub-group: patients who are in need of a calcaneal osteotomy because of
      a severe varus hindfoot. The reason the study group is so heterogenous is that peroneus
      longus and brevis tears are very rare, and 10 patients are referred to the Orthoaedic
      deparment each year, that need this type of surgery. The sample size has been calculated to
      30 patients (based on changes in force measurements during gate), but more patients need to
      be involved in the study in order to have 30 patients at one year follow up.
