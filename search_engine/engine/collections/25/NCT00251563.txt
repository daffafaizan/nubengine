    
      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical
      characterization of individuals with cancer (gastric, colorectal, esophageal, liver,
      prostate, lung, breast and endometrial cancer, etc.). We will accrue approximately 1600
      patients as experimental group. The control group consists of subjects who will be confirmed
      without cancer. We will explore the environmental (including family history, life style,
      diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress
      factors, angiogenic factors, and tumor markers, etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress
      factors and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We will study the association between
      various environmental risk factors with the clinical characterization and correlation between
      the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of various cancer.
