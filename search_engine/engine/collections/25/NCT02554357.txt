      of the shoulder and upper arm.

      Moreover, the incidence of rebound pain is well documented and is often of considerable
      discomfort to patients, who may quickly go from little or no pain to moderate-severe pain.
      Continuous nerve block techniques with home ambulatory catheters are currently utilized to
      manage postoperative pain.This study is designed to compare the level and duration of pain
      control of ExparelÂ® injected after bupivacaine via stop-cock connected syringes and
      bupivacaine alone for ISBPB.
