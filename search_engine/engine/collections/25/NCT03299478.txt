      in a prospective multicenter study to establish a prognostic TNM-Immunoscore.

      The investigators will include around 1000 stage I-IIIA patients from various centers in
      Scandinavia. The investigators will also collect demographic and clinicopathological data,
      blood and tissues in a database and biobank. Candidate T-cell markers will be analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry for validation and by other methods for exploration of their impact on
      prognosis
