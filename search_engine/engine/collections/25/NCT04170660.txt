      associated with maternal hypertension and renal dysfunction. It is a constant concern of
      obstetrical teams in the pre and post partum period. In case of diagnosis in the emergency
      unit, patients are usually hospitalized. However, in the case of a diagnosis of preeclampsia
      has been invalidated, but in presence of isolated or frustrated clinical functional signs, in
      the case of a history of placental vascular pathology, obstetric teams implement surveillance
      strategies that are binding on the patients.

      The sFlt-1/ PlGF assay has a high negative predictive value for the coming week.

      The use in clinical practice of these two biomarkers in the indication of negative prediction
      at one week could help teams in their management but the interest of this use needs to be
      evaluated.
