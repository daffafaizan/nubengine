      sensitive detection method for ischemia. It would be a powerful tool for risk stratification
      of patients presenting with chest pain but unremarkable ECG and blood tests. the
      investigateors therefore designed a blind multicentrique prospective study to evaluate
      expression and functionnaly activity of A2AR in the management of undifferentiated chest pain
      The objective of the study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy between this novel biomarkers
      A2AR and invasive and non -invasive evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD).
