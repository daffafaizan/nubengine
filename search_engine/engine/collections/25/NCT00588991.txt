      I. To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of ABT-888 (veliparib) when
      administered alone and in combination with topotecan hydrochloride with or without
      carboplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, high-risk myelodysplasia,
      or aggressive myeloproliferative disorders.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABT-888 when administered with topotecan
      hydrochloride and carboplatin in these patients.

      III. To determine if ABT-888 when administered with topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin
      can induce clinical responses in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 when administered alone and in combination
      with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in these patients.

      II. To obtain pharmacodynamic data regarding the ability of ABT-888 to inhibit poly
      (ADP-ribose) levels in leukemic blasts.

      III. To obtain descriptive data regarding the mutational status and/or methylation status of
      key genes in selected DNA repair pathways (Fanconi complementation groups A-F, Blooms, and
      ataxia-telangiectasia) in leukemic blasts.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally twice daily on days 1-8, 1-14, or 1-21 and topotecan
      hydrochloride with or without carboplatin IV continuously over 120 hours on days 3-7.
      Treatment repeats every 28-63 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
