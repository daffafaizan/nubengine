    
      Primary objectives

        1. To identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 177Lu-ST2210 after prior intra-lesional
           injection of AvidinOX in the liver.

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of intra-lesionally injected AvidinOX + IV injected
           177Lu-ST2210

        3. To evaluate intra-lesional distribution and retention of AvidinOX + 177Lu-ST2210 complex
           in liver metastases

        4. To evaluate systemic biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 177Lu-ST2210 and {AvidinOX
           + 177Lu-ST2210}- complex

      Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate proportional 177Lu-ST2210 tumor binding, as a function of total tumor load,
           and AvidinOX dose injected

        2. To demonstrate AvidinOX post-deposition reactivity with 177Lu-ST2210 over time

        3. To evaluate whole body dosimetry of IV 177Lu-ST2210 after prior AvidinOX injection
           (radiation safety dosimetry)

        4. To record individual tumor dosimetry

        5. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of {AvidinOX + 177Lu-ST2210}-complex in reducing tumor
           size

        6. To evaluate whole body safety dosimetry and dose linearity of IV administered
           177Lu-ST2210 after prior intra-lesional injection of AvidinOX

        7. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of ST2210 in plasma and urine
