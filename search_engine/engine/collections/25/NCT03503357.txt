      anesthetic will be recruited for this study. This study will use the Isolated Forearm Test
      (IFT) to identify patients at risk of anesthesia awareness. In the IFT, induction of
      anesthesia is followed by inflation of a cuff on the dominant arm before neuromuscular
      blockade (paralysis) is induced. The cuff prevents paralysis of the hand allowing the patient
      to communicate to an observer through predefined hand movements, typically following a
      command like: "Mrs. Jones, if you can hear me, squeeze my hand". Participants will thus be
      asked to follow a series of commands intraoperatively to assess awareness.

      Routinely recorded clinical data will be collected to frame the observations about IFT
      responsiveness, and non-invasive EEG data will also be collected to provide information about
      the "brain state" of the patients. Patient reported confusion and objectively measured
      confusion using the Nurse Based Delirium Screening Tool (NuDesc) will be collected post
      operatively. Finally, participants will be contacted 24 hours and 7 days following their
      operation to complete an anesthesia satisfaction questionnaire.
