    
      Rationale: Glioblastomas (GBM) account for 70% of all gliomas (80% of all malignant brain and
      CNS tumors) and remain the most aggressive sub-type of glioma, with a particularly poor
      prognosis. Surgery aimed to complete resection is the first therapeutic modality, however,
      the infiltrative nature of the disease makes a complete resection nearly impossible. In a
      randomized, phase III EORTC-NCIC trial, overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      patients treated with concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of
      temozolomide was 27.2% (95% CI 22.2-32.5) at 2 years, 16.0% (12.0-20.6) at 3 years, 12.1%
      (8.5-16.4) at 4 years, and 9.8% (6.4-14.0) at 5 years, treatment which is now standard of
      care. Almost all GBM patients experience relapse and there is no one generally agreed
      standard of care in recurrent GBM. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a central
      regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis, is considered to play a major
      angiogenic role in GBM. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, showed a
      28%RR,a 43% 6-month PFS and provided a consistent clinical benefit in terms of both delayed
      progression and increased median overall survival over historical controls. This benefit is
      limited however, with the tumor eventually evading treatment by for example compensatory
      upregulation of angiogenic factors like placental growth factor (PlGF). Therefore, targeting
      PlGF could be a new strategy of tumor angiogenesis inhibition, complementary to VEGF(R)
      inhibition. In preclinical setting, inhibiting PlGF has shown to inhibit growth and
      metastasis of various tumors. Humanized monoclonal PlGF antibody RO5323441 was evaluated in
      phase I trials in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients; no Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
      was found, thus no Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined. Stable disease was observed in 6/23
      patients on different dose levels. A phase I/II study of bevacizumab in combination with
      RO5323441 is currently ongoing in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT01308684). However, the
      amount of RO5323441 to reach the recurrent GBM, and how this is affected by bevacizumab
      treatment, are yet unknown. This can be determined by repetitive measurement of RO5323441
      tumor uptake with 89Zr-RO5323441 PET.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the penetration of RO532441 into
      recurrent GBM by 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and to quantify its uptake, to visualize and
      quantify 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ distribution, and to measure the effect of
      bevacizumab treatment on 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM.

      Study design: This is a single center, investigator driven, 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and
      bio-distribution study in patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab
      at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight i.v. in 90 min on day 1 is given every 2 weeks in cycles of
      6 weeks. The treatment with bevacizumab will continue until documented disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or patient's best interest. 89Zr-RO5323441 will be
      administered i.v. at a tracer dose of 5 mg (37 MBq) on day -3 and on day 11 of cycle 1 of
      bevacizumab treatment. Four PET scans will be performed (2 brain only PET scans and 2 whole
      body PET scans). Brain only PET scans will be performed 2 hours after each 89Zr-RO5323441
      administration on day -3 and day 11, and will take 10 minutes/ scan. Whole body PET scans
      will be performed 4 days after each 89Zr-RO5323441 administration (before dosing with
      bevacizumab on day 1 and day 15), and will take 50 minutes/ scan. 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake
      values in recurrent GBM lesions at baseline and day 15 will be compared to assess bevacizumab
      effect on tracer tumor uptake. The purpose of the two early brain-only PET scans after each
      89Zr-RO5323441 injection is to identify whether changes in 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent
      GBM lesions following treatment with bevacizumab can be solely attributed to an effect on
      blood volume/ vascular permeability, or rather indicate a possible modulation of placental
      growth factor (PlGF) level in the tumor tissue. The rationale for the whole body
      89Zr-RO5323441 PET scans is to assess 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs distribution at
      baseline, as well as to evaluate the influence bevacizumab treatment could exert on
      89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs uptake. For 89Zr-RO5323441 pharmacokinetics, blood samples
      will be taken 1 hour after 89Zr-RO5323441 tracer injection on d-3 and d11, respectively
      together with the blood samples for hematology on d1 and d15 during the 1st cycle of
      bevacizumab treatment. The rationale for this is that performing both the 89Zr-RO5323441 PET
      scan data quantification and the assessment of the tracer's blood pharmacokinetics would
      enable us to better understand the specificity of 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM
      lesions. Patients will be assessed for bevacizumab treatment response by brain MRI every 6
      weeks (i.e. every cycle) in the first 6 month and every 12 weeks thereafter, until documented
      progression using the updated RANO criteria. Treatment and tracer injection related side
      effects will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0) for toxicity and adverse event reporting.

      Main study parameters/ endpoints: 89Zr-RO5323441 tumor uptake and organ distribution will be
      scored visually and quantitatively. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and relative uptake value
      (RUV) will be determined and compared in the recurrent GBM lesions and in relevant tissues at
      baseline and day 15.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risk associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Bevacizumab is registered in The Netherlands for use in metastasized colon and
      breast cancer, in lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma and has already been
      tested in GBM clinical trials. Bevacizumab is expected to have clinical benefit for patients
      enrolled in this study and similar safety profile compared to the other indications.
      RO5323441 monotherapy was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignant diseases. In
      this study, one patient will receive a low total protein dose of 10 mg RO5323441 (2X5mg) in
      the tracer and it is expected that RO5323441 will not enhance bevacizumab related side
      effects. The total radiation dose of 89Zr-RO5323441 for a patient participating in this study
      would be 36 mSv for women and 30 mSv for men. According to the investigators this radiation
      burden is justifiable in this patient group by the information that can be obtained in this
      study. Risk: exposure to 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan-related radiation, possibility of allergic
      reaction to the protein in the tracer, possible side-effects of bevacizumab.
