    
      The procedure involves removal of the diseased parts of the joint, that is the damaged
      cartilage and adjacent bone, and replacing them with artificial parts which closely resemble
      in structure and/or function the removed native parts.

      The artificial parts fit onto the reshaped bone and are fixed either with bone cement (e.g.,
      polymethylmethacrylate) and press fit of the part(cemented), or by self-anchorage with bone
      ingrowth to its porous surface(cementless).

      The design of the artificial parts may include a stem, a keel or pegs, which fit onto the
      medullary canal of the bone or into a hole pre-prepared in the bone. An artificial part may
      fit loosely and be fixed with bone cement, press-fit for self- anchorage or include
      extendible anchors which are retracted upon placement and extended thereafter so as to secure
      the implant in place.

      Following fixation of the components, the joint is reduced and the soft tissue tension is
      appropriately checked to reassure stability of the joint.

      The MP-1™ acetabular liner will be tapper locked in acetabular metal shells to resurface the
      acetabular socket in cementless total hip replacement.

      MMaTech Ltd will manufacture the liners to perfectly fit into the external metallic shell of
      the following sizes (mm):
