      insulin therapy for blood glucose >180mg/dl. Insulin will be titrated according to hospital
      sliding scale.

      The use of insulin or metformin will benefit burned children by improving muscle protein
      build-up, speeding wound healing and reversing growth arrest, improving the immune response,
      and positively affecting long-term rehabilitation.

      The results of this study may initiate a change in standard of care as it is found that
      simply the reduction of blood glucose by metformin, improves patient outcomes as metformin
      can be administered without the added complication of hypoglycemia.
