    
      Study to evaluate the acute efficacy of a single night of High Flow Therapy (HFT) to treat
      mild-moderate predominantly obstructive Sleep Disordered Breathing, as compared to nasal
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Subjects will be order-randomized to
      receive HFT or CPAP in the laboratory, undergo a washout period, and return for the
      alternative therapy in the laboratory. The hypothesis is that HFT will be non-inferior to
      CPAP in controlling Apnea/Hypopnea events in this subject set during this study.

      Primary outcome will be Apnea / Hypopnea Index (AHI) change on therapy as compared to
      baseline diagnostic polysomnography.
