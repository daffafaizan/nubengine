      Health Insurance System and having had at least one reimbursement of any antithrombotic in
      the 3-year study period are identified by using data from the National Health reimbursement
      database (Système National d'Information Inter-Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie, SNIIR-AM).
      SNIIR-AM contains individualized, anonymous and comprehensive data for all health spending
      reimbursements of affiliated subjects, including basic patient demographic data, medical
      drugs as well as outpatient medical care, prescribed or performed by health-care
      professionals from both public and private practices. This allows to calculate a denominator
      (number of person-years of anti-thrombotic drug exposure).

      Crude incidence rates of major bleeding per 100 person-months are calculated in
      antithrombotic users, anticoagulants and others; stratification on a modified HAS-BLED score
      allows fair comparison between anti-thrombotic drug classes.
