      health practice notification (SUT) makes the diagnosis with liver biopsy mandatory for the
      treatment of chronic viral hepatitis (Chronic Hepatitis B Inf. And Chronic Hepatitis C Inf.).
      In daily gastroenterology practice, clinicians frequently perform a liver biopsy for the
      diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NASH), and to a lesser extent, for the diagnosis of
      Wilson Disease and Hemochromatosis.

      During the observation after liver biopsy, patients are hospitalized on their right side,
      which is the biopsy side, with the argument that there will be less bleeding or bile leakage
      complications. Patients who do not develop complications after 4-6 hours of observation are
      discharged to their homes. (1) In this study, researchers aimed to investigate the
      post-biopsy position of patients who were referred to the clinic for liver biopsy, the rate
      of complications after biopsy, and to what extent the patients found the procedure acceptable
      according to their post-biopsy position.
