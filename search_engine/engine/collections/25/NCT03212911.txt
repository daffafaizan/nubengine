    
      -  A randomized controlled trial to evaluate differences in immunogenicity and safety of
           the two hepatitis B vaccination regimens, including the percentage of responders,
           high-level responders, anamnestic response, geometric mean titers of anti-HBs antibody,
           adverse events and predictive factors associated with vaccine responsiveness

        -  After participant enrollment, data on baseline characteristics, time since HIV
           diagnosis, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, antiretroviral treatment regimen and duration
           will be collected, then the participants will be randomized into 2 groups to receive
           either 3- or 4-standard doses (20 mcg per dose) of HBV vaccination, and follow-up blood
           test for anti-HBs titers at multiple pre-specified time points to evaluate outcomes
