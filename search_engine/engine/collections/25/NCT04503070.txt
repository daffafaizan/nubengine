      exclusion criteria prior to consent. Once consent is obtained, each subject will undergo
      instruction and training expectations of each swing phase. Once an adequate determination of
      proficiency has been met, each subject will undergo EMG and MOTUS sleeve placement on each
      upper extremity:

        -  Forearm flexors

        -  Forearm extensors

        -  Medial epicondyle

        -  Lateral epicondyle

        -  Posterior rotator cuff musculature

      Once participants have undergone appropriate calibration processes, they will perform listed
      swing progressions in a randomized order:

      A. Dry swings - reduced weight (wiffleball) bat - 5 swings light intensity (25-50% effort), 5
      swings moderate intensity (50-75% effort), 5 swings high intensity (75-100% effort) B. Dry
      swings - normal weight bat - 5 swings light intensity (25-50% effort), 5 swings moderate
      intensity (50-75% effort), 5 swings high intensity (75-100% effort) C. Tee hitting - normal
      weight bat - middle strike zone level - 5 swings light intensity (25-50% effort), 5 swings
      moderate intensity (50-75% effort), 5 swings high intensity (75-100% effort) D. Soft toss -
      underhand toss from assistant - middle strike zone placement - 5 swings light intensity
      (25-50% effort), 5 swings moderate intensity (50-75% effort), 5 swings high intensity
      (75-100% effort) E. Simulated hitting - pitching machine - randomized strike zone placement -
      5 swings light intensity (25-50% effort), 5 swings moderate intensity (50-75% effort), 5
      swings high intensity (75-100% effort)
