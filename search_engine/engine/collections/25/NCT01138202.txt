      2002. The prevalence of NNRTI resistance has increased since 2005. Tuberculosis can develop
      following NNRTI-based regimen failure or after introduction of a new salvage regimen with a
      boosted PI (immune recovery syndrome). Although, Efavirenz based HAART is preferred in TB/HIV
      with rifampicin containing antituberculosis. However, Efavirenz could not be used in case of
      NNRTI failure, intolerance or toxicity. It remains unknown how to optimally treat HIV /TB in
      populations in which rifampicin has to be used. Moreover, Rifabutin which is recommended when
      use concomitant with boosted PI4, 5, is not feasible in Thailand and other developing
      countries due to cost, toxicity and dosing considerations. If ritonavir-boosted LPV
      demonstrates suitable pharmacokinetics, and is well tolerated, this regimen might prove
      extremely useful and could be widely implemented. LPV/r is potent and widely available
      boosted PI in National Health System in Thailand. We therefore believe that there is a strong
      rationale and impetus for the study of LPV/r 400/100 mg bid versus LPV/r 600/150 mg bid as a
      boosted-PI combination that in the presence of RMP, is able to produce a satisfactory PK
      profile associated with adequate antiretroviral potency, tolerability and efficacy .
