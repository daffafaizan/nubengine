      France) is a newly developed endoscopic device which allows the application of laser
      microscopy with any conventional endoscope and mosaic imaging. Previous studies have
      demonstrated its application in various GI diseases, including Barrett's esophagus, colonic
      adenoma, ulcerative colitis, and etc. However, limited data are provided on exploring the
      application of pCLE in the stomach. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to propose a
      new pCLE classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture, and to assess the
      accuracy and interobserver agreement of this new pCLE classification system in the stomach.
