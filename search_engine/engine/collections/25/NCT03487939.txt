      metastasis colorectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could suppress tumor, reduce
      metastasis, inhibit recurrence and improve long-term prognosis. Moreover, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy could provide evidence about tumor response to drugs for the adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Furthermore, according to the biological behavior of tumors observed by
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, unnecessarily excessive surgery could be avoided. However, some
      studies suggested that drug efficiency was consistent with resection rate. And FOLFOXIRI has
      been observed efficacy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with manageable
      toxicities. Therefore, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI
      chemotherapy in the patients with resectable liver metastasis of colorectal cancer to achieve
      higher resection rate and longer survival.

      In this prospective study, 30 patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases were
      treated with neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy. After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      the liver metastases will be removed. If there are primary bowel lesions, they will be
      resected together. Safety profile was recorded based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0). Objective response was evaluated by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Before treatment and after 4
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we will evaluate tumor metabolic response via FDG-PET and
      monitor the dynamic changes of peripheral blood ctDNA.
