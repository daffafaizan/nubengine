      intractable pain with a high incidence. Nearly 50% of PHN patients have experienced
      persistent pain for more than one year. Although it is not directly life-threatening, will
      lead to sleep disorders, even depression, seriously affecting the quality of life of
      patients. This project is a multi-center randomized controlled trial, which will recruit 448
      patients with PHN in 7 hospitals, aiming to evaluate the analgesic effect and safety of
      electroacupuncture on postherpetic neuralgia, and provide evidence-based medical evidence for
      electroacupuncture treatment of PHN.
