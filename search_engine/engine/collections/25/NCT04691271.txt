      vasculature after aSAH, and cerebral blood flow is significantly reduced, which can lead to
      delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or delayed ischemic neurological dysfunction (DIND). Past
      studies have shown that if cerebral vasospasm occurs in patients with aSAH, the proportion of
      ischemic brain injury can be as high as 20%-30%.Obviously, prevention and treatment of CVS
      are the key to reducing the disability and mortality of aSAH.
