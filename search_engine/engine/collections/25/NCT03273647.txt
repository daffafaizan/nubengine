      for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, the considerable number of esophageal cancer
      patients received operation as the first treatment modality. Accordingly, postoperative
      treatments have been playing an important role because of the poor survival rates of the
      patients who have been treated with resection alone. The existing data shows that the 5-yeal
      survival rate of stage T2-3N0M0(UICC 7th edition) of thoracic esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma(TESCC) after surgery is about 50% ,and locoregional lymph nodes metastases is
      responsible for the main cause of failure while distal metastases account for relatively less
      ratio. Therefore, the subclinical residual tumor is affirmative even if the early disease has
      been undergone curable excision and local adjuvant treatment may be essential. In rectal
      cancer, the involvement of the circumferential resection margin (CRM) is one of the key
      factors for local recurrence and poor prognosis,based on reports in which CRM with < 1mm was
      found to be prognostically significant, whereas the clinical and prognostic significance of
      the CRM involvement in EC has been investigated only in a few series showing conflicting
      results, as some studies suggest a significant influence of CRM. There is lack of clear
      evidence for prophylactic radiation therapy in positive Circumferential Resection Margin(CRM)
      patients of TESCC now. In view of this, the randomized controlled trial will determine the
      clinical efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant radiotherapy in positive Circumferential Resection
      Margin(CRM) for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
