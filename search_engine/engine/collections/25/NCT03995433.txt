    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of NSTEMI
      patients that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and clinical
      outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will establish a
      prospective registry of 2000 NSTEMI patients in 10 sites with follow-ups of up to 5 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate myocardial pathological features and functional changes in NSTEMI
           patients.

        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in NSTEMI patients.

        4. To compare myocardial tissue characteristics and functional changes in STEMI (data
           derived from EARLY-MYO-CMR) and NSTEMI patients.

        5. To verify GRACE Score classification in NSTEMI from CMR imaging view.
