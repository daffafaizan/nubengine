      pertinent to diagnostic urethrocystoscopy. All residents will be tested on anatomic replica
      of human bladder for baseline competency using the above tools. Then approximately half will
      be randomly selected to undergo an educational intervention (a workshop teaching diagnostic
      urethrocystoscopy). As we are interested in short-term acquisition, about a week later all
      residents will be retested using the same methods. Grades on the exam will be kept
      confidential.
