      inaccessible to chemotheraphy and agents such as trastuzumab due to the blood brain barrier,
      which prevents potentially harmful chemicals such as chemotherapy agents and antibodies such
      as trastuzumab from reaching the brain. Decreasing the incidence of brain metastasis with
      acceptable effects on neurocognitive function would be a significant improvement in the care
      of patients with MBC.
