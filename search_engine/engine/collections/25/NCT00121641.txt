      a short-term randomized treatment period. Subjects who complete the short-term period will be
      eligible to enter the long term extension period. Also, subjects in the short-term period who
      have an elevated blood sugar that requires additional medication for blood sugar control will
      be eligible to enter the long-term treatment extension period where they will receive
      metformin added onto their blinded study medication. Subjects with screening hemoglobin A1c
      (A1C) > 10.0% and â‰¤ 12.0%, who otherwise meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were eligible
      to enroll directly into Open-Label Treatment Cohort (Direct Enrollees) and receive open-label
      saxagliptin 10 mg. Those who completed the short-term period were eligible to enter into the
      long-term treatment extension period.Saxagliptin dose titration was not permitted.
