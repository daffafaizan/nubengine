      a broad variety of toxins, venom variability and injection quantity among individual snakes
      and across species result in broadly variable patient presentations. Clinical consequences of
      crotaline envenomation include local and systemic effects, both of which may progress for
      hours to days.The best studied systemic consequence is coagulopathy, which may in its
      complexity mimic disseminated intravascular coagulation. Platelet and clotting disorders
      respond rapidly to administration of polyvalent antivenom.

      Crotaline viper envenomation in the United States is treated with one of two licensed
      products: Wyeth Antivenin (Crotalidae) Polyvalent (Polyvalent), or CroFab® (antivenin
      Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab, ovine). In recent years, both of these products have been
      in critically short supply. Use of Wyeth Polyvalent has been associated with a greater than
      75% incidence of adverse reactions, including acute type 1 and delayed type 2 immune
      reactions.These phenomena are an inherent risk in the use of whole immunoglobulin. CroFab´s
      low molecular weight creates a pharmacokinetic mismatch with crotaline venom which leds to a
      recurrent venom effects.

      Anavip is pharmacologically and pharmacokinetically different.Because of the elimination of
      the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule, Anavip is expected to produce far fewer
      adverse reactions than seen with whole immunoglobulin antivenoms and unlike Fab molecules,
      F(ab)2 molecules exceed the size threshold for renal clearance and thus are expected to
      remain in circulation for a significantly longer time and substantially reduce the incidence
      of recurrent coagulopathy.
