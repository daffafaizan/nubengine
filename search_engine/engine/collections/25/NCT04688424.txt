    
      Aim 1: To compare the effects of 8-weeks of FES-assisted cycling training on improving
      cardiorespiratory fitness, walking function, self-motivated exercise/recreation,
      self-perception and functional mobility and quality of life of adolescents with spastic CP
      with marginal walking ability (Gross Motor Function Classification System Levels II - IV) vs.
      8-weeks of volitional cycling training and a non-intervention control group.

      Aim 2: To compare the effects of 8-weeks FES-assisted cycling training on changes in cycling
      ability of adolescents with spastic CP with marginal walking ability vs. 8-weeks of
      volitional cycling training and a nonintervention control group.

      Aim 3: To elucidate the mechanisms for potential improvements in cycling ability after
      8-weeks of FES-assisted or volitional cycling training of adolescents with spastic CP and
      marginal walking ability.
