    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with previously resected pancreatic
           adenocarcinoma treated with postoperative cisplatin, interferon alfa, fluorouracil, and
           concurrent radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the disease-specific, biochemical failure-free, and symptom/treatment-free
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive fluorouracil intravenous (IV) continuously and
           interferon alfa subcutaneously (SQ) 3 times per week (total of 17 doses) on days 1-19
           and 29-45 and cisplatin IV over 6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43. Patients also
           undergo concurrent radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week in weeks 1-3 and 5-7 (28
           fractions).

        -  Post-chemoradiotherapy fluorouracil: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on
           days 71-108 and 127-168.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
