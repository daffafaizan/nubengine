      I. To evaluate the response of non-small cell lung cancer to SAHA in the second line setting
      by applying RECIST criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the time to progression and overall survival in this patient population.

      II. To examine the toxicity profile of SAHA.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the molecular activity of SAHA by evaluating its effect on histone
      acetylation, upregulation of target genes, generation of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis
      and correlation with P53 status.

      II. To explore gene expression profiles that predict response to SAHA.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months
      for 1 year or until disease progression.
