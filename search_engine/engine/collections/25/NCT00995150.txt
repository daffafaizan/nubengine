    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter evaluation of the efficacy of a
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG20). The goals of the study include
      provision of information to understand efficacy and safety within the widest range of
      possible users of the LNG20. Typically, intrauterine contraceptive studies only include women
      18-35 years of age for efficacy and safety, and place limits on parity and larger body size.
      Women outside of these characteristics also desire an effective intrauterine contraceptive.
      Accordingly, this study will include women who are both nulliparous and parous as well as
      women less than 18 years of age in the primary efficacy and safety analyses
