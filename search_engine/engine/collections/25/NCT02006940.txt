      of distal airways, which is also called alveoscopy, allows for real-time minimally invasive
      intraacinar imaging. This method has been developed that special miniprobe can be passed into
      the distal airway via the working channel of the bronchoscope and provide so called "optical
      biopsy". The method is based on the natural autofluorescence of pulmonary structures,
      detecting the elastin scaffold of central and peripheral airways, the structure of alveoli,
      blood vessels and alveolar macrophages. Taking into account the fact that in vivo
      endomicroscopy of distal airways is a novel diagnostic technique it needs correlating the
      obtained data at certain disease with the reference methods for the challenges of our current
      understanding of interpreting endomicroscopic images. We choose high resolution computed
      tomography and morphology as such reference methods.
