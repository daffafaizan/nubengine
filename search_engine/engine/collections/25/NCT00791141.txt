      loco-regional recurrence frequently occurs. Efforts have been made to improve response rates
      and survival and different therapeutic regimens including concurrent chemo-radiotherapy or
      sequential chemo-radiotherapy have been developed.

      To further increase the outcome of patients with locally advanced SCCHN effective new
      treatments with minimal toxicities are needed. Molecular targeted agents, which do not
      demonstrate overlapping toxicities with commonly used chemotherapy agents, have therefore
      been investigated. The EGFR is widely expressed at high levels in SSCHN and is associated
      with poor prognosis.

      Cetuximab has already been investigated in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy in
      patients with head and neck cancer. The immunoradiotherapy was well tolerated with most of
      the side effects related to the high dose irradiation. The most common side effects are
      mucositis and dysphagia. Additionally, skin reactions appear sometimes more frequently in
      cetuximab administration. Grade 3 to 4 infusion reactions were observed in 3% of the patients
      treated with cetuximab. Based on the current promising results with RCT in patients with
      locally advanced head and neck cancer and clinical results with EGFR-antibodies plus RT, the
      present study was primarily designed to define the acute grade 3/4 toxicity.

      We expect to show effective results in reducing the risk of distant metastasis, with
      administration of an additional six month adjuvant cetuximab treatment, in patient with
      recurrent SCCHN.
