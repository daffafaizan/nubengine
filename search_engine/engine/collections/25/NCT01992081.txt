      hence it may be beneficial for patients to increase physical activity levels. This study will
      test two instruments to measure physical activity: A questionnaire (completed on a personal
      digital assistant) and a physical activity monitor which patient wear during the day.
      Patients will be randomized to either receive the Telecoaching program in addition to usual
      care or only the usual care. The study will involve 4 clinic visits as well as some phone
      calls over duration of 6 months.
