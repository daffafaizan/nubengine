        -  To identify and characterize single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in non-small cell lung
           cancer (NSCLC) specimens.

        -  To identify and characterize structural variations in the genomes of NSCLC specimens.

        -  To identify and characterize other genomic alterations including, but not limited to,
           expression profiling and methylation.

      OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from archived specimens are analyzed for single nucleotide
      variations, structural variations in the genomes, and other genomic alterations including,
      but not limited to, gene expression profiling and methylation. Clinical data related to
      disease, treatment, and recurrence from each patient sample is also collected.
