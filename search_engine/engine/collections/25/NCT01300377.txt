      or a mixture of the two for local anesthetic treatment (in addition to general anesthesia).
      The choice of local anesthetic to be used during surgery is based primarily on the
      differences in time for the anesthetic to take effect and duration thereafter. Lidocaine
      typically works in less than 1 minute and lasts approximately 45 minutes. Bupivacaine works
      within 2 to 3 minutes and lasts 4 to 6 hours. Lidocaine is often preferable due to its
      shorter time of effectiveness. However, its relatively short duration may translate into a
      higher use of narcotics for pain management during postoperative care - particularly within
      the first hour following emergence from general anesthesia. Therefore it is conceivable that
      these patients would have higher levels of pain, higher cost of care related to cost of
      narcotics, and higher cost of caregiver time required to administer them.
