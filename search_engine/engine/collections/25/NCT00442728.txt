      ventilation were expected. They were divided into intervention (n=7) and control (n=14)
      groups. For the intervention group, an intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation was
      applied daily for 30 minutes on the right thigh whereas the left thigh was used as a control.
      Heart rate, respiration rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation
      were monitored before, during and after the electrostimulation. Perimeter of the right and
      left thighs was measured in both groups every 3 days at 5 cm above the upper edge of the
      kneecap.
