    
      Objectives: To examine if dry needling in combination with active physiotherapy is more
      effective in reducing pain and increase activity of daily living, range of motion and muscle
      strength in patients with chronic low back pain compared to sham dry needling in combination
      with active physiotherapy.

      Methods: the study will include individuals with non-specific LBP over 3 months.

      Subjects will be divided randomly into two research groups, both will receive physiotherapy
      including mobility, strengthening and stretching exercises. Intervention group, additionally
      to exercises, will receive dry needling to the Gluteus Medius muscle by inserting a needle to
      a trigger point until a visible involuntary twitch in the muscle appears. Sham needling will
      be applied by needling with pre-cut and smoothed needles that will not penetrate the skin.

      Both groups will receive two treatments per week and up to six treatments overall, evaluation
      will be performed before and after the series of treatments.
