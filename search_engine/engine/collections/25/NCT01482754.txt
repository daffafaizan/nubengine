      infusion rate of 50mg/hr for the first 30 minutes. If tolerated well, subsequent increments
      will step up to 50mg/hr every 30 minutes to a maximum dose of 400mg/hr. For second and
      subsequent infusions, the infusion rate commences at 100mg/hr with 30 minute increments of
      100mg/hr to a maximum dose of 400mg/hr. The first and subsequent infusion generally completes
      between 5-6 and 3-4 hours respectively.

      Lengthy infusions translate into higher costs and longer waiting times for patients due to
      scant resources. Therefore, there is growing interest globally in shortening the overall
      infusion times to either 90 or 60-minutes. A recent systematic review evaluating safety of
      rapid Rituximab infusion has confirmed that Rituximab at 90-minutes is safe for NHL patients.
      However 60-minute infusion was not recommended for neither NHL nor chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) patients due to lack of evidence.

      Although the rapid Rituximab infusion at 90-minute has been tested among Singapore population
      in National Cancer Centre, it was not being evaluated among the cohort of patients who
      received treatment in National University Hospital Singapore. As rapid Rituximab infusion
      remain off label use, this research study intend to evaluate the safety of rapid Rituximab
      infusion at 90-minute among NHL patients.

      The selected doses will be 375mg/m2 as recommended and approved by FDA.
