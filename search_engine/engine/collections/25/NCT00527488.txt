      degarelix to treat BPH with only a short transient lowering of the serum testosterone
      concentration to or below the castration level defined as 0.5 ng/mL. Two doses and two dosing
      regimens (32 and 64 mg administered either as a single administration or as two
      administrations separated by 14 days) will be evaluated for 42 days.
