      neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is a serious condition
      and the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The available therapies for treating wet
      AMD require life-long intravitreal (IVT) injections every 4-12 weeks to maintain efficacy. A
      one-time IVT administration of ADVM-022 has the potential to treat wet AMD by providing
      durable expression of therapeutic levels of intraocular anti-VEGF protein (aflibercept) and
      maintaining the vision of patients. ADVM-022 is designed to reduce the current treatment
      burden which often results in undertreatment and vision loss in patients with wet AMD
      receiving anti-VEGF therapy in clinical practice.

      ADVM-022-07 is an observational long-term extension (OPTIC-EXT) study assessing safety and
      efficacy of ADVM-022 gene therapy product, in subjects with neovascular, or exudative (wet),
      age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).

      To evaluate potential long-term outcomes of ADVM-022, the OPTIC-EXT will follow subjects
      previously treated in the OPTIC parent study (Clinical Protocol No. ADVM-022-01 [OPTIC]
      (NCT03748784)). Subjects will roll over from the OPTIC parent study and will be followed for
      3 additional years, following completion of the preceding 2-year assessment period in the
      OPTIC parent study. There is no investigational treatment administered in this study.
