      and economic level. Finding an efficient cure is paramount in order to reduce its severity
      and mortality. Several medications are currently under investigation. Among them,
      hydroxychloroquine can prevent viral replication at several sites and has been shown
      efficient in vitro. Several clinical trials are in progress to evaluate its efficiency in
      vivo. However, no study so far has evaluated the covid-19 infection in patients with SLE.

      Objectives and methods: The primary objective was to describe the prevalence and the severity
      of Covid-19 infection in patients wih systemic lupus erythematosus. The secondary objective
      was to compare these parameters in patients treated by hydroxychloroquine and those not
      treated by hydroxychloroquine. This observational study of a historical-prospective cohort
      focuses on all adult lupus patients seen during the last year in the departments of
      rheumatology and nephrology in CHU Montpellier. It will collect information concerning the
      patient's condition, treatments and main comorbidities (cardio-vascular, respiratory, hepatic
      and immune depression), as well as symptoms suggesting covid-19 infection, its confirmation
      and its course and severity.
