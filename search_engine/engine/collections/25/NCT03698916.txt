      is being used in the treatment of patients with primary OA of the knees. This transdermal
      celecoxib preparation is currently in use in multiple rheumatology clinics in southern
      Ontario, Canada. Only patients that have been prescribed the celecoxib cream will be
      approached for screening and subsequent study participation. The study is purely
      observational as the protocol does not dictate treatment or dose assignment. Subjects will be
      followed for 12 weeks. In addition to the baseline clinic visit, they will participate in 2
      telephone calls where data will be collected on outcome assessments that measure disease
      severity. The data collected during those visits will be compared to baseline values of the
      same assessments.
