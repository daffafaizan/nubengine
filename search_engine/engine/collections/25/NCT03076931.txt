      (narrowing of the airway below the vocal folds) develop a voice disorder. Voice disorders
      lead to psychosocial problems that affect many of these children over their lifetime,
      specifically their career choices and their long-term quality of life. Our current
      understanding of voice problems following surgical airway reconstruction is limited. There is
      a lack of research to understand the alterations of the phonatory mechanisms due to the
      underlying initial condition (stenosis) and the surgical airway reconstruction performed. The
      purpose of this proposal is to develop and test imaging biomarkers to support diagnosis and
      surgical decision-making leading to improved voice outcome. The overarching goal of this work
      is to establish a foundation upon which surgical practice could be enhanced to improve voice
      outcome while still achieving optimal airway results. Specifically, the project will use: a
      prospective pre- and post-surgery cohort design to develop an imaging biomarker of "vibratory
      potential" for predicting the vibratory outcome after airway reconstruction. Quantitative
      image processing methodology will be used for the development and validation of the new
      imaging biomarkers, based on high-speed videoendoscopy. This research project will address a
      substantial gap of knowledge in pediatric voice and airway surgery, and has the potential to
      significantly improve the quality of life of these patients who have some of the most severe
      and difficult to manage voice disorders. The results could be translated to adult patient
      populations and other voice disorders (e.g. development of disease-specific imaging
      biomarkers).
