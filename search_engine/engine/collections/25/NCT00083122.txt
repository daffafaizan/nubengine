      I. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival in patients with advanced
      ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with cisplatin and flavopiridol.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are accrued to two separate groups (Group 2
      closed to accrual as of 3/10/06) .

      GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and flavopiridol IV over 24 hours on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP 2 (Closed to accrual as of 3/10/06): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and
      flavopiridol IV over 24 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.
