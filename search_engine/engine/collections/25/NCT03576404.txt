    
      Patients were assessed at baseline for baseline characteristics, dialysis-related factors,
      and medications records

        1. Pharmacists conducted brief monthly interview for patients to assess the medications
           they are receiving

        2. A comprehensive interview for patients occurred at month 3 and 5 including concepts of
           MTM and MI

        3. MTM included a review of each participant's medications and personal medication record
           to identify the use of any over-the-counter medications, design of their
           medication-related action plan, formulation of specific therapeutic interventions, and
           referrals for discussion with their physician and subsequent documentation and
           follow-up. The therapeutic interventions accepted by the physician were further
           discussed with each patient/caregiver using the MI technique to encourage adherence and
           this discussion was documented in each patient's medication record.

        4. MI incorporated the main components reported in the literature: rolling with resistance;
           expressing empathy; avoiding argumentative behavior; highlighting the discrepancy
           between patients' current attitudes compared with the desired therapeutic goals; and
           empowering patients' self-efficacy
