      To determine the cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation amplitude thresholds at which an
      erection, as indicated by persistent increases in intracavernosal pressure, occurs for
      various stimuli of fixed frequency and fixed pulse-width.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective pilot study used to determine a threshold range of cavernosal nerve
      electrical stimulation parameters that result in penile erection. Assignment to the order of
      stimulation paradigms will be randomized. No placebos are used. No blinding is used.
