    
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a relatively new radiation technique in which a
      few very high doses of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors. It has been
      used effectively in other cancers like lung and liver. The goal is to deliver a radiation
      dose that is high enough to kill the cancer while limiting radiation to surrounding healthy
      organs. The daily dose of radiation is 2-3 times greater than conventional radiotherapy, but
      it is given for only 5 days over a 2 week period. Conventional radiotherapy is given over 6-7
      weeks. The chemotherapy drug, cisplatin is used as a radiation sensitizer and will be given
      before each of the 5 radiation treatments.
