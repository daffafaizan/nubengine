      and septic complications after bariatric surgery.

      A prospective, observational study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was performed. We
      evaluated preoperative comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors, and the appearance of
      postoperative complications up to 90 days after surgery.

      Evaluated cardiovascular risk factors include age, the presence of tobacco habit,
      preoperative diagnosis of T2D, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiopathies (including
      arrhythmias, ischemic cardiopathy or congestive cardiac failure), strokes, Charlson index and
      analytical parameters of the lipid (triglycerids, total cholesterol and the subfractions High
      Density Lipoproteins (HDL-cholesterol) and Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL-cholesterol) and
      glycemic profile (fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin). Cardiovascular risk factors, such
      as the Framingham risk score, were analyzed.

      Primary outcomes were the appearance of medical and septic postoperative complications.
      Medical complications include cardiovascular complications (new onset or impairment of acute
      heart infarction, arrhythmias, cardiac failure or stroke), respiratory complications
      (pneumonia or respiratory failure) and acute renal failure. Septic complications include,
      urinary tract infections, incisional or organ/space surgical site infection (SSI), pneumonia
      or bacteriemia of other origin.
