    
      The APT Webstudy will use web-based cognitive testing and questionnaires to generate a risk
      score which will be used to identify individuals who may be at an increased risk for
      developing AD dementia.

      Individuals who join the APT Webstudy will register at https://www.aptwebstudy.org/, sign an
      electronic informed consent form (ICF), provide basic demographic information and participate
      in web-based cognitive testing. Participants will return the APT Webstudy quarterly (every 3
      months) to complete the cognitive testing again.

      Based on the risk score and changes identified in the cognitive testing results, participants
      will be invited to visit a partnering clinical trial site for an in-person visit with
      biomarker testing and clinical assessment.

      The combined results of the web-based assessments, with the biomarker and clinical
      assessments, will allow an adaptive statistical algorithm to improve the selection of those
      at highest risk for developing AD.
