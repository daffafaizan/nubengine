    
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized, single-center, dose-escalation study which
      utilizes tolfenamic acid in combination with gemcitabine and radiation in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic malignancies which require definitive or palliative
      radiation.

      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to have a variety of anti-neoplastic
      mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth, promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of
      angiogenesis. Tolfenamic acid is an oral (NSAID) migraine medication which has demonstrated
      anti-tumor activity in preclinical pancreatic models when used with Gem/XRT (gemcitabine and
      radiation therapy) and as a single agent.

      Each patient enrolled will receive tolfenamic acid in combination with Gem/XRT. Depending on
      cohort assignment, patients will self-administer tolfenamic acid at either 200mg, 400mg,
      600mg or 800mg three times per day. Gemcitabine will be administered intravenously at 400
      mg/m2, every seven days for a maximum of 5 doses, starting with the second week of tolfenamic
      acid administration. Radiation will be given 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 5 Â½
      weeks for a maximum dose of 50.4 Gy, beginning with the second week of tolfenamic acid
      administration.

      A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the study. After
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tolfenamic acid has been determined, patients will be
      enrolled in an expansion cohort (at the MTD or the highest dose level achieved if the MTD is
      not reached) to further assess safety and the anti-tumor response to treatment with
      tolfenamic acid plus Gem/XRT.
