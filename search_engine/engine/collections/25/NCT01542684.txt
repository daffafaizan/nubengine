      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Days 1-4 of every cycle, you
      will receive azacitidine by vein over 15-30 minutes.

      You may receive drugs to help prevent nausea and vomiting before you receive your dose of
      azacitidine.

      On Days 5-7 of every cycle, you will receive GM-CSF by vein over about 15 minutes or by
      injection.

      Each study cycle will be about 4-6 weeks, depending on the study doctor's decision.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time each week during every cycle, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      At any time, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to
      check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your follow-up visits will be per standard of care for the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Both azacitidine and GM-CSF are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of MDS. The study drug combination to treat MDS is
      considered investigational.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
