      18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET is usually a poor indication for NETs since these neoplasms
      tend to be metabolic inactive, and thus FDG-PET is only used for high grade more aggressive
      NETs . Only a combination of several biomarkers together can lead to NET description that
      allows treatment selection and to some extent prediction of treatment success.

      In this study the investigators wish to take advantage of the new hybrid PET-MR and use it to
      find new methods to characterize NETs. Only very few PET-MR studies have been performed with
      correlation to NETs and they showed the potential of this tool for tumor characterization .

      The investigators plan to integrate PET-MR with big data analysis methods to obtain an
      improved tool for staging, characterization and monitoring NETs.
