      clinically accepted biomarkers that may be used to inform disease progression rate in an
      individual with Parkinson disease (PD), and (2) no biomarkers exist to inform differential
      diagnosis of conditions that exhibit parkinsonian symptoms and signs. This 2-year study aims
      to develop a multi-modal neuroimaging biomarker that enables the prediction of disease
      progression rate in PD, and a biomarker that enables the differential diagnosis of PD,
      multiple systems atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls.

      This study consists of two parts; neuroimaging of a defined population of mid to late stage
      PD subjects currently followed at UT Southwestern Medical Center, and recruitment of new
      subjects with PD, MSA, and PSP who will be followed clinically over 2 years and who will
      undergo neuroimaging.

      Participants will be asked to undergo several types of neuroimaging which will be analyzed
      using machine learning techniques.

      At each study visit of the newly recruited cohorts, appropriate clinical scales will be
      performed based on their diagnosis and used to track and measure disease severity and
      progression.
