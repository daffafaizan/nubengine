      of the upper extremity. Usually it has favorable natural healing-tendency, but sometimes it
      is responsible for long-lasting disability. The pathogenesis of this disease has remained
      unclear, however it has been speculated that the role of inflammation is smaller than
      previously believed. Instead, anatomical and vascular factors may play a much greater role.
      The evidence for the operative treatment is lacking, and the conservative treatment is
      therefore preferred. The conservative treatment used to rely largely on corticosteroid
      injections to the extensor muscle insertions. However, it has been shown that
      corticosteroids, in fact, tend to increase the subjective pain in the long run. Several
      studies -- most of them unfortunately underpowered -- have been carried out to find an
      efficient conservative treatment to this disease, but none of them has turned out to be
      significantly better than others. During the last couple of years, platelet rich plasma (PRP)
      has been used as a treatment in several musculoskeletal diseases (e.g. fracture healing,
      cartilage regeneration, wound healing). PRP is a substance centrifuged from patient own
      blood. There are a couple of studies regarding the use of PRP in lateral epicondylitis. The
      results are mostly positive; however it has not been thoroughly shown that it would be more
      effective than patient's whole blood. The hypothesis of this study is that PRP is more
      effective in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis than whole blood or saline vehicle
      injection. The primary outcome measures are pain (VAS) and the Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand -score (DASH).
