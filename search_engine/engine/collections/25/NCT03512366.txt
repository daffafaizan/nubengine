      prostheses most often used in the inguinal area may in some cases create new clinical
      problems, such as foreign body sensation in the groin, discomfort, and abdominal wall
      stiffness, surgical site infections, migration of mesh and may affect procreation and sexual
      function, The cost and availability of mesh prostheses in smaller towns and underdeveloped
      regions proves to be a major hindrance. The requirement of the hour is to find a technique
      that is simple, cost effective, easy to perform, does not require extensive dissection or use
      of a foreign body, and also gives an acceptable recurrence rate without any major intra or
      post-operative complications and can be performed as a day care procedure to reduce the
      burden of cases in our community. A possible option for this is the Desarda method, presented
      in 2001, which uses an undetached strip of aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle instead
      of a mesh and has shown to have promising results in studies conducted so far. Several
      retrospective and randomized controlled trials have shown that local anaesthesia provides the
      best clinical and economic benefits to patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. As there
      have been no studies till date comparing the outcomes for patients operated by these methods
      under local anaesthesia only, hence this study has been planned to assess if Desarda's
      technique is suitable to be used as a day care procedure with early return to normal
      activities after surgery, less post operative discomfort and minimum dose of analgesics and
      acceptable recurrence rates. This will help reduce the burden of the hospitals as these
      patients can be operated on a day care basis with minimal discomfort.
