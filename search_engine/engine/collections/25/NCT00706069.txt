      studied in a phase [I]/[II], with favourable profile of toxicity in pretreated patients with
      anthracyclines and/or taxanes (Oncology News International vol 12, no 3, suppl 2, 2003).

      In a study of toxicity and effectiveness, Vanhopher reported objective response rates (PR) in
      21 from 45 patients (47%) and stabilization of disease (SD) in 16 patients (36%). Severe
      leucopenia (grade 4), was reported in 5% of patients (Borquez D, et al: Proc Am Soc Clin
      Oncol 19: Abstract 420, 2000)
