      validated fluoroquinolone class of drugs. Quarfloxin was rationally designed to target a
      G-quadruplex (QPLX) DNA structure and disrupt protein-DNA interactions essential to cancer
      cells. The QPLX targeted by quarfloxin forms within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the QPLX is
      bound by the nucleolin protein.
