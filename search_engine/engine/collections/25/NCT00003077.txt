        -  Determine whether omega-3 fatty acids will reverse weight loss in advanced cancer
           patients with cachexia.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of omega-3 fatty acids in these patients
           (phase I completed 12/1999).

        -  Determine whether omega-3 fatty acids will result in an antitumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, stratified, dose escalation study. Patients are stratified by
      the extent of weight loss (2-5 percent or greater than 5 percent in the past month).

      Patients receive omega-3 fatty acids orally in two equal doses with/after breakfast and lunch
      for 4 months or until weight loss is observed.

      Dose is escalated in cohorts of two patients, although dose escalation is allowed in
      individual patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level at
      which no greater than one-third of the patients treated, including escalated patients from a
      lower dose, experience grade 3 or worse toxicity (phase I completed 12/1999).
