      Neck Disability index, NDI, is just under 7, while "minimally clinical important difference"
      (MCID) is 7 points . That gives that 16 patients are needed in each group to get 80% power
      with a significance level of 5%. However, in the studied population the one year mortality
      rate is substantial, especially after a neck injury . In order to be able to draw conclusions
      from the study the investigators have elected to expand the study to 25 subjects in each
      group.

      Follow up: 1w, 6w, 3m, 1y with CT, Questionaires: NDI, EQ5D. Bone density measurement at
      injury. Extension flexion x-ray after 1 year.
