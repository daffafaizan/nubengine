           (NXTSC) for the treatment of infected wounds as the sole topical treatment of microbial
           infection at the wound site.

        2. Determine the effect on wound treatment outcomes using a novel antimicrobial wound gel
           for the treatment of infected wounds when this gel is used in conjunction with the
           current standard of care infection controls to treat microbial infection at the wound
           site.

        3. Determine the effect on wound treatment outcomes using standard of care treatment.
           (SOC).
