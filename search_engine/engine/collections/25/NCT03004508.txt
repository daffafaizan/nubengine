    
      The study will be a randomised clinical trial comparing subjects receiving twice-daily doses
      of either 120-mg of Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extract (IDN 5933) or placebo for a 6 months
      period.

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  DNA Damage assessed with the Comet assay as proportion of DNA in the tail.

        -  Micronucleus frequency (MN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (Frequency per 1000
           binucleated cells).

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Complete clinical assessment at the beginning and at the end of the study.

        -  Occurrence of Adverse drug reactions in individuals treated with GBE or placebo.

        -  Liver functions will be monitored according to biological laboratory examinations and
           clinical symptoms. A subgroup of individuals will be monitored also for genetic
           parameters concerning expression patterns of genes putatively associated to early events
           of HCC carcinogenesis Clinical and biological parameters will be measured in the study
           groups at the beginning (T0) and at the end of the study (T2).
