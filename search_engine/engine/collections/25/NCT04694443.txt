      will be compared to age, gender-matched PD patients receiving the best standard in-office
      clinical management (control group). Both groups will be followed for 8 months.

      The main outcome will be the comparison of incidence of falls between the study and control
      groups. Secondary outcomes will include the analysis of cost-effectiveness of
      multidisciplinary tele-health interventions.

      The results of this study will allow us to study the feasibility of remote health care to
      prevent falls in patients with PD, allowing equity in the distribution and access to
      specialized health care.
