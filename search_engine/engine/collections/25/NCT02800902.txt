      body by specifically inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; which is a
      rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Rosuvastatin (RSV) and atorvastatin (ATV)
      have shown to have bone stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.. The present study aims to
      explore the efficacy of 1.2% RSV and 1.2% ATV gel as a local drug delivery and redelivery
      system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of degree II
      furcation defects.

      Methods: Ninety patients with mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were randomly
      allocated into three treatment groups: SRP plus placebo gel (group 1), SRP plus 1.2% RSV gel
      (group 2) and 1.2% ATV gel (group3). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at
      baseline then after 6 months. The gels were redelivered at the respective sites at this 6
      month appointment. Then again all clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded after 3
      months. (9 months from baseline)
