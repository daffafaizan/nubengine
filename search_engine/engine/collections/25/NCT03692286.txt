      can be very distressing to both the patient and the operator. Patients might even consider
      postoperative pain and flare-up as a benchmark against which the clinician's skills are
      measured. Prevalence of postoperative pain or flare-up is, therefore, one of the influencing
      factors when making a clinical decision. Better management of postoperative pain increases
      the patients' confidence in dentist's skills and gives positive attitude toward dental
      profession. In cases with necrotic pulp, the incidence of pain becomes higher, hence testing
      which intracanal medication is more effective in decreasing the bacteria present within the
      root canal and subsequently pain is crucial.
