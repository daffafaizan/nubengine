      Therapy-Defibrillation (CRT-D) or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Pacing (CRT-P) vs Pacing
      Therapy AAI. Randomization will be stratified by indication. Optimal pharmacological therapy
      in both treatment arms. Length of follow-up for each subject will be 2y, since all subjects
      will be followed to a common study termination date.
