      widely indefinite, and this could compromise treatment choices and efficacy. In addition to
      dystonia and rigidity, proprioceptive and sensorimotor disintegration as well as peripheral
      degenerative processes (myopathy, skeletal and soft tissue changes) have been proposed as
      causative factors of abnormal trunk postures.

      When the body is educated in the Elispheric® movement it relearns the original vertebral
      motion, and postural control necessary for any action by the body, the professional can then
      perform effective vertebral reeducation.

      The Elispheric® movements are created by a motorised plate. This unique technology impulses
      the body through a centrifugal force in three planes. This force trains the body in its
      natural spirals.

      The performance result is based on the fact that Imoove restores the all freedom of movement,
      strength, precision and it works on the basic skeletal posture.

      It is an exploratory study, in order to verify if the project is adequate, to establish its
      feasibility and to obtain information that allows to determine the size of the sample of the
      definitive study, 30 consecutive PD outpatients will be recruited for the IMOOVE® treatment.
