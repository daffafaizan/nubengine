      point as possible (immediate after randomization) for the purpose of ischemic
      preconditioning. We have recently conducted preclinical studies on the effects of ischemic
      preconditioning on the MSC functions. We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after
      culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to
      FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of
      MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell
      death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity.
