      parturient patients at risk undergoing cesarean section, in relation to type of anesthesia
      used, general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia, in order to evaluate the safety of type of
      anesthesia used for this kind of patient.

      It is very important to assess and predict risk in the cardiovascular system in such cases. A
      number of cardiac indexes for predicting risk have been developed like Goldman Multifactorial
      risk index, Eagle's risk index and Detsky's cardiac index. It is recommended to evaluate
      patients using these indexes and to institute preoperative medical treatment based on the
      results. These clinical scoring systems, although simple to use, are somewhat inconvenient
      and have limitations in their predictive value, whereas other cardiac investigations such as
      exercise or pharmacologic stress imaging are sensitive, but limited in practice by time and
      resources. Recently brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was spotlighted as a predictor for
      diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of various heart diseases. BNP is a cardiac hormone
      that is synthesized by ventricular myocytes in response to ventricular dysfunction. Recent
      studies have demonstrated that elevated serum BNP levels predict first cardiovascular event
      and death in the general population. In addition, it has been reported that BNP measured
      before major surgery can be used as a predictor of postoperative cardiac complications.
