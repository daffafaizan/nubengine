      the safety of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), when MB is treated according to the
      Murray law with a Proximal Optimization Technique (POT), remains unclear.

      The KISS study will evaluate the non-inferiority of no side branch intervention versus side
      branch ballooning, in the setting of single stenting with systematic proximal optimization
      technique.
