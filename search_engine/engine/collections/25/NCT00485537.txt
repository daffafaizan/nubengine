      agonist protocol (Group 2) in ICSI cycles. The trial was conducted between September 2005 and
      December 2006. The mean age in both groups was 32 (range 22-40). The main outcome measures
      were the number of oocytes retrieved, injected and fertilized, embryos transferred, and
      clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates.
