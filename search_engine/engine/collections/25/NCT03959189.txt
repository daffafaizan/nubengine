      relationship between dose, safety, tolerability, exposure and clinical benefit. This is a
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment period crossover
      study in two cohorts of participants with DM1.

      Participants who have consented and meet eligibility criteria will receive two treatments,
      placebo and ERX-963, in a randomized crossover fashion with a washout period between the
      treatments. On treatment days, participants will receive treatment followed by repeated blood
      collection for pharmacokinetic analysis and administration of a battery of outcome measures
      relevant to sleep and cognition.
