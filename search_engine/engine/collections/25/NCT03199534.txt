      number of female pelvic syndromes including childhood elimination disorders, idiopathic
      urinary retention, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, constipation, sport injuries,
      postoperative and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Following appropriate patient
      education about pelvic floor function, mainstays of therapy for high-tone pelvic floor
      dysfunction pelvic pain include pharmacotherapeutic agents and pelvic floor physical therapy.
      The investigators hypothesize that chemodenervation with Botulinum toxin A will offer a safe,
      efficacious intervention for women with high tone pelvic floor dysfunction that cannot be
      adequately treated with pelvic floor physical therapy alone.
