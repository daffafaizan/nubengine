      Metformin.

      Alogliptin: The investigators will start with 25 mg QD and the dose will be maintained.

      Metformin: The investigators will start with 250 mg QD and the dose will be slowly increased
      to 750 mg TID. The dose increase is possible up to its maximum, 2250 mg, so that HbA1c is
      maintained below 6.9%. However, increase in dose with elder patients requires careful
      consideration.

      Participants taking part in this study will receive dietary and exercise coaching.
      Participation in this study is expected to last up to 2 years.

      Patients will terminate from the trial when their HbA1c exceeds 8.4% for more than three
      months.

      The investigators will evaluate beta cell function by conducting 75 g OGTT before, a year
      after, and two years after the beginning of the trial. Alogliptin or Metformin will be
      stopped three days before the OGTT. The investigators will make sure that urine ketone is
      negative before an oral glucose load.
