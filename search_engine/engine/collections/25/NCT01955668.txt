    
      In this first time in patient study, AZD6738 will be administered to patients with
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) or B
      cell lymphomas, primarily to determine the safety and tolerability of AZD6738.
      Pharmacokinetics of AZD6738 and potential biological activity will also be investigated.

      An oral formulation of AZD6738 will be used. The starting dose of 20 mg twice daily (BD) will
      be escalated to reach a maximum tolerated dose in patients as defined by dose-limiting
      toxicity. A '3 week on, 1 week off' schedule, as deemed optimal in modelling of data from
      non-clinical studies, will be used initially.

      Following the dose escalation phase of the study, additional patients with prospectively
      identified 11q-deleted or ATM deficient relapsed/refractory CLL will be enrolled to a dose
      expansion phase to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological
      activity at selected dose(s)/schedule(s).
