      questionnaire in primary care physician offices in the city of Merzig, Germany. We will
      recruit all people (age>18y) with a body-mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 plus patients in the two
      following participating physician offices: Praxisnetz and Merzig. Cardiovascular risk will be
      assessed using the PROCAM (Munster Heart Study), ESC (European Society of Cardiology) and
      Framingham risk scores. Psycho-social factors will be recorded according to the methodology
      of the INTERHEART study.
