      General information of the patient in form of duration of symptoms and duration of
      diagnosis,exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Imaging findings such as main pancreatic duct
      stone,size,parenchymal calcification , ductal stricture and its location, using any
      medications such as antioxidants and pain killers .

      The pain score will be estimated by Izbicki's pain score in last 6 months. Patients will
      receive standard of care during study period, and they won't receive any experimental
      therapy.

      After 6months of ESWL further general information of the patient any addictions, a formal
      imaging and determining main pancreatic duct stone ,size ,calcifications and strictures and
      also usage of any medications for decreasing pain.

      Pain will be calculated by Izbick's pain score in last 6 months . Comparing pain score and
      information investigators will evaluate predictive factors of pain relief after ESWL by
      logistic regression.
