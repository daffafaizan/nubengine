      I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote perioperative monitoring in solid
      tumor cancer patients scheduled for gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), gynecological
      (GYN) cancer surgery.

      II. To explore patterns, trajectory, and changes in physiologic health parameter outcomes
      (weight, temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps) and
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (symptoms, quality of life [QOL]) from pre-surgery to the
      post-discharge period.

      III. To explore the relationship between changes in physiologic health parameter
      outcomes/PROs and surgical outcomes (postoperative complications, readmissions).

      IV. To explore changes in physiologic health parameters and PROs by open surgery versus
      minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo remote perioperative telemonitoring with home monitoring devices activity
      monitor beginning 7 days before surgery and up to 30 days after hospital discharge.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 months.
