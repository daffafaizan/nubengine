      perceived dyspnoea in patients suffering from moderate-to severe COPD. Secondary aims are to
      investigate the effects of the above treatments on quality of life, exercise capacity,
      pulmonary lung function.

      Thirty consecutive patients, admitted to Auxilium Vitae Rehabilitation Centre for intensive
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme, suffering from moderate-to-severe COPD, will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups with different treatments (n=15
      group 1: experimental subjects - PR+Acu-TENS and n=15 group 2: control subjects - PR only) by
      sequential block randomization.

      An intensive inpatient PR programme will be applied to all participants. The programme will
      include the optimisation of drug therapy and daily sessions of:

        1. Supervised incremental exercises on a treadmill, a cycle,and an arm ergometer according
           to the protocol suggested by Maltais et al. until the achievement of 30 min of
           continuous exercise at an intensity that elicited dyspnoea at level 5 on a modified Borg
           scale starting from a workload corresponding to 50% of maximal workload achieved during
           an initial incremental test;

        2. Abdominal, upper- and lower-limb muscle activities involving lifting of progressively
           increasing light weight and shoulder and full-arm circling;

        3. Education;

        4. Nutritional programs and psychosocial counselling, when appropriate. A multidisciplinary
           team of chest physicians, nurses, physical therapists, a dietician, and a psychologist
           offered care.
