      practice. However, there is a lack of effective means of prevention and treatment.The
      investigators previously found that ischemic preconditioning, IPC, and dexmedetomidine has
      protective effects on intestinal mucosal injury.

      However, the combined effect of various factors has not been clinically validated. To explore
      the effect of comprehensive intestinal protection strategy on postoperative intestinal
      complications in patients undergoing laparotomy with general anesthesia,the investigators
      select the patients undergoing open surgery under general anesthesia as the study subjects
      and the concentration of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as well as the
      incidence of digestive system complications in one week after operation are the main
      observation indexes.
