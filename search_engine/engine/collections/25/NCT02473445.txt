    
      Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but
      are not limited to the following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy;
      myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic
      acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS); Kearn-Sayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing
      encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome); polymerase gamma (POLG)-related disorders
      (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia,
      Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy
      Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLG-Related Ataxia
      Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
      (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome or
      polyneuropathy-ophthalmoplegia-leukoencephalopathy- Intestinal pseudoobstruction (POLIP)
      syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and other syndromes due to multiple
      mitochondrial DNA deletions.

      Patients completing study RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866) are eligible for enrollment into the
      extension study RP103-MITO-002 if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled.
      Subjects continue on the last total daily dose of cysteamine bitartrate delayed-release
      capsules taken during RP103-MITO-001. Dose-adjustments are permitted.
