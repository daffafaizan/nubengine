    
      Secondary objectives:

        -  to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.

        -  to compare the PK of HM10460A in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

        -  to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and absolute
           neutrophil count (ANC).

        -  to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and CD34+ cell
           counts in the blood.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity potential of HM10460A by measuring binding antibodies (bAb)
           and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to HM10460A and native G-CSF following a single
           subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.
