      initial diagnosis or re-staging at the time of treatment failure. The updated study shows 11C
      -labeled choline derivatives seem to be the most promising PET radionuclides in assessment of
      prostate cancer and USA FDA approves the utility of C-11 Choline in prostate cancer patients
      in 2012 September.

      To our best literature search, there are only few preliminary studies regarding application
      of PET/MR in prostate cancer patients and the initial results in correlation of functional
      MRI and PET images seems promising. Combined PET/MRI images have the advantage of giving
      anatomical, functional, and metabolic information in a single image setting and provide a
      comprehensive survey including local regional extension and systemic metastasis. Unlike in
      the USA where more than 70% prostate cancer patients were diagnosed at early stage, most
      prostate cancer patients in Taiwan were diagnosed at advanced stage with high PSA or T3-4
      disease, or even systemic metastasis. The need to implement good staging modality is even
      more urgently needed in Taiwan than in USA and related studies are still lacking. In the
      current study, our hypothesis is that C-11 Choline PET/MRI is a good modality in staging high
      risk prostate cancer patients, and in predicting patients' outcome after treatment. Our
      hypothesis will be examined by this clinical study.
