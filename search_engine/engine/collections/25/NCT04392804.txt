      that, the next appointment will be scheduled. On the next appointment, each patient included
      in this study will undergo ultrasound cleaning and receive guidance for adequate everyday
      oral hygiene. The next appointment, after 10 days will be scaling and root planing for
      selected periodontal pockets. Because it is painful treatment, anesthesia is needed to be
      administrated. Patients will be split into three groups by picking cards, for receiving
      different doses of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine ORABLOC® (40 mg/ml Articaine +
      0.01 mg/ml Epinephrine, PIERREL S.P.A, Capua, Italy) in each group. Doses will be 0.1 ml, 0.2
      ml, and 0.3 ml of 4% articaine with epinephrine for one appointment scaling and root planing.
      Anesthesia will be obtained by CCLADS device Anaject® (Septodont, Sallanches, Franc). The
      Intraseptal anesthesia (ISA) will be the method of administrating the anesthesia. Parameters
      of the device will be a mode with constant pressure, injection speed - mode LOW 0.005 ml/s.
      Time for application will depend on the dose, and it will be 20 s for 0.1 ml, 40 s for 0.2
      ml, and 60 s for 0.3 ml.

      Parameters of local anesthesia will be recorded by the pin-prick test. The pain will be rated
      by the visual-analogue scale (VAS). The pain will be rated immediately upon termination of
      the local anesthetic delivery and during the scaling and root planing.

      Patients will be followed up the next day for local side effects and their need for analgesic
      medication.
