      gut microbial diversity is positively correlated with health status. Recent evidence confirms
      the role of gut dysbiosis in cardiovascular disease. Americans consume 50% more salt than the
      amount recommended by the Dietary Guidelines and 130% more than recommended by the American
      Heart Association. Excess salt intake is considered a modifiable risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. Changes in the gut microbiota composition followed by immune system
      activation is reported with high salt intake in animals. In particular, abundance of
      proinflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells increases with excess salt consumption. In contrast,
      T regulatory (Treg) cells oppose Th17 cell action and may aid in reducing inflammation
      associated with high salt intake, a hypothesis that has not yet been tested in humans. Only
      one preliminary study assessed changes in gut bacterial composition with high salt intake in
      humans, when only men were recruited. The study also found an increase in Th17 cell
      abundance. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of high salt
      intake on the gut microbiota diversity and Th17 and Treg cell abundance in men and women.
