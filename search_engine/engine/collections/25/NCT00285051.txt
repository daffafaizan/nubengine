      vomitting in patients being treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and the patients
      will continue use for 3 days afterward. Patients will be given rescue medication and will
      fill out VAS scales for nausea, pain, appetite and dizziness. Patients will be treated for 2
      cycles, one cycle receiving active drug (one of 2 doses) and the other placebo. Patients
      receiving placebo will receive ondansetron injection before chemo and patients receiving
      active drug will receive a normal saline injection. Patients will take the drug 4 times daily
      for 3 days. The patients will return to clinic for a visit after 24-48 hours and 4 days.
      Patients will bring a urine sample to measure metabolite. Patients will be given a diary to
      monitor dosing and side effects as well as concomitant medication. The study will be
      conducted in 2 - 3 centers. There will be 108 patients enrolled with 27 in each of 4 groups:

      Group 1 cycle 1 - Placebo cycle 2 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 2 cycle 1 - Placebo
      cycle 2 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 3 cycle 1 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per
      doseGroup cycle 2 - Placebo Group 4 cycle 1 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose cycle 2 -
      placebo
