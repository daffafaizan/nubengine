    
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent disease with a significant morbidity and mortality.
      The estimated annual incidence is 1.45 per 1,000 patients, which translates to 1,350,000
      cases per year in the United States. It is estimated that PE results in more than 200,000
      deaths per year.

      Currently there are two types of commercially available IVC filters utilized to prevent PE;
      permanent and retrievable. Both types of filters have documented limitations, such as
      tilting, migration, fracture, embolization and late deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Retrievable
      filters were developed to avert some of the late consequences of permanent filter, but in
      practice there is low success with eventual removal. In a series of 37 clinical studies, with
      a total of 6,834 patients the mean retrieval rate was 34%.

      There are numerous design features of the SENTRY IVC Filter that are intended to improve on
      the limitations of available IVC filters and obviate the need for retrieval.
