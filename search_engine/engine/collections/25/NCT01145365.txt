      prior to medical therapy is controversial. Several retrospective studies have suggested a
      benefit to this approach. (1, 2) However, there have been no prospective studies performed to
      answer this important question. This study aims to definitively answer this question. Our
      hypothesis is that by establishing surgical drainage of all perianal fistulas and abscesses
      prior to initiation of medical therapy, further abscess formation will be prevented and the
      rate of durable fistula healing will improve.
