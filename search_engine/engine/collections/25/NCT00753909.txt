      patients with advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provided a survival
      benefit. There are patients with NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed
      after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy. The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such
      patients is justified. The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, administered every two
      weeks, has a favorable toxicity profile. This study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab
      to a biweekly regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin as 2nd or 3rd line therapy for NSCLC
