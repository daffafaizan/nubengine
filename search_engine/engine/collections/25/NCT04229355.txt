      HCC are diagnosed as advanced stage or unresectable disease because of the lack of signs and
      symptoms. Despite significant research efforts, only a few effective treatment approaches
      have been developed for HCC. Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is widely
      used as a palliative treatment for inoperable HCC. TACE based on drug-eluting beads
      (DEB-TACE) has recently been introduced into the clinic. This technique relies on drug-loaded
      microspheres to embolize and release antitumor medication gradually and locally in order to
      maximize local ischemia and tumor necrosis. Nowadays, many RCTs and meta-analyses found
      DEB-TACE is associated with higher overall survival than cTACE for unresectable HCC. However,
      the long-term survival is still low after DEB-TACE treatment. In recent years, targeted drugs
      (such as sorafenib, lenvatinib) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) have exhibited
      potential therapeutic effects for advanced HCC. Lenvatinib is non-inferior to sorafenib in
      overall survival in untreated advanced HCC. Combining targeted drugs or immunotherapies with
      conventional therapeutic approaches may provide synergistic effects and facilitate the
      development of personalized medicine. However, it is still unknown which is the best
      combining treatment. Therefore, this prospective study aims to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of DEB-TACE plus sorafenib or lenvatinib or PD-1 Inhibitor for unresectable HCC.
