    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in
      dialysis patients. Patients on hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) who have been
      treated with an erythropoietin analogue or have an indication for treatment with an
      erythropoietin analogue will be evaluated for eligibility and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      treatment with roxadustat (with discontinuation of prior erythropoietin analogue therapy) or
      to an active-control group treated with epoetin alfa
