      formation and to support obliteration of the dead space in the axillary carry out. The
      hypothesis made in this protocol is that axillary clearance by using an operation technique
      including the use of the precise LigaSure instrument and closure of dead space can be done
      without using a postoperative drain.

      The AND PRECISE PROTOCOL aims at providing first evidence that axillary clearance by using an
      operation technique including the precise LigaSure instrument and closure of dead space of
      the axilla will result in an operation were a drain is not necessary and the need for seroma
      evacuation after surgery is very limited Patients undergoing axillary clearance necessary for
      achieving reasonable control in invasive breast cancer and participating in the AND PRECISE
      protocol will undergo the operation by using a technique including the use of the precise
      LigaSure instrument and closure of dead space. Postoperatively, the numbers of seroma
      punctions and the amount of seroma will be recorded prospectively. Patients will be asked to
      record on a daily basis their experience of pain by a visual analog scale of pain.

      The main study parameter is the percent of cases which successfully did not need seroma
      punctions after the intervention.

      Potential disadvantages for the patient are risk for more seroma formation and discomfort.
      Patients will be asked to record on a daily basis their experience of pain by a visual analog
      scale of pain.
