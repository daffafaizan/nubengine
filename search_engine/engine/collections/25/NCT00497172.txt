    
      This is a multicenter (11 centers), prospective, randomized single blind study. This study
      has a 2-arm design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Sirolimus-eluting stent
      CYPHERTM and/or updated version to the bare metal Bx SONICTM stent. A total of 250 patients
      will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be either randomized to the Sirolimus-eluting stent or the bare
      metal Bx SONIC stent. The investigator cannot be blind because the outer appearance of the
      system for the implant of the Sirolimus-eluting stent differs from that of the bare metal
      stent and will therefore immediately be recognized by the surgeon. However the patient will
      not know which stent will be implanted. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 9 and 12 months
      post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months. Additionally,
      medical costs associated with the index hospitalization and length of stay, and repeat
      hospitalizations and costs associated with other relevant medical resource use during the 1
      year follow-up period will be collected and analyzed.
