      I. To assess the efficacy as measured by the confirmed overall hematologic response rate
      (partial response or better) of isatuximab in relapsed/refractory systemic light chain (AL)
      amyloidosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicities in the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis with
      isatuximab.

      II. To evaluate time to hematologic response. III. To evaluate duration of response. IV. To
      evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). V. To evaluate overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab in relapsed/refractory immunoglobulin amyloid light
      chain (AL) amyloidosis as measured by organ specific response rates (cardiac, renal,
      gastrointestinal [GI], liver, soft tissue, nerve), in the subset of patients that can be
      evaluated for organ response.

      II. To evaluate time to organ response in the subset of patients that can be evaluated for
      organ response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive isatuximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on
      days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every
      at least every 6 months for up to 4 years.
