      during their pregnancy. On a regular basis blood- and urine samples will be taken throughout
      their pregnancy and until 1 month after delivery and analyzed for a large variety of
      coagulation factors in order to identify factors that might predict an increased risk of
      developing pre-eclampsia and/or cardiovascular events. In addition a DNA-sample is taken if
      consented in order to evaluate genetic factors.
