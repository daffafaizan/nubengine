      transseptal approach, and is intended to reduce mortality and adverse event rates in selected
      patients for whom surgical options are not feasible.

      Innovation: A truly transfemoral, trans venous delivery of the valve which minimizes
      procedural risk. The Cardiovalve implant has a very low left ventricle (LV) protrusion
      footprint thus reducing the risk of LV outflow tract obstruction and/or interference with the
      LV. The experience to date is limited but thus far none of the clinical programs has been
      halted for safety reasons. Most of the technologies have focused on a transapical delivery
      approach (with mini-thoracotomy access) to further simplify the delivery method, with only a
      few allowing trans-septal delivery with femoral venous access.
