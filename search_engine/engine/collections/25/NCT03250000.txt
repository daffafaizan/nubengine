      at increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke during periods of acute exacerbation.
      These findings might be related to acute endothelial changes associated to increased systemic
      inflammation. Changes in the microcirculation can be explored noninvasively by studying
      retinal blood vessels that are visualized in fundus images. The retinal blood vessels have
      anatomical and physiological features that are comparable with the coronary circulation.

      Patients with COPD experience quadriceps muscle weakness, which worsens during
      hospitalization by ~1% per day. This is the result of physical inactivity, in combination
      with increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Physical inactivity is induced by
      the hospital environment, but is also related to symptoms of dyspnea caused by increased work
      of breathing and oxygen desaturation.

      Muscle weakness and physical inactivity are associated to poor functional status and
      recurrent hospital admissions, independent of pulmonary impairment, which makes those
      patients with frequent exacerbations prone to enter a vicious cycle.

      Simple functional screening tests during hospital stay might enable us to quantify the impact
      of a hospitalization on functional status and to identify patients at risk for repeated
      exacerbations.
