      Reconstruction.

      Patients will be divided into 2 groups. The TIVA group (N = 23) will be administrated
      intravenous anesthesia (propofol-remifentanil), while the DES group (N = 23) volatile
      anesthetics (desflurane-remifentanil).

      Specifically, the TIVA group will include patients over 50 years of age with high risk of
      nausea / vomiting and postoperative delirium, as well as suspicion of malignant hyperthermia.
      Patients with cardiac and respiratory problems will be included in the DES group.

      The following data will be collected in the Data Sheet: Patient Demographics (Gender, Age),
      Body Mass Index (Body Height- Body Weight). Simultaneously, the pain levels will be evaluated
      by VAS Optical Analogue Scale of VAS 0-10 in PACU, preoperatively and postoperatively, and
      perioperative pain levels will be assessed with CPOT scale (values 0-8).

      Stress levels will be evaluated with 3 NAS questions: a. How sad do you feel right now? b.
      How anxious do you feel right now? and c. How optimistic do you feel right now?. The 3 NAS
      questions will also be given preoperatively and postoperatively to the ward. The sedation
      levels will be assessed by RASS scale (values +4 to -5) and the Bispectral Index (BIS). The
      level of patient's awareness will be assessed by GCS Scale (3 (indicating deep
      unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (more widely used modified or revised
      scale)).

      The presence or absence of nausea / vomiting and the appearance of immediate postoperative
      complications will be examined. Finally, post-operative stress will be examined with stress
      biomarkers, salivary ACTH hormone and salivary cortisol hormone.
