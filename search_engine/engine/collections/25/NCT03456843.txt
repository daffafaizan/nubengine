    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit of combining radical surgery ? cytoreductive radical
      prostatectomy (CRP) - with the best systemic therapy (BST) in men with newly diagnosed
      clinical metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of CRP+BST on time to biochemical progression, cancer-specific
      survival, complication rates, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mPCa.

      II. To determine the transcription levels of bone morphogenetic protein -6 (BMP-6) and
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive antiandrogen therapy with or without docetaxel at the discretion
      of the treating physician.

      ARM II: Participants receive antiandrogen therapy for at least 1 month, then undergo
      cytoreductive radical prostatectomy. Participants continue antiandrogen therapy and may
      receive docetaxel prior to surgery at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months from time of
      progression.
