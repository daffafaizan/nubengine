    
      The study is designed as a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      with two groups of category 1 pulmonary TB patients who have successfully completed ATT and
      declared cured by bacteriological confirmation.

      The eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive single dose of either
      VPM1002 or placebo. After study vaccination, participants will be followed up for one year.
      Any suspected TB case during follow up will be further evaluated and bacteriologically
      confirmed. Study participants will be actively followed up for 2 months post-vaccination for
      any solicited local and regional reaction. SAEs will be recorded and reported throughout
      study participation.
