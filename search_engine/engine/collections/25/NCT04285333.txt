      fascia iliaca block prior to positioning hip fracture patients for standardized SA. We
      included 80 patients reporting pain with Verbal Rating Scale at 2 when raising the affected
      limb to 15 degrees. All patients admitted to induction room, were given standard monitoring
      and we randomized to receive either: ultrasound fascia iliaca block using linear high
      frequency ultrasound probe (10-15MHz) placed in a transverse direction over the anterior
      thigh below the inguinal ligament. A 50 mm needle was advanced until the tips placed
      underneath the fascia iliaca and 20 mL 1.5% Lidocaine was injected or ultrasound Percapsula
      nerve group block A curvilinear using low-frequency ultrasound probe (2-5MHz) that was
      initially placed in a transverse plane over the anterior inferior iliac spine and then
      aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counter clockwise approximately 45
      degrees. In this view, the iliopubic eminence , the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral
      artery, and pectineus muscle were observed and than a 100 mm needle was advanced to place the
      tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus
      posteriorly and 20 mL 1.5% Lidocaine.We compared pain on positioning for spinal anesthesia
      and also different time to realise both blocks.
