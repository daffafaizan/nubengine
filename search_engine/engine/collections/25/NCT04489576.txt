      appearance and morphology of the hair is one of the divergent traits in humans. Keratin in
      hair care products has two effects; it can penetrate the cortex of the hair fiber improving
      the mechanical properties of damaged fibers and promotes a surface coating that prevents or
      decreases water diffusion through the hair fibers.These properties have beneficial effects on
      the hair structure replacing lost keratin.However, the side effects and safety of this
      treatment have not yet been completely evaluated.There are many different brands of the
      keratin hair treatment, all with nearly the same basic chemical composition. Non-formaldehyde
      containing keratin straightening products, also known as safe keratin treatments (SKT) have
      recently been introduced to the market.Therefore, this study aims to study the efficacy and
      safety of such new non formaldehyde widely used keratin treatments on hair.
