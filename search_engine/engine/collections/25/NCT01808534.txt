      I. To determine the response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) of single
      agent palifosfamide in patients with refractory germ cell tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of remission. II. To determine progression free and overall
      survival. III. To assess toxicity and tolerability of palifosfamide in patients with germ
      cell tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive palifosfamide intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
