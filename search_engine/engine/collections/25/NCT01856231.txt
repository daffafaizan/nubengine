      physical activity (PA). Exercise training in a structured pulmonary rehabilitation program
      can generate substantial gains in functional capacity, but increases in functional capacity
      do not necessarily lead to improvements in daily PA. The proposed study will examine the
      effects of a lifestyle physical activity intervention designed to increase PA in people with
      moderate and severe COPD. The intervention includes a combination of (a) structured
      laboratory-based exercises with a self-efficacy enhancing intervention, (b) structured
      home-based exercises and (c) lifestyle physical activities performed at home. The
      intervention gradually transitions subjects from the structured laboratory-based exercises
      that focus on walking and circuit training to fully integrated lifestyle physical activities
      that integrate structured home-based exercises and lifestyle physical activities into daily
      life. The purpose of this preliminary study is to examine the effects of a program that
      includes two-months of structured lab-based training and subjects will be followed for a
      total of 18 weeks.
