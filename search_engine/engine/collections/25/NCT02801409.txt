      mainstay of treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, long-term survival
      after lung cancer surgery is far from optimal, and cancer recurrence or metastasis is the
      main reason leading to cancer death in these patients.

      The development of cancer recurrence/metastasis largely depends on the balance between
      tumor-promoting factors and immune function of the body. Studies showed that surgical
      manipulation releases cancer cells into circulation; and stress response induced by surgery
      inhibits the cell-mediated immunity. In addition, volatile anesthetics and opioids may also
      aggravate immunosuppression and potentially worsen long-term outcome. On the other hand,
      regional anesthesia can blunt surgical stress and reduce anesthetic consumption. These
      effects may help to preserve immune function and reduce recurrence/metastasis. However,
      existing evidences are insufficient to draw conclusion in this topic.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the hypothesize that regional
      anesthesia-analgesia may reduce recurrence/metastasis and improve long-term survival in
      patients after lung cancer surgery.
