      of which is lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the extremities, due to impaired lymphatic
      drainage. It can cause disability and a predisposition to infection and chronic ulceration.
      Other lymphatic disorders present with visceral manifestations such as regional or systemic
      lymphangiomatosis, pulmonary and intestinal lymphangiectasia, protein-losing enteropathy,
      chylous ascites, and chylothorax. Abnormalities of smooth muscle cell proliferation are
      associated with lymphangiomatosis. Proliferation of a neoplastic cell, the LAM cell, which
      exhibits a smooth muscle cell phenotype, is associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
      Currently, treatment for many of these disorders is symptomatic and the prognosis is
      variable.

      The molecular mechanisms of lymphatic vasculogenesis are incompletely understood, but
      critical genes have been described, and mutations in these genes may lead to developmental
      abnormalities. There may be a genetic predisposition to lymphatic disorders, with a role for
      modifier genes in disease progression. The purpose of this study is to (a) define the natural
      history of lymphatic diseases, (b) characterize the clinical phenotypes, and (Copyright)
      elucidate their pathogenesis at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. This
      protocol is part of a Trans-Institute basic, translational and clinical initiative in
      lymphatic disorders and will include participation of principal investigators across the NIH,
      as well as extramural investigators.
