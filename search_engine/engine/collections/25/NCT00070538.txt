        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of VP40101M when administered with cytarabine in
           patients with hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of VNP40101M.

      Patients receive cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 for patients under 65 years of age
      OR on days 1-3 for patients 65 years of age and over. Patients also receive VNP40101M IV over
      15-60 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses (in patients with
      responding disease) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with a continued response may receive additional courses at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 patients may receive treatment at
      the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
