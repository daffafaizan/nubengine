      maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are
      well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life.
      Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down
      metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade
      adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the
      combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an
      effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy
      with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations
      derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in
      turn positively affects quality of life. Clinical trials suggest an additional benefit when a
      CDK4/6 inhibitor is added to the combination of endocrine therapy and anti HER2 treatment.
      DETECT V is a randomized phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab
      plus pertuzumab and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in combination with either endocrine
      therapy or chemotherapy.
