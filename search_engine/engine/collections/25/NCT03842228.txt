    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the doublet
      combination of copanlisib and olaparib and of the triplet combination of copanlisib, olaparib
      and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with molecularly-selected solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of the doublet combination of copanlisib and
      olaparib, and of the triplet combination of copanlisib, olaparib and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in
      patients with molecularly-selected advanced solid tumors, as measured by objective response
      rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). Although the clinical benefit of
      the doublet and triplet combination of these drugs has not yet been established, the intent
      of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient
      will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and
      tolerability.

      II. To assess overall duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).

      III. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these combinations, and explore
      exposure-response relationships.

      IV. To correlate molecular alterations with OR (CR+PR).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib and olaparib.

      Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15
      and olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Beginning cycle 2, patients receive durvalumab IV
      over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 24 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 2 years.
