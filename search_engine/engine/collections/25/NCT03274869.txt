      including South Korea. It is characterized by fever, headache, rash, and eschar and the
      majority of patients without complications can recover with an early diagnosis and proper
      management with antibiotics. However, the increasing mortality rate of scrub typhus has been
      recently reported in Southeast Asia. Severe complications can be manifested by respiratory
      distress syndrome, renal failure, hepatic failure, and cardiovascular disease. Especially,
      cardiovascular complications can lead to cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac arrest.
      Therefore, the association and predictors for scrub typhus induced cardiovascular disease
      should be investigated to provide a timely and appropriate diagnosis and to reduce the
      mortality rate of complicated scrub typhus infection. Therefore, investigators prospectively
      investigate the association and predictors of cardiovascular disease in the participants with
      scrub typhus infection admitted to 3rd referral centers in South Korea.
