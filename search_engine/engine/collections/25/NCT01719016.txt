      very much needed in the treatment of coronary artery disease. In order to achieve this, two
      novel parameters, pressure drop coefficient (CDP), which combines flow and pressure readings
      and Lesion flow coefficient (LFC), which combines anatomical details of the lesion with
      pressure and flow readings, are being investigated. The diagnostic parameters will be
      correlated with Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR)values obtained using Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) imaging. They will also be correlated with Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).
