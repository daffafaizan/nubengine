    
      The aims of this study is to evaluate the effects of platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel
      or cilostazol in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis. The differences in platelet activation
      markers are also evaluated before and after clopidogrel or cilostazol administration. The
      investigators will perform a prospective, randomized study to compare the degree of platelet
      inhibition and platelet activation markers by adjunctive cilostazol (100 mg twice daily)
      compared to clopidogrel (75 or 150 mg/day) in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis.
