    
      This program aims to improve cardiovascular care for patients in Wilkes County by
      implementing a cardiovascular telehealth program designed to; a) assist WC- EMS paramedics
      with the early risk stratification (electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation, vital signs, and
      risk scores), treatment, and transportation destination decisions in patients with acute
      chest pain or dyspnea, b) support Wilkes Medical Center (WMC) Emergency Department (ED)
      providers (physicians and advanced practice clinicians) in the evaluation, management, and
      disposition of patients with acute cardiovascular symptoms, and c) provide consultative
      expertise to the Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) for patients seen following an EMS or ED
      encounter for cardiovascular symptoms.
