      which two (2) genes have been placed. One gene is for a protein (MUC1) found in cancer cells.
      The second gene is for human interleukin 2 (IL2) which the body's immune system makes to help
      it fight cancer. The TG4010 is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) once a
      week for six weeks followed by a schedule of every three weeks or every three weeks for the
      first twelve (12) weeks. If the therapy is working, it can be continued for up to 9 months
      until no further improvement or until the patient gets worse for as long as it is tolerated.
