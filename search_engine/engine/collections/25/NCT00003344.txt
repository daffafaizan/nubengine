      result in an acceptable level of toxicity when given in combination with concurrent external
      beam radiation therapy. II. Determine the objective response rate of these patients at the
      dose level below the MTD.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes beginning within 24 hours of
      radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. External beam radiotherapy is administered 5 days per
      week for 5.5-6 weeks starting on day 1 concurrent with chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      are treated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose level at which the incidence of dose limiting toxicity is no greater than one-third
      of the patients treated at that dose level. Once the MTD has been determined, additional
      patients receive irinotecan at the dose level below the MTD with external beam radiation
      therapy on the same treatment schedule as above. Patients are followed at 4 weeks after
      treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued into the Phase I portion of
      this study. Approximately 15-25 patients will be accrued into the Phase II portion of this
      study.
