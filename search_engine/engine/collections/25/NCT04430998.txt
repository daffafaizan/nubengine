    
      A randomized, double blind, 3 group parallel study with random allocation of 75 patients to
      any of three groups; Zinc-L-Carnosine-based mouth rinse, Chlorhexidine mouth rinse and
      placebo (water) control. Three days after professional oral hygiene, which aimed at the
      normalization of the periodontal index, the primary (HI, VAS) and secondary (mSBI; FMPS; VMI;
      SI) outcomes of the study are measured to obtain baseline information, and then scaling and
      root planing are carried out.

      The participants will be advised to follow their regular oral hygiene procedures (tooth
      brushing) in addition to the allocated mouth rinse. They will be examined again for primary
      and secondary outcomes at 7 and 21 days.

      Clinical evaluation:

      Clinical examination of each participant will be done by a single examiner using the
      previously described VAS scale and a UNC periodontal probe (No. 5 explorer Hu-Friedy,
      Chicago, Ill). In addition to these indices, each subject will be asked to report any adverse
      events they have encountered during the experiment.
