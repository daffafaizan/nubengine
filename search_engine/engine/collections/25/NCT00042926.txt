        -  Determine whether a negative hematoxylin and eosin finding from the lymphatic mapping
           and sentinel node lymphadenectomy procedure accurately predicts the negativity of the
           other cervical lymph nodes in patients with stage I or II squamous cell carcinoma of the
           oral cavity.

        -  Determine the extent and pattern of disease spread in the nodal bed in these patients.

        -  Obtain data on the use of immunohistochemistry to assess nodes in these patients.
