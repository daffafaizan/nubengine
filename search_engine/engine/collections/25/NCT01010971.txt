      This study will consist of a Screening Period, followed by a Single-Blind Placebo Run-in
      period. The Double-blind Treatment period (14±2 days) will begin at randomization/Day 1 and
      consist of an interim visit 7±1 days after randomization, and an End of Study (EOS)/Early
      Termination (ET) visit. All subjects will have either a telephone contact, or in some cases
      an in-clinic visit, 7±2 days after their last study visit. This study was previously posted
      by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma.,
      and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
