      shown that HFSRT combined with concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of
      â‰¥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year local control, intracranial progression free survival,
      progression free survival and overall survival rates were better than HFSRT alone group.
      Thus, the investigator conducted this randomized phase III trial to broad the sample size and
      verify our previous results. To finish the study in time, the investigator designed a
      multi-center trial.
