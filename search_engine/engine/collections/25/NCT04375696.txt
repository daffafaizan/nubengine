    
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect on weight loss in a group of
      subjects suffering from overweight and mild obesity (BMI between 25 and 32 Kg/m2) and with
      weight > 75 Kg/m2 being administered with a 3 g/day polyglucosamine dosage.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on blood triglyceride levels

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on blood levels of Total Cholesterol (CT),
           LDL, and HDL

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on glucose, insulin, insulin resistance
           assessed by calculating the Homeostatic metabolic assessment (HOMA)

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on liver enzymes (transaminases) and renal
           function (creatinine)

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on BMI (Body Mass Index)

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on the abdominal circumference

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on body composition evaluated by dual X-ray
           densitometer (DXA)

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on the serum levels of reactive oxygen species

        -  to evaluate the effect of supplementation on serum antioxidant capacity
