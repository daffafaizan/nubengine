      Weight and Health (Edmonton, AB) will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups (2D PSMAs versus 3D PSMAs). After a brief explanation of the respective
      tool, participants will estimate the volumes of pre-measured rubber food portion models on a
      test plate. Participants will then be given the 2D or 3D PSMAs to take home with them to use
      in the real-world. After 2-4 weeks, participants will be telephoned by the research team to
      complete a brief survey to evaluate their usefulness of and satisfaction with the 2D or 3D
      PSMAs at home.
