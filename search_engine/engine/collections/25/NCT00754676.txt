      disorders. Although a number of studies suggest that pancreatic stenting relieves abdominal
      pain in approximately 70% of patients, there has been no randomized study. Since any
      intervention may improve pain, the effectiveness of endoscopy cannot be ascertained without a
      true placebo arm or sham therapy group.

      The study will aim to determine the effectiveness of pancreatic stents in relieving chronic
      pain in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. Since these procedures do carry risk, a placebo
      controlled fashion is used for this study
