      inclusion.Patients were designed to randomize to six cycles of adjuvant TAC (TaxotereÂ®
      75mg/m2, doxorubicin 50mg/m2 or epirubicin 60mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2), and four
      cycles of T(100mg/m2), followed by 4 cycles of AC(doxorubicin 60mg/m2 or epirubicin 75mg/m2
      ,cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2). Prophylaxis with G-CSF was allowed for two arms when febrile
      neutropenia occurred in the first cycle of the study treatment. The second endpoint of this
      study is disease free survival. The primary objective is to compare the disease free survival
      rate and safety profiles of the above mentioned two arms.
