      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy will be screened at their preoperative visit. If they meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be invited to participate in the study and written
      informed consent will be obtained. If the patient consents to participation, they will be
      randomized to either the control arm or intervention arm. All patients will undergo sleeve
      gastrectomy in a standard fashion, either laparoscopically or robotically, as discussed with
      their bariatric surgeon. Post-operative diet will be initiated 4 hours after surgery. The
      specific diet received will depend on which arm the patient is randomized into.
      Post-operative assessments will be completed at various time points for all patients. These
      include a Verbal Rating Scale of Nausea and Vomiting, Rhodes Index Survey, and Quality of
      Recover-15 Survey. All patients will track their oral intake on a spreadsheet which will be
      provided. Additional demographic and clinical data will be collected from the Electronic
      Medical Record. After hospital discharge, patients will follow up in the clinic one week and
      one month after surgery, per routine. After the one-month visit, the patient's study
      participation will be considered complete.
