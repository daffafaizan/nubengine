      organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) on the effect of morphine after major surgery. This is
      primarily done by investigating systemic exposure of morphine in a cohort of patients
      undergoing scheduled laparoscopic colon or laparoscopic rectum surgery, and as pain treatment
      with intravenous (iv) morphine at the end of and after surgery (primary endpoints). As a
      secondary endpoint, we will investigate the effect (pharmacodynamics) of morphine in the same
      patients by registering pain during rest and activity, side effects and the degree of
      sedation at appropriate time intervals.
