      and tolerability profile of CV-MG01 is considered very good, with positive immunogenicity
      results after the high dose regimen of CV-MG01. The preliminary results also show an
      indication of efficacy of CV-MG01, as based on the different scales and questionnaires
      results, all specific to MG disease. Therefore, it is proposed to investigate, in an
      appropriately designed, randomised, double-blind and powered study, the clinical efficacy of
      CV-MG01 in a larger cohort of MG patients.
