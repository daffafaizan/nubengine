      with special focus on periodic assessments, reinforcement of compliance and attainment of
      treatment targets improves risk factor control and reduces morbidity and mortality in people
      with diabetes mellitus The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program is an innovative
      project using state of the art information technology with internet on-line system to enable
      doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to manage people with diabetes. It provides a
      virtual platform to facilitate implementation of evidence-based clinical protocols and to
      collect, manage and analyse data to track performance for quality assurance and improvement
      purposes. The JADE Program incorporates validated risk equations developed by the CUHK
      Diabetes Care & Research Group to stratify patients into various risk clusters for
      recommendation into different care protocols. This information can be relayed to people with
      diabetes in an interactive manner, in the form of charts and time trends, to motivate changes
      in behaviour and to attain treatment targets.

      In this implementation project, we aim to recruit 600 type 2 diabetic patients managed in a
      community setting. With written informed consent, these patients will be invited to enrol
      into the JADE Program. All patients will undergo annual comprehensive assessment (CA) at a
      diabetes centre with personalized JADE report (JADE) for 3 years. Half of the patients will
      be managed according to the JADE protocol implemented with additional support by a trained
      CHW (JADE+CHW). Guided by the personalized report with embedded decision support, the CHW
      will reinforce treatment adherence and self care after each clinic visit.
