      wait-list controlled trial to test the impact of the Communities That HEAL (CTH)
      intervention, which is designed to increase the adoption of an integrated set of
      evidence-based practices delivered across healthcare, behavioral health, justice, and other
      community-based settings. The intervention will include 3 components: community engagement to
      assist key stakeholders in applying evidence-based practices to addressing their opioid
      crisis, a menu of evidence-based practices for communities to select and implement, and a
      communications campaign to build demand for evidence-based practices to address overdose and
      opioid use disorder. Communities receiving the intervention will be engaged to reach
      individuals who are at highest risk of overdose death (e.g., out of treatment, leaving jail)
      and: (1) expand access to and receipt of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and
      behavioral treatment, (2) increase the number of individuals retained in treatment beyond 6
      months, (3) reduce the risk of fatal overdose through expansion of overdose education and
      naloxone distribution, and (4) improve prescription opioid safety. In addition, the study
      will determine (1) the factors that contribute to or impede successful implementation of the
      CTH intervention, (2) the factors that contribute to or impede sustainment of CTH
      intervention, and (3) the incremental costs and cost effectiveness of the CTH intervention.
