    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the PK,
      safety and tolerability, and ADA of nirsevimab when administered as a single fixed IM dosage
      to healthy Chinese adult subjects. Enrolment is planned at a single study center in China.
      Approximately 24 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive nirsevimab (n =
      18) or placebo (n = 6). All subjects will be followed for approximately 150 days after dosing
      to assess safety, PK, and ADA response.
