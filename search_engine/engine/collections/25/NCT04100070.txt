      there have been some questions regarding the long-term effect of these treatments with some
      concerns on the inconstant results on glycaemic control either due to CSII adherence or
      nutrition management issues.

      The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) study has already shown in diabetic
      adults that intensification of treatment and follow-up could result in significative
      improvement of glycaemic control.

      This study aims to test this hypothesis of significant improvement after one year following
      CSII initiation on glycaemic control.

      Two parallel arms will be compared in real life conditions; one with standard
      recommendations-based follow-up by both diabetologists/pediatricians and service provider and
      the other with intensive follow-up with higher frequency of provider's nurses visits and
      personalization of patient status transferred to the physician for each
      diabetologists/pediatricians visit.

      Thus, investigators could determine after one year if the glycaemic control is better with
      one or the other of these follow-up procedures.

      Glycaemic control will be assessed both by the evolution of HbA1c during the study period and
      its last level at the end of the study. Its evaluation will be completed by counting of all
      symptomatic hypoglycemia occurence during the study.
