      nucleus pulposus (LHNP) plus back pain. It is important to determine the effects of SJD on
      the gait characteristics in individuals with LHNP.Twelve individuals with LHNP (control
      group) and six individuals with LHNP plus SJD (study group) will be the participants of the
      study. Gait characteristics of participants will be evaluate with treadmill. Participants
      will walk at their self-selected speed for six minutes and data from 2nd minutes to 4th
      minutes were selected for statistical analyses. Gait speed, cadance, step lengths, time on
      each foot and step length variabilities will be record
