      and 20 patients with chronic venous disease. Socknleg is composed of an understocking
      covering the foot with three added stockings extending from the ankle to the knee without
      covering the foot. The novel Socknleg system is compared to a standard class III compression
      stocking. Outcome measures are successful donning and the comparison of interface pressure
      measured on the level of the ankle.
