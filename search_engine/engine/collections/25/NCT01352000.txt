      conditions at the point of their 2-week follow-up call. One-third will be randomized to a
      Usual Care (UC) condition, which will receive regular quitline services. One-third will be
      randomized to a Repeated Mailings (RM) condition, which will receive the 8 Forever Free
      booklets sent by mail at regular intervals over a period of 12 months. And one-third will be
      randomized to a Massed Mailings (MM) condition, which will receive all 8 booklets in a single
      mailing.
