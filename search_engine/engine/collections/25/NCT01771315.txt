      rehabilitation. However, the patients experience a variety of health related problems in the
      rehabilitations period following total knee arthroplasty and they have difficulties
      transferring health related information to their home settings. Nurse led follow-up in the
      early rehabilitation period might improve the health status of the patients by improving
      their knowledge and skills to handle health related problems. No studies found has
      investigated the effect of nurse led follow-up in form of telephone call following total knee
      arthroplasty.
