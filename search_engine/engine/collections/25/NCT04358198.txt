      surveillance gastroscopy will be enrolled. The routine surveillance program will be performed
      additional to taking photo at both GIM and normal mucosa at least 5 pictures in each. Biopsy
      will be done to confirm the diagnosis of GIM and normal mucosa. All pictures will be inserted
      to AI algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, the AI program will be
      validated in daily endoscopy compared with pathology. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity
      can be calculated by 2x2 table.
