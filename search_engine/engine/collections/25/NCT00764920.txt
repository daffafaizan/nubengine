        1. Laser Speckle Imaging can provide information about relative blood flow in a tissue. In
           skin it can be used to determine what areas have more blood flow and whether a
           particular intervention or treatment affects blood flow.

        2. Optical Coherence Tomography and Optical Doppler Tomography can provide pictures of
           blood vessels in an area of the body and can also tell how fast blood is flowing in that
           area.

        3. Photon Migration Spectroscopy can provide information about the amount of blood, oxygen,
           fat and water is in a tissue.

        4. Multi-Spectral Imaging can provide a 3 dimensional image of structures within the skin.

        5. Multiphoton Microscopy can provide images of structures of the skin.
