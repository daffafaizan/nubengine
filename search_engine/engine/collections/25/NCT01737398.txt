    
      FAP is a rare, hereditary disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. TTR
      is made by the liver and secreted into the blood. TTR mutations cause it to misfold and
      deposit in multiple organs causing FAP.

      Inotersen (also known as ISIS 420915) is an antisense drug that was designed to decrease the
      amount of mutant and normal TTR made by the liver. It is predicted that decreasing the amount
      of TTR protein would result in a decrease in the formation of TTR deposits, and thus slow or
      stop disease progression.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if inotersen can slow or stop the nerve damage
      caused by TTR deposits. This study will enroll late Stage 1 and early Stage 2 FAP
      participants. Participants will receive either inotersen or placebo for 65 weeks.
