      WHO-recommended multi-drug therapy (MDT). It is also known to have a beneficial effect in one
      of the common immunological reactions that occur in leprosy, known as erythema nodosum
      leprosum, or ENL. When MDT was reduced in length from 24 to 12 months, evidence suggests that
      ENL became worse. This study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial examining the
      effect of giving an additional year of clofazimine after completion of MDT. The endpoints are
      the incidence and severity of ENL over a period of 3 years in the 2 groups.
