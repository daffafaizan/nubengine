      occurs in allogeneic bone marrow/stem cell transplant (BMT) procedures, without the toxicity
      associated with graft vs. host disease (GVHD). In allogeneic BMT settings, patients are first
      conditioned to weaken the immune system in order to enable the engraftment of allogeneic
      donor cells. Patients require a matched-tissue donor in this setting in order to enable
      engraftment and also to minimize GVHD toxicity. While allogeneic BMT is a potentially curatve
      therapy, the treatment-related mortality, mostly related to GVHD toxicity, is high. This
      toxicity limits the clinical utility of this procedure. AlloStim is being tested to determine
      if it might be a less toxic alternative to allogeneic BMT.

      In this protocol, patients are not conditioned with chemotherapy prior to treatment.
      Therefore, the allogeneic cells in AlloStim are expected to be rejected by the patient's
      immune system within 24-48 hours of infusion.
