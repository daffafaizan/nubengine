    
      This first in human study with ABY-035 (a novel IL-17A inhibitor (interleukin 17A)) consists
      of four Parts. Part A consists of a single ascending intravenous dose study with 40 healthy
      volunteers divided into five dose cohorts. Each group consists of 8 subjects where 6 subjects
      will receive ABY-035 and 2 will receive placebo. The subjects will be followed for
      pharmacokinetic and safety assessments up to Day 95 after dosing.

      Part B of the study consists of 6 healthy volunteers who will be given a single subcutaneous
      dose of ABY-035. The subjects will follow the same study visit schedule as Part A.

      Part C of the study will include up to 12 moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients who each
      patient will be given a single intravenous dose of ABY-035. The patients will follow the same
      study visit schedule as Part A and B.

      Part D of the study will include up to 18 psoriasis patients (mild, moderate or severe). Each
      patient will participate in 3 or 7 biweekly dosing occasions of subcutaneously administered
      ABY-035. Patients will be followed regularly for safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics for 8
      weeks post-final dose.
