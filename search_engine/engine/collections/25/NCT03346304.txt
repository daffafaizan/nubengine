      cytological aberration, from normal to metaplasia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and
      then carcinoma in situ (CIS) before becoming an invasive cancer. Progression rates to
      invasive carcinoma can vary depending on the initial grade of lesion and it is generally
      accepted that high-grade lesions are more likely to progress to invasive cancer than
      low-grade lesions. Early detection and treatment of these lesions is critical to improving
      survival. There is no evidence base examining how, or whether these high-grade lesions (HGLs)
      should be treated, resulting in diverse treatment practices both nationally and
      internationally. This is the first randomised clinical trial of a bronchoscopic intervention
      in treating HGLs using PDT.

      Treatment: Treatment-arm patients will receive two courses of PDT treatment using the
      photosensitiser drug Fotolon®. Fotolon®, which preferentially accumulates in HGLs, is first
      administered via IV infusion. Patients then undergo bronchoscopy during which their HGLs are
      irradiated with red light (via non-heat emitting laser). Red-light activation of the
      photosensitiser causes chemical transformation of the cells and cell death.

      Follow Up: Follow up in both arms consists of AFB surveillance at 6 and 12 months, then every
      6-12 months (depending on the appearance of lesions), with annual CT scanning of the thorax,
      and annual spirometry. Biological samples for translational analysis will be taken at
      baseline and each subsequent trial visit.

      Duration of recruitment: Anticipated recruitment for phase II is 1 year (12 months), and an
      additional 2 years (24 months) for the phase III.
