      biopsy proven potentially resectable esophageal or junctional cancer scheduled to receive
      nCRT (CROSS regimen) prior to surgery.

      The study aims to evaluate Routine pre-treatment work-up includes PET to stage the tumour
      extension.

        -  PET/MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) will replace the PET component of CT(computed
           tomography)

        -  An additional intermediate 18-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/MRI will be performed during
           nCRT

        -  Post nCRT imaging, as required prior to surgery, will be PET/MRI six weeks after
           treatment completion.

        -  8-12 weeks post nCRT completion surgery will be performed, based on each patient's
           performance status and response to nCRT

        -  Histopathological samples of the excised tumor and lymph nodes will be used for
           diagnosis, staging and description of qualitative and quantitative parameters Routine
           clinical and radiological follow-up for 24 months (for the scope of this study) will
           follow the standard clinical workflow assigned to this group of patients.
