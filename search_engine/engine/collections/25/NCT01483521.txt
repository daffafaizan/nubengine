      Psychiatry Program. This home visitation program intervention consists of the following
      components: Developmental guidance, empowerment of parents while respecting the parent-child
      attachment, and child centered interactional guidance. The home visitors ( a PhD student and
      a Masters level student) visit consenting families and gave the parents an opportunity to
      voice their concerns regarding their child's behaviors. They were instructed to co-construct
      a play that had to be child led. Home visitors facilitated this task. Parents completed the
      Child Behavior Checklist and Parenting Stress Index prior to and after the intervention.
      These home visitations occurred approximately once a month whilst the families were on the
      wait list for clinical assessment and treatment. Those families that were randomized in
      control group did not receive any intervention.
