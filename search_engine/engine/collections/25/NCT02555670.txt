    
      BIA measurements are performed in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU or MC, within
      72 hours before or after CT scanning.

      The BIA measurements are taken with the BIA 101 ASE, manufactured by Akern, Florence-7 Italy.
      This device is phase sensitive and injects an alternating current of 400 µA at 50 kHz.
      Measurements were performed while patients lay in supine position with a pillow supporting
      the head. The resistance, reactance, body weight and length are entered in the BIA algorithm,
      using BodyGram PRO. This algorithm calculated the body composition, with muscle mass being
      reported in kilogram (kg).

      Abdominal CT scans are analyzed using the computer program SliceOmatic® version 4.3 and 5.0
      (TomoVision, Montreal, QC, Canada) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). The muscle
      tissue was identified by using boundaries in Hounsfield Units (grayscale) set of -29 to
      +150(23). The program computes muscle surface area in cm2, by multiplying the pixel area by
      the amount of pixels identified as muscle.

      For a direct comparison with the BIA-derived muscle mass, the CT-derived muscle area is
      converted to kg. This is done by following two steps. Firstly, the Shen equation is used for
      the conversion to litres.Secondly, the muscle volume is multiplied by its density, resulting
      in muscle mass expressed in kg.
