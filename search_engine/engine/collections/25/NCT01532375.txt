      parameters, visceral fat/subcutaneous fat, and blood lipid profiles in overweight subjects.

      Sixty overweight subjects with BMI >25 kg/m2 and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) ≥ 0.90 for men and ≥
      0.85 for women were randomly assigned to either KCJ supplement (n=30, 32 g/day) or placebo
      (n=30, 32 g/day) group for 12 weeks.
