      2012. An analysis time point has been added at Month 20. No changes have been made to the
      protocol endpoints or statistical methods but protocol endpoints will be analysed on data
      collected up to Month 20 once these data are available. The rationale is to have the full
      scope of protocol defined efficacy and safety endpoints related to a primary schedule without
      booster in both age categories followed up for 20 months earlier than at the initially
      planned study end time point (Visit 34 or Month 32 time point).

      The protocol posting document was updated due to a protocol amendment dated 10 December 2010
      to extend the study until December 2013 for all enrolled subjects (interval: Nov 2013-Jan
      2014). Including the extension, the mean follow-up time for subjects from 5-17 months will be
      during 49 months post dose 1 (range: 41-55), while for subjects from 6-12 weeks, it will be
      during 41 months post dose 1 (range: 32-48). This study is double-blind during the first part
      and single-blind during the extension part. An analysis will be conducted at the end of the
      extension including an evaluation of safety and efficacy against clinical malaria, severe
      malaria and prevalent parasitemia.

      The protocol posting document has been updated following the posting of results of the study
      (January 2015): The study remained double-blind until the end of the extension phase, and the
      analyses of Month 32 (initial end of study now becoming end of the first part of the study or
      primary study phase) and of the extension phase were conducted together.
