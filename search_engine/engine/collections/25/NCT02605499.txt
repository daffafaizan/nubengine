      subject to human factors and unfortunately is often inconsistent or inadequate. Patient rooms
      that have residual bacteria after routine environmental cleaning can act as reservoirs for
      multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and contribute to the spread of MDROs from patient to
      patient. In the setting of an increased focus on Healthcare-associated Infections such as
      Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and multidrug-resistant Gram negative and Gram positive
      organisms such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant
      Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA), Ultra-Violet C
      (UV-C) light has been shown to be a safe, effective way to decrease the burden of MDROs in
      patient rooms. However, studies examining the effectiveness of UV-C light when used post
      daily and discharge patient room cleaning are lacking.

      This study is a cluster, randomized, two-period cross over trial to investigate the
      relationship between environmental decontamination with UV-C light and transmission of VRE
      and other healthcare-associated bacteria. It investigates the hypothesis that UV-C in
      addition to daily cleaning leads to decreased patient acquisition of healthcare-associated
      bacteria.

      This study is important to further advance hospital-based infection prevention knowledge of
      the impact of UV-C light for environmental cleaning.
