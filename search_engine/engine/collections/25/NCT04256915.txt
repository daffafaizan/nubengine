      insomnia and eveningness. Eligible participants will be randomised to one of the following
      groups: CBT-I, CBT-I plus bright light therapy, or waiting-list control. Randomisation will
      be carried out using an automated online system. Assessments will be conducted at
      pre-treatment (week 0), during the treatment (week 2 & 4) and post-treatment (week 6/at the
      conclusion of the last group session). The two active treatment groups will be additionally
      followed up at post-treatment one-month and post-treatment six months in order to examine the
      maintenance effects following the intervention with CBT-I and CBT-I plus bright light therapy
      respectively.
