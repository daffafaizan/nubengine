      I. To evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the
      treatment of localized primary renal cancer to evaluate histological accuracy in successful
      ablation of the small renal mass, matched with intraoperative targeting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of laparoscopic HIFU for patients with primary renal
      cancer.

      II. To evaluate the technical success of laparoscopic HIFU ablation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic HIFU thermal ablative therapy during partial
      nephrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 6
      months, 12 months, and then annually for up to 3 years.
