    
      -  A prospective, randomized, investigator-masked, crossover comparison;

        -  Ocular hypertension or glaucoma (XFG or POAG) patients and who consent to participate
           will be enrolled in this study

        -  Patients will be scheduled for a screening visit IOP assessment (IOP measurements at
           08:30, 12:30 and 16:30 (±1 hour).

        -  Patients who are on therapy at the screening visit and who consent to participate will
           undergo a washout period for 4 weeks (depending on therapy) before the baseline visit;

        -  Patient can under the washout period be given brinzolamide (Azopt) if needed, Azopt
           should then be discontinued 5 days before baseline visit;

        -  After the screening visit (and after wash-outperiod for treated patients) patients will
           be scheduled to undergo a baseline visit IOP assessment (IOP measurements at 08:30,
           12:30 and 16:30 (± 1 hour with a minimum of 3 hours between readings) and will then be
           randomized for Period 1 to receive either BIMMD drops once in the evening (20:30) or
           TUDPF drops once in the evening (20:30) for 3 month

        -  After 3 month, patients will be switched for Period 2, to the opposite treatment (e.g.
           switched to either BIMMD or TUDPF) to be dosed in the evening;

        -  After another 3 months they will undergo the final evaluation of IOP levels and of
           tolerability;

        -  Intermediate safety visits may be scheduled at the discretion of the investigator.
