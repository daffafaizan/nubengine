      identified as enduring pain in the perineum, pelvic area, and/or genitalia in many studies.
      As in other painful chronic conditions, pain does not correspond strongly with objective
      medical findings and has no orthodox pathology. It is however associated with voiding and
      sexual disturbances. Symptoms should have been present for at least 3 months within the
      previous 6 months and must be validated with the standard questionnaire of the National
      Institute of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index. In most patients, pain is the main
      symptom. Chronic bacterial prostatitis the predominant type of prostatitis is a common and
      painful condition, typified by pelvic area pain and lower urinary tract symptoms, for which
      effective diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies remain elusive. Previous studies
      have documented an association between prostatitis and both psychiatric and rheumatologic
      diseases. Socioeconomic status indicators, such as lower education and lower income, also
      played an important role in predicting which men would have worse chronic prostatitis
      symptoms. These findings are consistent with those found among women with interstitial
      cystitis; women with lower education and income in the Interstitial Cystitis Database were
      more likely to report more severe symptoms.
