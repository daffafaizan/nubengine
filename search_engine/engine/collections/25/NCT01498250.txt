      variety of different cancers. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin has not been
      systematically evaluated regarding differentially expressed miRNAs. Patients with BCC are
      included in the study to perform an exploratory analysis by miRNA expression profiling using
      microarrays. Expression levels of miRNA candidates will be validated by TaqMan real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
