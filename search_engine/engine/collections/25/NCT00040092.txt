    
      A Phase III, Double-blind, Multicenter, Randomized Study in Chemonaive Patients with Locally
      Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer to Compare a Combination Therapy of Virulizin® plus
      Gemcitabine versus Placebo plus Gemcitabine; Optional Secondline Therapy may Include
      Continuation of Virulizin® or Placebo, Alone or in Combination with 5-Fluorouracil.

      Patients who have not received any prior chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      Gemcitabine plus Virulizin® versus Gemcitabine plus placebo in a double blind fashion. On
      disease progression patients may be switched to 5-Fluorouracil and continue to receive
      Virulizin® or placebo. Patients may continue Virulizin® alone, if clinically indicated when
      5-Fluorouracil is discontinued.
