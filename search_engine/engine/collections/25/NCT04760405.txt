      intervention in MM patients undergoing ASCT with concurrent exploration of HRQOL. The data
      obtained from this trial will provide supporting data for a future randomized clinical trial
      evaluating the impact of TCE on immune function (incidence of ASCT related infectious
      complications, natural killer cell phenotype and activity, and myeloma remission rate (clonal
      plasma cell % at day 100, minimal residual disease (MRD)), with the evaluation of efficacy on
      improving HRQOL during ASCT. Successful completion of this CROC project will provide
      necessary data to support future grant applications, in particular the feasibility of
      immunoassay evaluation of MM patients undergoing ASCT.
