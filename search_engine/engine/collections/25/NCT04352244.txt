      investigators will probe multiple aspects of fat cell (adipocyte) identity by integrating
      quantitative chemical imaging, single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc and
      snRNAseq), and site-specific collection of adipocytes and adipocyte precursors.

      Deidentified data from these studies will be submitted to the Human Cell Atlas. The
      investigators anticipate that these studies will ultimately increase understanding of
      mechanisms by which fat (adipose) tissue regulates systemic metabolism (energy transformation
      in the body), and promotes risk for metabolic disease. Knowledge gained from this research
      may be used to set the stage for disease-specific analyses, and aid in the development of
      personalized medicine for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.
