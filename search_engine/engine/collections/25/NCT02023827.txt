      participate in the study and to be randomly assigned to treatment or standard care. A
      Multiattribute Utility Measurement Approach (Graham, Flay, Johnson, Hansen, & Collins, 1984)
      was used to ensure that probation officers assigned to the two conditions were approximately
      equivalent on level of education, years of experience working with juvenile offenders, number
      of hours of training on the TTM, and confidence using the TTM in their work.

      Probation officers were responsible for recruiting moderate- and high-risk youth on
      probation, and delivering baseline assessment sessions and intervention sessions. However,
      local project site coordinators were available to provide assistance, as needed.

      Computerized follow-up assessments and urine drug testing at 6 and 12 months follow-up are
      being administered by "trackers" at a time and place that is convenient for the youth. Study
      protocols include best practices (Scott, 2004) for maximizing retention at follow-up in
      research involving high-risk populations.
