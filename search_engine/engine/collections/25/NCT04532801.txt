    
      Assignment: each study subject serves as their own control, and will come in timed to their
      cycle. The order in which they undergo the kisspeptin or placebo arms is randomized and
      separated by greater than two weeks to minimize variability and study-specific effects.

      Delivery of Interventions:

      Prior to each visit, study subjects will be asked to:

        -  eat at least 150 gm carbohydrates per day

        -  refrain from strenuous exercise

      On the day of the visit, study subjects will:

        -  eat a standardized meal prepared by the metabolic kitchen in the clinical research
           center

        -  be observed overnight to ensure a 12-hour fast

        -  have an IV placed, for a 16 hour kisspeptin or placebo infusion

        -  after the 12 hour fast, starting at 8 am in the morning will undergo a mixed meal
           tolerance test
