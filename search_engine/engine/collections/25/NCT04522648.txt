    
      Design and setting: This trial is a multi-center single-blind trial involving five hospitals
      in Denmark.

      Procedure: All women booked for surgery for breast cancer at one of the study sites will be
      invited to participate. Women, who provide written informed consent, will have BIS
      measurements, and perform self-measurements of arm circumference. Further, participants will
      complete a sociodemographic questionnaire which will be used to ensure recruitment of a
      representable sample. This data will be collected at the hospital of surgery at
      pre-treatment. After surgery, women who had >6 lymph nodes removed and have planned radiation
      therapy will be randomized 1:1 into intervention or control.
