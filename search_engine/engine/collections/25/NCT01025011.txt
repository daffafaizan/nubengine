      eye. In many eye diseases (especially diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy as well as in
      retinal vessel occlusions) retinal circulation is modified. Knowing hemoglobin concentration
      on the site of the pathology will give us further information about the pathogenesis of this
      diseases and may provide a new possibility in therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to test a new non-invasive tool to measure hemoglobin in retinal
      arteries. Healthy volunteers from the eye clinic and pregnant otherwise healthy patients of
      the gynecological department of the Triemli Hospital, Zurich, as well as anemic gynecological
      patients that show up for a check-up are included.

      Hemoglobin will be quantified by a blood draw of a cubital vein. Using a Fundus Camera (Nidek
      AFC-230) pictures of the fundus will be taken from each study patient. Afterwards the study
      investigator selects a retinal artery of interest which will be used for measuring the
      hemoglobin concentration. Intensity of the green channel of the camera chip is determined
      with the aid of the law of Lambert-Beer.

      Absolute Hemoglobin concentration is calculated in relation to the vessel volume.
