      patients to fully understand the content of the informed consent process, it should clearly
      explain the purpose, process, risks, benefits and alternatives to medical procedures or
      clinical research as well as a patient's rights and responsibilities. Patient safety and
      quality of care are at risk if the informed consent process is not delivered in a way that
      assures patient comprehension.

      Adoption of methods that allow researchers to conduct brief and virtual interviews with
      participants to complete the informed consent process using tablet computers (e.g. iPads)
      with a comprehensive multimedia library (e.g. video clips, animations, presentations, etc.)
      to explains the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the clinical care will enhance patient
      comprehension.

      The goal of this project is to help make the conduct of patient centered outcomes research
      (PCOR) more efficient and more widely implemented by engaging key stakeholders, including
      patients, through the development and evaluation of a new mobile health (mHealth) informed
      consent tool to disseminate PCOR findings in informed consent research.

      This study will be conducted over a 15 month period and will consist of 6 parts: (1)
      Front-End Focus Groups, (2) User Requirements Analysis, (3) Screen Prototypes Usability Focus
      Groups, (4) Design and Implementation, (5) Before Launch Usability Evaluation, (6) After
      Launch Usability Evaluation. Given the steps in the process and the changing (i.e. different)
      subjects/participants in each component of the development process, this study registration
      record primarily summarizes the final step in the development of VIC.
