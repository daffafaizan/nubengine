      components to be organized within a centralized platform. Utilizing this platform,
      therapeutic area-aligned Communities with associated Disease-Specific Cohorts (DSC) can be
      added according to scientific merit and need to address specific research questions in
      patients diagnosed with chronic diseases. This design capitalizes on a shared, sustainable
      infrastructure across a diverse patient population, which allows for more efficient
      coordination and conduct than can be achieved in traditional stand-alone,
      independently-conducted research studies with narrowly-focused target patient populations.
      This master protocol design will ultimately support a dynamic program that adapts to the
      changing landscape of chronic disease management and allows for rapid enrollment and
      collection of retrospective and long-term prospective data from participants in specific
      disease areas of interest.

      TARGET-RWE currently includes the TARGET-RWE.LUNG Community, with open DSCs for Asthma, COPD
      and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
