      and rodent. Whether this elongation of life due to calorie restriction can be applied to
      humans is not known. However, it is a fact that calorie restriction will decrease the risk of
      developing metabolic disturbances such as diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis.

      On the molecular level the specific relations are not fully understood. This study will
      investigate the possible connection between SITR1 and the relation to the GH/IGF-I axis and
      STAT5b in healthy men. The participant will fast 42 and 12 hours respectively, and have GH or
      placebo infusions. The design is a classical 2x2 design and will be randomized.

      Knowledge of the interactions between calorie restriction, SIRT1, STAT5b and the GH/IGF-I
      axis will apply important information about the relations between aging, energy metabolism
      and metabolic disturbances.
