    
      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective will be to determine the efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in recurrent
      anaplastic astrocytoma patients (6-month progression-free survival)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.

        -  To evaluate efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.

        -  To see if the presence of ATRX, TERT promoter, IDH1 mutations and/or MGMT promoter
           methylation, confers a better response to NOVOTTF-200A.

        -  To determine if the treatment significantly modifies the patient's quality of life.
           Sponsor will use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires:

             -  FACT-Brain (FACT-Br)

             -  FACT-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog)

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To determine if the presence of proneural or mesenchymal phenotype (Cytoscan analysis)
           confers a better response to NovoTTF.

        -  To determine if the in vitro sensitivity of the glioma cells derived from patient
           specimens before and after the NOVOTTF-200A treatment correlates with the patient's
           response to treatment.
