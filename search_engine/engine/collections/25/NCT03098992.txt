      design using convenience sampling to enroll subjects as they present and are found to be
      eligible per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This multicenter clinical trial utilizes a
      randomized assignment allocation schedule stratified by clinical site. Allocation rule
      pertains to the ratio of subjects in each treatment arm. Sampling rules pertain to the number
      of subjects in each active treatment arm.

      Two treatment arms enrolled on a 2:1 ratio: Active arm is the Fotona Dynamis Er:YAG Laser
      System and the control arm is a sham treatment with a very low laser setting and parameter
      presentations masked. The active arm subjects will be followed out to 12 months
      post-treatment. The sham arm subjects will be followed out to 6 months and then offered the
      active treatment.
