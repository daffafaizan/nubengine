      behaviors (patient activation, treatment plan adherence), and two chronic condition measures
      (glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure); (2) the impact of open access audio on provider
      communication and on their attention to patient contextual factors (i.e. individual Veteran's
      needs and circumstances relevant to planning effective care); and (3) patient, provider, and
      leadership perceptions of the extent to which the program is safe, not burdensome, and
      worthwhile at both the start and at two years into the program. A secondary analysis will
      descriptively measure the effect size of OAA on ED visits and hospital admissions.
