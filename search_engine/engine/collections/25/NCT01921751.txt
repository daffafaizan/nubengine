        -  I. To determine if intensified radiochemotherapy following gemcitabine and
           nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for
           improved 2-year overall survival (OS) from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with
           gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone.

        -  II. To determine if standard radiochemotherapy, following gemcitabine and
           nab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for
           improved 2-year OS from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with gemcitabine and
           nab-paclitaxel alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To evaluate patterns of failure (local and systemic progression) by SMAD family
           member 4 (SMAD4) status and intensity of radiation therapy.

        -  II. To evaluate the impact of radiochemotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 intact
           patients.

        -  III. To evaluate adverse events associated with the treatments.

        -  IV. To evaluate correlation between SMAD4 status determined by immunohistochemistry
           (IHC) and genetic SMAD4 status.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months.
