      ways to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids that allow them to avoid surgery. High intensity
      focused ultrasound therapy (HIFU) is a novel non-invasive method for uterine fibroid.
      Preliminary clinical studies proved HIFU ablation is a safe and effective technology.
      However, it is not clear whether HIFU has superiority over traditional surgery on
      satisfaction and adverse impact.The study is to confirm these questions.
