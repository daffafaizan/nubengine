      a test-meal (breakfast) in the lab and following food record over the rest of the day at
      home.

        1. week: physical activity level (PAL) 1.3, 3 intervention days in the metabolic chamber:
           ad libitum energy intake, washout day, isocaloric diet, 36 hours fasting

        2. week: physical activity level (PAL) 1.3, 2 intervention days in the metabolic chamber:
           isocaloric diet, 36 hours fasting

        3. week: physical activity level (PAL) 1.6, 2 intervention days in the metabolic chamber:
           ad libitum energy intake, 36 hours fasting

        4. week: physical activity level (PAL) 1.6, 2 intervention days in the metabolic chamber:
           isocaloric diet, ketogenic diet (isocaloric)

        5. week: physical activity level (PAL) 1.6, 2 intervention days in the metabolic chamber:
