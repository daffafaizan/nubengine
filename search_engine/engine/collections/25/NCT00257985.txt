      in approximately 80% of migraine sufferers. After systemic administration GTN is transformed
      to nitric oxide (NO). Treatment of spontaneous migraine attacks with an inhibitor of NO is
      effective in 60% of patients. These data show that NO is involved in both initiation and
      maintenance of migraine attack.

      The consequence of migraine gene mutations on relevant migraine pathways has never been
      tested. The aim of the present study is to explore functional consequences of migraine gene
      mutations on their responses to GTN infusion. The project will improve our understanding of
      the neurobiology of migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.
