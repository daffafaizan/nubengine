      subcapsular cataracts but prospective studies on this topic and accurate assessment of this
      potential adverse effect are lacking. We will evaluate changes of lens transparency after
      administration of systemic corticosteroid therapy for at least one year with Scheimpflug
      photography and quantification of lens autofluorescence.
