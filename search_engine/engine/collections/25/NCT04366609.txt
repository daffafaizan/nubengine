    
      The study has three aims:

        1. Examine the effect of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) genotype in children with ADHD on the
           effectiveness and adverse reactions of treatment with MPH.

        2. Study predictors for the short- and long-term outcome in childhood ADHD

        3. Examine the long-term outcome with respect to ADHD symptoms, and impairment in daily
           functioning in the cohort

      The specific aims are to:

        -  Describe the treatment response during the first 12 weeks after initiation of IR-MPH
           treatment, based on weekly clinician- rated ADHD core symptoms, the rate of
           normalisation/ borderline normalisation of ADHD core symptoms, adverse reactions, daily
           and social functioning, and measures of sustained attention.

        -  Describe the three-year outcome, based on parent rated ADHD core- and behavior symptoms,
           and level of impairment in daily functioning.

        -  Provide information about predictors for outcome after 12 weeks: clinical
           characteristics at entry (sex, age group, global severity of psychiatric disorder,
           psychiatric comorbidity, subtype of ADHD diagnoses), and predictors for outcome after
           three years: sex, age group, baseline severity of ADHD- and behavior symptoms, IQ,
           parental psychiatric disorder, maternal educational level, and time to treatment
           response.

        -  Determine the end-dose of IR-MPH after 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Systematically sequence the CES1 gene and associate the identified genotypes of this
           gene with treatment responses, including dosage of IR-MPH
