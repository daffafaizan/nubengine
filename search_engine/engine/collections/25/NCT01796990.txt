      commitment-based behavioural intervention concerning physical activity level and
      self-efficacy, as well as regarding planning and the acceptance of psychological and physical
      discomfort related to physical activity after 3 and 6 months compared to providing only
      individual written feedback on their physical activity. A further aim was to explore
      stability and maintenance of changes in physical activity at the 6 months follow-up. It was
      hypothesised that acceptance- and commitment-based behavioural intervention is more effective
      than feedback only in improving physical activity and related beliefs and cognitions.
