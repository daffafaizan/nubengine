      performed with up to 45 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who have participated in past
      surveys. A second group of 150 KTRs will be asked to evaluate the internet-based module for
      the effectiveness of information. A third group of 12 KTRs will be asked to evaluate the
      internet-based module for usability. A fourth group of 160 KTRs will be asked to take part in
      a randomized controlled trial evaluating the fully developed internet-based sun protection
      strategies program.

      Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at risk to develop skin cancer. Adequate sun
      protection after transplantation can reduce the risk of developing skin cancer. In 2006, the
      National Kidney Foundation (NKF) found that sun protection education delivery and content
      varied among transplantation centers. Clinicians rarely knew when to initiate education about
      skin cancer risks and prevention including timing and scope, and rarely demonstrated
      understanding of the importance of reminders for and repeated education of patients.
      (National Kidney Foundation 2006) The NKF supported standard, formal, well timed skin cancer
      prevention information and sending reminders to KTRs at the beginning of summer.

      Aims:

        1. To explore culturally sensitive use of terms describing ethnic cultural perceptions of
           sun burning, pigment darkening after sun exposure and description of skin color by the
           amount of photoprotective pigment in the skin.

        2. To pilot test the internet-based sun protection brochure with English speaking KTRs
           representing 3 ethnic groups: White, Black and Hispanic.

        3. To explore understanding of the importance of sun protection and the KTRs' confidence in
           their being able to practice sun protection.
