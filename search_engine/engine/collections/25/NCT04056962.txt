    
      Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) and tufted angiomas (TA) are rare vascular tumors,
      which are apparent predominantly in infancy or early childhood. Currently, no standard
      treatment regimens exist for KHE/TA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of topical application of tacrolimus for superficial Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma
      (KHE) and tufted angioma (TA).
