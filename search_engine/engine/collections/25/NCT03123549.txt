    
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      two-level SimplifyÂ® Disc compared to conventional two-level ACDF in skeletally mature
      patients for reconstruction of two contiguous discs from C3 to C7 following discectomy at two
      contiguous levels for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with
      neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalities localized to the levels of the two contiguous
      disc spaces that are unresponsive to conservative management.
