      surgical histopathology as the reference standard, the investigators intend to achieve the
      following objectives in adult subjects with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) undergoing
      surgical resection or transplant:

        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI for imaging patients with HCC

        2. To estimate the sensitivity of SUVmax on PSMA PET for identification of LI-RADSÂ® 5
           (definitely HCC) observations or biopsy proven HCC(s).

        3. To perform a Radiology-Pathology correlation of PSMA uptake at PET with HCC tumor PSMA
           immunostaining, tumor pathology features, and signal and enhancement characteristics at
           MRI
