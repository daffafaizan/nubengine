      temperature on newborn crying times, on the effects of newborn behavior and stress, the views
      and practices of mothers with newborn babies on baby bathing, and the effects of bath types
      on the umbilical cord in term babies, and the effects of bath products on newborns. It seems
      that there are studies done. However, although studies on the effect of the cleaning product
      used in the first bath of late preterm and term newborns on the skin barrier are limited in
      number for term newborns, there are almost no studies for late preterm newborns. The
      hypotheses of this study are as follows; 1. In late preterm and term newborns, the first bath
      with cleaning product protects the newborns' Transepidermal Fluid Loss better than the first
      bath with only water. 2. In late preterm and term newborns, the first bath with cleansing
      product keeps the skin pH levels of newborns at a more optimal level compared to the first
      bath with only water.
