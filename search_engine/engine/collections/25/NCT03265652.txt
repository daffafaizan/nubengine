      number of meibomian glands yielding liquid secretion in lower eyelid , meibography,
      self-assessed symptoms and close up photos of the lid margins) will be measured at baseline.
      All subjects will receive 4 treatments at 2 weeks intervals. In each treatment session, a
      subject allocated to the study group will be treated with IPL administered in the malar
      region, from tragus to tragus including the nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately
      following the IPL administration, the meibomian glands will be manually expressed from both
      eyelids. Subjects in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that the
      IPL administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 10 weeks after the baseline
      (or 4 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the outcome
      measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.

      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 10 weeks: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline).

      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis
      that IPL treatment itself provides relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
