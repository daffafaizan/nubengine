      validated, focusing on the coordination of wake-up and respiration, the management of
      delirium, as well as the early mobility of the patient. Innovation consists of simple,
      reproducible nursing care that reduces triggers of delirium; as well as the use of two new
      approaches in reanimation: conversational hypnosis and early and comprehensive re-empowerment
      of the patient in the management of his pain and well-being.
