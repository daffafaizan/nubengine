      cavity from the retina. This posterior vitreous separation may be incomplete, leading to
      areas of residual VMA. These adhesions can result in maculopathies such as vitreomacular
      traction syndrome, macular hole, epiretinal membrane, cystoid macular edema, diabetic macular
      edema, neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, exudative
      age-related macular degeneration, and myopic traction maculopathy. VMA may lead to
      pathological sequelae due to the static and dynamic anteroposterior tractional forces to the
      surface of the macula. The resultant complication will depend on the size and strength of the
      traction, with smaller areas of adhesion leading to greater traction. Identifying the
      prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion and its associated complications will yield valuable,
      new epidemiologic data, leading to improved diagnosis and management of patients with this
      condition. The prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion in specific age groups has not been
      investigated.
