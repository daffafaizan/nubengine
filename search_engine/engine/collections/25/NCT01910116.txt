      population. It frequently involves knees, hips, spines and hands. In hands, the distal and
      proximal interphalangeal and the first carpometacarpal joints are affected, leading often to
      significant disability and limitation in the daily activity. The chronic progressive nature
      of the disease requires a life-long treatment. The mainstay treatment of hand OA targets pain
      control. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used. However, they are
      frequently associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects including gastritis,
      peptic ulcer diseases, and bleeding, especially with long term use. Further, they do not
      ameliorate pain completely, requiring additional medications such as acetaminophen or
      opioid-based analgesics.

      Shibaro is a mixture of purified oriental herbs consisting of Ledebouriellae Radix,
      Achyranthis Radix, Acanthopanacis Cortex, Cibotii Rhizoma, Glycine Semen, and Eucommiae
      Cortex. These herbs have been used for the treatment of diverse inflammatory conditions in
      Chines traditional medicine. All 6 herbs show an excellent safety profile and their
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects have been studied in both animals and humans. As
      such, given the excellent safety profile, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, Shinbaro
      might be ideal in the treatment of OA.

      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Shinbaro in the treatment of hand OA
      in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial.
