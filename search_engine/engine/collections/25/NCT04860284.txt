      supportive care with oxygen supplementation and treatment of symptoms. Several re-purposed
      and new drugs have been investigated but none is conclusive for efficacy against
      COVID-19.These include the antimalarial drugs- chloroquine(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine(HCQ),
      antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir and antiretroviral combination therapies such
      as lopinavir/ritonavir. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are readily accessible in
      Uganda and could be explore for treatment of COVID-19,current data regarding their efficacy
      and safety is scanty.

      It is necessary to determine whether HCQ can be useful for treatment of Ugandan patients with
      COVID-19 for the following reasons : Firstly, the Ugandan population expresses a high level
      of variability with a younger population with more than 50% under the age of 15 years.
      Secondly, the population with co-morbid conditions like diabetes mellitus ,hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease is significantly lower compared to higher income countries.
      Preliminary data from the first 52 COVID-19 patients in Uganda treated with HCQ demonstrated
      faster symptom resolution although this did not reach statistical significance. Lastly, HCQ
      has not been tested in mild-moderate disease where hospitalization is not necessary and we
      therefore do not know whether it can lead to faster viral clearance, slow disease progression
      and reduce time to symptom clearance. Our main aim will be to determine if hydroxychloroquine
      can lead to faster viral clearance.
