      routine analysis. The biopsies were immediately immersed in culture medium (Dulbecco's
      modified medium, DMEM) in a falcon tube and kept for 16h at 37 C before cultivation. Biopsies
      were cultivated as described in Barone MV1, Caputo I, Ribecco MT, Maglio M, Marzari R,
      Sblattero D, Troncone R, Auricchio S, Esposito C. Humoral immune response to tissue
      transglutaminase is related to epithelial cell proliferation in celiac disease.
