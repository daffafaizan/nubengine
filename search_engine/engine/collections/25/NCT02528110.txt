      patients are randomized into HIPEC group and control group. In HIPEC group, the patients
      undergo radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and HIPEC with paclitaxel and 5-Fu.
      Patients in the control group just undergo radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy.
      Patients in both groups receive 6 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy (SOX or XELOX) and are
      followed up for 5 years or until death.

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter and parallel group
      study.
