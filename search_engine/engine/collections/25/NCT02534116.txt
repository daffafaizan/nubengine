      pressure wound therapy versus conventional dressings following abdominal reconstruction.

      Patients will undergo abdominal surgery (panniculectomy, abdominoplasty, ventral hernia
      repair, or autologous flap reconstruction using abdominal donor tissue). Following closure of
      the incision, patients will either have a gauze dressing placed over the incision (control
      group), or incisional vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy. The dressing will be removed
      over a time period of 2 to 5 days after surgery. The gauze dressing will be removed at 2 days
      and the wound VAC will be removed at 5 days. After this time, the wound will be assessed for
      signs of infection, seroma, hematoma, skin and fat necrosis, skin dehiscence, and hernia
      during the follow-up appointments.
