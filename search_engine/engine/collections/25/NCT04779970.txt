      (HBV). One fourth of untreated patients develop progressive liver damage and are at risk of
      liver-related death, which can be prevented by treatment with Nucleos(t)ide Analogues (NA).
      These drugs efficiently suppress viral replication, but seroclearance of the virus, defined
      as loss of Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg), is predicted to require an average of 36 to
      52 years (2, 3). Cessation of NA after long-term viral suppression in patients without HBV
      seroclearance might reduce costs and may even increase the chance of subsequent HBsAg loss.
      We have recently shown in a retrospective multicentric international study, that Caucasian
      ethnicity and off-treatment viral control are associated with HBsAg loss after NA cessation.
      In this study we will prospectively stop NA in both Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients
      matched for gender and age, to validate the observed host and viral parameters for future
      roll-out of this treatment strategy.
