      U.S. Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). However, variations in PT
      practice patterns and utilization of ineffective interventions lower the quality and increase
      the cost of care. Although, adherence to the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can improve
      outcomes and cost effectiveness of LBP care, PT CPG adherence rates remain below 50%. The
      RESOLVE trial will evaluate the effectiveness of an active PT CPG implementation strategy
      using an education/audit/feedback model for reducing pain, disability, medication use and
      cost of LBP care within the DoD and VA healthcare systems. The RESOLVE trial will include
      3300 to 7260 patients with LBP from five DoD and VA medical facilities, using a stepped-wedge
      study design. An education/audit/feedback model will be used to encourage the physical
      therapists to better adhere to the PT CPG recommendations. The primary outcomes of disability
      and pain intensity will be measured with the Oswestry Disability Index and the Defense and
      Veterans Pain Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes will include the LBP-related medical resource
      utilization and biopsychosocial predictors of PT outcomes. Statistical analyses will be based
      on intention to treat principles and will use linear mixed models to compare treatment
      conditions, and examine the interactions between treatment and sub-grouping status. The
      RESOLVE trial will provide a pragmatic approach to evaluate whether PT CPG adherence can
      reduce pain, disability and downstream healthcare utilization for LBP within the DoD and VA
      healthcare systems.
