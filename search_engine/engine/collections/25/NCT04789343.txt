      endodontic retreatment in mandibular premolar or molar without any symptoms. The teeth had
      been randomly assign into 3 groups according to the instrumentation or obturation techniques;
      hand files with lateral condensation, Reciproc with lateral condensation, or Reciproc with
      continuous condensation technique. Retreatments had performed in a single visit. Coronal
      restorations were removed, the gutta-percha were extracted using either Reciproc or hand
      files. After, biochemical and mechanical praparation, the canals were filled with
      gutta-percha cones and AH Plus sealer using the lateral condensation or continuous wave of
      obturation technique. Participants were been asked to rate the incidence and intensity of the
      postoperative pain on a verbal rating scale 24h, 48h and 72h and 7 days after retreatment.
      All data were analyzed using (Chi-square test, p=0,05)
