      treatment in anti-VEGF refractory nAMD, potentially allowing for better absorption of the
      exudative fluid.

      Aim To estimate the effect of systemic anti-Mineralocorticoid-Receptor treatment on eyes with
      nAMD which have remained exudative despite monthly anti-VEGF treatment for at least 6 months
      prior to enrolment.

      Objectives Primary objective

        -  To calculate the changes induced in retinal thickness following adjunct systemic
           anti-Mineralocorticoid-Receptor treatment Secondary objective

        -  To calculate the changes induced following adjunct systemic
           anti-Mineralocorticoid-Receptor treatment in the following ocular parameters

             -  Thickness of the neuro-retina (foveal)

             -  Amount of subretinal fluid (foveal and highest elevation)

             -  Height of retinal pigment epithelium detachment (foveal and highest elevation)

             -  Central (Subfoveal) choroidal thickness, and at 500um nasal and temporal to the
                fovea

             -  Presence / absence of exudative signs on OCT, according to the type of fluid
                (intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid)

             -  Best corrected visual acuity (number of letters)

      Medications:

      Standard medical treatment (monthly intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF) will be continued
      during this trial, no current medications will be altered. The medication spironolactone, an
      MR antagonist will be added to the currently prescribed medications (phase IV). The standard
      dose of 50mg once daily per os will be prescribed for 3 months (first week 25mg only for
      treatment introduction and safety), tapered during month 4 (25mg once daily).

      In the case of a patient current taking a medication with contra-indications for this drug,
      then the conflicting medication will be exchanged for an equivalent treatment option, where
      this is not possible then these patients will be excluded from the study. The patient will be
      withdrawn from the study in case of any serious side effects attributable to spironolactone
      (increased K+ above 5.5mmol/l).
