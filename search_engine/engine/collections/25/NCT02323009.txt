    
      Tracheotomized morbidly obese patients (BMI >= 40) who had failed an initial attempt at
      ventilator weaning (defined in the investigators study as ventilator dependent) were randomly
      assigned to one of two methods for setting Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP).

      Patients randomized to the esophageal balloon arm (ESO group) had their PEEP adjusted to
      overcome negative transpulmonary pressure and maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure
      (Ptp) of 0 to 10 cm H20 - targeting as close to zero as possible.

      Patients randomized to the static effective compliance arm (CStat group) had their PEEP
      adjusted to achieve the best static effective compliance as automatically calculated and
      displayed on the graphic interphase of the hamilton G5 or Galileo ventilator. For this group,
      the PEEP was adjusted in increments of 3 cm H20 until there was a less than 5% observed
      improvement in the static effective compliance. the PEEP with the best Cstat was chosen.

      At the end of the intervention period, this intervention cohort (termed "PEEP intervention
      cohort") will be compared to a group of historical controls to compare the efficiency of a
      PEEP-based weaning protocol to traditional weaning methods.

      The investigators hypothesized that PEEP levels titrated by use of an esophageal balloon to
      maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure between 0 to 10 cm H20, would lead to improved
      outcomes with respect to ventilator weaning in this subset of patients.
