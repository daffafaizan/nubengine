      brain stem. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is known for its curative treatment. Lateral
      spread response (LSR) is a kind of pathologic electromyographic (EMG) wave form which
      develops when facial nerve is compressed by vessel. There have been reports of monitoring LSR
      during MVD surgery helps predicting the clinical outcome of MVD.

      As neuromuscular blockade during LSR monitoring decreases the amplitude of EMG, partial
      neuromuscular blockade is usually maintained during general anesthesia for MVD. However,
      there have been no evidence of which degree of partial neuromuscular blockade should be
      performed during LSR monitoring under sevoflurane anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators
      performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of different degree of partial
      neuromuscular blockade on the LSR monitoring for MVD surgery.
