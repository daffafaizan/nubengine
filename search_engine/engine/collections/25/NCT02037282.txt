      with 226,000 excess hospitalizations and 30,000-50,000 deaths each year in the United States
      alone, and more therapies are needed in the armamentarium of anti-influenza medications
      including humoral immunity-based agents.

      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of an anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous
      immunoglobulin. Beginning with a low dose, subjects will receive anti-influenza intravenous
      immunoglobulin (FLU-IVIG) and evaluated on Study Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The safety and
      tolerability is evaluated using symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, and pharmacokinetics.
      Utilizing serum antibody responses as determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays,
      the dose will be escalated as immunogenicity is established.
