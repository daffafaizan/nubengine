      dilatation, decreases blood pressure and cardiac output reduction which leads to maternal
      nausea, vomiting, dizziness and uteroplacental hypoperfusion. Infusion therapy and the use of
      vasopressor can prevent and treat the incidence of hypotension. Appropriate fluid therapy can
      not only maintain maternal tissue perfusion, but also reduce uteroplacental hypoperfusion. In
      the present study, perioperative goal directed fluid therapy is used. The non-invasive
      continuous hemodynamic monitor is used in this study, and the parameters (blood pressure
      (BP), stroke volume(SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), cardiac output (CO)) are used to
      determine the parameters of the blood transfusion in cesarean section as infusion guidelines.
      The application of Clearsight system to the pre-infusion of target-guided crystalloid
      solution is compared with the infusion of quantitative crystalline solution in the hope of
      reducing the incidence of maternal hypotension, reducing the use of vasopressin, improving
      uteroplacental perfusion and reducing the incidence of fetal acidosis.
