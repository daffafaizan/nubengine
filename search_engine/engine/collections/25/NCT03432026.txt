      have COPD, and the burden of COPD in non-smokers is also higher than previously believed
      especially in developing countries. Exposure to gases, environmental pollution, respiratory
      infection, noxious particles, passive smoking, and indoor air pollution is the main cause of
      COPD in non smokers.

      COPD over the years has been classified into two phenotypes; chronic bronchitis or classic
      emphysema.However, The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
      guidelines over the last few years have stopped emphasizing the categorization of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) into only emphysema or chronic bronchitis

      Clear examples of COPD phenotypes in smokers have been described in different Researches,such
      as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbators and the asthma_copd overlap.,but
      there is alack of information about COPD phenotypes in non-smokers, So, there is a continuous
      need for research into groups of non smoking patients.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the phenotypes of COPD, their risk factors,
      Clinical and functional assessment and the prognosis of each COPD phenotype in non-smoking
      patients.
