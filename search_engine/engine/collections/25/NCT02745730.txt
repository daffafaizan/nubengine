      increasingly recognized. It is currently well accepted that the brain is the target organ to
      measure the effects of pleasantness and energy homeostasis in order to change feeding
      behaviour to reduce the rising prevalence of obesity. The effects of food on the brain are
      multiple and complex. In addition to primary aspects of food such as taste, texture, looks
      and smell, secondary aspects such as energy regulation are as much important in the entire
      "eating experience". Resting state functional connectivity in the brain can be assessed by
      the analysis of low-frequency fluctuations present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
      (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Investigators will use resting
      state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRl) to detect changes in connectivity in the
      default mode and salience network after consumption of four different milkshakes with added
      sugars or sweeteners.
