      correlation between intercourse during pregnancy and early labor. Brustman et al showed that
      women that were at a high risk for early delivery and had intercourse and then an early labor
      had significantly increase uterine activity compared to women at low risk. Petridou et al
      showed that this risk is significantly higher at week 33 of gestation. However, the Cochrane
      Library summary leaves the question of correlation between intercourse and early labor
      unanswered. In Sayle et al's study showed no correlation between early delivery and
      intercourse. In 2004 Oguma described 3 polymorphisms in the Prostanoid receptor gene. These
      polymorphisms were correlated to increased activity of smooth muscles of bronchi in asthma.
      Since this gene is also expressed in the uterine muscles we wanted to determine whether there
      is a correlation between the three polymorphisms T-549C, C-441T, T-197C, G+1044A and early
      delivery due to intercourse.
