      hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy combined with antiandrogen therapy prior to radiotherapy, in
      terms of disease-free survival and overall survival, in patients with stage I-IV localized
      invasive prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      All patients receive triptorelin IM once a month and oral flutamide three times daily with
      meals. Patients randomized to arm I receive this therapy regimen for 4 months. Patients
      randomized to arm II receive this therapy regimen for 8 months. All patients then undergo
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks within 2 months of the last injection of triptorelin
      and within 1 month of the last oral flutamide tablet. Patients are followed every 3 months
      after radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 276 patients (138 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
