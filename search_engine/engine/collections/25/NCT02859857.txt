    
      This is a first in man study of BXQ-350, a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent composed
      of two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the
      phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes.
      When both the components are assembled together forming stable SapC-DOPS nanovesicles
      (clinical formulation BXQ-350), the agent exhibits the propensity to enter the body and
      brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death.

      The study is divided into 3 parts:

        1. Dose Escalation Scheme Sequential cohorts of adult patients with advanced solid tumors
           and recurrent high-grade gliomas will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until
           the MTD is established, or in the absence of a MAD, the highest planned DL.

        2. During Part 2, patients with advanced solid tumors and recurrent high-grade gliomas will
           be enrolled and administered BXQ-350 at the MTD determined in Part 1 or at the highest
           planned DL, if the MAD is not reached.

        3. During Part 3, patients with either ependymoma, GI tumors , or advanced solid tumors
           other than HGG, will be enrolled and administered BXQ-350 at the 2.4 mg/kg dose level.
