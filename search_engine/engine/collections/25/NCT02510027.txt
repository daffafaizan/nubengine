    
      The target population is over <100,000 women aged 30 to 64 years who attend the Cervical
      Cancer Screening Program in 100 health centers in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. All women
      will be evaluated to determine hrHPV infection using the CobasÂ® 4800 HPV test. Triage
      strategies will be performed as reflex tests in all hrHPV-positive participants: HPV-16/18/45
      genotyping, detection of the E6 oncoprotein of HPV-16/18, cytology, and immunocytochemistry
      using p16INK4a/Ki67. Women with at least one positive triage test will be referred for
      colposcopy evaluation, where a minimum of four biopsies and an endocervical sample are
      systematically collected. Histological confirmation will be performed by a standardized panel
      of pathologists.
