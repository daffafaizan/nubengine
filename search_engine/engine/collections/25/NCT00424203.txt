      Primary

        -  Determine the independence of older women with resected stage I, II, or III breast
           cancer treated with adjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on other aspects of the patient's life, utilizing
           the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, the Folstein
           Mini-Mental State Exam, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Cumulative Illness
           Rating Scale-Geriatrics.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the acceptability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen, in terms of cardiac issues and anemia, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine recurrence-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and after completion of chemotherapy.
      Questionnaires include the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, the Mini-Nutritional
      Assessment (malnutrition), the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (cognitive function), the
      Geriatric Depression Scale (depression), the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale - Geriatrics
      (comorbidities), and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (quality of life).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
