    
      Randomized, blinded, 3 x 3 crossover intervention. Each treatment will last 12 d, followed by
      a 7-d wash-out period. After the washout, subjects will go back to their regular diet for two
      weeks before beginning the next cycle. Subjects will report to the research kitchen in the
      Nutritional Sciences building for their breakfast. Maize will be incorporated into two
      muffins. Other food choices will be yogurt and other low-fiber foods. Blood samples will be
      taken at baseline and days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 19. Natural abundance measurements of
      13-carbone to 12-carbon will be taken at baseline, day 12 and day 19. Retinol isotope
      dilution testing will be done at the end of the study to determine total body stores of
      vitamin A in the subjects. This will include the day 19 blood sample of intervention phase 3
      and a final blood sample 14 days after the isotope dose administration.
