    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of the combination of R115777 (Zarnestra™) and Idarubicin
      plus cytarabine by defining the DLT and MTD. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the
      combination of Idarubicin, cytarabine and ZARNESTRA in patients with high-risk MDS and AML.
      (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib. Patients are stratified according to
      age (< 50 versus ≥ 50) and, in patients ≥ 50 years of age, cytogenetics (diploid versus
      unfavorable).

      INDUCTION THERAPY:

      PHASE I: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3 (or 1-4), idarubicin
      intravenous (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-3, and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive cytarabine, idarubicin, and tipifarnib as in phase I at the MTD.

      Patients in both phases who respond to induction therapy proceed to consolidation maintenance
      therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising
      cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3, idarubicin IV over 1 hour on days 1-2, and tipifarnib
      twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then begin maintenance therapy comprising oral tipifarnib twice daily on day 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
