    
      This is both a retrospective and prospective single-center study. In the prospective part of
      the study, patients complete a self-questionnaire, with :

        -  a non-specific part, concerning the history of anaesthesia (locoregional or general),
           the patient's feelings about these anaesthesias (possible difficulties in waking up,
           pain) and details about the the course of the anaesthesia (including possible
           complications).

        -  a part specific to the sleep disease (possible rebound of symptoms, management of sleep
           treatments before and after anesthesia, sleep treatments before and after the different
           types of anesthesia).

      Evaluation Criteria:

      Main:

      Frequency of history of locoregional and general anesthesia, and their possible
      complications.

      Secondary:

      Frequency of patients with rebound symptoms, or with worsening symptomatology (in each of the
      3 groups, and in subgroups of patients with the same treatments), during locoregional and
      general anesthesia independently.

      Other parameters collected via self-questionnaire (and at the time of the initial evaluation,
      retrospectively on medical records):

        -  Sociodemographic data: age, gender, body mass index

        -  Data related to the disease: age of onset of symptoms, age of diagnosis

        -  Other associated medical conditions

        -  Type of surgery

        -  Type, date and the number of anesthesia: locoregional, general
