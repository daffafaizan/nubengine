      require implantation of a metal orthopedic device. Patients will be followed for one year
      after surgery to determine if any symptoms including rash, itch, joint pain, joint swelling,
      and/or joint failure develop post implantation.

      Patients will be recruited from two sites: (1) Divisions of Orthopedics and Allergy &
      Immunology, Winthrop University Hospital, and (2) Division of Immunology, and Allergy
      Section, University of Cincinnati Medical Center.
