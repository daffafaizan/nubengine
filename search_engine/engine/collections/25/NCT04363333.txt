      having OSA and Covid-19 outcomes within 28 days of the hospitalization.

      Secondary outcomes will be conducting a polysomnography in cases with high probability of
      having OSA compared to those with low probability, approx. 4 months after the Covid-19
      diagnosis, and re-evaluate the association of the verified OSA diagnosis and severity with
      the outcomes in the first 4 weeks as well as with the outcomes after 4 months.
