    
      Primary objective: To assess the feasibility and safety for Anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in
      combination with decitabine and/or chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks to subjects with
      relapsed or refractory malignancies.

      Secondary objectives: 1) To assess the antitumor activity of Anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in
      combination with decitabine and/or chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory
      malignancies. 2) To characterize the immunological effects of Anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in
      combination with decitabine and/or chemotherapy. 3) To characterize the immunological effects
      of Anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in combination with decitabine and/or chemotherapy.

      Exploratory objectives: 1) To analysis of potential biological parameters correlated to
      clinical response and toxicities. 2) To search predictive biomarkers to guide the choose of
      patients undergoing the treatment of Anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in combination with
      decitabine and/or chemotherapy.

      Safety Evaluation: Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for 100
      days post last treatment, and will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.

      Efficacy Evaluation: 1) Treatment response to lymphoma was defined using the International
      Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Lymphomas; 2) Treatment response to solid
      tumors was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1).

      evaluation index: BOR; ORR; PFS and OS.
