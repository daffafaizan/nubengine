    
      This five week (one week baseline and four weeks randomised treatment period), multi-centre,
      placebo controlled, parallel group, randomized withdrawal study will evaluate the maintenance
      of effect after long-term treatment with Sativex® in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due
      to MS who have been receiving long-term benefit from treatment with Sativex®. Subjects will
      be selected from the Supply of Unlicensed Sativex® (SUS) or named patient supply programmes
      and must have been receiving Sativex® for at least 12 weeks prior to study entry. Following
      informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will enter the study (Visit 1, Day 1) and
      commence a seven day open label baseline period, before returning for a randomisation visit
      (Visit 2, Day 7), at which point they are randomised to receive either Sativex® or placebo
      (randomised withdrawal period). Subjects will return to the centre for an end of study visit
      at week five (Visit 3, Day 35) or earlier if they withdraw from treatment. Spasticity and
      sleep disruption review and dosing diaries will be completed each day from the start of the
      baseline period until completion or withdrawal.
