      signs of disease progression in active surveillance protocols. This can directly benefit
      patients by providing them with greater confidence that their disease is being accurately
      monitored. In addition, this study may be beneficial to the general management of prostate
      cancers by adding to our knowledge of these investigations characterizing prostate cancers.
