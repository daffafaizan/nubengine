      of antimicrobial activity. A granule formulation has been developed to improve medication
      adherence of the patients. This study was conducted to assess the bioequivalence of the
      granule formulation to dry suspension in healthy Chinese volunteers and estimate the
      pharmacokinetics profiles of cefprozil. An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period,
      two-group, crossover study was conducted in 60 healthy Chinese volunteers under fasted or fed
      conditions (30 volunteers for each condition) to assess the bioequivalence between two
      formulations of cefprozil. Blood samples were collected at specified time intervals, and the
      plasma concentrations of cis- and trans-cefprozil were determined by a validated liquid
      chromatography- mass spectrum/ mass spectrum method. Pharmacokinetic and bioavailability
      parameters were estimated via non-compartmental methods. Adverse events were also recorded.
      If the 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of geometrical mean of test and reference
      formulations for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-infer are all within the predefined bioequivalence
      criteria range of 80%-125% for cis-, trans-and total cefprozil, the two formulations can be
      considered bioequivalent.
