      Assess the efficacy of raising and maintaining hemoglobin (Hgb) levels above 12.0 g/dL with
      epoetin alfa vs maintaining Hgb levels above 10.0 g/dL without epoetin alfa on
      progression-free survival, overall survival, and local control in anemic patients with
      cervical cancer receiving concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin. Compare the quality of life
      of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to stage (IIB vs IIIB vs IVA),
      method of brachytherapy (low-dose vs high-dose), and surgical staging of para-aortic nodes
      (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy comprising pelvic external beam radiotherapy daily five
      days a week for 5 weeks, followed by either 1 or 2 implants of low-dose rate intracavitary
      brachytherapy or 5 fractions of high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy, followed by 3-5
      days of parametrial boost radiotherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV concurrently with
      pelvic external beam radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and once during the week of
      parametrial boost radiotherapy.

      Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy as in arm I. Additionally, patients
      receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly concurrently with radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during weeks 3 and 6, within 1 week of
      last brachytherapy, and every 3 months for 2 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
