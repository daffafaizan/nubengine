      patients using Emricasan at 25mg BID dosing for 14 days with a 1:1 active: placebo of
      mild-COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care therapy. Although EMR has been extensively
      studied in humans in a total of 18 Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, with an excellent safety and
      tolerance profile, it has not been used in the setting of COVID-19, therefore necessitating
      an initial safety and tolerability study looking at a no difference between AEs/SAEs for
      comparison between active and placebo group. The pharmacokinetics of EMR has been extensively
      studied; therefore, the Investigators will opportunistically sample patients at the end of
      the study to confirm that the Emricasan PK is not altered in COVID-19 patients. The primary
      endpoint will be cumulative incidence of AE/SAEs through day 14. Secondary endpoints will
      include various clinical and laboratory measures and patient reported outcomes (PROs) using a
      COVID-19-related assessment tool, SARS-CoV-2 viral PCR, titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2
      neutralizing and quantitative antibodies and immunological studies as described in the
      protocol.
