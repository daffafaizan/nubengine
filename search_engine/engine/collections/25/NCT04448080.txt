      particular the fear of pain during and after surgery can cause tremendous anxiety. In
      addition, possible side effects of general anesthesia and sedation should be considered, in
      particular, in patients with multiple comorbidities. The investigators want to help patients
      to cope with their anxiety and, in addition, minimize risks of surgical procedures including
      side effects of anesthesia. With this project, the investigators aim to investigate whether
      topical anesthesia - often used in ophthalmologic surgical procedures - can sufficiently
      control pain during and after a glaucoma laser procedure compared to intravenous
      analgosedation. As primary objective, the effectiveness in pain control of analgosedation and
      topical anesthesia in MP-TLT will be compared. As secondary objective, the effect of the
      anesthetic protocol used on postoperative visual related quality of life will be
      investigated.
