      five Union Councils (UC) in Dadu District in Sindh Province. The project will scale up the
      already existing health services for MNCH in the district referral hospital and the five
      Basic Health Units (BHUs), one in each UC. Institutional based services as well as their
      scope for outreach to pregnant women, mothers and children in the communities with the aim to
      promote safe deliveries as per WHO guidelines and Government policy will be enhanced. In
      order to deliver quality services, the facilities will be renovated and equipped and the
      capacity of the existing staff will be strengthened through different training courses in
      MNCH. In addition professionally trained Lady Health Visitors will be introduced in the BHUs,
      who will conduct all maternal services including deliveries in the BHU and the communities.
      The health staff is furthermore responsible to establish and facilitate community support
      groups and raise communal awareness for the importance of mother and child health care as
      well as safe deliveries with skilled attendants. Operational research is an integral part of
      this pilot project. The research validates the progress and improvement of maternal and child
      health indicators. The results will be used to lobby the scale up of MNCH interventions with
      the Ministry of Health in Pakistan.
