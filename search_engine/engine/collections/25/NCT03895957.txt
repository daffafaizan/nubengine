      VR Mind and VR Mind+. The software utilizes the concept of virtual reality exposure therapy
      to treat social anxiety disorder. The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy
      of VR Mind and VR Mind + interventions.

      The research consists of fourteen sessions. The first and the last session will be dedicated
      to participant assessment. Subsequent sessions 2-13 will be performed according to the
      therapy protocol for each arm. Control group of participants (active comparative arm) will
      receive standard treatment for social anxiety disorder - cognitive behavioral therapy based
      on the protocol developed by the Principal Investigator [protocol adapted from the approach
      of Clark and Wells (Mayo-Wilson, Dias, Mavranezouli, 2014)]. Experimental group 1 will
      receive cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure in virtual environment. Experimental group
      1 and control group were designed to be as similar as possible, with the exception of the
      modality for the delivery of exposure. All treatment session will be led by licensed
      therapist.

      Participants of the experimental group 2 will independently conducts the self-therapy
      process. The intervention will consist of 12 therapeutic sessions. At each of the 12
      sessions, the participant will selects a specific scenario of social situations that arouse
      fear (e.g. public speaking, job interview or other situations from everyday life).

      Because of the risk of simulator sickness (e.g., headaches, nausea), exposure trials will
      last no longer than 20 minutes for each session.
