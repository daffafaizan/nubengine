      Disorder (OUD) will be screened, and those eligible who are positive for fentanyl analogues
      at screening will be consented and inducted onto sublingual buprenorphine (target dose 16mg
      to 24mg). On the fourth day after starting the buprenorphine induction, participants will
      receive sublocade (BXR) 300mg by subcutaneious injection. Participants will be seen twice per
      week for urine collection for toxicology and research assessments and will have Medication
      Management counseling weekly during one of these visits. BXR will be administered monthly and
      dosing will be according to the FDA prescribing instructions of 300mg for the second dose and
      100mg for the third.
