    
      Adult patients with Dexa scan (bone scan) z-scores < -1.0 (meaning low bone density) in at
      least one site will be selected for randomization. All patients who qualify for randomization
      will undergo baseline bloodwork for serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and
      n-terminal telopeptides of collagen (NTX) levels. Recent bloodwork obtained as part of their
      ongoing long-term Pediatric Oncology and/or Endocrine clinic follow-up evaluation will be
      reviewed to exclude any baseline correctable confounding causes of osteopenia (low bone
      density). All women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test.

      For those patients already on growth hormone replacement therapy, growth hormone will be
      administered as per standard of care, with standard dose ranges adjusted based upon
      IGF-1(Insulin like growth factor) monitoring. Those patients not currently receiving growth
      hormone replacement therapy will not be placed on therapy as a part of this study. Patients
      on and off growth hormone replacement therapy will be randomized in a block design to the two
      treatment arms to assure equal numbers in each treatment arm. The bisphosphonate to be
      utilized will be provided to the Arm II patients at no charge. All Arm II patients will
      receive the same bisphosphonate regimen, Risedronate 35 mg per oral once weekly for 18
      months. All patients on arms I and II will also receive Vitamin D (400 IU p.o. daily) and
      calcium carbonate (500 mg p.o. twice daily) free of charge for eighteen months.
