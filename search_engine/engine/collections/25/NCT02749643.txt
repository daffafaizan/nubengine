    
      Investigators will perform three experiments:

        1. Investigators will add vibrotactile feedback to prosthetic users during the execution of
           a standardized functional test and performance of simple grasping tasks, with a
           disruption to the normal visual feedback, and examine whether their performance and arm
           kinematics are improved with tactile feedback;

        2. Investigators will examine the effects of adding the feedback to a prosthesis on the
           performance and visual attention during a dual task assignment in prosthetic users, and

        3. Investigators will provide prosthetic users with the feedback, to use it at their
           natural surroundings for a week, and study the reported activity and satisfaction
           levels.
