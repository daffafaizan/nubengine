      to penicilloate prepared by our new method of penicilloate preparation versus our old method
      of penicilloate preparation. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      significance of the different diastereoisomers of penicilloate on skin test reactivity.

      Five (5) adult subjects without a history of penicillin allergy and fifteen (15) adult
      subjects with a history of penicillin allergy and previous positive penicillin skin test to
      the minor determinant (penicilloate) and/or major determinant (penicilloyl) will be enrolled
      into the study. Each subject will be skin tested with our current penicillin skin test which
      includes penicilloate conducted in the Division of Allergic Diseases will be compared the
      skin test of our penicilloate prepared by our newer method along with the different
      diastereoisomers of penicilloic acid on the same day and time. The adult subjects without a
      history of penicillin allergy will serve as our control.
