      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib, carboplatin, and etoposide in
      patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.

      II. Evaluate biologic effects of bortezomib on relevant targets in the tumor tissues of
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib, etoposide, and carboplatin.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and
      etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 6 additional
      patients with newly diagnosed, chemotherapy-naive extensive stage small cell lung cancer, and
      6 patients with other tumor types, are treated at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-14
      months.
