    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (overall and complete response rate) after rituximab +
      oblimersen sodium extended induction therapy in previously untreated cluster of
      differentiation 20 positive (CD20+) follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients.

      II. To determine the time to progression after rituximab + oblimersen sodium extended
      induction therapy in previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of rituximab + oblimersen sodium therapy in previously
      untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.

      II. To establish whether the therapeutic effects of the rituximab + oblimersen sodium
      combination are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent randomized trial
      (in comparison to rituximab alone).

      III. To correlate Fc receptor profiling to response to rituximab + oblimersen sodium in
      previously untreated patients with follicular NHL.

      IV. To determine the relationship between change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) uptake early
      after treatment with rituximab + oblimersen sodium to response rate and time to progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Induction therapy (month 1): Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and
      15-21 and rituximab IV on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 in month 1.

      Extended induction therapy (months 3, 5, 7, and 9): Patients receive oblimersen IV
      continuously on days 22-28 and rituximab IV on day 24 in months 3, 5, 7, and 9.

      Treatment continues for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
