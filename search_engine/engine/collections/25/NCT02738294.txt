      diagnosis of gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate diagnostic efficacy
      of ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with targeted biopsy compared with EFB from
      white light endoscopy and ME-NBI combined with EFB.

      A prospective study was conducted encompassing suspected EGC. All patients were performed
      white light endoscopic examination with EFB and then ME-NBI with ME-NBI targeted biopsy.
      Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including diagnostic efficacy of EFB from white
      light endoscopy,ME-NBI combined with EFB, ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with
      targeted biopsy.
