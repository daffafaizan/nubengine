      the most common is wound infection. Surgical Site Infections (SSI) usually result in
      increased long-term complications, such as incisional hernia, prolonged hospital stay,
      increased outpatients visits and medical costs. Negative-Pressure-Wound-Therapy (NPWT) is a
      technique using vacuum dressing, commonly used to promote surgical wound healing, but there
      is a significant lack of knowledge about its safety and efficacy in promoting wound healing
      after stoma closure. This is an interventional, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the NPWT (PICOâ„¢ system, Smith&Nephew Healthcare, Hull, UK) on stoma
      wound compared to Standard of Care (SOC).
