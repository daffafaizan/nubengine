      degeneration of basal ganglia, patients with Parkinson's disease also demonstrate internal
      rhythm dysfunction, thus will lead to difficulty in rhythmic movements such as ambulation.
      For improving the rhythmic movement problem, auditory cues are often used in clinical setting
      and shows benefits in ambulation and freezing problems. Previous studies often use finger
      tapping test and ambulation to assess the rhythmic movement problem. No study uses stepping
      in place movements as a test to examine rhythmic problem. Little study investigates the
      effects of auditory cues on brain cortical excitability. In this cross-over study,
      participants will receive 2 times of training include stepping-in-place exercise with and
      without auditory cues in random orders. Auditory cues are given via the metronome. There is
      one-week wash-out period between two trainings. Movement tests such as walking and
      stepping-in-place and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are carried out before and
      after each training.

      The investigators hypothesize the variation of rhythmic movements such as walking and
      stepping-in-place will be reduced more, and the cortical excitability would be modulated
      after the training with auditory cues, comparing with the other training without auditory
      cues.
