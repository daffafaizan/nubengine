      direct changes in EEG activity compared to the placement of a sham phone. Furthermore, it is
      investigated whether placement of the mobile phone on the ear or the heart results in
      different outcomes. The subjects are measured twice: on one of the two days the mobile phone
      is attached to the ear, the other day to the chest. In this single-blind, cross-over design,
      assessments in the sham phone conditions are conducted directly preceding and following the
      mobile phone exposure. During each assessment, EEG activity and radiofrequency radiation are
      recorded jointly. Delta, theta, alpha, slowbeta, fastbeta, and gamma activity are computed.
      The association between radiation exposure and the EEG is tested using multilevel random
      regression analyses with radiation as predictor of main interest.
