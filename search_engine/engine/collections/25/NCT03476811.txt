      catheters will be tunneled under the skin with large hollow-bore needles along the entire
      length of the incision on either side prior to closure. These catheters will deliver study
      drug (0.25% Marcaine) directly into the incision. They will be affixed to the skin with
      steri-strips. The catheters will then be attached to a drug delivery pump at 2mL/hour and
      will be removed prior to discharge.
