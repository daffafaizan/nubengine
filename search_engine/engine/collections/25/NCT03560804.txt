      with the two methods -impedance cardiography and applanation tonometry- can be predictive of
      the antihypertensive effect of two different classes of drugs, ATII antagonists and
      diuretics.

      The drugs that will be used in the study are olmesartan and chlorthalidone and the duration
      of the study is 12 months.
