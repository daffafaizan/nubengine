      treatment for overweight and obese individuals with diabetes. Unfortunately, it is difficult
      for people to implement lifestyle changes that lead to significant weight loss, and even
      harder to maintain weight loss. Manipulation of the gut-brain axis may be a means to augment
      weight loss efforts. Preliminary data suggests that a simple cryoablation procedure to freeze
      the vagus nerve is well-tolerated and leads to clinically significant weight loss.

      The pilot study will assess the feasibility and efficacy of this procedure in obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes. Aim 1 will focus on changes in glycemic control. Aim 2 will evaluate
      differences in body weight and anthropometric measurements. This study will provide much
      needed data for a novel therapeutic intervention to manage obese patients with type 2
      diabetes.
