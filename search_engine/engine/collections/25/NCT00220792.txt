      and during initial treatment. Group interventions for cancer patients have been shown to
      improve psychological adjustment. The tests of efficacy for these interventions have
      typically taken place in university settings using highly developed models of intervention.
      Our aim was to test our supportive-expressive model in community oncology practices utilizing
      personnel already working with these populations. To conduct this study of group therapy for
      primary breast cancer patients, we developed a brief version of the supportive-expressive
      model (Classen et al., 1993). Our first aim was to test the efficacy of this intervention for
      reducing mood disturbance for women who received the intervention compared to a control
      group. A second aim was to examine who was most likely to benefit from the intervention. A
      third aim was to see if this method could be taught efficiently and effectively to oncology
      nurses and mental health professionals.
