      that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and
      associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to
      noxious particles or gases. Hypoxia caused by restrictive airflow is one of the symptoms of
      COPD. Hypoxia can affect the inner ear and vestibular nuclei. Also, balance impairment can be
      caused by hypoxia. Previous studies show that balance affected negatively in COPD patients.
      The aim of this study is to investigate of vestibular system influence in individuals with
      COPD. A total of 10 COPD patients and 10 healthy adults will include the study. This research
      is planned to be carried out as a cross-sectional/descriptive research. It's planned as a
      pilot study. Respiratory functions (respiratory function test), vestibular functions (head
      shake test, head trust test, unterberger test) and postural stability (sensory organization
      test) of participants will be assessed.Comparisons between study and control groups will be
      made with independent samples t-test for parametric values and Mann Whitney U for
      non-parametric values.
