    
      This is a prospective, randomized study with two cohorts: one experimental and one control.
      Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) radiographs are routinely obtained as standard of care
      during spine surgery to confirm proper implant placement. These images will be used in this
      study. In one-half of the study subjects, after all sponges are removed, a surgical sponge
      will be intentionally placed in the surgical field prior to imaging. Postoperatively, each
      subject's images will be assessed for the presence or absence of a retained surgical sponge.
      Images will be independently read by two investigators. When there is discordance, the images
      will be adjudicated by a third. Interobserver agreement will be quantified using the Kappa
      statistic. Those reading images will not have participated in the surgery.
