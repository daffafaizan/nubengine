      will be given Papaverine (PDE10 inhibitor, 300 mg orally) in the first session followed by
      placebo in the second, and the other half will be treated in the reverse order. There is a
      minimum of one month between the two test-sessions. After each of the two treatments, the
      subjects will be tested with both a psychophysiological (the Copenhagen Psychophysiological
      Test-Battery) and neuropsychological test-battery (tests from the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, or "CANTAB"). The project has three phases: In the
      first phase 10 healthy subjects will be included to determine the kinetics of
      Papaverine-contained release capsules ; in the second phase 30 schizophrenia patients and 30
      healthy subjects will be included to determine the impact on cognitive and sensory gating
      related deficits; Finally 10 Healthy subjects will be included to determine the effect of
      Papaverine on hemodynamical parameters by the means magnetic resonance scannings.
