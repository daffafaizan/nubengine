      of 60 patients aged 18-65 with at least 3 months of myofascial neck pain will be recruited to
      participate in the study. The participants will be randomized into two groups. Each group
      will undergo two 4-week treatment arms separated by a 4-week wash-out period. Participants
      will apply a topical gel patch 12 hours each day overlying painful areas in the neck and
      shoulder girdle for each 4-week period. The topical gel patch used in each arm of the study
      will be identical except the placebo will not contain the active ingredient, 0.1% capsaicin.
      Both topical gel patches will be supplied by Caleb Pharmaceuticals. Each participant will
      complete 3 surveys at baseline and after each 4-week treatment arm: 1) McGill Pain Scale, 2)
      visual analog scale, and 3) Short Form 36 (general quality of life data). Paired T-tests will
      be used to evaluate for statistically significant changes between treatment with the control
      gel versus the active ingredient gel containing the capsaicin.
