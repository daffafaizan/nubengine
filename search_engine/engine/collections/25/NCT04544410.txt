      steroid dose used by adult CAH subjects. The first 24-weeks will be a double-blind, placebo
      controlled, comparison of Tildacerfont vs Placebo. The following 28-weeks will allow all
      subjects to move to open label Tildacerfont to continue to reduce steroid dose where
      appropriate, and observe long term safety.
