      with problematic and pathological gambling behavior. The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which the online program leads to a significant reduction in
      pathological gambling. The primary outcome is the PG-Y-BOCS as a measure of the severity of
      pathological gambling symptoms. Secondary outcomes are rates of depression, measured with the
      PHQ-9 as well as gambling-specific cognitive biases, measured with the GABS. The program is
      expected to lead to a significant reduction in problematic/pathological gambling behavior
      (PG-Y-BOCS) and also to declines in both depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and gambling-specific
      cognitive biases (GABS). The study is conducted as a randomized-controlled trial with one
      intervention group and one wait-list control group. The intervention group receives the login
      data directly following the baseline survey and can use the program over a period of 8 weeks,
      whereas the wait-list control group receives access to the program after completion of the
      post-survey.
