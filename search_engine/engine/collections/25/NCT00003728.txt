    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the value of dexamethasone (DM) vs prednisolone (PRDL) administered during
           induction therapy, in terms of event-free and overall survival, in children with acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LNHL).

        -  Assess the value of increasing the number of administrations of asparaginase during
           consolidation and late intensification therapy, in terms of disease-free and overall
           survival, in children without very high-risk (VHR) features.

        -  Compare the response rate in children treated with prephase therapy comprising DM vs
           PRDL and intrathecal methotrexate.

        -  Compare the incidence and grade of toxic effects of these treatment regimens in these
           children.

        -  Compare the long-term effects of these treatment regimens on growth and pubertal
           development, neurocognitive, cardiac, and endocrine function, and incidence of aseptic
           bone necrosis in these children.

        -  Evaluate the proportion of children with VHR disease when defined according to extended
           VHR criteria, and assess the prognostic importance of the new VHR features (cytogenetics
           and minimal-residual disease).

        -  Compare the feasibility of the VHR chemotherapy protocol in patients treated with DM vs
           PRDL.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified for prephase
      therapy according to center, disease (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma [NHL]), WBC for ALL patients (less than 10,000/mm^3 vs 10,000/mm^3 to less than
      100,000/mm^3 vs greater than 100,000/mm^3), stage for NHL patients (I or II vs III or IV),
      and whether prephase already started (yes vs no). Patients are stratified for protocol II
      therapy according to center, risk group (very low risk [VLR] vs average risk 1 [AR1] vs
      average risk 2 [AR2]), and treatment arm at first randomization.

                IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days 1-7.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive dexamethasone (DM) orally twice daily or IV over 1 hour
                every 12 hours on days 1-7.
