      activation during acute vascular injury, and to explore the association between neutrophil
      activation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Colchicine reduces cell surface expression of
      selections, adhesion molecules key to neutrophil recruitment after vascular injury. Daily
      colchicine use is associated with reduced adverse cardiovascular events in stable
      atherosclerosis. Using a clinical percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) model, the
      investigators evaluate whether pre-procedural colchicine (1.8 mg oral load over one hour)
      reduces the rate of post-PCI adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the context of a double-blind
      placebo-controlled randomized study. The investigators will also characterize neutrophil
      biology in acute vascular injury and the effects of colchicine on neutrophil biology in this
      setting.
