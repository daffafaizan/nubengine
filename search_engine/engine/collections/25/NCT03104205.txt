      increased risk of disability, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight
      loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older
      obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. The overarching goal of this
      study is to conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a
      technology assisted wellness intervention for older adults with obesity.

      Study Timeline:

      September 2018 to April 2021:

      Goal: Conduct a study of improving weight and physical function in older adults with obesity
      at home using video-conferencing. An mHealth obesity wellness intervention (MOWI) will
      integrate a fitness device with a weekly individual dietician-led nutritional session, along
      with twice weekly physical therapist led group exercise session performed in a person's home.

      Participation Duration: Three times weekly for 6 months. We shall also have participants
      return to the center once monthly
