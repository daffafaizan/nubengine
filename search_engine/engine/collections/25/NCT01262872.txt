    
      There will be two cohorts in the study: Cohort 1 (children aged 2-4 years) and Cohort 2
      (infants aged 8-10 weeks), and two steps in the study, Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 will consist
      in a safety evaluation of the GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A (GSK 2189242A or
      10PP vaccine). Before evaluating the two formulations of the 10PP vaccine in infants (Cohort
      2), safety and reactogenicity of the highest dose formulation of this vaccine will be
      evaluated in children (Cohort 1). Prevnar 13™ will be used as a control. In the second step
      of the study, Step 2, two investigational formulations of the 10PP vaccine will be tested in
      infants (Cohort 2) as regards immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety. Both formulations of
      the 10PP vaccine will be evaluated according to the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)
      schedule i.e. a 2, 3, 4 months vaccination schedule, using licensed Synflorix™ and Prevnar
      13™ vaccines as comparators. The higher dose (HD) formulation of the 10PP vaccine will be
      also evaluated according to the 2, 4, 9 months vaccination schedule using licensed Synflorix™
      vaccine as comparator. The study in infants will also assess the immune responses to routine
      vaccines when co-administered with the candidate pneumococcal vaccine, using licensed
      Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™ vaccines as comparators.
