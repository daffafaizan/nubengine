      performed by a trained and certified vascular technologist using advanced duplex imaging
      equipment and with subsequent interpretation by a trained physician. It would be of value to
      develop an accurate, reliable, low-cost, and easily accessible tool to screen for
      extra-cranial ICA disease in an office based setting. However, such a tool would require
      novel technology that allows for quick, accurate, reproducible, and safe evaluation.

      This study will evaluate a new technology called the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS) developed by
      CVR Global. The CSS instrument uses principles of cardiovascular resonance to detect low
      frequency pressure fluctuations associated with flow disturbances in areas of significant
      arterial narrowing.

      Subjects will undergo a clinically ordered clinical carotid duplex ultrasound as part of
      standard of care. Subjects will have a noninvasive CSS assessment before or after the carotid
      duplex ultrasound.

      Within 3 months following the date of the initial study visit, the electronic medical record
      will be queried for any interval correlative imaging studies (CTA, MRA, or angiography) and
      reports performed up to 1 month prior and 3 months after the duplex examination date. Report
      of findings will be documented (i.e., % ICA stenosis by CTA/MRA).
