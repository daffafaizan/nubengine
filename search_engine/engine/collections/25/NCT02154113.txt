      for body contouring purposesdesigned to selectively disrupt sub-dermal fat cells employing
      focused ultrasound. All other types of tissue, such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral
      nerves, remain intact. There are no thermal effects. Fat-cell destruction is achieved by
      ultrasound-induced mechanical effects during a very short exposure time.

      VelaShape is a non-invasive device for Body Reshaping and Cellulite Treatment. VelaShape
      combines controlled infrared (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies
      with mechanical manipulation.
