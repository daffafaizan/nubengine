    
      This study will be conducted at 24 study sites in 3-5 countries. The study duration for each
      participant will be approximately 52-56 weeks. Approximately 240 participants with severe
      eosinophilic asthma taking high-dose Inhaled corticosteroids/ long-acting β2-agonist
      (ICS/LABA) who have been treated for severe eosinophilic asthma with at least 3 consecutive
      doses of Fasenra® and have clinically responded since the start of Fasenra® treatment
      (defined for the purpose of this study as an Asthma control questionnaire-5 item (ACQ-5
      score) <1.5 at Visit 1 and Visit 2b) will be enrolled into this open-label study. The study
      consists of a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and 4- to 8-week screening and run-in period (to
      align the randomisation study visit with the next Fasenra® injection), a reduction period of
      32 weeks, and a 16-week maintenance period.
