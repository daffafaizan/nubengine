    
      The Early Detection Initiative (EDI), is designed to evaluate if imaging at the time of new
      onset hyperglycemia and diabetes, especially at its earliest discovery through passive
      surveillance of the electronic medical record (EMR), results in earlier detection of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

      Eligible patients are identified and enrolled based on a first-time elevation in fasting
      blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to the level indicating diabetes as derived from
      records in their EMR. All enrolled patients are randomized to either the Observational Arm or
      Intervention Arm of the study. Patients randomized to the Intervention Arm have Enriching
      New-onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC) score calculated using age, body weight and
      glucose or glycated hemoglobin values in their EMR. Patients with high ENDPAC score (>0) are
      approached for informed consent to participate in up to two imaging studies by computerized
      tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to imaging,
      participants will be asked to complete study questionnaires and participate in serial blood
      collection at up to five time points. Blood samples collected in the EDI study will
      contribute to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      biorepository located at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research facility.
      Patients in both study arms are followed for development of PDAC.

      This study is performed at locations with broad (institutional) consent for use of patient
      EMR information for research studies. Passive follow-up by EMR will occur for five years
      following enrollment. Any patient that has declined participation in EMR-based research at
      the institution is not included in the study.
