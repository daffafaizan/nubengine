      antibody in the treatment of tumor, but the clinical study of CAV / IE chemotherapy combined
      with anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue
      sarcoma has not been started, and the related research is still in the blank state. In view
      of the above problems, to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAV / IE
      chemotherapy combined with toripalimab in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone
      and soft tissue sarcoma patients, so as to provide more treatment options for patients with
      advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue sarcoma.
