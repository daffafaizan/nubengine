    
      Multicenter open label, uncontrolled study that enrolled men with metastatic castrate
      resistant prostate cancer previously treated with sipuleucel-T in the androgen dependent
      setting in the Dendreon P-11 study. The study was divided into Active and Long Term Follow-up
      (LTFU) Phases.

      During the Active Phase eligible subjects received one infusion of sipuleucel-T every two
      weeks for for a total of three infusions. Subjects returned to the clinic for Week 6, Week
      10, Month 6, and Month 12 visits. After the Month 12 visit, subjects were to enter the Long
      Term Follow-up Phase, in which they were contacted every 6 months via telephone.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary: Evaluate the immune response generated by sipuleucel-T.

      Secondary: Evaluate the safety of sipuleucel-T and explore the correlation between
      sipuleucel-T immune response and overall survival.
