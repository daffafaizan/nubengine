    
      A single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual comparison, no treatment and
      positive controlled clinical study to determine the SPF of Physiogel Daily Defence Protective
      Day Cream Light as per ISO 24444:2010. The provisional minimal erythemal dose of unprotected
      skin (MEDu) for each subject will be determined before starting the test phase. Once the
      provisional MEDu for a subject has been determined, the three test sites will be demarcated.
      The test product and positive control (P3 reference sunscreen formulation) will be applied to
      two of the three test sites. The other test site will remain unprotected. All three test
      sites will be exposed to UV radiation at the expected MED and subsequently evaluated for
      erythema 16-24 hours after UV exposure.
