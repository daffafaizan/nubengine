      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus when administered with gefitinib in
           patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, alone and in combination with gefitinib, in
           these patients. (Phase I)

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral everolimus once on day 1. Beginning on day 8, patients
           receive oral gefitinib once daily. Beginning on day 22, patients receive oral everolimus
           once daily. Both drugs are then given concurrently for the rest of the treatment.
           Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of everolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral everolimus at the MTD determined in phase I and oral
           gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.
