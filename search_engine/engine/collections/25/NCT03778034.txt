      females. They are closely related to each other. Previous studies showed influences of head
      posture on the mandibular rest position, range of functional movements and the jaw and neck
      muscles work together during rhythmic movements. They affirm that patients with TMD present
      more alterations in head positioning than patients with no dysfunction .

      However, no studies up to date has been evaluated the effect of FHP on TMJ proprioception.
      The proprioceptors in the human TMJ play important key role in identification of mandibular
      position when the teeth are not occluded. TMJ receptors provide the greater afferent activity
      regarding perceptual awareness of joint position and movement . Proper assessment of TMJ
      proprioception may be critical for designing not only rehabilitation but also
      pre-habilitation interventions for patients with FHP aiming to prevent TMD. Therefore, this
      study will be the first one which aims to investigate the effect of FHP on TMJ proprioception
      in post-pubertal females. This study may expand the role of physiotherapy in woman's health.
