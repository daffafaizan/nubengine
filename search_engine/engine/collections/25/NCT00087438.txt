      Primary

        -  Determine whether treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy results in acceptable
           local control (i.e., â‰¥ 80%) in patients with medically inoperable stage I or II
           non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine treatment-related toxicity in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine disease-free survival, overall survival, and patterns of failure in patients
           treated with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 8-14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months.
