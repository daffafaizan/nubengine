      according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3 (ICSD-3), will be studied.
      Additionally, 30 healthy normal sleepers will be included as controls. The duration of study
      participation will be 10 weeks. All subjects will wear an actigraph during week 1 to record
      baseline sleep patterns, followed by 8 weeks of recording with the SleepScore Max. During
      week 10, the subjects will wear the actigraph again to measure post intervention sleep. The
      healthy subjects will be used as a control to test if the SleepScore Max can track sleep well
      as compared to actigraphy. The subjects with chronic insomnia will be randomized into one of
      three groups (30 subjects in each). One of these groups is the test intervention group, in
      which subjects will track their sleep with the SleepScore Max device and will receive
      feedback and coaching from the Smartphone app associated with the device. The other two
      groups will serve as passive and active controls. The passive control group will track their
      sleep using the SleepScore Max device, but without any feedback or coaching. The active
      control group will also be tracking their sleep with the device, without feedback or
      coaching, but they will also undergo online CBTi which is a user guided program to track
      sleep, receive sleep coaching, and initiate behavioral techniques such as tailored sleep
      scheduling and sleep hygiene to help improve sleep.
