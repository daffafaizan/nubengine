      or inappropriate therapies to their defibrillator. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      identify factors which are associated with periods of high ventricular arrhythmia burden by
      looking at gene expression from peripheral blood, in addition to levels of known markers of
      CHF, including catecholamine levels, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin. This study
      hypothesizes that extrinsic or systemic factors play a role in triggering these events, and
      if true should yield candidate proteins which would spawn functional studies to prove a role
      in causation. Additionally, identification of a marker of increased recurrence of events may
      aid in guiding therapy (starting an anti-arrhythmic versus awaiting the next event).
