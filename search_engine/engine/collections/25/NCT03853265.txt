      in the virtual reality (VR) group or the no VR group. Caregivers in the VR group will be
      given VR glasses. They will be instructed how to access the video and use the glasses. The
      child/wearer of the glasses will feel immersed in the three-dimensional environment and be
      able to look around the room as they move down the hallways in the video. The caregiver will
      be encouraged to have the child wear the VR glasses as often as possible and record the
      number of times the video is watched. The caregiver will fill out a "records form" which will
      include the date and time the video was watched. Both groups will then return to the clinic
      for follow up data collection visit.
