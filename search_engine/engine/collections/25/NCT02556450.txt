      spironolactone, may prevent HF by acting on extracellular matrix remodelling, especially in
      patients with active fibrogenesis, identified by high Gal-3 levels. The benefit/risk ratio of
      spironolactone might be superior in patients with a higher compared to lower plasma
      concentrations of Gal-3.
