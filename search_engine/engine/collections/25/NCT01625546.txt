      has antidepressant effects in medically healthy patients with moderate to severe MDD. We plan
      to recruit a sample of 30 medically healthy individuals with MDD who will be randomized to
      examine whether WBH will demonstrate an antidepressant effect when compared to a control-WBH
      condition that will be comprised of very mild heating in the WBH machine (Heckel HT3000). To
      determine acute and sustained effects of WBH on depression severity, the study will include
      basic clinical and psychiatric assessments 5 days before and after WBH and follow-up
      assessments at 2, 4, and 6 weeks following WBH. Additionally, assessments will be conducted
      during the optional open treatment, 1 week following the open treatment, and at the 3 month
      follow up. To assess whether WBH affects how individuals relate to other people in their
      environment, as well as how they spend their time in general and to assess social processes,
      the study will employ the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR). Participants will wear the
      EAR device during the day, while going about their lives over the weekend. This weekend
      monitoring also includes an actigraphy assessment during which participants will wear an
      actigraphy device during their waking and sleeping hours. In addition, blood will be obtained
      at multiple time points to assess plasma concentrations of biological predictors or response
      and mechanism of action for WBH. This study challenges the existing paradigm by determining
      if peripheral afferent sensory pathways can be accessed to treat MDD and thus avoid problems
      of exposing all of the brain to non-selective drugs.
