      conducted in an emergency department only population. Patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department (ED) with signs and symptoms of acute heart failure will be approached for
      enrollment.

      Clinical and laboratory data will be collected to establish product performance and clinical
      concordance to adjudicated clinical diagnosis. Approximately 1800 evaluable subjects at
      geographically dispersed sites in the US will be enrolled in the study.

      Sample collection and testing of clinical samples with the Access Natriuretic Peptide assay
      will be performed under two separate protocols
