      I. To determine maximum tolerated dose-per-fraction for SBRT to the prostate fossa following
      prostatectomy based on acute toxicity (< 90 days).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the acute (< 90 days) toxicities and adverse events associated with
      hypofractionated SBRT when administered to the prostate bed in the post-prostatectomy
      setting.

      II. To describe the late (> 90 days from treatment) toxicities and adverse events associated
      with hypofractionated SBRT when administered to the prostate bed in the post-prostatectomy
      setting.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the patient-reported toxicity/quality of life (QOL) following hypofractionated
      SBRT treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo 5, 10, or 15 fractions of hypofractionated SBRT daily over 1-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 6, and 13 weeks and then
      at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.
