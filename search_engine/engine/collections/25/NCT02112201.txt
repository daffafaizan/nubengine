      juvenile justice system with the triple-threat risk of delinquency, drug abuse, and trauma.
      This is a competing continuation of the ProTeens study (Preventing Drug Abuse & HIV/AIDS in
      Delinquent Youths: An Integrated Intervention) which focused on testing a family-centered
      intervention for treating HIV risk, drug use, and delinquency in boys. The current study will
      adapt the ProTeens intervention for girls. Girls and their parent(s) will be randomly
      assigned to either a family-centered intervention condition (INT; n = 100) or to an active
      comparison condition (n = 100) consisting of group therapy and case management (GCM). The INT
      condition will consist of individually administered HIV preventive intervention for
      adolescent girls involved in the juvenile justice system that integrally addresses
      delinquency, drug abuse, and trauma exposure, along with group-based training and support for
      parents. The girl and parent components will run concurrently for three months. The GCM
      condition will consist of group therapy and case management for girls provided as usual by
      the juvenile justice department. We will examine intervention effects on proximal outcomes
      measured at 12 months, the effects of childhood adversity on proximal outcomes, and the
      mediation of intervention effects. Longer term outcomes will be measured at 24 months. Data
      will be collected through in-person interviews and questionnaires from focal participants and
      their parents, official arrest records, and urinary analysis.
