    
      The company, From the Future and University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) team aimed to
      develop a virtual reality (VR) game that integrated with the features of a specialized
      self-driven treadmill to provide accessible and progressive walking challenges for
      individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP). The game was designed to go beyond typical VR
      research efforts and provide a truly immersive and engaging experience that would motivate
      individuals with high pain-related fear to keep moving.
