      States. Even for early stage disease, the rate of recurrence following surgical resection is
      as high as 50%. Although neoadjuvant therapy, administered before surgery, for early stage
      lung cancer is associated with a survival benefit, it is rarely used due to the systemic
      toxicity of intravenous (IV) cytotoxic chemotherapy. IV immunotherapies are also being
      evaluated in combination with systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant setting. However, only a
      minority of patients respond to immunotherapy. One of the most common reasons for failure of
      immunotherapy is lack of presentation of tumor antigens to the immune system, a problem that
      may be potentially addressed with cytotoxic agents.

      Over the last several years, case series have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of
      delivering cisplatin directly into lung tumors. Given the current knowledge of safety and
      tolerability of intratumoral cisplatin, coupled with the potential to achieve immune priming
      that may help address systemic micrometastases, the investigators postulate that intratumoral
      cisplatin will be well-tolerated, and potentially effective, neoadjuvant therapy for patients
      with early stage, resectable, non-small cell lung cancer.
