    
      This is an open-label, non-randomised study designed to provide continued access to AZD1775
      for eligible patients with advanced solid tumours who have previously completed an AZD1775
      clinical pharmacology study and to investigate the safety of a once daily monotherapy regimen
      of AZD1775 in patients with advanced solid tumours.

      All patients who completed 1 of the parent clinical pharmacology studies are eligible for
      this study after a washout period of at least 4 days (minimum duration defined in the parent
      study protocol) and meet the eligibility criteria specified in this protocol. Patients who
      discontinue early from the parent study will be considered by the Sponsor and treating
      physician on a case-by-case basis.

      During the study, patients will continue to receive AZD1775 as long as they are benefiting
      from treatment in the Investigator's opinion and do not meet any other discontinuation
      criteria.
