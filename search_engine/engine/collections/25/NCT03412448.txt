      intensity of chronic pain 6 months and 1 year after cardiac surgery. Data on the level of
      post-operative pain experienced on days 1 to 4, at the time of surgery, as well as opioid
      consumption, adjuvant pain treatments and other variables of interest that are currently
      recorded prospectively at time of surgery will be culled from patient charts. Additionally,
      the possibility of continued opioid use by patients at 6 months post-surgery will be
      evaluated.
