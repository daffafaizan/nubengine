      of whole blood with a proprietary cytokine followed by the quantitative detection of
      interferon-gamma using an immunoassay. NK Vue is intended to be used for the monitoring of
      the immune status of individuals. Measurement of NK cell activity could be a useful tool for
      assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell
      activity has been shown to be affected.
