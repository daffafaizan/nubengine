      is not FDA-approved for this use so this is a research study. The machine has been redesigned
      to see if doctors can see smaller structures and use a lower radiation dose.

      An x-ray dye will be injected through a needle in the subject's arm before the test. The FDA
      has approved this dye for other uses, but not for this exam, so the use of the dye is also
      research.

      The breast CT device will take multiple pictures of the subject's breast and create a 3-D
      image of the breast. It does not compress or squash the breast like a mammogram.
