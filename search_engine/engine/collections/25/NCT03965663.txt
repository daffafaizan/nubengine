      subject. For subjects of group 2 the length of the initial phase depends on the progression
      of the re-innervation. The initial phase ends, when the subject can perceive the tactile
      stimulate at the re-innervated area of the skin. During the initial phase, all subjects get a
      new prosthesis. To minimize the adjusting to the new prosthesis only a new socket, which
      houses the vibro-tactile Feedback system, is fabricated and the old prosthetic food is
      re-used. After a period of 3 weeks minimum, where the subjects use the new prosthesis, a gait
      analysis and an assessment of the sensitivity of the skin at the stump are performed.

      Subsequently the intervention phase starts and the vibro-tactile feedback system is
      activated. For a period of 6 months the subjects use the new prostheses with the integrated
      vibro-tactile feedback system in daily living. After 2 and 4 months, the subjects visit the
      study site for an assessment of the sensitivity of the skin. After 6 months a second gait
      analysis and an other assessment of the sensitivity of the skin a the stump are performed.
      Afterwards the vibro-tactile feedback-system is disabled.

      During the observing phase the subjects use the prosthesis with the disabled vibro-tactile
      feedback system for 4 months.

      During all three phases the subjects answer the questionnaires every 2 months.
