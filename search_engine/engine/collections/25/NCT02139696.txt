      In multiple sclerosis (MS), significant pathology correlating to disease progression, to
      expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and to cognitive decline, takes place outside the
      plaque areas, i.e. in areas of normal appearing white matter and gray matter.
      Neuropathological studies suggest that mechanisms involved in this widespread pathology
      include activation of microglial cells, oxidative stress and deficiency in mitochondrial
      functions. Activated microglia can be detected in vivo with a translocator protein (TSPO),
      expressed in activated, but not resting microglia) binding radioligands and positron emission
      tomography (PET). 11Carbon-PK11195 radioligand is one such radioligand. Importantly, the
      possible effect of MS therapies on microglial activity can be evaluated in patients in vivo
      with PET-imaging performed before and after the treatment.
