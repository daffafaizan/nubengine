      polymorphism rs2274333 (A/G), salivary zinc ion concentration and BMI.

      Furthermore, we apply direct measures of the gustatory system activation following
      stimulation with PROP, obtained by electrophysiological recordings from the tongue of
      subjects classified for taster status, genotyped for the specific receptor gene (TAS2R38),
      and in which papilla density was determined.
