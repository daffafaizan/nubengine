      the results will demonstrate that inexpensive DNA testing could help dieters predict whether
      they will have greater weight loss success on a Low Carb or a Low Fat diet. Commensurate with
      increasing scientific interest in personalized medicine approaches to intervention
      development, this would provide an example of the potentially substantial health impacts that
      could be obtained through understanding specific gene-environment interactions that have been
      anticipated from the unraveling of the human genome.

      Mobile App Sub-Study-For the purpose of augmenting adherence to high vegetable consumption in
      both diet groups, we will develop a theory-based mobile app to increase vegetable consumption
      through goal-setting, self-monitoring, and social comparison. Participants from both diet
      groups with iPhones will be re-randomized to receive the app at either months 4-5 or months
      7-8. The first phase during months 4-7 will be used to compare the effect of a mobile app
      (intervention) vs. no mobile app (waiting-list control). The a priori hypothesis is that
      vegetable consumption will increase among those who receive the app in both diet arms. The
      investigator and outcomes assessor will be blinded to group assignment. Intention-to-treat
      analysis will be used.
