      donor sites using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and static 2-point discrimination
      (2PD) test. The test points were at the centers of the radial and ulnar portions of the thumb
      pulp and the donor sites separately. Each area was tested 3 times with a Dellon-Mackinnon
      discriminator. Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before
      proceeding to another lower value.
