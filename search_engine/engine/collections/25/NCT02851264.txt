      improving patient outcomes.Optical enhancement technology can serves in the diagnosis of GI
      neoplasia. However, its performance in ESN has not yet been reported.The aims of the present
      study is:

        1. To investigate the diagnosing value of optical enhancement technology for early
           esophageal squamous neoplasia.

        2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual
           chromoendoscopy with optical enhancement technology .
