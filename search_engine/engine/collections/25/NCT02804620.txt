    
      This two-phase study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing usual care to a
      12-month peer-led DSMS intervention designed to improve long-term diabetes-related health
      outcomes.

      In Phase 1, the research team will implement a 30-hour peer leader training (PLT) program
      recruiting adults with type 2 diabetes and equipping them with the diabetes knowledge,
      facilitation strategies, and communication skills to deliver a DSMS intervention. In Phase 2,
      the researchers will conduct the peer support intervention, referred to as the Peer-Led,
      Empowerment-based Approach to Self-management Efforts in Diabetes (PLEASED). Patients
      randomized to the PLEASED arm will be paired with a peer leader and receive 12 weekly
      contacts (face-to-face and telephone support) from their peer leader (PL) in the first 3
      months followed by 18 bi-weekly telephone support contacts over the last 9 months.

      The goal of the PLEASED intervention is to help patients improve glycemic control and
      diabetes specific QOL and sustain these health benefits over the long-term. To achieve this
      goal, PLs will address 3 key functions of peer support that include assisting patients in the
      daily management of their diabetes, providing social and emotional support, and linking
      patients to clinical care resources.

      Participants' inclusion criteria are: to (1) have type 2 diabetes, (2) be 21 years, (3) speak
      English or Vietnamese or any languages that their peer leaders speak, (4) be willing to be
      matched with a peer leader, and (5) have a personal land line telephone or mobile phone.

      Peer leaders' inclusion criteria are: (1) have diabetes, (2) be 21 years, (3) speak English,
      (4) have transportation to attend training, (5) be willing to commit to a 30-hour training
      program, and (6) have a land line telephone or mobile phone (7) have a self-reported HbA1c of
      8% or less.
