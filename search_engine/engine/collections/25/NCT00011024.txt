      complementary medical modalities that have been used in children with cerebral palsy by
      practitioners in an attempt to decelerate the complications from the neurologic insult and
      resultant muscle imbalance. The specific aims are: 1) The development and incorporation of
      two alternative modalities (osteopathic manipulation and acupuncture) into available services
      in southern Arizona for individuals with cerebral palsy. 2) The evaluation of the uptake of
      and compliance with the two modalities in the clinical services for cerebral palsy. 3)
      Conduct pilot studies of each of the two modalities to determine their efficacy in decreasing
      the degree of muscle tension in children with spastic cerebral palsy.
