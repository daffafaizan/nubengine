      neuropsychiatric complication that is characterized by sudden change of mental status,
      inattention, disorientation and memory impairment with fluctuations of symptoms during the
      day. Delirium causes increased morbidity and mortality, decreased postoperative functional
      activity and may predispose to dementia.

      Perioperative pain may be an important predisposing factor to delirium. Intravenous opioids
      have been widely used to relieve patients with hip fracture from pain, but they have a lot of
      complications and have been correlated with delirium as well. Fascia Iliaca compartment block
      is a peripheral compartment nerve block that is used in hip surgeries. Use of this
      compartment nerve block to protect geriatric patients from delirium has not been studied.

      The objective of this trial will be to establish whether the ultrasound-guided suprainguinal
      fascia iliaca compartment block is capable of protecting geriatric patients with hip fracture
      from delirium as compared to placebo
