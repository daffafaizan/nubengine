      prevalent. In a systematic review, preoperative anemia was found in 24 +/- 9% and
      postoperative anemia in 51% +/- 10%. Perioperative anemia was associated with a blood
      transfusion rate of 45 +/- 25%, postoperative infections, poorer physical functioning and
      recovery, and increased length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality. Although the best
      transfusion trigger in elective patients remains unknown, restrictive transfusion protocols
      are recommended and avoidance of blood transfusion if possible.

      The only non-systemic modality capable of reducing blood loss before it occurs is a bipolar
      sealer (Aquamantys). By pre-incisional treatment of the soft tissue, bleeding (and
      potentially total blood loss and transfusion) is reduced without tissue charring.

      Previously studies on the use of Aquamantys in primary knee arthroplasty have had various
      outcomes, the most recent being negative while the former 3 were positive regarding reduction
      in blood loss, drop in hgb and transfusions. No published date exist on potential outcomes in
      revision knee arthroplasty where blood loss and transfusion needs exceeds that of primary
      total knee arthroplasty by far. Aquamantys hence would theoretically benefit the most in a
      revision setting without the use of a tourniquet - and would be an interesting modality in
      modern contemporary fast-track revision if shown effective despite/on top of the use of
      additional blood saving modalities. The present study is therefore motivated by investigating
      this aspect.
