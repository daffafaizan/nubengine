    
      A randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      crofelemer in providing prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult patients with solid tumors receiving
      targeted cancer therapy containing regimens. Diarrhea grading will be done according to the
      National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Ver. 5.0).

      Randomization will be at a 1:1 ratio with subjects randomized either to crofelemer 125 mg
      delayed-release tablets or matching placebo tablets administered orally twice daily with or
      without food. Randomization will be stratified by the type of targeted cancer therapy and by
      tumor type. Placebo and crofelemer treatment will be initiated concomitantly with the
      administration of targeted cancer therapy-containing regimens.

      The Stage I double-blind placebo-controlled primary treatment phase will be the first 12-week
      period to accommodate targeted cancer therapy with approximately three (3) cycle chemotherapy
      regimens (if needed) over the inclusive 12-week period after initiation of crofelemer or
      placebo treatment in Stage I.

      After completing the Stage I treatment phase (12 weeks), and after the LPLV of the primary
      Stage I treatment phase, the primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed. The subjects
      will have the option to remain on their assigned treatment arm and reconsented to enter into
      the Stage II extension phase. Reconsent will be required to enter into Stage II. For subjects
      who do not reconsent, Visit 5 will be the last study visit. Subjects who enter into the Stage
      II extension phase will continue on their originally assigned study treatment commenced at
      the beginning of Stage I.
