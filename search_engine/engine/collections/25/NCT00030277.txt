        -  Determine the ability of Sonablate to focus ultrasound waves for the purpose of
           selectively destroying prostate cancer tissue, with resultant drop in PSA levels to
           below 0.5 ng/mL and negative biopsy for cancer cells, in patients with locally recurrent
           prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment failure (brachytherapy vs
      post-external beam radiotherapy).

      A probe is inserted into the rectum. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy using
      the Sonablate system is delivered to the prostate tissue over approximately 2 hours. Patients
      with residual cancer lesion (by biopsy), PSA greater than 0.5 ng/mL or increasing PSA levels
      taken 2 months apart, visible prostate tissue on ultrasound, and no local or distant
      metastases after day 90 undergo retreatment with HIFU.

      Patients are followed at 2, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
