    
      The ATTEMPT (Adolescent Type 1 diabetes Treatment with SGLT2i for hyperglycEMia &
      hyPerfilTration Trial) is designed to evaluate the impact of Dapagliflozin versus placebo in
      combination with insulin therapy. This trial will assess detailed renal mechanistic
      evaluations, with direct measurement of GFR, to understand the important physiologic impacts
      of SGLT2 inhibition on the early onset manifestations and progression of diabetes
      complications within this age group.

      Fundamentally, the ATTEMPT trial will provide essential information in establishing a
      framework for this young cohort to evaluate key physiologic, mechanistic and metabolic
      outcomes.
