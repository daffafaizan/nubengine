      pain intensity may increase during acute episodes of exacerbation. Fifty (50) patients in
      acute exacerbation of COPD will be included in the emergency department of CHU Grenoble Alpes
      and Hôpital du Sacré Coeur de Montréal. The intensity and characteristics of pain will be
      evaluated from the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and the Brief Pain Inventory
      (BPI). Assessment of respiratory status, anxiety and depression, and clinical and biological
      data, defining the severity of exacerbation, will also be collected. A 30-day follow-up
      visit, after a return to the stable state of COPD, allowed the realization of Respiratory
      Functional Exploration and the same questionnaires.
