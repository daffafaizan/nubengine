      during the acute phase of ACS is effective in reducing ischaemic events. The combination
      regimen of anticoagulation with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) strategy is more effective
      than either treatment alone. The most widely used parenteral anticoagulation agent in ACS
      patients is enoxaparin (1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously twice daily).

      Rivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant with potent anti-Xa activity, which might be an
      attractive alternative drug to enoxaparin. In fact, rivaroxaban was consistently shown to be
      non-inferior to enoxaparin therapy aimed to reduce the event of recurrent venous
      thromboembolism. Moreover, the bleeding risk of low dose of rivaroxaban is low and acceptable
      (1.0-2.5%) during the acute phase of ACS as shown by ATLAS ACS-TIMI 46 Trial, and the
      bleeding risk of enoxaparin during the acute phase of ACS was 4.3% as shown in a
      meta-analysis.

      We thus hypothesized that the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban during the acute phase of
      ACS is non-inferior to enoxaparin and designed this prospective, randomized, open-label,
      active-controlled, multicenter study in participants with ACS (STEMI or NSTEMI or unstable
      angina). All eligible participants receiving background treatment of aspirin plus clopidogrel
      or ticagrelor will be randomly assigned to either receive oral rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily
      or oral rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily SC until hospital
      discharge or 12 hours before revascularization therapy for a maximum of 8 days.
