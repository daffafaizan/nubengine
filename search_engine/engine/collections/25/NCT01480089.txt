      for pain management have remained essentially unchanged over the last 10 years (3). Current
      acute pain-management strategies include 1.) Epidural or intrathecal opioids 2.)
      Patient-controlled devices delivering systemic opioids and 3.) Regional techniques such as
      peripheral nerve blocks and post-incisional infiltration with local anesthetics.

      The use of epidural and systemic opioids results in significant side-effects such as
      post-operative nausea and ileus which often lead to increased hospital stay. The literature
      supporting the benefit of preincisional infiltration with anesthetics remains equivocal.

      A recently published study describes the use of intraperitoneal Ropivacaine (2mh/kg) during
      laparoscopic appendectomy(4). The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      study using Ropivacaine (vs placebo) injected through the laparoscopic ports prior to the
      start of the appendectomy in 63 patients(4).

      Patients treated with Ropivacaine had a significant decrease in visual analog pain scores
      post-operatively and had decreased narcotic use during their hospital stay compared to
      placebo. There were no side-effects found with the one-time use of the Ropivacaine.

      The results of the above study and review of an additional 24 randomized controlled trials
      conducted from 1993-2003 are not felt to be generalizable to pelvic surgery where port
      placement and the operative procedures vary significantly. Hence this study was undertaken to
      investigate the role of intraperitoneal Ropivacaine as an adjuvant to muscle relaxants and
      narcotics at the time of pelvic surgery.
