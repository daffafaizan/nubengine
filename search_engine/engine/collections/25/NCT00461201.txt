      demand and their capacity to solve things is limited by lack of time. Many organizational
      interventions have been planned to solve this problem. One of these is to imply the nurse
      professional to solve and control health problems that traditionally were the doctor's job.
      So, to demonstrate the nursing care is as effective as the medical care, we will compare,
      among both collectives, the 'quality' of care received by patients who ask an appointment for
      the same day.
