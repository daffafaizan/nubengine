      evaluating safety, tolerability and impact on the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers,
      overweight and obese adults. This study is designed as a FIH, Phase I, daily oral single
      dose, clinical trial evaluating safety, tolerability and the impact on the gut microbiota
      following introduction of Xla1 performed in 2 parts:

        -  Part 1: An open phase in normal weight healthy volunteers (HV) receiving all Xla1.

        -  Part 2: A randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in overweight or
           obese (stage 1) adult patients receiving either Xla1 or placebo.

      The following objectives will be addressed in the program: 1) the primary objective of the
      study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Xla1 in Healthy adult Volunteers (HV) [part
      1], and, subsequently, in overweight and Stage I obese adults [part 2]. 2) the secondary
      objectives comprise additional evaluation of the effects of Xla1 on subject's intestinal
      microbiome ecology and evaluation of the engraftment of Xla1 in the gastrointestinal tract
      (GIT).
