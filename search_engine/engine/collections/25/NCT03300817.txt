    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immunogenicity of the vaccine, assessed at week 12, based on the increase in IgG anti-MUC1
      antibody titer over the pre-vaccination levels.

      II. Safety, assessed throughout the trial and continued observation for 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore potential differences, if any, in the immunogenicity of the vaccine (as
      assessed at week 12 by the IgG anti-MUC1 antibody titer ratio) in current versus (vs.) former
      smokers.

      II. To evaluate pre-vaccination levels of circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
      and correlate with the ability to respond to the vaccine.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore immune response at week 24. II. To explore the relationship between chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status at pre-registration and immune response in
      current versus former smokers.

      III. To explore the impact of the MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine (MUC1/Poly-ICLC vaccine) on
      inflammation-related high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      levels.

      IV. To explore the impact of baseline levels of hsCRP and IL-6 on the ability to successfully
      vaccinate with MUC1/Poly-ICLC.

      V. To establish a biospecimen repository archive: frozen peripheral blood live cells and
      plasma for future more detailed and comprehensive immunologic assays, including direct
      testing of anti-MUC1 T cell immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine subcutaneously (SC) at weeks 0, 2, and 10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at week 28.
