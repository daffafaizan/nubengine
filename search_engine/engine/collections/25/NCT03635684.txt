      demonstrated. It is mainly used in Palliative Care and Geriatrics when a venous line is not
      available. It is a simple and comfortable technique that allows to administer solutes and /
      or medications continuously or discontinuously in the subcutaneous tissue.

      A number of drugs of different therapeutic classes, including morphine, have a good level of
      scientific evidence for use by this route.

      Subcutaneous Acetaminophen injection is being used in some medical centers, mainly in Europe,
      despite the lack of definite evidence on its efficacy. It is sometimes accused of causing
      pain at the injection site; it seems that this is not the case if it is infused slowly, over
      20 minutes to 30 minutes. There is no report of serious local effects.

      The consultation palliative care team at HÃ´tel-Dieu de France (HDF) has used subcutaneous
      Acetaminophen infusions repeatedly without adverse effects since January 2014.

      This study aims to quantify the degree of effectiveness of subcutaneous Acetaminophen
      infusions for pain or fever in Geriatrics and Palliative Care, as well as determining its
      safety.
