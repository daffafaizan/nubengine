      arteriovenous fistula (mNT-BBAVF) and the standard brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula
      (BCAVF) for long-term hemodialysis patients. Briefly, in mNT-BBAVF, a side-to-side
      anastomosis between the brachial artery and non-transposed proximal basilic vein is disposed,
      followed by the ligation of the vein above anastomosis. All the perforating in the surgical
      field should be ligated. All patients will be followed up for 12 months after surgeries. The
      outcomes includes: hemodynamic parameters (vessels's diameters, blood flow velocities and
      blood volumes) detected by ultrasound in 12 months, Complications in 1-month and 12-month,
      primary patency and secondary patency (cumulative patency).
