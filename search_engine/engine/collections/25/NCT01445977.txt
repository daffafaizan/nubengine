      been FDA cleared for treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD) and conductive hearing loss
      (CHL). The Sonitus SoundBite Hearing System consists of an In the Mouth (ITM) component an
      external microphone component, worn behind the ear (BTE), a calibration interface cable and
      PC-controlled calibration software for subject calibration. A charger is also provided to
      charge the ITM and the BTE. The objective of this multi-sites observational study is to
      assess the long-term patient use of the Sonitus SoundBite Hearing System.
