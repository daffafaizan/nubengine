      A sample size of 104 patients was calculated to obtain at list 25% reduction of fentanyl
      usage in QLBII group with 0,05% significance and power of 0,8. Consenting patients, scheduled
      to KTX procedure under general anaesthesia will be randomly assigned (1:1) according to the
      computer -generated randomization list with permuted blocks (block sizes: 20, 20, 24, 40) to
      receive 20ml of 0,25% Bupivacaine with epinephrine ipsilaterally to the operation side in
      QLBII or TAPB after the general anaesthesia induction and before the surgery starts. All the
      blocks will be performed in the supine patients position, under ultrasound guidance for both
      techniques. The correct spread of injectate will be confirmed with ultrasound.
