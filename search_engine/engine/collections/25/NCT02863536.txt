      reducing the rate of recurrence of BV in women cured with vaginal metronidazole and to
      compare the results of the treatment with the rate of recurrence reported in appropriate
      selected international literature. Therefore, the Polybactum® early administration should be
      able to modify the basal individual risk of BV recurrence.
