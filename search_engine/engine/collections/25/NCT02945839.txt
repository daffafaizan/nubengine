      migraine treatment program on the quality of life for migraineurs with frequent and disabling
      headaches who present to the ED. The intervention (PM+PMR) will combine acute treatment,
      migraine preventive medication-topiramate, and the APP with PMR. Data from patients in the
      intervention group will be compared with data from an enhanced usual care (EUC) group to
      examine the efficacy of the combined treatment effects.
