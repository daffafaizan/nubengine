      I. Assess the initial safety of the CA for lung tumors less than or equal to 3.5 cm in size
      including acute toxicity (30 days).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate local control.

      II. To assess physical function for this cohort of patients.

      III. To evaluate the impact of treatment on generic and disease-specific quality of life.

      IV. To obtain pilot data useful for the design of a subsequent phase II or randomized phase
      II trial.

      V. Evaluate changes in pulmonary function at 3 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo computed tomography (CT)-guided CA

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24,
      36, 48, and 60 months.
