      anaesthesia. Administration of dexmedetomidine during the preoperative period has been
      demonstrated to reduce the requirement of opioid analgesics and other sedative and hypnotic
      drugs.Therefore, the study is designed to measure the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine
      premedication on the propofol dose requirement and bispectral index at loss of consciousness.
