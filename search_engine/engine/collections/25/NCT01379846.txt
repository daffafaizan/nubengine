    
      Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) is one of the major causes of infectious meningitis in
      children, and can also cause sepsis, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis, pneumonia and
      myelitis.

      TAK-816 is a conjugated Hib vaccine being tested in healthy infants aged 3-6 months at the
      time of the first dose.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (immunogenicity) and safety of
      TAK-816 (10 ϻg/0.5 mL) in comparison with ActHIB (Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine) as a
      control.

      In addition, the efficacy (immunogenicity) and safety of Absorbed Diphtheria-Purified
      Pertussis-Tetanus Combined (DPT-TAKEDA) vaccine when TAK-816 and DPT vaccine are administered
      concomitantly will also be investigated.

      For the Primary Immunization Phase of this study: three doses of TAK-816 or ActHIB 10 µg/0.5
      mL and DPT-TAKEDA 0.5 mL will be administered at 4-week intervals over 8 weeks (Visit 1, 2,
      3). At4 weeks after the third dose, a follow-up observation and evaluation will be made
      (Visit 4).

      For the Booster Vaccination Phase of this study: a single dose of TAK-816 or ActHIB 10 µg/0.5
      mL and DPT-TAKEDA 0.5 mL will be given at 52 weeks after the third dose (Visit 5). At 4 weeks
      after the fourth dose, a follow-up observation and evaluation will be made (Visit 6).
