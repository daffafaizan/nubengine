    
      HCR040 is an investigational medicinal product whose active substance is HC016, allogeneic
      adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      administration of HCR040 using: a) two sequential escalating doses administered 96 hours
      post-injury to participants with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS); and b) the determined maximum tolerated dose administered 96 hours post-injury to
      participants with moderate to severe ARDS. The study also includes initial exploration of
      efficacy.

      Treatment is administered by intravenous injection.

      The study has been divided into two phases:

      Phase 1 (open label): 6 participants with moderate to severe ARDS will be included in 2
      sequential cohorts.

      Phase 2 (randomized, controlled, double-blind): 20 participants with moderate to severe ARDS
      will be randomly divided into two groups (control and treated).
