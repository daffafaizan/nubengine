      system that commonly occur in the head and neck of children. LMs are considered a rare or
      orphan disease which causes complications including pain, ulceration, secondary infection,
      infiltration of other organs, and death. Current therapies involve surgical excision or
      methods of chemical or physical destruction of portions of lesions. No therapies are
      uniformly effective and all have the risk of significant adverse events. We recently
      witnessed almost complete resolution of a LM lesion in a child who was treated with
      sildenafil oral therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. We have subsequently evaluated
      additional subjects who improved with sildenafil. The goal of this clinical research trial is
      to document the benefit or absence of benefit of sildenafil therapy for LMs and identify
      which type of patient will benefit from sildenafil. This study is a double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial which involves precise documentation of volume changes associated
      with therapy or placebo by using MRI segmentation techniques. We will also observe and
      document the clinical response to sildenafil or placebo using clinical evaluation scores and
      surveys. The results of the study should identify characteristics of LM lesions which may
      suggest a beneficial response to sildenafil therapy. Sildenafil has very low risk of side
      effects in the dosage used in this trial. Documentation of an effective response of LMs to
      sildenafil will accelerate the interest in, and the ability to understand, the mechanisms of
      LM formation and treatment.
