      regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. A reason, being their capacity for multipotent
      differentiation, tissue repair and immune modulation.

      To evaluate a physiological concentration level of ASCs in human fat we investigate two
      extraction methods of fat, excision and liposuction. This is done through a standardised
      setup with patients acting their own control. The study is carried out in accordance with the
      guidelines provided by the International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science and
      International Society for Cellular Therapy.
