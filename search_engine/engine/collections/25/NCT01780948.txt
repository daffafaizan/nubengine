    
      Population : Thai postrenal transplantation recipient who received everolimus and have
      hypercholesterolemia in posttransplantation clinic at Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn
      University.

      Study Design : Experimental study, Two-sample crossover study Sample size calculation :N = 18
      Primary outcome : 12-hour area under the time concentration curve of everolimus Secondary
      outcome : renal function (serum creatinine, creatinine clearance)

      Method :

        1. Patients will random to everolimus or everolimus with atorvastatin 20 mg arm for 1
           month.

        2. Take blood sample for everolimus concentration at time 0,0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 8,
           12 hour

        3. After first blood sample, patients will received everolimus only for 1 month (wash out
           period)

        4. Patients will switch to another arm eg.patient who had received everolimus will switch
           to everolimus with atorvastatin 20 mg for 1 month

        5. Take blood sample for everolimus concentration at time 0,0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 8,
           12 hour

        6. Everolimus level will analyse for 12-hour AUC of everolimus.
