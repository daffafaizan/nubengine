    
      Open-label investigation of 10 individuals seeking inpatient treatment for severe and
      enduring anorexia nervosa. In addition to standard inpatient treatment, patients receive one
      FMT per week for 4 weeks, with follow-ups at 8 weeks and 6 months. Patients will receive 30
      mL of healthy fecal microbial preparation (OpenBiome, FMP30) into the upper GI tract via a
      nasogastric tube weekly for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are to determine safety, feasibility,
      tolerability, and acceptability of FMT for the treatment of AN. Secondary outcomes are: to
      determine preliminary efficacy as indexed by weight gain and weight retention over follow-up;
      to assess positive change in psychological metrics; to measure the efficiency of microbial
      transfer from the FMT material to the recipient intestinal microbiota; and to determine the
      duration of this effect via repeat stool sampling paired with 16S rRNA gene and/or shallow
      shotgun metagenomics.
