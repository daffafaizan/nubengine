    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, outpatient study in COPD
      subjects who are discharged from the hospital following a COPD exacerbation. Subjects who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments. Arformoterol tartrate
      inhalation solution 15 mcg (BROVANA) will be administered BID (morning and evening,
      approximately 12 hours between doses) using a standard jet nebulizer with a face mask or
      mouthpiece connected to an air compressor. Tiotropium 18 mcg (SPIRIVA) will be administered
      QD (morning) via the HandiHalerÂ®.

      Study medications will be dispensed to the subject at Visit 1. The objective of the study is
      to determine the comparative effectiveness of arformoterol and tiotropium on
      re-hospitalization and to assess safety in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      subjects recovering from hospitalization for an acute exacerbation.
