    
      The City of Warrensville Heights and The Cleveland Clinic are combining efforts to address
      the paucity of fresh and nutritious foods accessible to seniors in the Warrensville Heights
      community through a new program at the city's Civic and Senior Center. This program will
      combine healthy lifestyle education with nutrition demonstration using recipes that can be
      prepared in a blender. These recipes have been designed to be simple, delicious and easy to
      eat, and include smoothies, soups and even a few desserts! Our ultimate goal is to use both
      education and demonstration to promote a mindset change regarding community members'
      abilities to eat healthy.

      The population in the Warrensville Heights community is aging, and there is a high prevalence
      of chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and kidney disease. A recent
      Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) identified engagement and participation in the
      promotion and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle as a major area for improvement. Currently
      there is very limited access to healthy foods in the immediate community of Warrensville
      Heights, and in many cases, the transportation costs required for residents to access those
      healthy foods is often financially unfeasible. It is clear from this CHNA that both access to
      and education about healthy food options is sorely needed in this community.

      The Center for Lifestyle Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute has a proven
      track record of engaging patients in healthy living and eating through education, live
      cooking demonstrations / hands-on cooking classes, exercise and stress management programs.
      In response to the CHNA and in collaboration with 12th District Representative, John E.
      Barnes, Jr., the BLENDS study will extend our expertise to the Warrensville Heights
      community.
