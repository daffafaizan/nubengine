    
      Patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) undergoing endoscopic therapy through our Barrett's
      Esophagus Unit will be approached for study enrollment. Patients with no endoscopic evidence
      of BE will be considered for the study. Surveillance biopsies will be obtained per standard
      clinical protocol and reviewed to confirm absence of intestinal metaplasia. Patients who have
      achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) will be enrolled in the study
      and will undergo the NvisionÂ® Imaging System (VLE). Patients enrolled in the study will
      undergo clinical follow-up consisting of surveillance endoscopy every 3 months for 1 year.
      Surveillance endoscopy intervals may be prolonged to every 6 months in the second year, and
      annually thereafter. At each follow-up visit, endoscopic data will be collected to determine
      if patients remain in CRIM or show evidence of recurrent disease. Patients will be followed
      for 1 year (endpoint 1) and 3 years (endpoint 2).
