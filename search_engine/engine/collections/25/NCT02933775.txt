    
      A single arm open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      engraftment potential of CAR-CD19 T cells in patients with CD19-positive malignant B cell
      leukemia and lymphoma. All subjects will receive CAR-CD19 T cells infusion.

      Primary objectives:

        1. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
           with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector (referred to as "CAR-CD19 T" cells).

        2. Determine the duration of in vivo survival of CAR-CD19 T cells.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CAR-CD19 T
           cells infusions.

        2. To determine the amplification and survival of CAR-CD19 T 4-1BB:CD3ζ and CD28:CD3ζ as
           measured by the relative engraftment levels of CAR-CD19 T 4-1BB:CD3ζ and CD28:CD3ζ cells
           over time.

        3. Estimate relative trafficking of CAR-CD19 T cells to tumors in bone marrow and
           lymphnodes.

        4. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19,
           and assess correlation with loss of detectable CAR-CD19 T (loss of engraftment).

        5. Determine the relative subsets of CAR-CD19 T cells.
