      outpatients at Beijing Ditan Hospital were eligible for the study. The diagnosis of chronic
      hepatitis C was based on the detection of anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) by a third
      generation microparticle chemoluminescence assay and HCV RNA by a reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Patients were required to have evidence of HCV
      infection for at least 6 months.

      patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (Pegasys®; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 135 or
      180 µg by subcutaneous injection once weekly.

      Among treatment-naive patients, the duration of therapy was determined by HCV genotype and
      the on-treatment virological response at week 4, 12 or 24. Genotype 1 infected patients were
      assigned to complete a 48~72 weeks of treatment, and those who had not responded to a
      previous course of therapy were assigned to complete a total of 72 weeks of treatment.

      Dose adjustment: In the event that a patient did not achieve an RVR at week 4, and provided
      they were not experiencing adverse events, the daily dosage of ribavirin was increased by 200
      mg or 300 mg, and in the case of those who started treatment on the lower dosage of
      peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) or conventional interferon alfa, the dosage of peginterferon
      alfa-2a (40KD) was increased from 135 µg/week to 180 µg/week. In the event of adverse events
      that could not be ameliorated with symptomatic treatment, the dose of peginterferon alfa-2a
      (40KD) was reduced from 180 µg/week to 135 µg/week and of ribavirin by 200 mg/day or 300
      mg/day.

      Quantitative HCV RNA testing was performed before starting treatment (week 0), at week 4, 12,
      and 24, and at the end of treatment, and 24 weeks after completion of treatment using a
      commercially available real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR kit. The primary efficacy
      end-point was achievement of SVR defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of a 24-week
      untreated follow-up period. The percentage of patients with undetectable HCV RNA (<500
      copies/mL) at week 4 (RVR), and 12 were secondary efficacy endpoints.
