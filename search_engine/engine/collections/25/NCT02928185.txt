      Coping Together manuals based on recommendations of HSCT patients, CGs, dyads and clinicians
      (for Phase 1 only). For this study, CG is defined as spouse, partner, family member, friend,
      colleague, or neighbor who can, but do not necessarily live together, and provide
      uncompensated care. A dyad is defined as a combination of a patient and their designated CG.
      Dyads can review the Coping Together manuals individually or jointly, but will be interviewed
      together.

      Part 1 will capture diverse perspectives of HSCT patients, CGs, dyads and clinicians using
      individual (patients, CGs, clinicians) and dyadic (dyads) interviews for the preliminary
      adaptation of the Coping Together manuals.

      Part 2 will explore the experiences of HSCT patients, CGs and dyads with HSCT CT, which will
      be the HSCT-modified version of the Coping Together manuals, using individual (patients, CGs)
      and dyadic (dyads) interviews to refine the HSCT CT manuals.
