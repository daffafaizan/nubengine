      the GSV using radiofrequency ablation or laser is associated with improved recovery compared
      with conventional surgery. Furthermore, radiofrequency ablation (using the Closurefast
      device) has been shown to cause less pain and require less analgesic intake than laser
      treatment. At the time the 3 RF study was conceived there were two other radiofrequency
      devices that were marketed to have theoretical advantages over the Closurefast technique. All
      three devices were in use in clinical practice (including at Worcestershire Royal Hospital)
      in 2013. The initial study focused on clinical results (up to 12 months) and anatomical
      results (up to 6 months) and remains the only clinical trial to date that has directly
      compared the outcomes of radiofrequency thermal ablation devices.

      This second (long term) phase of the study aims to assess which of the radiofrequency venous
      ablation modalities studied in the original 3RF study (Venefit (Closurefast), vs.
      Radiofrequency induced Thermal Therapy vs. Endovenous Radiofrequency) is most effective in
      relieving patients' symptoms and signs from varicose veins disease, and in maintaining
      absence of reflux in the treated vein segment (of the great saphenous vein (GSV)) 5 years
      following surgery.
