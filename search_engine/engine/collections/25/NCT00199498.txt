    
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of RV pacing site on LV systolic
      function as measured by LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction).

      Secondary objectives of this trial include:

        1. to compare the effect of RVSeptal(RVS) versus RVApical(RVA)pacing on other indices of
           systolic and diastolic LV function

        2. to compare the rate of heart failure-related hospitalization between RVS versus RVA
           pacing

        3. to compare new-onset atrial fibrillation and stroke rates between RVS versus RVA pacing

        4. to assess the effect of RVA versus RVS pacing on quality of life and functional capacity

        5. to compare the rate of successful pacemaker lead implantation, complications and chronic
           electrical performance of RVS versus RVA pacing
