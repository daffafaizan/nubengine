      surgical management of EPF was the only treatment option. Now there are multiple studies
      demonstrating the effectiveness of misoprostol for treating EPF. Most of the studies
      investigating medical treatment of EPF have evaluated efficacy at one week. We have found
      that many women do not want to wait for one week for an outcome of their medical treatment,
      and want resolution sooner. This has hampered the widespread utilization of medical therapy
      in our institution.

      We propose a regimen of medical treatment for EPF with expeditious follow-up. We want to
      demonstrate the relative efficacy of two medication regimens for treatment of EPF by
      performing a randomized trial. One regimen will be 800μg buccal misoprostol alone and the
      other regimen will be 200mg mifepristone, orally, in addition to 800μg buccal misoprostol,
      simultaneously. The primary outcome will be complete abortion rates 24hours after medication
      administration. We hypothesize that mifepristone will not improve complete abortion rates at
      24hrs.

      Secondary outcomes include rates of abortion by medical treatment at one week, the
      indications for surgical intervention, relationship of progesterone levels and type of
      pregnancy failure to outcomes in the two groups. Another secondary objective is to assess
      satisfaction with the treatment process at the conclusion of pregnancy termination, and 3
      weeks after the beginning of the process.

      The majority of studies investigating medical treatment of EPF use vaginal misoprostol, but
      buccal use is increasing. We will use buccal misoprostol, which is widely used at our
      institution. We will assess the efficacy of this route of administration as well as assess
      patient acceptability of this method.
