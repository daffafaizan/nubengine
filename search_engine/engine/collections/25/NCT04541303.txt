    
      To perform a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the hemostatic effect of
      TXA soaked gauze (intervention) versus normal saline soaked gauze (control) when applied to
      granulating defects in the setting of Mohs micrographic surgery.

      Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized into two arms once enrolled in the
      study on the day of their Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).

      One arm will serve as the control group and will receive normal saline soaked telfa pads to
      the wound bed upon completion of MMS.

      A second arm will receive TXA 25mg/ml at a volume of 1ml/cm2 soaked telfa pads to wound bed
      upon completion of MMS.

      In both arms, the telfa pads will have a standard pressure dressing placed overtop.
