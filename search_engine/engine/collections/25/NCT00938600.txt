      consequences of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy are unknown, but increasing evidence
      suggests it may compromise fetal growth and development of the immune system. We hypothesize
      that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women has an adverse effect on the newborn's defenses
      against infectious diseases in early infancy, and thus contributes to the high rates of
      neonatal mortality in South Asia. Randomized controlled trials of antenatal vitamin D
      supplementation are needed to test this hypothesis. However, preliminary studies are first
      necessary to establish a safe and efficacious dose of vitamin D to be used in such trials. In
      the proposed study, we will measure the response of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum
      concentration (a biomarker of vitamin D status) to oral vitamin D3 supplementation in
      pregnant women and non-pregnant women of reproductive age. The goal is to establish a safe,
      efficacious and feasible weekly vitamin D supplementation regimen for use in future trials.
      Five groups of approximately 15 women (3 groups of pregnant and 2 groups of non-pregnant
      women; total up to 75 women) will be supplemented and followed closely for 10 weeks
      (non-pregnant women) or until delivery (pregnant participants). The primary outcomes will be
      the change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations following vitamin D supplementation, and
      safety parameters that reflect calcium regulation (serum albumin-adjusted calcium
      concentrations and urine calcium excretion) and fetal development.
