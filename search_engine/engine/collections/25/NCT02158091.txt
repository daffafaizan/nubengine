    
      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive IPI-145
      in combination with the standard drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR).
      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

      Phase I

      The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can
      be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have
      CLL. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the
      study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled
      in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

      Phase II:

      Patients treated with IPI-145 at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) + fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) with standard dosing.
