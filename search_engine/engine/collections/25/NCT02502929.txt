      Depression is a known risk factor for diabetes. Some antidepressants can also increase risk
      of diabetes by causing weight gain. DREAM will test the effect of lifestyle and medication
      therapy management (MTM) compared to social services (control) on diabetes risk among
      depressed Cambodian Americans. Community health workers (CHWs) will deliver the lifestyle
      intervention and assist pharmacists with MTM. Lifestyle and biological risk factors for
      diabetes, such as depressive symptoms, HbA1c and insulin sensitivity, will be measured before
      and after the interventions.
