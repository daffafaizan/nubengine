    
      Phase IV prospective, randomized (1:1), parallel-group trial utilizing concurrent controls.
      Assess the reduction in time taken to dispostion or discharge patients. Assess the ability of
      POC testing to satisfy guidelines for a 30 minute turn around time of results. Assess and
      differences in clinical decision-making for other diagnostic procedures including nuclear
      imaging, echo, and stress treadmill, disposition from the ED, time to catherterization lab,
      PCI, and CafBG based on the cardiac troponinn results from the bedside analyzer and the
      central lab instrument.Assess the difference for in-hospital and 30 day post hospital
      discharge cardiac events including all-cause and cardiac-specific deaths, CHF,
      cardiomyopathy, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmia, beween the bedside analyzer and the
      central lab instrument. Assess the differences in hospital care costs for the hospitalization
      period, and assess direct medical and indirect productivity costs in the 30 day post hospital
      discharge period to patients who are diagnosed, using the bedside cTnl test and the central
      lab cTn tests, and subsequently treated as per the guidelines.
