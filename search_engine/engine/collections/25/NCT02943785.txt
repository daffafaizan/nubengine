      anticoagulation (OAC) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)

      Objective:

        -  To assess the effect of Edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) on net adverse
           clinical events (NACE), i.e., the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction
           (MI), ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism (SEE), valve thrombosis, and major
           bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] definition).

        -  To assess the effect of Edoxaban versus VKA on major bleeding (ISTH definition).
