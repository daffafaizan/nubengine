      large inter individual variability in the response to prednisone has a genetic component, but
      the genetic determinants of this variability remain unknown. We propose to use two relevant
      phenotypes, changes in white blood cell counts and changes in glucose tolerance induced by in
      vivo administration of prednisone, to characterize gene expression patterns and identify
      variants that are involved in the in vivo response to prednisone.
