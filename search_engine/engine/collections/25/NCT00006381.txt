        -  Determine the efficacy of celecoxib and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with
           HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that is refractory to prior
           trastuzumab.

        -  Determine the safety of celecoxib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: At least 3 weeks after the last dose of prior chemotherapy, patients receive oral
      celecoxib twice daily. Patients continue or restart trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90
      minutes weekly or every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 9 months.
