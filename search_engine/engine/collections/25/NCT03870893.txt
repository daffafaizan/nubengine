      and mechanism to contribute to improving the health and quality of life of the patients as
      well as reducing their global burden of disease by shifting the current passive
      "therapy-oriented" paradigm to a more proactive "participation-oriented" paradigm.

      Ever since physical activity and physical fitness have been reported to have an inverse
      relationship with the mortality rate, especially deaths due to cardiovascular disease,
      various efforts have been made to optimize physical activity and physical fitness among
      children with cerebral palsy. ADHD is one of the most common coexisting conditions of
      cerebral palsy. More participation in engaging sports activities like therapeutic riding is
      anticipated to improve patient health and their quality of life.

      Hippotherapy is expected to improve clinical symptom of ADHD in children with cerebral palsy
      while preventing possible ensuing psychiatric disorders, thereby bringing significant
      improvement in their health and quality of life.
