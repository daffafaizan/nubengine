      symptoms linked to the menstrual cycle with severity that disrupts functioning for as much as
      several weeks each menstrual cycle. Estimates indicate that 20-25% of menstruating women
      experience severe PMS. The efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants is clearly demonstrated
      for severe forms of PMS in short-term treatment trials. This study compares short-term
      treatment (4 months) and long-term treatment (12 months) with sertraline in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled design. The purpose is to determine how long medication should be
      continued following symptom relief, to what extent and how rapidly symptoms return after
      stopping medication, and whether there is any additional improvement with long-term
      treatment.

      Following a screen period for 2-3 menstrual cycles that includes a placebo-treated cycle,
      eligible women are randomized double-blind to the short-term or long-term treatment arm.
      Subjects are switched (double-blind) to placebo after 4 months or 12 months of sertraline
      treatment. All subjects continue the study for a total of 21 months and receive either
      sertraline or the matching placebo in this interval. Subjects whose symptoms return are given
      open-label sertraline without breaking the study blind. Subjects rate symptoms daily
      throughout the study using the Penn Daily Symptom Report. Other assessments are conducted at
      monthly intervals and include the Clinical Global Impressions Rating Scale, Sheehan
      Disability Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Endicott Quality of Life Questionnaire
      and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale. The overall duration of the study is expected to be 5-6
      years.
