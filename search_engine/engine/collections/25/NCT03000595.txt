      consent process has been completed. Patients with a total body surface area (BSA) of ≥2% and
      ≤ 15% atopic dermatitis involvement, in the treatable areas, and who meet all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      Once patient eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, the patient
      will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled patients will receive either 5%
      SAN007 cream or placebo cream (randomized in a 2:1 ratio) with the first dose applied at the
      Day 1 Study Visit. Patients and/or their legally authorized representative will be instructed
      on how to apply the study medication twice daily for 28 days. Patients will return to the
      clinic on Study Days 7,14 and 28 for study-related assessments. Patients and/or their LAR
      will receive a telephone contact from the site, on Study Days 21 and 35.

      Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs) with respect to severity,
      duration, and relationship to study drug.

      In addition cutaneous tolerability will be evaluated at each visit. Tolerability evaluation
      will be based on patients reporting discomfort during or immediately following application of
      SAN007. This will also be recorded as an AE. The study exclusion areas are to be not to be
      used in this evaluation.

      Efficacy will be assessed at each study visit through the completion of the IGA, EASI and BSA
      calculation.

      During the active treatment period, Patients will return to the study site according to the
      study schedule for interim assessments and recording of concomitant medication and adverse
      events (AEs).
