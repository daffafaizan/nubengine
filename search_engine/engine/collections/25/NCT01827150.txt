      spectroreflectometry oxygenation measurement in the eye (OSOME) was used to measure eye
      fundus oxygenation, more precisely optic nerve head capillaries structures oxygenation, by
      full spectrum reflectometry (1020 wavelength from 400 to 700nm) in real time (O.S.O.M.E.,
      Faubert & Diaconu US patent # 5,919,132) with 2% accuracy. It includes a fundus camera
      (Topcon, Osaka, Japan) coupled with a digital video camera (USB) and a detection unit
      composed of a multi-channel spectrograph and a charged coupled device (CCD).

      In order to use this machine, upon arrival, the patient's right eye needs to be dilated with
      drops of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine hydrochloride
      2.5%. The patient is required to rest for 20 minutes to allow a complete dilatation of the
      pupil before using the OSOME.
