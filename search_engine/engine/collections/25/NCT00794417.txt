      different doses of aflibercept in combination with approved doses of pemetrexed and
      cisplatin. The objective of phase 1 was to determine the safest dose of the combined study
      medications. This dose was administered to patients with previously untreated NSCLC in phase
      2. The phase 2 portion of the study determined if the combination is effective in treating
      NSCLC.
