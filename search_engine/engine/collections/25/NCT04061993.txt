      orthopaedic departments of two Slovenian hospitals. In each hospital 125 patients aged 60 or
      older with unilateral osteoarthritis, ASA score 1-3, signed informed consent, access to
      watching USB videos and without terminal illnesses disabling rehabilitation participation,
      will be randomly assigned to intervention (IG) or control group (CG). Total hip arthroplasty
      with anterior approach will be performed. All patients will get current standard
      physiotherapy during hospitalisation. Patients in IG will additionally learn strength and
      sensory-motor training exercises. Patients in both groups will get USB drives with exercise
      videos, written exercise instructions and training diary. Physiotherapists will perform
      measurements (physical tests and maximal voluntary isometric contractions) and patients will
      fill in outcome assessment questionnaires (Harris Hip Score and 36-Item Short Form Health
      Survey) at baseline and 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery.
