      (BPD) prevention. As a result, insufficient investigation has been performed to define
      optimal respiratory management strategies for infants and young children with established
      BPD. Thus, there is no robust evidence base to guide ventilator management to promote lung
      disease recovery and support neurodevelopment in this population. Neurally adjusted
      ventilatory assist (NAVA) is an alternative to conventional flow triggered ventilation that
      has shown promise for improving respiratory gas exchange, patient-ventilator interaction, and
      work of breathing in preterm neonates. The safety and efficacy of NAVA in infants and young
      children with established, severe BPD is uncertain. This prospective, unblinded, pilot
      randomized cross-over trial of 2 modes of mechanical ventilation will compare measures of
      pulmonary mechanics, respiratory gas exchange, and patient comfort between conventional flow
      triggered mechanical ventilation and NAVA among 20 prematurely born infants and young
      children receiving invasive respiratory support for severe BPD.
