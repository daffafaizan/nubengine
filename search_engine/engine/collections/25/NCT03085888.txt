      nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors. GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing
      (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with machine
      learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this prospective,
      multi-center, observational cohort study is to validate an assay for the early detection of
      breast cancer and other invasive cancers, including hematologic malignancies. The study will
      collect blood samples from participants within 28 days of their screening mammogram.
      Additional blood samples will also be collected for a subset of participants. For
      participants who receive a cancer diagnosis during the study, archival tissue samples will be
      collected.
