      therapy for chemosensitive disease, or single-agent topotecan. Although the efficacy of
      topotecan as second-line chemotherapy for SCLC has been consistently demonstrated in a number
      of clinical studies, the choice of irinotecan as first-line therapy prevented use of the
      evidence-based option such as topotecan. Topotecan and irinotecan are cytotoxic agents that
      inhibit same intracellular pathway, namely topoisomerase I, which is an enzyme involved in
      DNA replication and RNA transcription.

      Although their mechanism of action is similar, the preclinical and clinical data of these two
      drugs have some notable differences. Topotecan and irinotecan have different spectra of
      antitumor activity in various models of human cancer. Clinical data support that these agents
      may have different spectra of activity. The differences in antitumor activities may also
      reflect different mechanisms of resistance. Furthermore, topotecan and irinotecan have
      different limiting toxicities (myelosuppression and diarrhea, respectively).
