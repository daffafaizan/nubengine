      such as distal radius fractures, may require different types of treatment. For this study
      this type of fracture will be treated by surgery to place a plate with screws to the broken
      bone and then a plaster splint will be applied. After surgery, physical therapy will be
      started. Following surgery you will be assigned to one of four groups by the type of wrist
      fracture (broken bone) you have. Each person will by chance (the flip of a coin) be put in
      either the Early or Delayed Range of Motion groups. Those in the Early Range of Motion groups
      will begin exercises for motion starting 7 days after surgery. Those in the Delayed Range of
      Motion, will begin exercises for motion starting about five weeks after surgery. Once you
      begin the exercises to help you get back normal use of your wrist, you will have measurements
      of how much motion and strength you have in the wrist and hand that was fractured. The
      measurements will take about five minutes to complete. All participants will have an x-ray of
      the wrist at 2, & 6 weeks following surgery and if needed at other appointments. At each
      appointment you will be asked to fill out four questionnaires, asking about pain and how you
      are getting along with the broken bone in your wrist. The questionnaires will take about 20
      minutes of your time to complete. At Week 26 you will be asked to record the amount of motion
      you have in both of your wrists on paper drawings as well as the measurements that we will
      make. Working with the drawings will take approximately five minutes. At Week 52 you will be
      asked two questions about how satisfied you are with the results of your surgery. Surgery,
      x-ray of your wrist, and exercise to help you get back motion of your broken wrist are all
      standard orthopedic practice for treating a broken wrist bone.
