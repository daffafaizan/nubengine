      the last decade(s). Many factors during the consultation influence patient satisfaction. One
      of the aspects in a consultation is the request for help; especially in primary care the
      request for help has been recognised as an important aspect influencing patient satisfaction.
      The investigators hypothesized that exploring the request for help more thoroughly would
      improve patient satisfaction in general practice.
