      statistical precision to meet the objectives, with each participating doctor recruiting up to
      6 patients. An initial sample of 1000 doctors should be contacted (letter, phone).

      These 1000 doctors will initially be chosen at random from a file held by Pfizer of doctors
      who have agreed to take part in a Pfizer survey.

      These doctors will be experienced and qualified in the treatment and management of patients
      with non-metastatic, surgically-treated breast cancer (medical oncologists, gynaecologists,
      and medical oncologists/ radiation oncologists). They are practicing in general hospitals,
      teaching hospitals, CRLCC cancer centres and private clinics treating patients with breast
      cancer.

      Study recruitment was stopped due to difficulty in enrolling the targeted number of patients
      on December 3, 2010. There were no safety concerns involved in the decision to stop
      enrollment.
