      for multivisceral resection were selected from a prospective database. Clinical and
      pathological factors, perioperative morbidity and mortality and outcome were verified from
      medical records. Estimated local recurrence, and overall survival were compared using the log
      rank method, and Cox regression analysis was used to determine the independence of the
      studied parameters.
