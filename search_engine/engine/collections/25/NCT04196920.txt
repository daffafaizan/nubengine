      of chronic inflammatory disease, date of first prescription of antiTNF alpha either
      infliximab or adalimumab, date of start and end of immunosuppressive azathioprine/6MP and/or
      metrotrexate, mode of administration of per os or SC/IV treatment, efficacy based on
      validated clinical scores HBI-PDAI-Mayo, tolerance). A collection will be made on the
      University Hospital from a computer workstation. An analysis will then be carried out to
      write the publication secondarily. The data retention period will be one year from November
      2019 to November 2020 depending on the duration of this thesis work, which is estimated at
      one year.

      Expected results and prospects : " Methotrexate-associated antiTNF alpha combination therapy
      is as effective and safe as traditional azathioprine combination therapy in patients with
      IBD. The positive results may in practice lead to changes in our practices and give first
      priority to this combination therapy with methotrexate. "
