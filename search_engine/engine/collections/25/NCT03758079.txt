    
      Pruritus is one of the frustrating skin manifestations of advanced renal failure. Many
      options have been used for the management of uremic pruritus (UP) such as Pregabalin,
      Gabapentin, Doxepine and Desloratidine. Gabapentin, a GABAergic drug, has been found to be
      effective in the treatment of uremic pruritus. Doxepin, a potent antihistamine drug, is used
      orally or topically in many pruritic conditions such as UP, idiopathic pruritus, atopic
      dermatitis, neurogenic, or psychogenic pruritus and, in the management of the UP in
      hemodialysis patients.

      No comparative head to head study between Gabapentin and Doxepine has been conducted to date.
      The aim of this study was to compare Gabapentin and Doxepin in treatment of uremic pruritus
      in hemodialysis patients.
