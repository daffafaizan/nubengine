    
      This is a Phase I, single centre, randomised, single blind, placebo-controlled study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple
      ascending doses of inhaled AZD8871 in healthy male Japanese subjects.

      All subjects will sign an Informed Consent Form before starting any study-related procedures.

      Twenty-four healthy subjects, aged 20 to 55 years, will participate in 3 cohorts. All
      subjects will be admitted to the unit the day preceding the 1st dose and will be housed in
      the unit until 96 hours (4 days) post last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP)
      (Day 20).

      Eight subjects will participate in each cohort and will receive either AZD8871 or placebo,
      randomised 3:1 (6 subjects to receive AZD8871:2 subjects to receive placebo). Each subject
      will only be dosed in 1 cohort. The study design allows a gradual escalation of dose (Cohorts
      2 and 3) with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the subjects.

      In Cohort 1, subjects will receive only a single dose of AZD8871 300 µg or placebo on Day 1,
      followed by once daily dosing on Days 5 to 16. The dosing schedule of all cohorts will be
      single dose of IMP (active or placebo) on Day 1, followed by once daily dosing on Days 5 to
      16. Within 5 to 7 days of discharge from the unit, there will be two follow-up visits.

      Following each cohort, a maximum dose of 2 times the dose administered in the previous cohort
      will be considered for the subsequent cohort. However, the planned dose for Cohort 2 is 600
      µg and for Cohort 3 is 900 µg. Dosing of Cohorts 2 and 3 will be preceded by a SRC meeting,
      which will confirm the adequacy of the planned doses. A minimum of 5 subjects on active
      treatment need to complete dosing per cohort in order to proceed to the next dose level.

      The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 58 days (from
      Screening [up to -28 days before randomization] to Final Follow up visit [Day 30]).
