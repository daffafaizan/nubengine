      Prospective study of 100 women from family practice offices in Vancouver, Victoria and Prince
      George who currently use tampons to manage menstrual flow. After an information session and
      consent, subjects will be randomized to tampon use or Diva Cup use and record their
      experience on a diary for 3 months. Women who attend the information session and who do not
      enrol, or those who drop out will be asked their reasons for discontinuing, and their
      pre-study questionnaire will be used for analysis.
