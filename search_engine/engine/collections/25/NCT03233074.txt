      characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, progressive bone marrow failure, cytogenetic and
      molecular abnormalities, and increased risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
      It is a well-accepted theory that MDS and AML originate from primary alterations of
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) compartment, which confer a survival advantage to them at the
      expense of physiological hematopoiesis. More recently, there is growing evidences regarding
      the contribution of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML.
      Of particular interest, several studies have pointed towards a pivotal role of mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSC), one of the main components of the BM niche, in the initiation and
      propagation of myeloid disorders. In this context, it is of clinical significance to better
      characterize the intrinsic defects harbored by MSC in MDS and AML context, as compared to
      physiological conditions. Such research initiative aims to dissect the cross-talk between
      malignant HSC and their BM partners in crime, further prospecting for innovative
      stromal-directed strategies for the treatment of MDS and AML.
