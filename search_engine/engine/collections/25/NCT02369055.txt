    
      Anticipated: 500 patients from Norway and 500 patients from Denmark are included in the
      national stroke-register datasets, and 250 patients from each country in the
      questionnaire-based datasets.

      The questionnaire includes demographic data, the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL)
      scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The EuroQol Quality of Life scale
      (EQ-5D), the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), the Quality of Life After Brain Injury,
      Overall Scale QOLIBRI-OS, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and additional questions about
      satisfaction on treatment and rehabilitation.

      5-6 patients from each country will be selected for semi-structured interviews with both
      priori questions and exploratory questions.

      The mixing of methods will balance the goals of generality and complex understanding in how
      patients describe their quality of life and rehabilitation-chain.
