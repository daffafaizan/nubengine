      consecutive weeks, with a two-day rest given in between the five-day treatment blocks. The
      topotecan dose started at 1.8 mg/m2/dosage and adjusted to attain a target systemic exposure
      of 80 plus or minus 10 ng-hr/ml.each cycle consists of 28 days and subsequent cycles can be
      administered upon hematological recovery. Patients with a CR, PR, or SD, can continue to
      receive up to a total of six cycles. Patients with PD are removed from the study.

      Secondary Objectives include:

        -  To describe the anti-tumor activity of topotecan in children with recurrent Wilms tumor
           of anaplastic histology.

        -  To assess the relation between CYP3A4/5 genotype and the pharmacokinetics and
           pharmacodynamics of topotecan.

        -  To assess the relation between ABCG2 genotype and the pharmacokinetics and
           pharmacodynamics of topotecan.
