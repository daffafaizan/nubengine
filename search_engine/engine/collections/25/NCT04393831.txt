      sparing to compare cancer outcomes and urinary/sexual outcomes following radical
      prostatectomy. Using the Retzius technique, the surgeon will remove the prostate in a way
      that preserves a portion of the nerves and tissue structures that are typically removed
      during the conventional technique.

      The investigators will assess recovery of urinary and sexual function of patients through
      questionnaires at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery.
