      skin care measures, including anti- bedsore mattresses; body position changes every two
      hours, and shear/friction reduction.

      Trained nurses will review all participants' charts and verify any report of PU until the
      first ambulation, discharge or death. Patients with a verified PU are referred to the
      institutional wound care group.

      For the purpose of outcome adjudication, study personnel will email digital pictures to 2
      independent, blinded outcome assessors (experts in skin care). Skin lesions will be rated in
      4-level scale (EPUAP/NPUAP). In case of disagreement, a single, independent referee will
      confirm the presence/absence of any potential PU.

      The unit for analysis will be patients developing (first occurrence, in a time-to-event
      analysis) PUs in the areas covered by the interventions.
