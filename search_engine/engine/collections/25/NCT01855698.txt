      haematological malignancies has been recently reviewed (1). For patients with lymphoma, the
      incidence of VTE ranged from 1.5 to 14.6% and is 59% in patients with central nervous system
      lymphoma. The incidence of VTE in patients with acute leukaemia varies with time, being
      between 1.4 and 9.6% at diagnosis and between 1.7 and 12% during induction therapy. Notably,
      the highest rates of VTE were reported in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, with
      values between 6 and 16% in the largest series. In patients with multiple myeloma who did not
      receive antithrombotic prophylaxis, the rate of VTE increased to 26% in those undergoing
      treatment regimens including immumodulatory drugs (thalidomide and lenalidomide) (1).
      Moreover, in patients who have undergone autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT), the rate of VTE is between 2.9 to 9.9%, and was central venous
      catheter (CVC)-associated in the majority of cases (2-4). VTE has been shown to occur even
      during periods of severe thrombocytopenia; one-third of the events from a patient series
      occurred when the platelet count was <50 x109/L (3). Patients with acute leukaemia have a
      high risk of haemorrhage, mostly related to thrombocytopenia as a result of haematological
      disease and/or chemotherapy, such that the administration of anticoagulant drugs in this
      setting is problematic. No randomised controlled trials have addressed the issue of VTE
      treatment in patients with acute leukaemia, and the management of these cases is based only
      on small groups of patient series or experts' opinion. Five reports have described in detail
      cases of paediatric or adult patients with malignancies and thrombocytopenia who have been
      treated with heparin as a result of a VTE (5-9). Out of a total of 54 cases, 32 had
      haematological malignancies and a platelet nadir <50 x109/L (reviewed in ref. 10). The
      majority of patients (22 of 32) had CVC-related thrombosis. A full dose of low molecular
      weight heparin (LMWH) bid was administered to the majority of the patients with CVC-related
      thrombosis and to the totality of patients for whom the thrombosis was not CVC-related. All
      patients received platelet transfusions if the platelet count fell below <20-40 x109/L, and
      the dose of LMWH was halved when the platelet count was <20 x109/L in one report. None of the
      patients had major bleeding. Rethrombosis occurred in three of 32 (9.3%) patients (6,7). In a
      large series of 379 patients with acute leukaemia, treatment for 20 patients who had one
      (n=16) or two (n= 4) VTE events was essentially based on the administration of enoxaparin 100
      U/kg bid; in the case of a platelet count <50 x109/L or in the clinical suspicion of bleeding
      risk the dose was reduced to 100 U/kg qd or 50 U/kg bid. Alternatively, the patients received
      a continuous i.v. infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) to obtain aPTTs in the lower
      therapeutic range (1.5 times greater than the basal value). Secondary prophylaxis after acute
      VTE was based on the administration of enoxaparin 100 U/kg qd in the case of ongoing
      chemotherapy or vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) (INR between 2 and 3) otherwise. In general, the
      length of secondary prophylaxis was reported to be not longer than six months (11). The
      safety of therapeutic anticoagulation treatment for the management of thrombocytopenic
      patients was also evaluated in two series of patients receiving HSCT (12,13). In 10 patients
      with multiple myeloma who had received autologous HSCT, anticoagulation was required
      following pre-transplant CVC-related subclavian vein thrombosis (n= 8), pulmonary embolism
      two months prior to transplant (n= 1), or a history of acute intermittent atrial fibrillation
      that was complicated by an arterial embolus to the leg (n= 1). Beginning on the first day of
      high-dose chemotherapy, the 10 patients received therapeutic UFH (a 5,000 U i.v. bolus
      followed by 1,000 U per h) to maintain aPTTs between 50 and 70 seconds and were switched to
      VKA treatment when their conditions stabilised. UFH treatment was interrupted once the VKA
      administration produced a therapeutic INR >2 for two consecutive days. Heparinised patients
      received platelet transfusions to maintain counts >30 x109/L. Three patients developed
      bleeding (haematuria, haematemesis, mucosal bleeding) that did not not require transfusion,
      and no thrombotic events occurred (12). In another series of 26 patients with HSCT who were
      given enoxaparin for the treatment of VTE, 21 patients had haematological malignancies. There
      were 25 VTE events recorded (four patients had two events at different sites) and 11 cases
      had upper extremity CVC-related deep venous thrombosis. During periods of thrombocytopenia
      (<55 x109/L), enoxaparin administration was reduced to a median value of 49 U/kg/day (range
      34-75) and was withdrawn in some instances when the platelet count fell below 20 x109/L. Two
      major bleeding events (8%) occurred, in one case fatal (13). The aforementioned data are
      insufficient for the production of evidence-based guidelines. Experts and the AIEOP
      (Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica) have suggested that the first
      two weeks of treatment should consist of the administration of full-dose LMWH (anti-factor Xa
      level 0.5-1 U/ml), maintaining the platelet count above 50 x109/L. After the first two weeks,
      halving the dose is recommended if the platelet count is between 20 and 50 x109/L. If the
      platelet count is below 20 x109/L, it is advised that the LMWH therapy be discontinued until
      the platelet count recovers to greater than 20 x109/L (14-16). Recent guidelines of the SISET
      (SocietÃ  Italiana per lo Studio dell'Emostasi e della Trombosi) also suggested that in
      patients with haematological malignancies and VTE LMWH should be preferred over VKA either
      for the first six months or a longer time (17). Arterial thrombosis has been rarely reported
      in patients with acute leukemia as heralding manifestation or complicating the course of
      disease (18-21). However, details concerning antithrombotic treatment and the platelet count
      at the time of the event are lacking in the majority of the reported cases. There have been
      no published studies concerning the use of novel antithrombotic agents such fondaparinux,
      direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors, in patients with haematological malignancies or
      thrombocytopaenia. However, in vitro experiments that have been performed on plasma from
      children with ALL and antithrombin deficiency as a result of the administration of
      asparaginase have demonstrated that the direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran generates a
      consistent anticoagulant response that is independent of the antithrombin level. Therefore,
      this drug class may have important potential for use in this field (22).

      Rationale Data about treatment of arterial or venous thromboembolism in patients with
      haematological malignancies and thrombocytopenia are mainly anecdotal. The very limited
      knowledge in this setting does not allow to plan a randomized controlled trial, lacking a
      standard of care and being quite uncertain the benefits and risks of different strategies.
      Therefore we planned an observational study either retrospective and prospective to gain
      information about efficacy and safety of different therapeutic strategies in patients with
      hematologic neoplasms and platelet count <50 x109/L having had diagnosis of arterial or
      venous thromboembolism.
