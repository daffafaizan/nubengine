      2 period cross-over design with a wash out phase of at least three treatment free days
      between both administrations. Sample collection will be performed over eight hours after
      fasted administration. This time is considered adequate for the determination of plasma
      concentration vs. time profiles long enough for reliable estimation of the extent of
      absorption, i.e. the AUC derived from measurements is expected to cover at least 80% of the
      AUC extrapolated to infinity for deferiprone
