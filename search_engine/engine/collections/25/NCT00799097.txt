      prospectively enrolled. Patient demographics, comorbidity data, objective testing, and QOL
      evaluation will occur preoperatively and outcomes (QOL and olfactory testing) will be
      measured 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Determinants of change in QOL will be analyzed
      by univariate and multivariate methods including construction of a multivariate predictive
      model.

      This proposal focuses on patients undergoing surgical intervention for the management of CRS.
      The findings can potentially be applied to the 200,000 patients annually undergoing sinus
      surgery and in working toward the long-term goal of developing a comprehensive system for
      measuring extent of disease so that disease severity and treatment response can be rigorously
      quantified in the 30 million patients with CRS.
