      visualization of the mucosa. However, there're some limitations, for instance, significant
      amounts of air are usually retained in the small bowel, which will lead to the distention and
      the pain of the gastrointestinal tract during and after the procedure.

      Carbon dioxide(CO2), comparing to the air, is rapidly absorbed from the intestine, which
      allows the bowel to decompress more quickly and potentially decreases intraprocedural and
      postprocedural pain, sedation medication requirements, procedure time, and recovery time. It
      is also to the benefit of deeper intubation depth so that higher total enteroscopy rate and
      diagnostic rate will be achieved.

      Initial reports indicated that CO2 was effective during the colonoscopy ,ERCP and DBE
      examination, but it is still uncertain to the SBE procedure
