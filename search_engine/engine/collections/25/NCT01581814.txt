      on reproductive age , seems to be associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular
      disease. At present, insulin-sensitizing drugs, such as metformin, represent one of the most
      important line treatment for hyperinsulinemic PCOS women. Metformin is able to produce
      favourable outcomes on the metabolic derangements in insulin-resistant normal weight and
      obese PCOS patients. Oral contraceptives represent the traditional medical therapy for the
      long-term treatment of PCOS women, in order to obtain regular menstrual cycles and to improve
      the clinical signs of hyperandrogenism.Based on the above mentioned evidences, the aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the effects of DRPS/EE alone versus metformin alone versus
      DRPS/EE plus metformin on the CD4+CD28null T cells frequency and on endocrino-metabolic
      parameters, in hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients
