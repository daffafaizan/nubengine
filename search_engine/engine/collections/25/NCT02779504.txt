      series of Agluna® treated and untreated METS™ modular prostheses conducted at the Royal
      National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore. The expected sample size will be 106, with 53
      patients in each treatment arm (Agluna® treated vs untreated). However there will be an
      initial pilot of 20 subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the study conduct and to identify
      if any further study design modification are required.

      The primary outcome is the estimation of the infection rate over 12 months following an
      Agluna (silver) treated METS™ endoprosthetic surgery. This will be compared to the infection
      rate of non-Agluna Treated devices in a similar population. Incidence of infection will be
      measured according to the accepted definition of periprosthetic joint infection from the
      American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. The study follow up period is 12 months after
      implantation. Secondary objectives are to examine the health economic impacts of using the
      Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System in comparison to the untreated METS™ Modular
      Tumour System and to establish clinically relevant superiority of the Agluna® Treated METS™
      Modular Tumour System in comparison to untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System.
