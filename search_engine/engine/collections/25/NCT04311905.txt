      received laser activated irrigation LAI during root canal treatment and the other group
      received no treatment just conventional RCT. â€¢ Patients were equally divided into 2 groups
      (n=12 in each group ) The study in a Single blinded RCT , Numbers for patients will be
      generated and distributed randomly in a table on an Excel sheet, and in front of each number
      either a letter (C) for control or (I) for intervention will be typed After patients were
      selected in the study they will be asked to fill in a consent form , that states that they
      are part of a clinical trial and that they may or may not receive a laser activated
      irrigation Group A LAI :Disinfection were done by using 5 ml of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite
      irrigation for 1 minute. Irrigation will be performed with a 30-gauge needle side vented The
      irrigation needles were introduced passively up to 2 mm away the working length. After
      irrigation Laser treatment will be performed with a diode laser, at a wavelength of 980 nm
      with a repeated pulse mode using a pulse duration of 5sec per canal and a pulse interval of
      0.2 ms. The laser irradiation were delivered for 1 minute into the canal up to 1 mm short of
      the working length, with circling movements from the apical part moving towards the coronal
      part Group B : received mock laser intervention , conventional Root canal treatment with 2.5%
      sodium hypochlorite CBCT was taken pre-operative and another one was taken after 12 month ,
      both volumetric and linear measurements were calculated
