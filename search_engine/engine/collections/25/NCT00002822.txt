        -  Compare the survival rate in patients with newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer and
           good performance status treated with an intensive regimen of
           ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide with mid-cycle vincristine (VICE) vs. standard
           chemotherapy followed, as feasible, by thoracic radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the adverse effects of treatment and quality of life (including psychological
           distress, physical status, and functional status and global quality of life) in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist vs. the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 quality-of-life
           questionnaires in relation to compliance and ability to detect differences between
           treatments.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      The first group receives standard combination chemotherapy with
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide (ACE) or cisplatin/etoposide (PE) every 3 weeks for 6
      courses.

      The second group receives intensive combination chemotherapy with
      carboplatin/ifosfamide/etoposide on days 1-3 with vincristine on day 14 (VICE). Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

      Patients in both groups are considered for thoracic radiotherapy beginning 4-5 weeks after
      the first day of the last course of chemotherapy.

      Concurrent prophylactic antibiotics should be given. Patients who relapse may receive further
      treatment at the clinician's option.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for up to 1 year, every 3 months
      for up to 2 years, every 6 months for 5 years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be entered over 3 years.
