    
      100 patients with cerebral white matter lesions and 100 normal controls will be observed. All
      of them will receive MRI scan(T1WI,T2WI,T2flair,MRA,SWI,ASL,DTI and fMRI) and the assessment
      of the neuropsychological function (MMSE,Auditory verbal memory test,Trail-making test-A and
      -B,Symbol digit modalities test,Digit span test,Clock drawing test,HAMD) intending to analyse
      topological organization in brain structural and functional networks in cerebral white matter
      lesion patients and to evaluate the association between impairment of cognitive function and
      cerebral structural and functional networks in those patients.Furthermore,DNA will be
      extracted from the blood sample of all participates to perform High-throughput sequencing.
      MRI scan and neuropsychological function assessment will be performed repeatedly after 1,3
      and 5 years.
