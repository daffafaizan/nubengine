      inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, and fibrous tissue remodeling are associated with
      c-Kit, Lyn and PDGFR kinase signaling pathways; all key targets of masitinib. This is a
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group (ascending dose titration of masitinib
      to 6.0 mg/kg/day and matching placebo), comparative study of oral masitinib in the treatment
      of patients with severe asthma, uncontrolled with high dose of inhaled corticosteroid and
      with elevated eosinophil levels. Eligible patients will be treated during at least 48 weeks.
