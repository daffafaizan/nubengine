      incompletely understood, but it has been suggested that cigarette smoking may change
      inflammation and airway remodelling in asthma to become more similar to that in COPD (chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease).

      Any form of tobacco use, especially cigarette smoking, plays an important role in this
      disease. Asthmatic smokers are prone to several negative outcomes. Cigarette smoking by
      itself is associated with airway inflammation and features of airway remodelling including
      increased epithelial proliferation, squamous cell metaplasia, goblet cell hyperplasia, smooth
      muscle hypertrophy, and increases in bronchial glands mass.

      Corticosteroid insensitivity is an important clinical feature of asthma, particularly in
      patients with severe disease and smokers. The mechanisms of corticosteroid insensitivity in
      asthmatic patients are poorly understood.

      One of the major problems in the treatment of smoking asthma patients is the lack of efficacy
      data in this group of patients as smokers have almost always been excluded from studies on
      asthma due to perceived concerns about recruiting patients with COPD. Therefore, there is a
      lack of specific information about the treatment of asthma in smokers. The asthmatic smoker
      is a special phenotype with important therapeutic and prognostic clinical implications.
