      diet interventions with either a high-saturated fat diet or a low-fat high protein diet for 4
      days (days 1-4) and a breakfast on day 5. Blood samples are collected on day 1 at fasting
      state and on day 5 at fasting state and 4 and 6 hours after the breakfast to examine lipid
      levels and circulating monocyte phenotypes.
