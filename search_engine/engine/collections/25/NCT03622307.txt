      safely provide defibrillation for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular
      tachyarrhythmias. However this system is currently not able to perform anti tachycardia
      pacing (ATP) which can terminate some VT, thus avoiding painful shocks.

      Ideally slow VT should be managed with RF ablation while fast VT causing hemodynamic
      consequences should be treated with ICD shocks combined with medications. Typically, ICDs in
      secondary prevention patients are programmed to intervene at 10 msec at least above the
      clinical VT. In cases of hemodynamically stable VT this can result in unnecessary therapies
      and lead to ICD shocks. S-ICD can safely manage fast VTs while slower hemodynamically VTs can
      be managed with ablation.

      This approach can avoid transvenous ICD related complications and unnecessary ICD
      interventions such as ATP which can accelerate VT to ICD shock zone. However, the benefit of
      this management strategy compared to conventional transvenous ICD programming has not been
      studied in patients who receive the device for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac
      death.
