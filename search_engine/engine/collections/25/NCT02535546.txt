      patients with COPD in Ireland and if the PCV-13 has potential for reducing infective
      exacerbations in this cohort. A group of 150 COPD patients are being monitored at quarterly
      intervals over one year. At each study visit patients report changes to COPD-related
      medication, recent hospitalisations and exacerbations and provide a sputum sample (or
      pharyngeal swab if not possible) which is assessed for the presence of S. pneumoniae.

      The specific objectives of the study are:

        1. To monitor the carriage rate of pneumococci in a cohort of Irish patients with COPD
           during and outside periods of acute exacerbation over a one year period.

        2. To assess the COPD exacerbation rate amongst this group of patients.

        3. To monitor changes in the proportion of patients positive for pneumococci carriage over
           a full season and to document those patients intermittently or permanently colonised.

        4. To characterise S. pneumoniae isolates carried by COPD patients in terms of their
           genetic evolution, comparison with strains in other countries, and antimicrobial
           susceptibility.

        5. To assess the proportion of colonised COPD patients that would be covered by current and
           future pneumococcal vaccines.
