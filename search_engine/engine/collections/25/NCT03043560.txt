      available treatments fall short of addressing this large public health burden. Dysfunction
      within the brain reward system is emerging as a core feature of depressive disorders, in
      particular related to deficits in motivation, interest, and response to pleasure (e.g.,
      anhedonia: markedly diminished response to pleasure). Evidences from a series of preclinical
      studies from our group highlighted the KCNQ subtype of neuronal potassium (K+) channel as a
      novel target for the treatment of depressive disorders and our human pilot study showed a
      reduction in anhedonia and related symptoms, and an increased brain response to reward (as
      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) following treatment with ezogabine.
      Building on this data, the current project will assess reward circuit activity following
      treatment with ezogabine in depressed patients with a current depressive disorder (Major
      depressive disorder [MDD], persistent depressive disorder, other specified depressive
      disorder) and anhedonia (defined by a score â‰¥ 20 on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale
      [SHAPS]), using fMRI to investigate the cortico-striatal circuit to reward.

      This study represents the first part of the R61/R33 National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      founded project. A clear increase in reward circuit activation in at least one ezogabine
      treatment group compared to placebo, given acceptable tolerability, will constitute a "go"
      and the project will move to the next phase (R33), where we aim to examine the relationship
      between treatment, reward circuit activity, and behavioral and clinical outcomes in a larger,
      confirmatory efficacy trial of ezogabine for depression with anhedonia.
