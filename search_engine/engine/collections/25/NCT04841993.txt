      Includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical products. Recently, many
      countries have authorized the use of cannabis flower cups with a standardized amount of
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and their acidic precursors
      (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A [THCA] and cannabidiol acid [ CBDA]) for the treatment of
      different diseases. In Italy since January 2017 there has been for sale a standardized
      cannabis preparation produced by the Military Pharmaceutical Institute of Florence. This
      medicinal variety of cannabis sativa, known as FM2 has a variable THC and CBD percentage of
      between 5-8% and 7-12% respectively. To date, there are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of
      THC, CBD and other minor cannabinoids in conventional and unconventional biological matrices
      after oral administration of cannabis tea, cannabis oil and vaporized with the same medicinal
      preparation (FM2). The main objective is to know the concentrations of THC, CBD and
      metabolites, and other cannabinoids in blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat after the
      experimental administration of a standardized cannabis preparation orally (two formulations:
      cannabis tea and cannabis oil) and vaporized. In addition, the acute pharmacological effects
      and tolerability will be evaluated. Healthy recreational cannabis users with experience in
      oral use of cannabis will participate
