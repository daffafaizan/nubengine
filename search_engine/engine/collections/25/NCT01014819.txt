      microns away from it and detects the electric field in the skin using capacitative coupling.
      Measurements of hundreds of malignant melanomas in mice indicated that these lesions generate
      an electric field that is easily detected. One previous clinical trial at the VA Medical
      Center in Hampton VA indicated an 80% reliability in predicting malignant lesions by their
      electric field. We have improved the Dermacorder over the past two years by enhancing its
      sensitivity and stability and must now determine if these improvements have improved its
      ability to detect malignant lesions. If the Dermacorder provides a reliable diagnosis of
      malignant lesions, its use could dramatically reduce the number of biopsies performed and
      this would significantly improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Americans
      seeking the advice of dermatologists regarding suspicious lesions each year
