      GT3X+ placed at each of three body sites, the dominant-side wrist, right hip and
      dominant-side ankle to objectively measure physical activity. Patients will wear the
      ActiGraph devices during two 30-minute periods of direct observation. To compare activity
      counts measured by the ActiGraph devices with directly observed purposeful physical activity,
      we will record the time and type of physical activity performed by patients such as sitting
      at the edge of the bed, sitting in a bedside chair, transferring to a chair, standing and
      ambulating. The data acquired from this observational (AMERCIA) study will seek to establish
      the feasibility of using accelerometers to measure activity in a diverse population of
      patients with medical or surgical critical illness.
