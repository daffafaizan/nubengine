      charts of neonates with NH reaching exchange transfusion threshold.

      The SCBU database will be searched for neonates born at â‰¥ 28 weeks of gestation hospitalized
      for phototherapy between January 2009 and December 2014. The SCBU charts of these neonates
      will be manually researched to identify study participants which will be classified as NH
      reaching exchange transfusion threshold (cases) or as NH within moderate threshold
      (controls). Additionally neurological signs compatible with ABE that would likely be reported
      by the clinical staff will be searched in the clinical notes and coded as present/absent;
      those signs are: sleepiness, irritability, apnea, convulsions, abnormal position/tone, and
      abnormal cry. Those charts will be included into the cases.

      Cases discharged alive from the SCBU will be traced back to evaluate their clinical and
      neurocognitive long term outcome. Each case will be matched with a moderate NH control from
      the same clinic, sex, gestational age and season of birth and hospitalized within the same
      month.

      Both will be examined clinically and findings reported on a standardized forms, their visual
      function will be tested using the Cardiff acuity and contrast cards and their neurocognitive
      development will be assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales-Extended revised.

      Maternal demographics and additional birth variables (i.e. birth asphyxia, type of delivery,
      breastfeeding) will be extracted from the antenatal care database and added to the selected
      cases; laboratory results (G6PD deficiency, ABO incompatibility, haematocrit) are stored in
      the SCBU database and will be retrieved. The general characteristics, the trajectory of SBR,
      and the neonatal outcome will be described.
