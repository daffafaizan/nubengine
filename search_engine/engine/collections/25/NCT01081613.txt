    
      This feasibility study is designed as a side study to the multicenter, international phase
      I-II trial with HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 (protocol CAUY922A2101), as part of the biomarker
      assessment. In protocol CAUY922A2101, section 4, the design of this phase I-II trial is
      described (p37, 38). Briefly, a dose-escalation study is performed according to phase I
      design in adult patients with advanced solid malignancies. This part is followed by a
      dose-expansion study according to a phase II design. In the latter part, breast cancer
      patients are enrolled that are either refractory to hormone- or trastuzumab treatment (both
      treatment arms, n=40 patients), on the maximal tolerated dose of AUY922 based on the phase I
      part of the study. Patients with ER positive, hormone therapy refractory breast cancer, will
      receive a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan as part of the present side study protocol, which will be
      performed in collaboration with the Royal Marsden Hospital (United Kingdom).

      To this end, a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan will be performed before (baseline) and during
      treatment with HSP90 inhibitor AUY922, as described below.

      A minimum of six patients will be entered to evaluate whether the effect of HSP90 inhibition
      by AUY922 can be detected with a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan
