      Included in the literature are several studies that highlight substantial numbers of
      post-surgical infectious complications. Specifically among patients undergoing radical
      vulvectomy, the incidence of post-operative wound complication is as high as 58%. Surgery is
      the treatment of choice for vulvar cancer, but few studies establish protocols or management
      strategies to prevent the complications of post-operative wound infection and breakdown. This
      proposed randomized prospective study would specifically investigate the efficacy of a 24
      hour post-operative course of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics - namely Cefazolin - in
      preventing wound infection and wound breakdown following vulvectomy. This same regimen has
      been described by a leader in the field of gynecology in his text - TeLinde's Operative
      Gynecology. This study will utilize two arms - one as the treatment arm utilizing 24 hours of
      prophylactic antibiotics and the other as control.
