    
      Study Aim One: To develop and validate objective procedures for quantifying efferent
      responses to non-invasive laryngeal mechanical and aerodynamic stimulation.

      Study Aim Two: To develop and validate an objective test of brain stem evoked responses to
      laryngeal stimulation using electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve.

      Study Aim Three: To determine whether individuals with idiopathic voice disorders have
      abnormal conditioning of their responses to laryngeal mechanical and aerodynamic stimulation.

      Study Aim Four: To determine whether individuals with idiopathic voice disorders have
      abnormal brain stem responses to laryngeal stimuli.

      Study Aim Five: To evaluate whether sensory input plays a role in symptom generation in
      laryngeal motor control disorders, temporary bilateral ISLN blockade will be used in
      idiopathic voice disorders.

      Study Aim Six: To evaluate whether the central pathophysiology involved in motor responses to
      sensory stimulation are altered by botulinum toxin injection in individuals with spasmodic
      dysphonia.

      Study Aim Seven: To evaluate central responses to laryngeal afferent stimulation in normal
      volunteers and patients with idiopathic voice disorders at rest and during vocalization using
      magnetoencephalography.

      These studies will develop improved non-invasive techniques for the diagnosis of laryngeal
      sensory disorders and will determine if abnormalities in sensory feedback modulation are
      involved in idiopathic voice disorders. Such findings will lead to improved understanding of
      the pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of idiopathic voice disorders and may
      ultimately improve treatment approaches to these disorders.
