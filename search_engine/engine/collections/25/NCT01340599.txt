    
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the short-term effects of daily Polyphenon E (defined green tea catechin
      extract) administration (800 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate [EGCG] once daily [QD]) during the
      interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (approximately 6 weeks) in men
      with localized prostate cancer.

      II. Compare the change in levels of intermediate biomarkers (Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl2],
      cyclin D, KiP1/P27, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and cluster of differentiation
      [CD]31) in biopsy (pre-treatment) and prostatectomy (post-treatment) specimens collected from
      subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and
      prostatectomy.

      III. Compare the change in pre- and post-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      level in subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and
      prostatectomy.

      IV. Evaluate bioavailability of catechins from Polyphenon E (plasma and tissue catechin
      levels, catechin metabolites in urine).

      V. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Polyphenon E in this subject population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) QD for 4-10 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical
      prostatectomy between days 28-70.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
