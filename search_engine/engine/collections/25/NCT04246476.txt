      the first visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will wear
      wearable sensors during the following tasks: walking with no cues; walking while listening to
      music; and walking while mentally singing. The wearable sensors will measure gait parameters
      including gait speed and stride time variability. All participants will also conduct the
      following tasks while finger tapping on a keyboard: tapping with no cues; tapping while
      listening to music; and tapping while mentally singing.

      At the second visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will
      perform the following tasks during imaging: uncued tapping; listening to music (no tapping);
      mentally singing (no tapping); listening to music and tapping; and mentally singing and
      tapping.
