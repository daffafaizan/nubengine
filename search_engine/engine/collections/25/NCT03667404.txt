      bacteria play roles in multiple functions including gut motility and secretion of metabolites
      which can have systemic effects on the body. Recent evidence has shown that people with PD
      have an altered distribution of gut bacteria that healthy controls. These changes are
      associated with differences in various metabolites, including butyrate, that are involved in
      maintaining the gut barrier integrity and even gait and balance function. Microbiota
      dysbiosis could potentially exacerbate or even contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.
      Probiotic and dietary interventions may improve gut function and the motor symptoms in PD,
      but neither have been examined for their effect on the gut microbiome. Prebiotic treatments
      have been shown to order the microbiome in some populations, but have not been assessed for
      tolerability or efficacy in PD.

      The objective of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of resistant
      maltodextrin (RM), a prebiotic non-digestible fiber, and its effect on the microbiome and
      motor in non-motor symptoms and PD. The investigators will conduct a randomized,
      parallel-group double-blinded controlled trial assessing RM 50 g daily compared to
      maltodextrin (an easily digestible glucose polysaccharide) over 4 weeks. Patients will be
      dosed with 25 g daily for 1 week and then titrated to 50 g daily for the remaining 3 weeks.

      The goals of this study include: 1) To determine the safety and tolerability of RM compared
      to maltodextrin in patients with PD; 2) To determine if RM will remodel the gut microbiome in
      patients with PD; 3) (exploratory) To determine if RM administration will improve motor and
      non-motor symptoms in PD.
