      university and a mobile phone cell company which is supporting SMS sending program. In the
      second step, by making software plug-in to our hospital's patient follow up program, two
      programs were integrated. According to this integration, after stent insertion, in case of
      entering the numerical code corresponding of ''ureteral stent application'' procedure during
      the stage of epicrisis preparation, the patient follow up system warns the official recording
      the epicrisis to enter the stent removal time. Patient follow up system transfers this
      information to SMS sending program. After several weeks of the procedure, if the stent needs
      to be removed, the software automatically sends a warning message to the patient and the
      physician. If the patients attends to urology department and undergoes stent removal, the
      official enters the code of "endoscopic stent removal" to the patient follow-up program. Then
      the program stops to send warning message.

      By the software plug-in to patient follow up program, SMS sending was made mandatory not to
      forget or skip none of the patients during the epicrisis writing procedure.
