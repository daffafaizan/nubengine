    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the rate of leukemia relapse can be decreased for patients with
      chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and Philadelphia chromosome positive
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) responsive to imatinib mesylate (or either dasatinib
      or nilotinib for patients who have imatinib-resistant disease or who are intolerant of
      imatinib) followed by nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      compared to historical controls given high-dose conventional allogeneic HSCT or chemotherapy.

      II. To determine whether the rate of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) can be decreased
      for patients with CML-BC and Ph+ ALL responsive to imatinib mesylate (or dasatinib or
      nilotinib) followed by nonmyeloablative HSCT compared to historical controls given high-dose
      conventional allogeneic HSCT or chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be safely used in patients with
      mixed or full donor chimerism as preemptive therapy to eliminate minimal residual disease.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients continue to receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO), dasatinib PO,
      or nilotinib PO once or twice daily until day -2 and resume on day 14 or when blood counts
      recover after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2; and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplantation on day 0.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST-DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO
      every 12 hours on days 0-27 (related donor recipients) or every 8 hours on days 0-96 with
      taper on day 40 (unrelated donor recipients). Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or PO
      every 12 hours on days -3 to 56, followed by taper on days 57-180 (related donor recipients)
      or on days -3 to 100, followed by taper on days 101-177 (unrelated donor recipients).

      DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION: Patients with persistent disease and no GVHD after stopping GVHD
      prophylaxis receive donor lymphocyte infusion IV over 30 minutes once every 28 days for 3
      doses.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up periodically for 2 years and then annually thereafter for 5 years.
