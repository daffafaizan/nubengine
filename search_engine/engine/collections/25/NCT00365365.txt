      enrollment. HER2-negative participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either stratum 1
      (AC->T sequential + bevacizumab) or stratum 2 (TAC + bevacizumab). All HER2-positive
      participants were assigned to stratum 3 (TCH + bevacizumab).

      The study included a treatment period of 1 year, followed by a 2 year posttreatment survival
      follow-up period.
