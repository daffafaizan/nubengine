      patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) despite the lack of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy
      of FICB for this indication. Therefore the objective of this randomized, prospective trial
      was to assess the analgesic benefit of FICB for post-operative pain management in THA. Our
      hypothesis was that FICB would confer an analgesic benefit for patients after THA.

      Methods After IRB approval and informed consent, patients having THA at our center in the
      period 2010-2011 were recruited in the morning of their surgery. Eligible patients were
      adults, ASA physical status I-III, and BMI <30) with no contraindication to study procedures.
      In the PACU, all patients received morphine sulfate IVPCA; patients reporting pain > 3 on the
      NRS-11 despite IVPCA were randomized by the method of sealed envelopes to receive US guided
      injections of 30ml 0.5% ropivacaine (FICB) or 30ml 0.9% NaCl (sham block, SB) beneath the
      fascia iliaca.

      The primary outcome variable was opioid analgesic consumption during the first 24 h
      postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity (NRS-11) and extent of
      sensory blockade.
