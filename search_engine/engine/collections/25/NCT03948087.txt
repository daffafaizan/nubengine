      for post-surgical edema, enable faster wound healing and shorter hospital stays, as well as,
      reduce time to prosthetic fitting. Casting also reduces the risk of impact damage to the
      limb. Casting, however, is costly and impractical due to the requirement of a prosthetist
      available on call for after emergency amputation surgeries and a need for multiple repeat
      prosthetist visits to cut off and reapply casting after wound healing checks. Thus current
      practice involves use of a compression elastic tube bandage (like a tensor bandage) applied
      within 15 minutes after surgery. However this bandage applies pressure to the residual limb,
      which can increase risk of reduced blood supply to the healing limb especially in vascular
      compromised patients. Further, this soft bandage does not offer any protection to the
      residual limb, a fall or severe contusion could lead to a requirement for costly revision
      surgery. There is evidence that rigid removable dressings can improve wound healing times,
      protect the limb, prevent contractures and enable earlier prosthetic fitting. This study aims
      to examine the the differences in wound healing time, changes in limb edema, knee range of
      motion, limb protection post falls, device application time, time to prosthetic fitting and
      cost between currently used postoperative soft dressing (SD) and vacuum removable rigid
      dressing (VRRD) after transtibial amputation.
