        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of GW786034 in patients with advanced solid
           tumors.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the effect of this drug on biomarkers of angiogenesis activity in order to
           estimate activity and to determine the minimum biologically active dose in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral GW786034 twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-6 patients receive escalating doses of GW786034 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 21 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
