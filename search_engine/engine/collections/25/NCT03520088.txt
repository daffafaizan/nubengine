      treatment of rectal cancer. Up to 50% of sexual dysfunction is described after TME and up to
      30% of urinary dysfunction. Although there are other factors, the main cause of postoperative
      genitourinary dysfunction is intraoperative injury of the autonomic pelvic nerves. One of the
      regions with more risk is the Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA). The main objective of the
      study is to compare pre- and post-TME sexual dysfunction according to the approach of the
      inferior mesenteric vessels, directly on the IMA or from the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)
      to the IMA.

      Methods: Multicenter, prospective, controlled and randomized study of patients with rectal
      adenocarcinoma with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, who will be randomized into two groups
      depending on the approach of the inferior mesenteric vessels. The main variable is pre and
      postoperative sexual dysfunction. The secondary variables are visualization and preservation
      of the pelvic autonomic nerves, pre- and postoperative urinary dysfunction, pre and
      postoperative quality of life. The sample to be included will be 90 patients, 45 per group.
