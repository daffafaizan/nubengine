      effects on cardiovascular functional capacity, quality of life, risk factors modification,
      and morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidences suggest that inflammation plays a key role
      both on initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Several markers of systemic
      inflammation appear to be active effectors in the pathophysiology of athero-thrombotic
      disease leading to the occurrence of AMI.

      The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein constitutively
      expressed in quiescent cells, and it has been implicated in several cellular functions,
      including determination of nucleosomal structure and stability, and binding of transcription
      factors to DNA sequences. HMGB-1 has been recently recognized as a critical mediator of
      inflammatory diseases. In fact, the passive release of this protein from necrotic or damaged
      cells represents an effective stimulus triggering the inflammatory response. Specifically,
      HMGB-1 binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and, in turns, it
      activates mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).

      This intracellular pathway leads to the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines.
      Interestingly, increased levels of HMGB-1 have been observed in atherosclerotic lesions,
      suggesting that HMGB-1 might be involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.

      This study was designed to investigate the relationship between HMGB-1 and strong
      postinfarction predictors of outcome such as cardiopulmonary and echocardiographic parameters
      before and after a 6-month exercise-based Cardiac Rehabilitation program.
