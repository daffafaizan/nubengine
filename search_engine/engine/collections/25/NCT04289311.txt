      intervention designed to facilitate self-management behaviors in children and adolescents
      with sickle cell disease (SCD). Specifically, the investigators propose to test the
      feasibility of the intervention for improving transition from parent-managed to adolescent
      self-managed care. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the communication that takes
      place via the intervention between adolescents, their parents/caregivers, and healthcare
      providers. The investigators will work with the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic to identify
      and recruit 5 healthcare providers of children with SCD and 30 dyads of adolescents ages 11 -
      17 SCD and their parent/caregiver (n = 60).
