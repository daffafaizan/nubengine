      in soccer for males between 40 and 60 years. Positive effects of such an activity on health
      can be suspected based on some studies and analogous conclusions. However, no sufficient
      database is available yet. Moreover, the range of cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing
      diseases for this specific population is not known.

      This study shall provide missing descriptive data on health status of veteran players and
      potential preventive effects of soccer at an age of 40 to 60 years. The investigation
      represents a cross-sectional examination of cardiovascular parameters and metabolic stress
      induced by training and competition. Additionally, orthopedic and other medical risks are to
      be revealed, and options should be developed to minimize these risks, e.g. by preventive
      measures included in training or rule modifications.
