      high-quality medication reminder smartphone application as a tool for secondary prevention in
      patients undergone CABG with DM, including the change in quality of life, medication
      adherence improvement and clinical outcome.

      Study design: the study is a two-arm, parallel, randomized clinical trial. Patients will be
      eligible if they have undergone CABG at this admission, have a history of diabetes mellitus,
      have the capability of reading and using smartphone application, and are able to provide
