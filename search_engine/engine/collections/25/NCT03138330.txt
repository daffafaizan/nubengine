    
      The primary purpose of this study is to validate a semi-quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire (FFQ) against a reference method (2-day weighed food records) in a sample of
      young children aged 15-36 months.

      In addition to dietary data, the investigators also collected information on parental
      demographics, toddler health with regards to allergies and intolerance, parental feeding
      practices, parent and child weight and height and lastly, saliva samples to study
      inflammatory markers.

      Therefore, in addition to the validation of the FFQ- the data will also be used to study
      associations between dietary patterns, food and nutrient intake and (i) parental feeding
      practices and (ii) inflammatory biomarkers from saliva
