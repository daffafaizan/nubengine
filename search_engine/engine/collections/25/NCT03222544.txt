      lower limb ulcer are often lower extremity vascular stenosis or occlusion, poor blood supply,
      making local ulcer local antibacterial drugs difficult to effectively reach and distribution,
      resulting in systemic antibacterial efficacy is limited, and easy to induce bacterial
      resistance at the same time . In recent years, the incidence of clinical multidrug-resistant
      bacteria increased, increasing the difficulty and cost of treatment.

      The current study attempts to identify whether the photodynamic therapy (PDT) would kill the
      surface of ulcer bacteria and promote ulcer healing, and explore the mechanism of methylene
      blue-mediated photodynamic therapy for diabetic lower limb ulcer RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS-This study evaluated six clinical indicatorsï¼š diabetic foot ulcer area reduction
      rate, inflammation control rate, Local bacterial load, the dose and use time of antibiotics,
      adverse reaction rate, bacterial biofilm,local neutrophil extracellular traps. The efficacy
      and safety of PDT could be confirmed if the clinical indicators of PDT group is better than
      the control group. In this study, three methods were used to investigate the mechanism of
      -methylene blue mediated photodynamic therapy for diabetic lower limb ulcer: a comparison of
      the bacterial load, bacterial biofilm,local neutrophil extracellular traps of the ulcer
      immediately pre-treatment and immediately,1-week ,2 week,1 momth post-treatment ; EXPECTED
      RESULTS-The investigators will expect that methylene blue-mediated photodynamic therapy could
      kill bacteria on the surface of diabetic lower limb ulcer and accelerate wound healing.
