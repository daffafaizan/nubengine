      study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter study comparing with pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin (PLD) with capecitabine as first line chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer in
      women 60 years and older. The study consists of a screening Phase (up to 14 days prior to
      treatment), treatment phase (up to 1 year), and post-treatment follow-up phase. The planned
      duration of treatment was 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2
      treatment groups (PLD or capecitabine). Safety evaluations will consist of vital sign
      examination, physical examination, incidence and severity of adverse events, and laboratory
      tests findings and will be followed throughout the study.
