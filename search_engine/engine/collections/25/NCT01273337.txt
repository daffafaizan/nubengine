    
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group, study in male and female
      subjects, designed to determine the safety and efficacy of ALD-401 in treating primary
      ischemic stroke. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized 3:2 within a site to the
      treatment or sham control arm. Subjects experiencing an ischemic stroke will undergo either a
      bone marrow or a sham harvest on days 11-17 and be dosed with ALD-401 or a sham procedure
      13-19 days after the primary event. Bone marrow cells are processed, sorted and formulated
      into a 3 mL suspension of ALD-401. Two days after harvest, subjects in the ALD-401 group will
      have their processed bone marrow cells (ALD-401) injected via intracarotid/MCA infusion,
      while control subjects have a sham infusion. All subjects will be followed for 12 months to
      monitor safety and to assess mental and physical function.

      This study seeks to demonstrate safety of ALD-401 derived from autologous bone marrow and
      given via intracarotid delivery in a therapeutic window of 13-19 days post primary stroke
      event. This dosing window was selected to allow post-stroke inflammatory response to recede
      and therefore minimize the impact of resident inflammatory cells on the administration of
      ALD-401. This dosing window was consistent with information derived from pre-clinical models.
      Intracarotid/MCA delivery may offer minimal loss or dilution of therapeutic cells prior to
      localization in and around the ischemic area of the brain. ALD-401 will be manufactured from
      the patient's own bone marrow harvested 11-17 days after the primary stroke event.
