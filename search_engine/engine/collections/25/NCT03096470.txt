      And compare the efficacy of closed reduction with anesthesia and no anesthesia for
      developmental dislocation of the hip. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 18
      months in order to identify any avascular changes in the femoral head. The presence of
      avascular necrosis was assessed by the criteria of Salter.
