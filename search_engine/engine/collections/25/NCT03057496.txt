      trained to use a collision warning device that alerts them to impending collisions.
      Participants will use the device at home during everyday mobility for about 1 month. The
      device is designed to supplement existing mobility devices, such as a long cane or dog guide.
      The device will provide warnings about potential collisions with mid- or high-level obstacles
      (which are typically not detected by a long cane).
