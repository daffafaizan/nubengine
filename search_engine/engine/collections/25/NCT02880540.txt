      the adult population because of its analgesic properties. It is a lipophilic imidazole
      derivative that is a selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative and analgesic
      properties devoid of respiratory depressant effects . Dexmedetomidine produces sedation by
      modulating the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine within the locus coeruleus of
      the brain, which is vital to producing an awake state. In addition, by directly stimulating
      α2-receptors in the spinal cord, dexmedetomidine inhibits the firing of nociceptive neurons
      responsible for the propagation of pain signals.

      Although dexmedetomidine is an agent with many off-label clinical applications in the
      pediatric setting, much about its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties remain
      unknown. This is even more evident for pediatric patients that are obese. Currently, there
      are no reported pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies that have investigated
      dexmedetomidine in obese children and adolescents. Our previous experience with the use of
      dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period along with our robust obese surgical population
      certainly supports the notion that we are well poised to conduct the proposed trial
