    
      This study is a prospective, post-market, multi-center, cohort assessment comparing Altis SIS
      (n=178) and transobturator and/or retropubic slings (n=178) in the treatment of stress
      urinary incontinence at up to 40 U.S. and international sites. Subjects will be followed for
      a total of 36 months with scheduled visits at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. The study
      population will consist of adult female subjects with stress incontinence who are clinically
      indicated for surgical intervention with a mesh sling.
