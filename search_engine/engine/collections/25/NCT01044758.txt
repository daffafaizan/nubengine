      Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to detect patients at risk for early intervention. One such
      condition is mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      studies in this group of patients have reported increased activation in the Medial Temporal
      Lobe (MTL) during performance of memory tasks. The functional significance of increased
      activation is unclear. One possibility is that greater activity reflects the increased effort
      needed in order to maintain performance, and as such would be a compensatory response. An
      alternative possibility is that increased activation reflects aberrant physiology related to
      the disease process itself and as such would be a sign of greater underlying disease severity
      and would interfere with brain function.

      Data in animal models suggest the possibility that low dose levetiracetam (well-tolerated
      anti-convulsant) treatment may reduce the observed hyperactivity and improve memory
      performance among individuals with MCI. The investigators are therefore conducting a
      within-subjects trial of 8 weeks duration, involving 144 subjects and low dose treatment with
      levetiracetam. During the course of the study, each subject may receive both drug and placebo
      for two weeks, with the order of administering those treatments counterbalanced. Cognitive
      testing and fMRI imaging will be obtained after 2-weeks on drug/placebo. The overall goal of
      the study is to determine if treatment of MCI subjects with low dose levetiracetam reduces
      hyperactivity within the MTL and improves memory performance.
