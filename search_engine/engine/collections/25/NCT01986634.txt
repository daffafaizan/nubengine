    
      Cohort Study, with Split Face treatment

      Methods:

      Patients will be evaluated in the office for possible inclusion. Those who agree to partipate
      will receive preoperative photos.

      On the day of the procedure patients will have a topical anesthestic applied for 30 minutes,
      then patients will recieve a 20um laser resurfacing of the entire face to remove dead skin
      and debris. After that, patients will have reapplication of a topical anesthetic for an
      additional 10 minutes. They will then undergo a 50 um peel to one side of the face and a
      patient tailored spot treatment of perioral wrinkles to the other side of the face. The depth
      of this may vary from 100 to 400um.

      Patients will return to clinic at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks post-procedure and fill out a
      short survey and have medical photography done. Patients will return at 3 and 6 month
      follow-up for additional photography and surveys. These visits will typically take 10 to 20
      minutes.

      Preoperative and post-operative photos will be analyzed by 2 independent plastic surgeons for
      post-operative changes and improvements.
