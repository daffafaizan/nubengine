    
      Material and Methods:

      A) sociodemographic variables:

      Age, sex, marital status, occupation, pack\year.

      B) clinical variables:

      1- Dyspnea measured by the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and the COPD Assessment Test
      (CAT ) while stable, previous to admittance.

      3- Charlson comorbidity index and age adjusted model.

      4- The APACHE II scale: the severity of the episode upon admittance, calculated using the
      APACHE II scale, using the worst value obtained in the first 24h after being admitted to
      hospital.

      5- the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale.

      6- Lab parameters: such as glucose, albumin and heamatocrit

      7- BAP-65 score: elevated blood urea nitrogen, altered mental status, pulse > 109 beats/min,
      age > 65 years.

      8- Assessment of symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

      9-Glasgow scale score.

      10-CURB 65 :"C" stands for "confused"; "U" stands for BUN greater than19 mg/dL; "R" stands
      for "respiration more than 30 breaths per minute""B" stands for blood pressure less than 90
      mm Hg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mm Hg or less; "65" stands â‰¥65 years.

      11-CAUDA 70: C: Confusion, Acidosis (pH <7.35), Urea >7mmol/L, MRC Dyspnoea score >4, Albumin
      <35g/L, Age >70 years. One point was assigned to each variable present, giving a six point
      scoring system.

      12-The COPD and Asthma Physiology Score.

      13-The early warning score.

      14-ADO index: comprised of age, dyspnea by the MRC, and FEV1. Scores ranged from 0 (best
      status) to 5 (worst status) for age, 0-3 for MRC, and 0-2 for FEV1. Points for each component
      were added so that the ADO index ranged from 0 to 10.
