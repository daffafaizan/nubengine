      non-instrumentation triple antibiotic paste pulp therapy (TAP) versus Vitapex pulpectomy in
      non-vital primary molars. Healthy 5 to 9 years old children with at least one non-vital
      primary molar were included in the study. molars were divided based on the subject's
      cooperation level and parental preference into two groups. In the first group, molars
      received TAP and in the second group, they received Vitapex pulpectomy followed by a
      stainless-steel crown. The TAP was freshly prepared and proportioned in equal parts by volume
      (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin=1:1:1) before the scheduled treatment
      appointment. The clinical and radiographic examination was performed by two calibrated and
      trained pediatric dentists at the pre-operative baseline and at the six- and 12-months
      follow-up visits.
