      current prevention models and a need for new approaches to contraceptive acceptability and
      promotion. Although popularity of Highly Effective Reversible Contraception (HER-C) in the US
      is steadily increasing, less than 10% of contracepting women use intrauterine devices (IUDs)
      or subdermal contraceptive implants, which are the most effective methods for avoiding
      unintended pregnancy.

      Poverty is an important predictor of unintended pregnancy where women with incomes below the
      Federal Poverty Level (FPL) have over a five-fold increased risk of unintended pregnancy
      relative to women with higher incomes. Because of limited public funds for family planning,
      low-income women in Salt Lake County have limited access to HER-C, which has high initiation
      cost but significant cost-saving potential over time. Additionally, contraceptive research
      has inadequately measured the social impact of HER-C.

      The first aim of the HER Salt Lake Initiative is to evaluate the increase in HER-C methods
      with three strategies: 1) Client centered contraceptive counseling; 2) Removal of financial
      barriers; and 3) Targeted media campaigns.

      The second aim of the HER Salt Lake Initiative is to assess changes in earnings and education
      among women initiating HER-C compared to other methods of contraception and model the
      projected lifetime earning potential of women based on their contraceptive method choices.
