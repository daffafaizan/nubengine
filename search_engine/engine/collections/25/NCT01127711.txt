      and residing in Västmanland and Örebro counties in central Sweden received a questionnaire
      concerning diet and other lifestyle factors. Of the 100,303 eligible men, 48,850 (49%)
      responded to the questionnaire. The questionnaire included items about diet, physical
      activity, medical history, and lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking history and use of
      dietary supplements.

      During 2008-09, the exposure information was updated and extended by sending out two new
      questionnaires - one questionnaire on health including several signs of symptoms, sleeping,
      social relations etc (2008) and one on diet, dietary supplement use, and lifestyle factors
      (2009). Majority of questions in the questionnaires have been validated.

      Incident cases of cancer are ascertained by record linkages of the study population with the
      National Swedish Cancer Register and the Regional Cancer Registers. Cardiovascular and other
      diseases as well as surgeries and causes of death are identified by linkage to the National
      Inpatient and other registries at the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. Ascertainment of
      cancer cases and other diseases is almost 100% complete. Dates of deaths are ascertained
      through the Swedish Death Register (100% complete), and information on date of moving out of
      the study area is obtained by linkage with the Swedish Population Register.
