      vaccine efficacy trials. It is important to gather information on the risk of HIV infection
      among recruited populations, the extent and stability of HIV risk behaviors in these
      populations, and the risk of HIV infection associated with risk behaviors. This vaccine
      preparedness study is designed to expand the capacity of the HIVNET to implement HIV
      prevention trials, increase the diversity of its participant population, and further target
      populations at highest risk of HIV infection.

      Participants complete a total of 6 scheduled study visits: 2 at baseline, 2 at follow-up 6
      months later, and 2 at follow-up 12 months after enrollment. Participant risk behaviors and
      knowledge of and attitudes toward HIV vaccine and other HIV prevention trials are assessed at
      each time point. HIV infection status is tested by standard HIV ELISA and Western blot at
      follow-up, as well as at participant request throughout the study. Participants are
      instructed to recognize and report suspected primary HIV infection based on symptoms or
      high-risk exposures. HIV pre-test, risk reduction, and post-test counseling is provided in
      accordance with CDC standards of practice. Participants who become infected with HIV during
      the study are counseled and referred for medical and psychosocial services.
