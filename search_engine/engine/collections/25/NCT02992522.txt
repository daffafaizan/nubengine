      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D),
      which is typically the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of the combination of obinutuzumab,
      venetoclax, and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall objective response rate to the combination of obinutuzumab,
      venetoclax, and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.

      II. To estimate the duration of response and 2 year progression-free survival associated with
      obinutuzumab, venetoclax, and lenalidomide treatment in patients with relapsed and refractory
      B-cell NHL.

      III. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of the combination of
      obinutuzumab, venetoclax, and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell
      NHL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax and lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and venetoclax PO on days 1-28.
      Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on
      day 1 of courses 2-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months.
