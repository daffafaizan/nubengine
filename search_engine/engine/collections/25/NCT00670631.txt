      have had no prior autologous or allogeneic transplant. Furthermore, only up to 12 months of
      prior treatment are allowed in this patient population. The study schema consists of one
      round of induction chemotherapy, two transplants, one round of consolidation chemotherapy,
      and two years of maintenance treatment. This study design differs from its historical
      predecessors in the following manner:

        -  In contrast to Total Therapy II and III, which only allow enrollment of patients with at
           most one cycle or one month of treatment prior to enrollment, the proposed study allows
           enrollment of patients with up to 12 months of prior treatment. No statistically
           significant difference in outcome between patients with one or no cycle of preceding
           therapy and those with up to 12 months of prior therapy. This should allow enrollment of
           significantly more myeloma patients.

        -  Induction therapy has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  Bortezomib and thalidomide have been added to the transplant regimen.

        -  BCNU is added to the second transplant to high dose melphalan.

        -  Gemcitabine is added to the second transplant regimen.

        -  Consolidation treatment has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  The first year of maintenance is with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone, and the
           second year of maintenance therapy consists of dexamethasone only.

        -  The novel agents thalidomide and bortezomib are not introduced upfront, but only with
           transplantation and maintenance.
