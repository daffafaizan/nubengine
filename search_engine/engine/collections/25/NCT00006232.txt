        -  Compare the partial and complete response rates in patients with multiple myeloma
           treated with induction therapy comprising idarubicin and dexamethasone vs vincristine,
           doxorubicin, and dexamethasone.

        -  Compare the disease progression, time to achieve maximal response, and duration of
           response in patients treated with these 2 regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral idarubicin and oral dexamethasone daily on days 1-4.
           Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone daily on days 8-11
           during course 1 only.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily, doxorubicin IV continuously, and
           vincristine IV continuously on days 1-4. Courses repeat as in arm I. Patients receive
           additional dexamethasone as in arm I.

      Patients without a maximal response after completion of course 4 may receive up to 2
      additional courses.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then prior to each study course.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
