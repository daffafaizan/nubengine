      Wort is one of the most popular herbal dietary supplements with a variety of claims including
      mood elevation and stabilization, stress relief, anti-viral effects, and enhancement of the
      immune system. We have previously demonstrated that treatment with St. John's Wort for 14
      days does not induce the clearance of carbamazepine under steady state conditions of
      autoinduction of carbamazepine clearance. One proposed mechanism for this lack of effect is
      that St. John's Wort is not sufficiently potent to further induce previously induced CYP3A4
      enzyme activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of St. John's Wort on
      single dose carbamazepine pharmacokinetics under conditions of uninduced CYP3A4. To evaluate
      this potential drug interaction, as well as the effect of St. John's Wort on epoxide
      hydrolase activity, eight normal healthy subjects will be enrolled into this pharmacokinetic
      study. Subjects will take a single 400 mg dose of carbamazepine followed by serial blood
      sampling over 72 hours for carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentrations.
      Subjects will then begin taking a standardized formulation of St. John's Wort three times
      daily with meals for two weeks. Following 2 weeks of St. John's Wort subjects will then again
      take a single 400 mg dose of carbamazepine and have serial blood samples collected for
      carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentrations. The total carbamazepine and
      carbamazepine epoxide exposure (AUC), oral clearance (CL/F), and maximal concentrations
      (Cmax) will be compared between treatment phases to characterize the potential drug
      interaction.
