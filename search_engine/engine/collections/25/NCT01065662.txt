           without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have recurrent
           gynecological cancers. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive
           the same dose of the study drug.

        -  There will be samples of blood taken that measure any additional effect of the study
           drugs and to look for a marker for the participant's particular type of cancer. Blood
           will be taken at a certain point in the study to evaluate the interaction of the two
           study drugs, cediranib and temsirolimus when given together. These are called
           pharmacokinetic (PK) samples. About 6 teaspoons of blood will be taken with each PK
           sample with a total of 34 samples taken.

        -  Participants will be given a study medication diary for each treatment cycle. Each cycle
           lasts four weeks (28 days). Temsirolimus will be given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each
           cycle. Cediranib wil be taken orally once daily in the morning.

        -  Participants will be asked to monitor their blood pressure on a daily basis at home and
           keep a blood pressure diary.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time periods during the
           course of the study: medical history; side effect assessment; physical exam; vital
           signs; blood tests; CT scan; MUGA or ECHO; EKG and urine test.
