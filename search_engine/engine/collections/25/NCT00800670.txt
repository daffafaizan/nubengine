      expected to rise. HIV-infected persons are especially susceptible to TB. An improved TB
      vaccine over the present BCG vaccine is needed.

      The general objectives of our TB vaccine research program are to develop a safe and effective
      vaccine for persons who at increased risk of contracting TB or reactivating latent
      tuberculosis and develop a safe booster vaccine for persons who have been previously
      vaccinated with BCG.

      This is an open-labeled phase 1 single institution trial investigating a recombinant genetic
      TB vaccine AdAg85A given by intramuscular injection in healthy subjects with or without a
      history of BCG vaccination. Ad5Ag85A is a recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vector
      expressing an M. tuberculosis immunogenic antigen Ag85A. We have shown that it is safe,
      immunogenic and associated with enhanced protection against challenge with virulent M Tb in
      murine, bovine and guinea pig models. Clinical grade AdAg85A has been manufactured by the
      Robert E Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory, Centre for Gene Therapeutics, McMaster University,
      Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

      The effect of pre-existing adenovirus antibodies on the safety and immunogenicity of the
      recombinant AdTB vaccine will be evaluated and the results of the PPD skin test following
      vaccination evaluated in a subset of subjects with a history of a negative PPD skin test.
