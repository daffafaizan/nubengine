    
      This open-label, sequential study is conducted in two parts: a monotherapy phase and a
      combination treatment phase.

      In the monotherapy phase sequential 3-patient cohorts receive 1 of 3 doses of rifapentine
      monotherapy.

      In the combination treatment phase, 12 patients each are randomized to one of three arms:

      Arm I: Rifapentine (assigned dose level based on monotherapy phase) plus azithromycin.

      Arm II: Rifapentine (assigned dose level) plus clarithromycin. Arm III: Rifapentine (assigned
      dose level) plus ethambutol.
