      critical care network in Asia. Through this network and this study, the investigators aim to
      provide a comprehensive epidemiological description, clinical management and outcomes of
      critically ill children with severe pneumonia across multiple sites in Asia. Through PACCMAN,
      the investigators aim to collect clinical data across at least 10 countries on children
      admitted to PICUs for severe pneumonia. Detailed data on aetiologies (not limited to
      vaccine-preventable pneumonia), broad age groups (not limited to a specific age group of
      children), and specific and supportive therapies in the PICU, will allow the investigators to
      perform comparative analysis of important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors
      associated with mortality and functional outcomes in a large cohort of children with severe
      pneumonia. This sets the stage for multi-center studies to investigate the effectiveness of
      intensive care therapies on the outcomes of children with severe pneumonia.

      The overall aim is to study the epidemiology of severe pneumonia is Asian children and
      compare the effectiveness of currently employed management strategies (related to invasive
      mechanical ventilation, adjunct and metabolic support) on clinical outcomes in approximately
      2000 children with severe pneumonia admitted to PICUs across at least 10 countries in Asia.

      The specific aims of this study are as follows:

      Primary Aim: To (1) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PACCMAN PICUs
      due to severe pneumonia; (2) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PICUs
      for severe pneumonia that develop pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) prior
      to PICU discharge or transfer; (3) estimate the overall and PARDS-specific mortality rates
      for children admitted for severe pneumonia; (4) characterize/classify etiologies of severe
      pneumonia according to the WHO criteria.

      Secondary Aim 1: Obtain distributions and estimates of 28-day ventilation free days and
      28-day PICU free days; estimate the proportion of patients requiring extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation.

      Secondary Aim 2: Identify risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality rates in
      children with severe pneumonia in Asia.
