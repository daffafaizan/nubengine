      fat (high in trans fat) with vegetable oil results in higher levels of total and LDL
      cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol). There has been tremendous interest within the food industry
      to identify cooking fats that have the physical properties necessary to make shelf stable
      products and have textural characteristics similar to existing products but that also
      favorably affects risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) such as LDL cholesterol
      levels and inflammatory markers. The current study is designed to assess the effect of a
      conventional cooking oil (hydrogenated oil) and a reformulated fat low in trans fatty acids
      on cardiovascular disease risk factors.
