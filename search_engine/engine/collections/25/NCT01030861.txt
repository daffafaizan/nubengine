      years. The study is projected to last between 4-6 years, depending upon rate of enrollment
      and number of subjects who develop diabetes.

      The main study objective is to determine whether intervention with teplizumab will prevent or
      delay the development of type 1 diabetes in high risk autoantibody positive non-diabetic
      relatives of individuals with T1D. Secondary outcomes are to include analyses of C-peptide
      and other measures from Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing (OGTT), safety, tolerability, and
      other mechanistic outcomes will be assessed during the study.
