      with prophylaxis (13 patients) received thiamazole alone (7 patients) or with sodium
      perchlorate (6 patients). The prophylaxis was administered one day prior to iodinated
      contrast medium (ICM) and for at least 14 days after ICM for thiamazole (20-40 mg/daily) and
      10 days after ICM for sodium perchlorate (900 mg/daily). Group without prophylaxis (23
      patients) received no prophylactic treatment. Laboratory tests were performed before and
      after ICM injection in all patients from both evaluated groups. Each individual had TSH and
      creatinine level measured at baseline. The investigators analyzed clinical data such as age,
      sex, mean volume of contrast media, goiter size and patients' comorbidities. Levels of TSH,
      FT3 and FT4 were evaluated retrospectively at different points in time after ICM.
      Ultrasonography was performed in each patient to assess thyroid morphology. The investigators
      performed a comparison between both groups in regard to duration of overt hyperthyroidism and
      thiamazole treatment. Thyroid volume was compared between patients who developed
      hyperthyroidism after ICM injection and remained euthyroid after ICM injection. Patients
      diagnosed with overt hyperthyroidism were treated with thiamazole.
