      effective against HCV genotypes 2 and 3 when it is administered in combination with weight
      based ribavirin for 24 weeks. In Genotype 1, a combination of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2 a
      with oral Sofosbuvir and weight based Ribavirin for 12 weeks resulted in 90 -100 % sustained
      virological response rates (SVR). These SVR rates for chronic hepatitis C genotypes 1,2 and 3
      are all based on Western studies. The investigators plan to conduct a retrospective study in
      Northern India region on patients treated with Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin or Sofosbuvir,
      Ribavirin and Peginterferon alpha 2a. The purpose of the investigators study is to assess the
      percentage of patients with sustained virologic response.
