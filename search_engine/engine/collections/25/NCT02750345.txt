    
      The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, single dose, three-period crossover
      bioequivalence study in at least 18 healthy male and female subjects at a single study center
      to evaluate the in vivo performance of two formulations of Nitisinone 10 mg and the reference
      product Orfadin under fasting.

      A total of 24 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) will be entered
      into the study. Volunteers will be determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers will
      be randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) under fasting conditions.

      There will be a minimum 23 calendar days washout between treatments. Blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0 hours) and at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 2 hours and
      30 minutes, 3 hours, 3 hours and 30 minutes, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 10
      hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120 hours post-dose
      (total: 21 samples per treatment period).
