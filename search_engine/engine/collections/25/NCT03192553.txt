      volunteers who participate in direct patient care. However, doffing simulations will be
      conducted outside of patient care areas and will not involve patients. Staff participants PPE
      techniques will be evaluated in the controlled environment of the simulation center of the
      Unique Pathogens Unit. The comparison groups will be the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      procedure with the addition of a second layer of gloves (double gloving procedure), the CDC
      procedure with additional hand hygiene performed on gloves at key steps (intensified hand
      hygiene procedure), and the one-step roll off of gown and gloves (one-step procedure), with
      the CDC procedure as the control. Participants will be assigned to a doffing protocol
      chronologically starting with the double glove and ending with the control until 100
      volunteers have participated. Additional PPE such as masks and goggles will be removed as
      part of each of the four protocols. Healthcare workers will receive a demonstration of the
      donning/doffing from the study coordinator, and perform a practice donn/doff prior to the
      observed simulation. Only one volunteer with participate in each simulation session. Glogerm
      (TM) will be applied to PPE in a thin stripe and smoothed to evenly with gloved hands to
      cover arms, trunk, and gown hem. S. epidermidis will be applied using colonies diluted in
      solution and spread over gloves, arms, trunk, hem with a swab.
