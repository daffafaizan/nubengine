      cabozantinib once daily orally. Required dose reductions will be in decrements of 20 mg
      cabozantinib (maximum two dose reductions).

      Subjects will receive study treatment as long as they continue to experience clinical benefit
      in the opinion of the investigator or until there is unacceptable toxicity.

      Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib, given as second-
      or third-line treatment in HCC patients that progress on or are intolerant to immune
      checkpoint inhibitors.

      Secondary objectives for this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the activity of cabozantinib, in terms of ORR (CR+PR) as per RECIST 1.1,
           duration of response, time to treatment failure (TTF), time to progression (TTP), and OS

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib
