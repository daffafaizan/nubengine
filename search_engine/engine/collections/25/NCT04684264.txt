      testing, biorepository storage) and baseline echocardiography. All participants will
      additionally be administered a health and lifestyle questionnaire, undergo measurement of
      vital signs, and receive uniform education on heart-healthy lifestyle and signs and symptoms
      of heart failure. Participants who are randomized to the intervention arm will receive a
      referral to Heart Failure Prevention Clinic, a pharmacist-directed practice in collaboration
      with an attending cardiologist, where they will be followed for 1 year, with their primary
      care physician updated after each visit. The information from their BNP, hs-cTn, and
      echocardiography will be provided to them and their primary care physicians as well as the
      pharmacist and cardiologist team members. The participants (and their primary care providers)
      who are randomized to usual care will be blinded to their BNP and hs-cTn values and
      echocardiography results.
