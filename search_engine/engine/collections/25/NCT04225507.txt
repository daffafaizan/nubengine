    
      This is a 6-month randomized controlled, parallel group trial with two arms. After baseline,
      the subjects will be randomized to lifestyle intervention alone (lifestyle group) or
      lifestyle plus CPAP intervention (lifestyle plus CPAP group). The same metabolic and
      cardiovascular assessments will be performed at baseline and after 6-months of intervention.

      The lifestyle group will aim to achieve a weight loss through diet and exercise. The
      lifestyle plus CPAP group will additionally receive CPAP treatment. All subjects will use a
      custom smartphone app to track weight loss and/or CPAP goals and will receive weekly coaching
      phone calls to maximize treatment adherence.
