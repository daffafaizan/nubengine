      found to reduce cardiovascular events. This protective effect has been traditionally
      explained by lowering plasma cholesterol and subsequent reduced progression of
      atherosclerosis. However in animal experiments statins have also shown the ability to induce
      pharmacologic preconditioning and thereby reduce infarct size. This effect contributes to the
      beneficial effect of statins on reducing of cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate
      between these two mechanisms of protection we will study the effect of atorvastatin on
      ischemia reperfusion damage after a short exposure to atorvastatin, before the lipid lowering
      effect of atorvastatin becomes apparent.
