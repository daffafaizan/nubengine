    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To create a registry (to be called "Carolina Senior") of older patients with an
           appointment at North Carolina Cancer Hospital.

        -  To have these patients complete a Geriatric Assessment (GA).

      Secondary

        -  To measure the response rates of GAs of Carolina Senior patients and their satisfaction
           with a GA by measuring the percentage of patients contacted who consent to complete the
           GA; the percentage of patients able to complete the self-administered portion of the GA
           without assistance; the length of time necessary to complete the GA; the variance and
           number of missing items; the percentage of GAs that contain all 3 of the following
           items: Timed Up and Go Assessment, Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, and
           healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance status; and patient satisfaction
           with the questionnaire by identifying items that are distressing or too difficult to
           comprehend.

        -  To gather information, including patterns of patient care, that would lend support for
           future research in the 'Carolina Senior' population who receive a confirmed diagnosis of
           cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence
           of disease, or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer).

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a geriatric assessment, a multi-dimensional inter-disciplinary
      patient evaluation that includes an evaluation of a patient's functional status (ability to
      live independently at home and in the community), co-morbid medical conditions, cognition,
      psychological status, social functioning and support, medication review, and nutritional
      status. Patients' medical records are also reviewed. Patients' health status at 1 year is
      incorporated into the registry.
