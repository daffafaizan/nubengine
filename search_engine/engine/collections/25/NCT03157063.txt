      metabolic function in adolescents. For this pilot study, the investigators will quantify
      variations in metabolic characteristics using a 2 x 2 cross-sectional study design,
      stratified by body weight (normal vs overweight/obese) and physical activity (sedentary vs.
      active). The goal is to identify metabolic factors that influence the energy balance system
      to directly inform interventions designed to prevent or reduce the prevalence of pediatric
      obesity.
