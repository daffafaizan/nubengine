      The patients with peripheral arterial disease will fill in the Korean version of WIQ before
      starting treatments. Baseline results of arterial function test, toe-brachial index and
      treadmill test will be recorded. Three months later, the patients will complete the
      questionnaire again. Arterial function test, toe-brachial index and treadmill test also will
      be taken again after treatment and the correlation of WIQ and other exams will be evaluated.
