      of core stabilization exercises performed with and without jaw movements in the management of
      nonspecific chronic low back pain. A total of 80 male and female volunteers having subjects
      with chronic nonspecific low back pain will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be
      assessed for transverse abdominal muscle strength contraction, pain and disability using
      Pressure Biofeedback Unit (BPU), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS 0-10cm) and Ronald Morris
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ 0-24) respectively. The scores on the mentioned scales will be
      documented as per guidelines. After baseline assessment, all subjects will be allocated to
      two groups through computer-generated random sampling. Group 1 will perform core stability
      exercises alone; Group 2 will perform core stability exercises with teeth clenching This
      study will be conducted at the Physiotherapy Department of Sindh Institute of Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation (SIPM&R). The computer-generated random sampling technique will
      be used to allocate the participants into the study groups. Data will be analyzed using SPSS
      22 and one-way repeated measure ANOVA will be applied to see the mean difference in the 2
      groups. For pair-wise comparison, the Tukey test will be applied. For pain and disability
      scales Friedman's test will be applied to see the two scales' median differences.
