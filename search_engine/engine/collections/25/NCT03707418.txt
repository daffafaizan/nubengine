      are anticoagulated with Heparin and Bivalirudin. Patients will be anticoagulated with a
      heparin bolus at the commencement of ECMO per standard of care, as there will be insufficient
      time to randomize these frequently emergent patients. Consent for the study will be obtained
      from a legally authorized representative Prior to starting a continuous infusion of
      maintenance anticoagulation, patients will be randomized to bivalirudin or heparin. Outcome
      measures are bleeding, thrombosis, development of Heparin Induced thrombocytopenia, number of
      cross-overs between the two research arms, circuit failures, decannulation, deaths and
      discharges from hospital.
