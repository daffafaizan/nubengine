      treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). They primarily exert their
      cytotoxicity through conversion into 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN) that are incorporated
      into DNA. Interindividual variations in response to thiopurine therapy are influenced by
      genetically determined polymorphisms in the activity of the enzyme thiopurine
      methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT competes with the formation of 6TGN, as it methylates the
      thiopurines (especially 6MP) and some of their metabolites. Approximately ten percent of all
      individuals are TPMT heterozygous, with one wild type and one low activity allele, and one in
      three hundred individuals are TPMT deficient with two low activity alleles. During the
      maintenance therapy phase of the treatment of childhood ALL, which may last several years,
      6MP is given on a daily basis at a starting dose of 75 mg/m.sq./day, which is subsequently
      adjusted to a white blood cell count of 1.5-3.5 x109/L. We have previously demonstrated that
      the risk of relapse is reduced by more than 50%, but the risk of second cancer was increased
      3-fold among TPMT low activity patients. Accordingly, the Nordic ALL2000 protocol recommended
      the dosing of 6MP to be based on the patients TPMT activity. In the present study of almost
      1000 Nordic patients, we will explore whether this strategy of TPMT-based individualised 6MP
      dosing have benefitted the patients by reducing their risk of second cancer while preserving
      their low risk of relapse.
