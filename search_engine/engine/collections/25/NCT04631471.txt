    
      DCM is a common, disabling disease. It is also a major cause of gait disturbance and
      imbalance in the elderly. As a consequence, DCM contributes to reduced mobility and frailty.
      NHS England recognises 1) reducing premature mortality and 2) enhancing quality of life for
      people with long-term conditions as important. DCM patients are at risk of recurrent falls,
      which is a major concern. In fact, a study investigating patients with hip fractures
      demonstrated that 25% of patients suffered from undiagnosed DCM. Surgical decompression is
      the only form of treatment at present. It is shown to stop disease progression. However
      neurological recovery after surgery is often disappointing. There are no approved drug
      treatments for DCM. Alleviating the long-term disability caused by DCM represents an unmet
      clinical need. Recovery of leg and arm function, as well as an improvement in pain are the
      patient recovery priorities.

      In DCM mechanical pressure on the spinal cord causes progressive loss of nerve cells and
      their processes as well as loss of myelin sheaths, the insulating layers of neurons formed by
      oligodendrocytes. Surgical decompression can halt disease progression, but there is limited
      natural spinal cord repair. Preclinical studies demonstrated that inhibition of PDE4 is able
      to stimulate a regenerative response, which is likely to benefit DCM: remyelination and
      axonal plasticity. Clinical studies using Ibudilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, have
      demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis. The observed beneficial effects are
      likely to reflect regeneration-inducing and neuroprotective effects of Ibudilast in the human
      CNS.

      The proposed trial is the first regenerative treatment for DCM, and potentially the first
      drug-based regenerative treatment for neurosurgical disease. It will mark an important
      milestone with regard to translation of preclinical findings into a clinical setting. The
      research questions have been designed to:

        -  Assess safety and tolerability of Ibudilast in patients undergoing surgery for DCM

        -  Assess efficacy of Ibudilast treatment in patients undergoing surgery for DCM

        -  Investigate disease mechanisms using

             -  Advanced imaging techniques, including MRI

             -  Gait analysis

        -  Explore the role of novel clinical outcome measures for studies investigating DCM

             -  Clinical scales

        -  Inform the design of future drug trials for use in DCM

        -  Investigate the impact of DCM on carers

      The following hypothesis will be addressed: Ibudilast improves recovery following surgical
      decompression of degenerative cervical myelopathy.

      RECEDE-Myelopathy is a multi-centre, double blind, phase III randomised, placebo controlled
      trial assessing the use of Ibudilast as an adjuvant treatment to decompressive surgery for
      DCM involving up to 10 UK sites. A total of 362 participants will be recruited.

      Each participant will be on trial for approximately 15 months (±21 days). There is a maximum
      1 week interval from screening to randomisation and a maximum 1 week interval from
      randomisation to treatment commencement. Ibudilast treatment will start within 10 weeks prior
      to surgery and will continue for up to 24 weeks after surgery. Treatment will be halted 5
      days prior to surgery and resumed at the previous maximum dose as soon as possible after two
      days since the operation. Participants will be taking Ibudilast for a maximum of 34 weeks; in
      case surgery is delayed beyond 10 weeks, post-surgery treatment will be shortened accordingly
      to keep the 34 weeks maximum treatment period. Participants will be followed up for a maximum
      of 12 months after surgery.

      The trial aims to run in parallel to standard clinical care. The only difference between the
      trial pathway and the standard NHS pathway is the addition of a course of either Ibudilast or
      placebo, and the additional follow up.DCM is typically managed in the outpatient setting.
      Patients are referred to a surgeon for assessment and management. Patients often already have
      a diagnosis. Sometimes, an allied professional makes a diagnosis acutely and a same day,
      'emergency' referral is made to the regional spinal centre. On occasion, such a situation
      predicates urgent surgery, but typically in such cases an outpatient appointment is made.
      Patients will therefore be identified from participating neurosurgical centres, typically via
      outpatient clinics but also the 'emergency' referrals. Screening of patients to determine
      eligibility for participation in the trial will be undertaken by the parent neurosurgical
      team according to the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Prior to screening, patients with DCM
      will be approached by a delegated member of the local trial team and given a patient
      information sheet (PIS) to take away and read in their own time. Patients will be advised to
      get in touch with the local trial team in order to address any questions that they may have
      on the contents of the PIS. If they decide to participate in the trial, they will be invited
      for a screening visit to provide a written informed consent and assess their eligibility for
      the trial as per inclusion/exclusion criteria described below.

      Once informed consent is obtained, screening assessments will be performed in the same
      outpatient clinic visit.

      Screening assessments to establish eligibility will include:

        -  Age

        -  Medical History including but not limited to

             -  Neurological Disorder(s)

      At the end of the visit, the dosing diary will be issued to the patient and instructed on how
      to use it. Participants' eligibility will be confirmed on receipt of results of the
      laboratory tests and they will be randomised to either Ibudilast or placebo. Participants
      will start treatment no later than 2 weeks after screening visit. One week after IMP delivery
      or collection, the local research team will make contact with the participant by telephone to
      ensure they have received the IMP and commenced their trial treatment. Any Adverse Events
      which may have occurred since consent will be documented in CRFs. Surgery will be performed,
      ideally, within 10 weeks after start of trial treatment.

      and the following assessments will be performed:
