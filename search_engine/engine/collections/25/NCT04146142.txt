      antibiotic use reduction without increase the risk of serious infection complications are
      therefore needed.

      Purpose: The aim of this trial is to compare the rates of infectious complication after
      transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with and without antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Materials and methods: A total of 450 patients will be included in this trial. A 1:1
      randomization to receive or not receive antibiotics prophylaxis will be performed using
      randomization system WebCRF-3 system. MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy will be done with
      transperineal prostate approach in local anesthesia in outpatient clinic. In patients with
      normal MRI,12-core systematic prostate biopsies with 3D biopsy registration will be done
      according to the EAU guidelines. In patients with positive MRI, 2-4 targeted biopsies from
      the suspicious MRI areas will be realized and systematic prostate biopsies will also be done.
      All prostate biopsies will be performed using Koelis MRI-TRUS image fusion and organ based
      tracking system. Post-biopsy infection and any adverse events will be systematically
      prospectively registered in all patients. Pain during the local anesthesia application and
      during the biopsy procedure will be registered using Visual Analog Score, 10 points scale
      questionnaire.
