    
      BT8009 consists of a Bicycle peptide (BicycleÂ®) which binds selectively to Nectin-4, and is
      covalently attached to a spacer and a cleavable linker attached to a cytotoxin (MMAE).

      This study is a Phase I/II, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study of
      BT8009 given as a single agent given once weekly and in combination with nivolumab. There are
      three parts to this study. Part A is a dose escalation in patients with select advanced solid
      tumors primarily designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of BT8009 as monotherapy or in
      combination with nivolumab and to determine a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following a
      selection of a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), part B, a dose expansion portion, will be
      initiated with the primary objective of clinical activity of BT8009 as a monotherapy or in
      combination with nivolumab in patients with select advanced solid tumors. Part C will
      evaluate safety and tolerability of chosen RP2D of BT8009 in patients with renal
      insufficiency.
