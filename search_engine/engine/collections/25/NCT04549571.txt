      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that the enhanced iCanDecide (iCanDecide-emotional support enhancement
      [ESE]) intervention is more effective than the standard version (iCanDecide-standard [S])
      resulting in higher patient knowledge about locoregional treatment risks and benefits.

      II. To demonstrate that the activation of the clinician dashboard (CDB) is more effective
      than not using a CDB, resulting in higher patient knowledge about locoregional treatment
      risks and benefits.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that the enhanced iCanDecide (iCanDecide-ESE) intervention is more
      effective than the standard version (iCanDecide-S), resulting in higher patient-reported
      breast cancer self-efficacy and lower patient reported cancer worry.

      II. To demonstrate that the activation of the clinician dashboard (CDB) is more effective
      than not using a CDB, resulting in higher patient-reported breast cancer self-efficacy and
      lower patient reported cancer worry.

      OUTLINE: This study is a multi-level trial of SHaDES that has two interventions in a
      factorial or crossed design: 1) an individually randomized patient-level randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the standard version (iCanDecide-S) vs. a version with
      innovative emotional support enhancements (iCanDecide-ESE), and 2) a clinic-level
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to test a Clinician Dashboard (CDB). Twenty-five
      surgical practices will be recruited for participation. Practices will be randomized to the
      timing of the CDB intervention, with some practices initiating the CDB intervention right
      away, while others may initiate the CDB later or perhaps be randomized to "no CDB" period.
      Clinicians will be asked to use the CDB beginning in the time period to which their practice
      was randomized and continuing to the end of the study. After registration, clinicians are
      followed up at 9 and 18 months. After a patient is registered, the patient will be randomized
      to one of two arms:

      ARM I: Patients utilize the iCanDecide - ESE website, then undergo surgery within 5 weeks of
      registration. Patients may also participate in an audio-recorded phone interview over 20
      minutes at 9-12 months post registration.

      ARM II: Patients utilize the iCanDecide - S website, then undergo surgery within 5 weeks of
      registration. Patients may also participate in an audio-recorded phone interview over 20
      minutes at 9-12 months post registration.

      After study registration, patients are followed up at 4-5 weeks and 9 months.

      Patients will be enrolled at participating clinics during the full duration of the study and
      all enrolled patients will receive a version of the decision support tool (iCanDecide-S;
      iCanDecide-ESE). These patient-level activities are not influenced by the timing of the
      practice-level randomization to the CDB.
