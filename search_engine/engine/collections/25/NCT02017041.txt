    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of a medication management aid for
      opioid dependence named SubAID. The SubAID system is a smartphone application and medication
      monitor designed to optimize adherence behaviors of an OD patient responsible for
      administering bup/nal maintenance therapy medication.

      Usability of the SubAID system will be tested utilizing a 3-Stage study design over a 5 week
      period among a cohort of subjects prescribed bup/nal and undergoing OST.

        -  Stage 1 - 1 week: Participants will use only an electronic medication monitor
           (MedSignals) in control mode to passively record baseline adherence to medication.

        -  Stage 2 - 2 weeks: Participants will use MedSignals in control mode and the smartphone
           application.

        -  Stage 3 - 2 weeks: Participants will use MedSignals in active mode and the smartphone
           application.

      After each stage usability assessments will be conducted to evaluate satisfaction with the
      products from participants.
