      (no yolk sac or fetal pole). Women in both follow-up groups will have β-hCG testing on the
      day of methotrexate injection and again in 8 days. If the level does not fall by 50% or they
      have concerning symptoms, they are asked to return to clinic for evaluation. If the β-hCG
      level falls by 50% or more, they will continue to be followed as per the protocol in their
      chosen group, but will be followed until their β-hCG becomes negative.
