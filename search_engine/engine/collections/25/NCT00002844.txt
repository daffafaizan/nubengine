      and bone marrow transplantation for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are at
      high risk for disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive daily intravenous infusions of cyclophosphamide for two days,
      followed by total body irradiation in four daily exposures. After completion of the total
      body irradiation, allogeneic or autologous bone marrow is infused intravenously.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients are expected to be accrued.
