      and be enrolled in the digital lifestyle intervention program. Following a 2-week run-in
      period at lower dose (500 mg/day) to minimize gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea,
      nausea, flatulence, bloating), participants will be escalated to a maximum dose of 1000
      mg/day. The digitally delivered lifestyle change program will include a core curriculum
      focused on diet quality, food types, exercise and behavioral strategies for goal setting, and
      self-monitoring.
