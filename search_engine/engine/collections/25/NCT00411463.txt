      efficacy of Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy for Bipolar II Depression (IPSRT-BPII). A
      total of 56 eligible subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups : Seroquel (n=28) or IPSRT-BPII (n=28). Following
      baseline assessment, all participants will undergo up to 20 weeks of their assigned
      treatment. Patients assigned to IPSRT-BPII who fail to respond (at least 50% reduction in
      HRSD-25 scores and YMRS ≤ 10) by week 12 will have Seroquel added to IPSRT-BPII. Subjects who
      achieve remission (defined as 3 consecutive weeks where both HRSD-25 and YMRS scores average
      ≤ 7) and have participated in the trial for a minimum of 12 weeks will be moved into a
      continuation phase where they will receive maintenance treatment (bi-monthly therapy sessions
      and/or pharmacotherapy) until week 20. Patients who do not achieve remission by Week 20 will
      be discontinued from treatment and referred for follow-up care. All subjects (remitters and
      non-remitters) will be assessed at 20 weeks.
