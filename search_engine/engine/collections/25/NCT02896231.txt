      with Met-positive (Met+) advanced NSCLC. The study includes a Dose-escalation Part (part
      A)and a Dose Expansion Part(part B). The aim of the part A is to estimate the MTD and to
      identify the dose limited toxicity(DLT) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PLB1001
      single agent as well as to determine the PK/PD profile .Once response has been observed in
      certain dose level ,then followed by the expansion part to further assess the clinical
      efficacy and safety of PLB1001 single agent. Aprox. 40 patients will be enrolled in PART A,
      while 20-30 patients for expansion cohort .

      PLB1001 is a potent selective c-Met inhibitor. PLB1001 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal
      cmet-mediated signalling, leading to profound tumour growth inhibition in xenografts of
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours. Preliminary data from a c-Met inhibitor INC 280
      has provided possibility on the safety and clinical activity of PLB1001 monotherapy in this
      patient population.
