      body weight and body fat as compared to a diet with a normal or low protein content. The
      effect seems to be due to a higher diet induced thermogenesis and increase satiety.

      Milk has a high content of proteins. It contains two very different types of protein: whey
      and casein. Whey is a soluble protein whereas casein clots into the stomach, which delays its
      gastric emptying and thus probably results in a slower release of amino acids. It is
      therefore very likely that the two types of protein affect the thermogenesis and appetite
      regulation differently.

      The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of dairy proteins (whey and casein) on
      postprandial energy expenditure, substrate oxidation and appetite regulation.

      The study will have a cross-over design including four meals each including a test drink
      (milk, casein drink, whey drink or water).
