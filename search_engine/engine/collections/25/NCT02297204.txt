    
      The safety and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept injections have been investigated in
      previous Phase I, I/II and III studies in AMD, RVO, and DME trials. Potential safety issues
      associated with the route of administration or the pharmacology of aflibercept in the study
      population include decreased BCVA, intraocular inflammation, intraocular infection, transient
      and/or sustained elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), cataract development or
      progression, retinal or intravitreal hemorrhage, macular edema, retinal break or detachment,
      and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). Safety will be assessed by visual acuity,
      ophthalmic examinations, fluorescein angiograms, OCT, intraocular pressure, vital signs, and
      adverse event documentation.

      To minimize the risks of intraocular infections, all injections will be performed employing
      sterile techniques as described in Appendix A. Study drug administration will be held for
      subjects who experience certain ocular events or infections. In the event any subject
      develops an adverse event in the study eye that is considered by the evaluating physician to
      be severe in intensity, serious consideration should be given to withdrawing the subject from
      the study.

      The PI or designated Sub-Investigators will review all adverse events on an ongoing basis to
      determine causality and relationship to study drug and/or study procedures.
