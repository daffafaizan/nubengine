      trial of the iFuse Implant System for SI joint fusion vs. conservative management. Subjects
      assigned to conservative management may cross over to iFuse after a minimum of 6 months of
      conservative treatment. Conservative management does not include interventional procedures
      such as prolotherapy, steroid injections and/or RF ablation.
