    
      This is an experimental clinical trial in which will be selected at the University, 40
      students with tension-type headache due to temporomandibular dysfunction. Among the selected
      subjects will be randomized by blind draw into two groups: intervention group (IG) and
      placebo group (GII).

      The instruments that will be used for the evaluation are the visual analog pain scale, the
      Survey questionnaire for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC) 3, and surface electromyography
      (EMG System of Brazil).

      The EMG signals will be collected in the rest position (3 samples) and maximum voluntary
      isometric contraction (3 collections). The masseter and temporalis muscles bilaterally will
      be evaluated according to the protocol of Rodrigues.

      For treatment of Ear, initially cleaning the pinna is made to be manipulated with 70% alcohol
      and later will be inserted mustard seed with a tape in the following points: Shenmen,
      Sympathetic, Kidney, subcortex, Adrenal and Brain second Souza in GI and GII point of the
      trachea. Such treatment will last 15 minutes each session, being held 2 times a week,
      alternating the ear to be manipulated over a period of 5 weeks.

      For comparison between groups the Mann-Whitney test statistic with Software BioStat 4.0
      software will be used. With a significance level (p <0.05).
