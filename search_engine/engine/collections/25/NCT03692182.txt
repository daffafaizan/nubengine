      among nursing home residents, yet comparatively little attention has focused on antipsychotic
      use among older adults receiving care in community-based settings. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the prevalence of antipsychotic use among a nationally
      representative sample of nursing home-eligible older adults in a community-based practice
      setting known as Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). The secondary
      objectives are focused on characterizing antipsychotic use within PACE and for these
      participants. Specifically, the investigator's secondary objectives are to describe patterns
      of other drugs concomitantly used with antipsychotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids) and to
      identify clinically relevant drug-drug interactions involving antipsychotics.
