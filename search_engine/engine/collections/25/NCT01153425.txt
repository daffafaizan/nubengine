    
      The overall design is to determine and compare the effect of teriparatide and of zoledronic
      acid on trabecular architecture by magnetic resonance imaging of the midshaft tibia.
      Post-menopausal women, aged 60 or older with osteoporosis and/or at increased risk of
      fracture, will be randomized to receive either teriparatide or zoledronic acid. Trabecular
      microarchitecture, biomechanical parameters and bone mineral density will be examined at 0
      and 12 months at 3T MRI.
