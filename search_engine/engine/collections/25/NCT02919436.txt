      operations. While much is known about the innervation and neural regulation of bladder
      emptying and storage, the cause of urinary retention after surgery is not fully understood.
      Early research has indicated that a small dose of tamsulosin (FlomaxÂ®), a commonly used
      medication approved to treat urinary symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, may
      reduce the incidence of POUR. Urinary retention is a prevalent issue in patients undergoing
      spinal surgery, leading to patient discomfort and prolonged length of stay. We hypothesize
      that the use of perioperative tamsulosin in patients undergoing spinal surgery will decrease
      the incidence of POUR.

      The study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will
      be randomized 1:1 to receive either oral tamsulosin 0.4 mg or placebo, taken once each
      evening, beginning 5 days prior to surgery and continuing through the first postoperative
      day. The primary endpoint is met when the patient is able to spontaneously empty their
      bladder post-operatively, or needs to be catheterized with either a straight or indwelling
      urinary catheter for post-operative urinary retention, whichever occurs first.
