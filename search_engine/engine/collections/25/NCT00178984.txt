      activity in the smooth muscle of the intestines. Volunteers with normal bowel activity, those
      with gastric problems, and diabetics with gastric problems will be studied under the SQuid to
      determine normal and abnormal activity. Diabetics with an abnormal gastric emptying study
      will be asked to participate.
