      nicotine on various elements of attention in smokers and nonsmokers. Because no published
      study, to our knowledge, has reported the effects of nicotine on the ANT and ABT, we will
      include the CPT, a task shown to be sensitive to nicotine, as a positive control. A secondary
      aim is to compare the subjective and physiological effects of nicotine between smokers and
      nonsmokers.

      Study Population: 50 smokers for a total of 30 completers (15 women, 15 men) and up to 50
      nonsmokers for a total of 30 completers (15 women, 15 men).

      Design: Placebo-controlled, between-groups comparison of smokers and nonsmokers. Participants
      will attend three experiemental sessions; a single dose of nicotine nasal spray (0, 0.5, or
      1.5 mg) will be administered at each session.

      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures will be accuracy and/or response time on the three
      attention tests, ANT, CPT, and ABT. Secondary outcome measures include responses to the
      PANAS, VAS items, and vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure). Participant demographics
      and smoking history will be reported using descriptive statistics.
