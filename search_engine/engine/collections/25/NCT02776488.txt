      indicated by cerebral microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR). We have performed safety
      analysis of exogenous sodium lactate infusions in humans and have demonstrated proof of
      concept that these fuels alter brain metabolism. Animal TBI studies have demonstrated proof
      of concept for exogenous lactate and pyruvate. We will conduct a multicenter, adaptive
      design-based, proof of concept biomarker mechanistic safety study of exogenous sodium
      lactate. The preliminary goal is to determine if exogenous lactate infusion is safe and has a
      demonstrated effect on selected biomarkers.
