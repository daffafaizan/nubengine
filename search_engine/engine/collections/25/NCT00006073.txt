    
      This protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of healthy subjects and
      patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. Healthy subjects may be studied to obtain
      normative data for endocrine tests involving blood, urine, saliva, ultrasound and magnetic
      resonance examinations. If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with
      endocrine-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard,
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the patient will receive
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder, according to current clinical practice. The
      overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to support our clinical
      training and research missions.
