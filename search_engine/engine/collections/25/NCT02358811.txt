      age. Our hypothesis is that adult apneic subjects would present local cerebral modification
      in the areas implied in cognition and memory, such as the hippocampus or the frontal areas,
      whereas elderly patients would present focal affects related to a deficit in the ventilatory
      and autonomic control without any major cognitive consequences.

      Understanding the consequences of sleep apnea according to age could permit to refine the
      indications of sleep apnea treatment, mainly in elderly patients.
