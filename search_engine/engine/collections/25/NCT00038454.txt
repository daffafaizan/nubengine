      criteria will undergo the IAD harvest following a post-induction IAD harvest calculation. IAD
      blood will be collected into citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine 1 (CPDA-1) blood bags. All
      subjects will receive a volume of Hespan® equal to the volume of their IAD harvest (to a
      maximum of 1 liter) performed as a result of the harvest calculation (0-1200 mL inclusive).
      Additional volume replacement required owing to IAD >1000mL will be performed with
      crystalloid, as required. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms
      (Hemolink™ arm or control arm) upon meeting a transfusion trigger for the first time while on
      CPB. Randomization will be administered centrally. Subjects will be transfused upon reaching
      predetermined transfusion triggers, reflecting a decrease in hemoglobin concentration and/or
      oxygenation:
