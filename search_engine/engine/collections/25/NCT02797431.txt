      in Europe and the US. Recently, evidence has accumulated that sepsis progresses from a state
      of hyper-inflammation to a state of immunosuppression. This immunosuppressive phase is
      characterized by increased incidence of secondary infections often with relatively avirulent
      opportunistic type pathogens. Currently, new therapeutic approaches to sepsis are occurring
      using immuno-adjuvants that boost host immunity. One of the most promising agents
      Interleukin-7 is an essential, non-redundant, pluripotent cytokine produced mainly by bone
      marrow and thymic stromal cells that is required for T-cell survival.In addition to its
      anti-apoptotic properties, IL-7 induces potent proliferation of na√Øve and memory T-cells
      potentially supporting replenishment of the peripheral T-cell pool which is severely depleted
      during sepsis. These effects were confirmed in clinical trials at the National Cancer
      Institute and in HIV+ patients.

      This clinical study will test the ability of IL-7 to restore the absolute lymphocyte counts
      in septic patients who have markedly reduced levels of circulating lymphocytes. An effect
      already confirmed in preclinical models of sepsis.
