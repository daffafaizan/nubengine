      There is evidence to suggest that pimavanserin, a medication approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, may improve deep sleep
      and insomnia. This study preliminary assesses the feasibility of pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime
      for 6 weeks for the treatment of chronic insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder.
