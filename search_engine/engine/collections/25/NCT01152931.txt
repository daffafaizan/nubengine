      and hepatocyte with possible generation of free radicals that may contribute to cellular
      membrane damage. This will make uninfected erythrocyte and hepatocyte to be more susceptible
      to merozoite invasion. Zinc and Selenium has immunomodulatory properties. They enhance
      cell-mediated immune response in malaria infection. This may help to adequately suppress
      schizont maturation and inhibit the release of merozoites. However, it is possible that they
      have a direct chemosuppressive or blood schizonticidal effect. The following research
      questions emanated from this hypothesis;

        1. Do the micronutrients in question have direct suppressive or schizonticidal effect?

        2. Can they be used as short course therapy with standard antimalarials in uncomplicated
           malaria?

        3. Is their effect enhanced when used in combination with each other or with standard
           antimalarials?

        4. Do they have any prophylactic benefit?

        5. Can their use alter the course of established malaria infection?
