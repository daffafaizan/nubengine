    
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the use of barbed sutures
      to close uterine incision at cesarean section is associated with an increase in the rate of
      postoperative adhesions compared with conventional sutures or not. Primigravida patients
      undergoing transverse lower segment cesarean section will be included in the study.Cesarean
      section incision will be closed with double layers of continuous barbed or conventional
      sutures.Patients who will return for a repeat caesarean (elective or emergency) will be
      evaluated intraoperatively for the presence of adhesions between various pelvic structures.
