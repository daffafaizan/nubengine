      cancer in Brazil. Other specific aims are:

        -  to describe patients demographics and socioeconomic characteristics

        -  to describe the BC pathological characterization

        -  to describe treatment (describe each treatment with dates start-end, cycles, dosing,
           sequence and line of treatment, reason for discontinuation)

        -  to analyze patients outcome (time to progression, site of metastasis, progression free
           survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), skeletal related events (SRE))
