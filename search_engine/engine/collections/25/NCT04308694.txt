      clinically-stable methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients who receive between 6- and
      13-days methadone take-home doses will be enrolled in the study where their methadone
      take-home administration and dispensing will be transferred to a community pharmacy for 3
      months. Participants will also complete three follow-up assessments at 1-month, 2-months, and
      3-months after the baseline visit to collect clinical and safety information since the
      previous assessment. Primary outcomes will be focused on feasibility measures (recruitment,
      accessibility to methadone treatment, substance use, medication call back success, and
      retention in treatment). Secondary outcomes will be focused on self-reported satisfaction
      measures from MMT providers (e.g., physician, physician assistant, nurse, and counselor)
      pharmacists, and patient participants.
