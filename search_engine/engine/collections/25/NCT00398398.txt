      patients with AGC, and there is still a need for new agents and/or regimens to improve the
      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy in advanced stomach cancers.

      The combination of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) has been widely used for the first-line
      treatment of advanced gastric cancer in many countries.

      Randomized phase III trial investigating capecitabine plus cisplatin(XP) versus FP showed XP
      is at least as good as FP with improved patients' preference.

      A Phase II study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) was conducted in our study group.
