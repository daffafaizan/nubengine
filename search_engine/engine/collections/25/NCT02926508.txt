    
      This study has a randomised, double-blind, between-subjects, placebo-controlled design,
      whereby participants will receive a 12-week treatment with Bimuno or a matched placebo.

      Children whose Key Stage 1 scores indicate they are within the lowest quintile for literacy,
      but whose teachers do not judge them to have any other significant learning difficulties,
      will be invited to be screened for the study. The teacher will also need to confirm if their
      reading is still a cause of concern; if not, the children will no longer be considered for
      inclusion in the study. Teachers will be asked to add the names of any additional children
      whose reading shows room for improvement. These children will be assessed to ensure they meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      If the child passes this initial school screening stage, and conditional to parental consent,
      he/she will then be assessed using the reading test from the British Ability Scale (BAS).
      Only those whose reading falls into the bottom 34th centile on the BAS word reading measure
      will be invited to take part in the full study.

      The study will include three sessions in total (all taking place at schools): (1) screening
      session, (2) baseline session and (3) post-intervention testing session. Children will also
      be asked to wear an actigraphy device for 5 consecutive nights before and after the
      treatment. In addition, children will be asked to give saliva samples on a few occasions
      (both at home - pre- and post-intervention -, as well as during the baseline and testing
      session visits).

      Parents and teachers will be asked to complete standardised questionnaires also before and
      after the treatment ends.
