      research study because these participants are pregnant and have gestational diabetes.
      Participants will be offered an opportunity to wear a medical device that monitors blood
      sugars (glucose). This device is called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The CGM measures
      glucose levels through a tiny plastic filament that is inserted under the skin in the abdomen
      by a skin prick. Typically, participants cannot feel this device once it is inserted. If
      participants agree to participate in this study, participants will be randomly placed into
      one of two groups: (1) the intervention group or (2) the control group. Participants will
      have a 50% (1 out of 2) chance like a coin toss of being placed into either group. If
      participants are in the intervention group, they will wear a real-time continuous glucose
      monitoring device (RT-CGM). The RT-CGM will allow participants to see glucose levels in real
      time. The RT-CGM will send information about glucose levels to a phone or display device so
      participants may see the glucose at all times. If participants are in the control group, they
      will not be given a RT-CGM. Instead, participants will be given a blinded CGM device. You
      will not be able to view your blood sugar results on the blinded CGM device. If participants
      are in the control group, they will also be given a blood glucose meter to check glucose
      using finger sticks according to the recommendations of the provider.
