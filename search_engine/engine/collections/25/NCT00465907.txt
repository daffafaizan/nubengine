      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of 80-85% of lung cancers, and is a major health
      problem. The main etiology of lung cancer is well recognized and established to be cigarette
      smoking which accounts for up to 80% of the cases in the western countries. Due to success of
      anti-smoking campaign, we anticipate to see less smoking related lung cancer and more
      non-smoking related lung cancer which is rising rapidly. For eg, currently in Singapore,
      smoking only accounts for 50-60% of all lung cancers, this is particularly true in female
      patients, as smoking occured in 30-40% of female lung cancer patients only.

      It is unclear if there is any significant difference in the fundamental biology between
      smoking and non-smoking related lung cancers, particularly in areas of natural course of
      disease, genetic changes of tumor cells, clinical presentation, response to treatment or
      survival. These are potential aspects for further investigation.
