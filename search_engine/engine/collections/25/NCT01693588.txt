      undertreated, 20% to 30% of all surgical patients continue to experience moderate to severe
      postoperative pain. High levels of postoperative pain are associated with an increased risk
      of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, are the most common reason for delayed
      discharge or for unexpected hospital admission after ambulatory surgery, and are responsible
      for prolonged convalescence after inpatient surgery. Furthermore both neuropathic pain and
      post surgical pain inhibit weight gain and may have an impact on the patient's nutrition post
      operatively. Finally, high levels of postoperative pain have also been associated with an
      increased risk of chronic pain. Therefore, the aggressive treatment of postoperative pain may
      be particularly important in influencing patient outcomes, inadvertent readmissions, and
      propensity for developing chronic pain.
