      two consecutive direct skin feeding assays (DSFA) at 24-hour interval. The results will
      determine the type of pivotal trial design for a follow-on Phase 2b trial whose objective is
      to bridge the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to the direct skin feeding assay (DSFA)
      and direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using a monoclonal antibody intervention, TB31F mAb,
      which interrupts transmission from human to mosquito. The results from this experimental
      medicine study will inform whether the preferred "Before-After" trial design in which each
      human volunteer serves as their own internal control can be utilized for a follow-on Phase 2b
      trial.
