      balance by giving perturbation based balance training.All perturbation exercises are given by
      either mechanical or by self reaching tasks in forward,backward,and in both sideways. There
      are very studies ;who attempted perturbation based balance training to improve balance in
      elderly population but not for stroke patients for their Speed, Balance and Function.The
      manual perturbation exercise can be an promising intervention in the future for various
      conditions
