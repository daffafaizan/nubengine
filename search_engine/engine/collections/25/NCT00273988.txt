    
      Ten HIV-1 infected, opioid-dependent adults on stable methadone treatment were to be enrolled
      in this study. This was an open-label, sequential treatment study, with methadone
      pharmacokinetics sampling before and after twenty-one (21) days of nevirapine administration.

      All patients received the same regimen. Methadone was administered in the first treatment
      period, and combination treatment of methadone and nevirapine was given in the second
      treatment period. In the first period, patients received methadone at their current steady
      state dose. In the second period (study days 1-21), they also received nevirapine 200mg qd
      (study days 1 to 14) and 200mg bid (study days 15 to 21). Blood samples were taken at the
      start of the first treatment period and at the end of the second treatment period for
      analysis of methadone and nevirapine pharmacokinetics parameters.

      Study Hypothesis:

      It was expected that nevirapine would decrease methadone levels in this patient population.

      Comparison(s):

      The study compared methadone steady state exposure in the absence and presence of steady
      state nevirapine. A range of pharmacokinetics parameters were assessed including clearance of
      methadone (the primary endpoint variable), area under the concentration-time curve, maximum
      concentration, time to maximum concentration and minimum concentration (measured for both
      methadone and nevirapine).
