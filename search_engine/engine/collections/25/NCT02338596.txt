      clinical outcomes at long-term follow-ups. However, they may have potential clinical
      consequences related to stress shielding, thigh pain, periprosthetic fractures,
      proximal/distal dimensional mismatch, an easier access pathway for wear debries and removal
      during revision. In an effort to reduce the risk of stress shielding, thigh pain,
      periprosthetic fracture, proximal/distal stem mismatch, and to facilitate removal of well
      fixed stem, a new ultra-short anatomic metaphyseal-fitting cementless femoral stem was
      developed. It was designed to provide closely mimicking the original functioning hip. The
      absence of the diaphyseal anchorage attempt proximal load transfer to reduce stress
      shielding, thigh pain and proximal distal/mismatch. Furthermore, it attempts to preservation
      of the femoral canal and femoral elasticity and ease of revision. The question thus arises
      whether it is possible to obtain strong and long-lasting fixation of the femoral component
      without diaphyseal anchoring.

      As clinical and radiographic performances of this ultra-short stem have been investigated
      only in a few studies and at short-term follow-ups, it remains to be elucidated whether an
      ultra-short stem shows a low incidence of implant loosening, stem misalignment,
      intraoperative fractures and revision rate. The purpose of this randomized controlled study
      to compare: (1) the clinical results, including Harris hip score, thigh pain, Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index score, and patients' satisfaction; (2)
      radiographic results, including stress shielding, implant loosening, stem misalignment; and
      (3) intraoperative fractures and revision rates of cementless total hip arthroplasty using an
      ultra-short anatomic metaphyseal-fitting cementless femoral stem versus a conventional
      metaphyseal and diaphyseal fitting anatomi proximal porous-coated cementless stem in the same
      patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous sequential total hip arthroplasty under one
      anesthetic.
