      biochemical, metabolic and physiological perturbations associated with obesity. The
      implications of these ethnic differences remain to be further defined. Several epidemiologic
      studies have shown that vascular disease and its cardiovascular complications, carry
      significantly higher morbidity and mortality in African Americans compared with
      Caucasians.1-3 These observations may be partly explained by a higher prevalence of
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
      tobacco use among African Americans.4-6 However, the pathophysiological processes underlying
      this racial predisposition have not been fully elucidated.7 It is likely that the etiologic
      basis of ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease is multi-factorial and involves dynamic
      gene-environment interactions in which variances in behavior and the social context are
      critical determinants.

      The proposed Program recognizes the importance of incorporating both biological factors and
      social determinants in the analysis of cardiovascular disparities
