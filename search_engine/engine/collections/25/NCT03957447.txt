    
      Overall goal of the study To contribute to a better understanding of the clinical
      epidemiology of wounds and wound healing and to improve wound management in settings with
      limited resources at the community level, the primary and secondary level of the health care
      services.

      Study objectives Main study

        -  To measure the proportion of wounds healed (defined as wound closed) at each cycle of
           clinical diagnosis and the corresponding presumptive treatment

        -  To describe the clinical epidemiology of wounds presented (presumptive clinical and
           confirmed diagnoses)

        -  Coverage and quality of wound management training of health care personnel at the
           peripheral health care level (health posts); Substudy 1

        -  To measure the effectiveness and acceptability of thermotherapy of patients with early
           BU (< 2cm) treated at health post level with the following outcomes:

             -  Primary endpoints absence of clinically BU specific features' according to WHO
                guidelines or 'wound closure' within 6 months after completion of heat treatment
                ("primary cure") and 'absence of BU recurrence for 12 months after completion of
                heat treatment' ("definite cure").

             -  Secondary outcomes rates of withdrawal for low compliance consent withdrawal rating
                of thermotherapy by health staff Substudy 2

        -  To measure the frequency and the severity of skin lesions (broken skin barrier) in the
           community and the health services

        -  To investigate the determining factors of community and health services-based wound
           management

        -  To measure the impact of the wound management intervention (main study and substudy 1)
           on the frequency, spectrum and severity of wounds including systemic complications in
           the community and at the 7 health posts / district hospital (HDSS-based) compared to the
           baseline study before the intervention and over time after the implementation of the
           intervention.

      Target Population The target population are approximately 43,000 people of the Taabo HDSS
      which is surveyed longitudinally for key demographic, health and socioeconomic indicators
      since 2008 (12, 13, 14). This provides ideal conditions to implement the intervention and
      assess the impact through operational endpoints. The health centres and the district hospital
      involved are part of the public health system. There is one district hospital and the seven
      health posts within the Taabo DHSS.
