      III-IV hemorrhoidal disease. However it is associated with intense postoperative pain that
      requires the use of multimodal analgesia. Inadequate pain control leads to the prolongation
      of admission, increasing the consumption of opioid analgesics.

      Traditionally spinal or general anesthesia is used in proctological practice. However, the
      number of studies about using of perianal local anesthesia, both in combination with general
      anesthesia and as a separate practice has been increasing recently.

      Perineal block with the anesthesia of the pudendal nerve's terminal branches allows to
      perform a hemorrhoidectomy with the optimal intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. The
      drugs used for this have some pharmacological differences in the duration of the drug and the
      form of administration.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study is to assess the effectiveness of
      the intraoperative use of perineal block with spinal anesthesia to reduce postoperative pain
      and the amount of used analgesics.
