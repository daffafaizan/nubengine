    
      Previously or newly collected biospecimens from various dermatologic diseases including port
      wine stains, hemangiomas, angiofibromas, Kaposi's sarcoma, angiosarcoma, scars, rosacea and
      psoriasis will be evaluated for markers of angiogenesis. Additionally, researchers can use
      discarded human skin tissue samples from skin biopsy/surgery sites which are removed for
      closure but are not submitted for histopathologic analysis.

      Currently, biospecimens prospectively collected are only from lesions with a known diagnosis:
      1) port wine stains, hemangiomas, cherry angiomas, facial angiofibromas, scars and psoriasis
      these lesions are generally not biopsied for diagnosis or 2) previously biopsied and
      diagnosed other vascular lesions such as angiosarcomas and Kaposi's Sarcoma.

      Specimens collected will be processed for microarray analysis, qPCR and/or
      immunohistochemistry performed to evaluate expression of various angiogenic factors and their
      receptors including: vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor,
      angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase
      I and thrombospondin-1, Angiotensin 2 receptor.

      Additional, tissue samples will be used to isolate three cell types: endothelial cells,
      keratinocytes, and fibroblasts. Tissue samples will be digested to isolate the cells which
      will be cultured separately and then incorporated into an in-vitro model to observe how blood
      vessels form in skin affected by port wine stains as compared to vessel growth in unaffected
      skin.
