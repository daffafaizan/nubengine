      opportunistic infections and deaths related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in youth,
      there is a need to ensure that youth living with HIV (YLH) are linked to and engaged in care
      to successfully achieve viral suppression. While an increasing number of mobile health
      (mHealth) technologies have been designed to address HIV prevention and care, a critical gap
      in innovation remains in tools designed to address the specific needs of YLH. In a Phase I
      project, investigators demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of a user-centered
      prototype design of PlusCare, an mHealth application that can be used by YLH and their case
      managers (CMs) to support HIV care. Results of Phase I suggest that PlusCare could facilitate
      multi-disciplinary, team-based case management of YLH by supporting the sharing and signing
      of documents remotely, automation of adherence reminders, sharing of lab results, alerts CMs
      about program requirements related to age and developmental milestones, streamlining of
      communication between multiple members of a patient's case management team and the patient,
      and offering accessibility to data from multiple modalities. In this Phase II project,
      investigators will conduct a mixed methods, non-randomized pre-post study with CMs (N=20) and
      YLH patients (N=70) to examine the use of PlusCare on case management processes and health
      outcomes (i.e., HIV viral load, medical visit frequency and gaps) in 3 different case
      management programs at 2 different clinical study site settings. An initial cost analysis
      will be performed to assess potential cost effectiveness. Results of these Phase I and II
      projects will inform the development of a product that can be used in multiple case
      management settings and prepare PlusCare for future commercialization. Results have
      implications for future development of PlusCare to serve the broader HIV population (YLH aged
      25-34 years old and at-risk individuals) as well as youth living with other chronic health
      conditions.
