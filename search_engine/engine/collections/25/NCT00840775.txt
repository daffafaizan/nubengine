      that will be conducted at up to 25 sites in Europe and Israel. All patients will be followed
      at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year post index stenting procedure.

      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of target vessel failure (TVF, see definition
      below) within 270 days of treatment with the Presillion™ Stent System. This rate will be
      compared with a performance goal derived using a meta-analysis of the standard-of-care
      therapy, coronary stenting with bare metal stents. This data will be used to support the PMA
      application for the Presillion™ Stent System.
