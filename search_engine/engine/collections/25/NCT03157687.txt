    
      A dysbiosis of human gut microbiome is discussed in the pathogenesis of many disorders, also
      including gastrointestinal (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) or liver diseases (e.g.
      liver cirrhosis) . A detailed analysis of intestinal bacterial patterns might reveal
      important findings for understanding disease pathogenesis. Thereby many studies only analysed
      the luminal microbiome of stool samples, whereas mucosa-associated bacteria have possibly a
      greater impact on human health and immune system .

      To determine the differences of luminal and mucosa-associated bacteria, stool and mucosa
      samples (via biopsies) will be collected. Thereby biopsies are taken of different intestinal
      locations (small intestine and colon) to detect variations along intestinal tract. An
      additional comparison of bacterial patterns in patients with chronic, local (IBD) and
      systemic inflammation (with liver cirrhosis) or without intestinal inflammations (healthy
      controls) should reveal the influence of microbiome on or by inflammation processes.
