      pressure improve pain management via SCS

        1. Examine the extent to which reductions in blood pressure (4 weeks of diuretic) improve a
           SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension compared with placebo.

        2. Examine the extent to which arterial baroreflex function, which is critical to blood
           pressure regulation, is impaired in patients with chronic pain and hypertension and is
           correlated with chronic pain symptoms.
