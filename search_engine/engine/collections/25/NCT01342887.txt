    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) and
      etoposide in combination with pravastatin (pravastatin sodium) and cyclosporine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery
      (CRi) rate after up to 2 cycles of induction therapy.

      II. Describe the disease-free survival of patients that achieve CR/CRi. III. Estimate the
      frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities, along with 28-day mortality after
      start of study treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II, dose-escalation study of etoposide and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride in combination with pravastatin sodium and cyclosporine.

      Patients receive cyclosporine intravenously (IV) continuously on days 5-9. Patients also
      receive pravastatin sodium orally (PO) every 6 hours on days 1-10, etoposide IV continuously
      on days 5-9, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV continuously on days 5-9. Treatment repeats
      for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving CR/CRi may receive 2 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
