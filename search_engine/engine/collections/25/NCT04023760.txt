      disease. After transplant surgery, patients must take immunosuppressive therapy, which
      carries significant risk for drug-drug interactions and adverse medication-related events.

      Transplant recipients are at an increased risk for co-morbidities traditionally managed with
      warfarin, such as venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. Apixaban has the potential
      to provide safer and more effective treatment, without additional monitoring of the INR, but
      it has not been studied in conjunction with anti-rejection agents in this population.
      Apixaban is metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-gp and BCRP transporters. As part of their
      immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant recipients are maintained on calcineurin
      inhibitors, which are weak CYP3A4 as well as potent P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. A study was
      recently undertaken to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction between cyclosporine or
      tacrolimus and apixaban in healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03083782) .
      The results indicated that the change in apixaban exposure was not clinically relevant.

      PK studies in healthy volunteers are a first step for determining the nature and extent of
      potential drug-drug interactions. However, follow-up studies in the actual patient
      populations are essential for ensuring safety and tolerability, and providing clinicians the
      confidence to use these combinations. The purpose of this study is to confirm the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of apixaban in combination with tacrolimus and
      cyclosporine in stable kidney and lung transplant recipients.
