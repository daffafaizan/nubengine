      of the U.S population. Annually, ~60,000 Americans die from TE and half of the survivors
      suffer long-term morbidity. Despite these staggering statistics, little is known about the
      clinical characteristics or epidemiology of the inherited risk factors for TE. Less is known
      regarding the acquired risk factors or the phenotype of TE in persons with multiple risk
      factors, yet preliminary data suggest that as many as 10% of patients may have multiple risk
      factors.

      Data from several studies, primarily involving adult subjects, shows that in a population of
      consecutively studied thrombosis patients, that one of the five most common inherited
      predispositions will occur in ~33.8%. Antithrombin (AT) is the least common (~1.9%) of these,
      while Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common (~18.8%). Most children who suffer from TE
      have indwelling catheters to assist therapy of underlying medical conditions, or are sick
      neonates. Thus, the contribution of molecular risk factors in children is largely unknown,
      with the exception of sparse retrospective data.

      The TE Registry may help clearly define the clinical phenotype, epidemiology, and
      complications seen in patients with TE associated with known molecular risk factors.
