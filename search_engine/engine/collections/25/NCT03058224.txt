        -  Screening visit, V1 (Day -10 to -7), informed consent

        -  Baseline visit, V2 (Day 1), randomization, treatment start

        -  Phone call, V3 (Day 4 ± 1)

        -  Phone call, V4 (Day 8 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V5 (Day 15 ± 3)

        -  On-site visit, V6 (Day 22 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V7 (Day 29 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V8 (Day 36 ± 3)

        -  On-site visit, V9 (Day 43 + 3), treatment end

        -  Follow-up on-site visit, V10 (Day 50 + 7, or 7 + 7 days after EDV).

      In addition, patients may be asked to return to the trial site between scheduled visits for
      assessment of safety data (unscheduled visits).

      The maximum duration of treatment for the individual patient will be 46 days (including
      allowed visit window deviation). The maximum duration of trial participation for the
      individual patient will be 67 days.
