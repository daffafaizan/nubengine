      changes in depression symptoms, dysmetria, and balance for medication non-responders. This
      research will provide an initial first step towards answering the following three research
      questions:

        1. Does a multimodal chiropractic applied clinical neuroscience approach to care affect
           self-reported symptoms of depression?

        2. Does a multimodal chiropractic applied clinical neuroscience approach to care affect
           dysmetria and balance control in a clinically depressed population?

        3. Are changes in dysmetria and balance control correlated with a change in depressive
           symptoms.
