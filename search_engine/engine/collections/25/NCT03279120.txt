    
      The purpose of this multi-center Phase I protocol, titled Phase I, 90-Day Safety,
      Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Study of Intravaginal Rings Releasing Tenofovir and
      Levonorgestrel is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      the Tenofovir/Levonorgestrel Intravaginal Ring (TFV/LNG IVR).

      The study will enroll healthy, non-pregnant, ovulatory, HIV-uninfected women aged 18 to 50
      with a body mass index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m2, regular menstrual cycles (approximately
      26-35 days) by participant report, and willing to use non-spermicidal condoms for sex and
      follow other study restrictions. Women will be protected from pregnancy by abstinence from
      vaginal intercourse or agreeing to consistently use condoms.

      The enrollment goal is for approximately 60 participants to complete the study. A subset of
      approximately 20 women will be selected for an in-depth interview to take place during the
      first month of IVR use and again after 90 days of use.

      Women will be randomized to one of four arms: TFV/LNG IVR (8-10mg per day/20μg per day) for
      90 days (Continuous), TFV/LNG IVR (8-10mg per day/20μg per day) for 3x28 days (Interrupted),
      placebo IVR for 90 days (Continuous), or placebo IVR for 3x28 days (Interrupted) and will
      undergo blood, cervicovaginal and rectal fluid sample collections, and cervicovaginal tissue
      collections for PK and PD assessments before, during and after 90 days of continuous or
      interrupted IVR use.
