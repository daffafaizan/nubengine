      represent unrecognized cardiac involvement. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can
      detect cardiac involvement including minute amounts of myocardial damage. Therefore, the
      objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of CMR and compare it with standard
      clinical evaluation for cardiac involvement. Patients with documented extracardiac
      sarcoidosis or clinically suspected cardiac sarcoidosis will be enrolled.
