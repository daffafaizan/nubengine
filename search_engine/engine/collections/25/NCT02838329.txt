    
      In this prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind study; parturients with functioning
      labour epidural analgesia requiring conversion to anaesthesia for surgical delivery (SD) -
      will be randomised into control and intervention groups: room temperature (RT) and body
      temperature (BT). The control group (RT) will receive room temperature Ropivacaine 0.75%, as
      is the standard practice. The treatment group (BT) will receive 0.75% Ropivicaine warmed up
      to 37Â°C temperature. Block height will be assessed every 2 minutes by a blinded investigator
      until the loss of sensation to cold at the level of T4, sensation to touch will be used as
      second modality.

      Primary outcome is the time to loss of sensation to cold at T4 bilaterally as assessed with
      ethyl-chloride spray. Secondary outcomes will include motor block, haemodynamic stability,
      and use of vasopressors, shivering, sweating, nausea, pruritus, body temperature,
      intra-operative supplementation, and Apgar scores.
