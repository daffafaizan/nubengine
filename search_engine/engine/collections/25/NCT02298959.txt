      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dosing for the combination
      of ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with unresectable stage III or
      stage IV melanoma, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival at 6 months. II. To obtain
      preliminary estimates of the rate of 1-year overall survival. III. To obtain preliminary
      estimates of the response rate. IV. To obtain preliminary estimates of time to progression.
      V. To perform correlative sciences that provide information regarding the mechanisms of
      action for this combination treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose expansion study of ziv-aflibercept.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and
      ziv-aflibercept IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 12 weeks.
