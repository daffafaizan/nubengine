      with CF without CFRD. This will be achieved by a randomized double blind controlled trial of
      Saxagliptin 5 mg vs. placebo which will be performed for 3 months in 60 patients with CF
      without CFRD. The study will be for 3 months of use and will consist of two arms:

        1. Saxagliptin 5mg

        2. Placebo. the primary outcome of this study will be the oral disposition index oDI ,
           derived from the OGTT. The oDI has been shown across age groups and metabolic phenotypes
           to be an excellent predictor of diabetes development over time . We postulate that
           Saxagliptin will increase incretin concentrations and thus improve insulin secretion.
           This will manifest as an increased oral disposition index (oDI), reflecting an improved
           beta cell response in the context of prevailing insulin sensitivity. The oDI is a useful
           predictor of diabetes development over time and its increase will provide evidence for
           protection from diabetes in this special study population
