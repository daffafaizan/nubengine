      adults will be randomized to receive either 3 dosis of intralesional bevacizumab, cidofovir
      or saline solution. Primary endpoints are the assessment of changes in the annual surgery
      rate and Derkay papilloma severity grading scale; secondary endpoints are changes in the
      Voice Handicap Index and safety.
