      lung segments during a first bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL
      will be collected in these challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for in-vitro
      experimentation. In addition, bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to
      assess the degree of local inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of
      airway epithelium following allergen challenge.
