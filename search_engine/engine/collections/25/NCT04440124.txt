      when looking to assess an individual's fitness for surgery. One such field test is the
      incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). An externally paced, maximal excursion test, the ISWT
      is a simple and easily reproducible test that is widely used within cardiac and pulmonary
      populations and shown to correlate well with Vo2 mas on a cardiopulmonary exercise test.
      Previous studies looking at the benefit of the ISWT in predicting post-operative outcomes
      within the oesophagastric population have demonstrated that walking less than 350 meters has
      been associated with significantly higher rates of mortality at 30 days and 3 years. No
      correlation between ISWT and postoperative respiratory complications in this surgical
      population has been previously reported.

      This study aims to assess whether walking <350 meters on an ISWT predicts the development of
      hospital acquired pneumonias following an elective oesophagectomy
