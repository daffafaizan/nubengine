      intervention and control group. The data was collected during March 1st to May 20th, 2019
      from three postpartum wards. The mothers were recruited by midwives on the wards after
      childbirth. The baseline sample size was 250 mothers, which is based on a conducted power
      analysis. The sample size calculation was based on previous study, from which the standard
      deviation (0.81) for change in parental satisfaction was calculated. Baseline data were
      collected before randomization in the hospital. Follow-up data were collected six to eight
      weeks postpartum at home.

      The instruments to assess the study outcomes were the parenting self-efficacy (PSE) scale
      developed and validated by Salonen et al. and parenting satisfaction (PS) scale, the
      evaluation subscale of the questionnaire "What Being the Parent of a New Baby is Like" by
      Pridham & Chang, 1989.

      Data were analyzed with SPSS statistical software for Windows, release 25. Descriptive
      statistics included frequencies, percentages, means and medians. Total scores for the PSE
      instrument and WBPL-R evaluation subscale (PS) were calculated by summing the scores for all
      items and dividing the sum by the number of items. Higher scores indicated better outcomes.
      Comparisons between groups were made of mother characteristics, PSE and PS. Due to skewed
      distributions, non-parametric tests were used. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for two group
      comparisons, and Kruskal Wallis tests were used for three or more group comparisons.

      Results have not yet been reported.
