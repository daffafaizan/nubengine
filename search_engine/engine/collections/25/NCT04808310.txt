    
      The study is a single-center, randomized superiority trial to compare two strategies for the
      assessment of the hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions.

      The primary analysis will be on the per-protocol principle (i.e. including all patients who
      are not protocol violators). A separate analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat
      basis (i.e. all randomized patients randomized to a treatment arm).

        -  SAQ Treatment Satisfaction Disease perception scale Follow-up (3 and 12 months) -
           Patient-oriented composite endpoint (death, myocardial infarction, unplanned
           revascularization) and its components.
