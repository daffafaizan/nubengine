      Europe. The decision whether to admit or discharge the patient is challenging and is often
      based on clinical signs and symptoms e.g. blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen
      saturation and temperature. But some patients are unnecessarily admitted and may have been
      better off if sent home. Other patients may be discharged without - and one out of five
      patients are readmitted within a month raising the question whether the patient should have
      been admitted at first presentation in the ED. suPAR is a strong prognostic biomarker
      measured routinely in acute medical patients in some emergency department (ED) settings.suPAR
      is a broadly applicable biomarker of risk, and it has been developed an algorithm for simple
      interpretation of suPAR in clinical decisions for the study.

      Objective To evaluate the use of a clinical decision algorithm in the ED with the aim of
      improving discharge or admission decisions.
