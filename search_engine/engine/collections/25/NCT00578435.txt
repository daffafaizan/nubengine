    
      The trial proposed is a single armed phase II treatment protocol designed to examine the
      engraftment,toxicity and graft-versus-host disease following a novel cytoreductive regimen
      including cyclophosphamide and Busulfan for the treatment of patients with Severe Sickle Cell
      Anemia,Thalassemia, and Diamond Blackfan Anemia using stem cell transplants derived from
      HLA-genotypically identical siblings.

      Patients will be conditioned for transplantation with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day x 4
      days), and busulfan [(if < 4 years of age 1 mg/kg 4 times per day x 4 days), (if > 4 years of
      age 0.8 mg/kg 4 times per day x 4 days)]. Patients will receive Methotrexate & Cyclosporin-A
      for prophylaxis against GvHD and GCSF to promote engraftment.

      The preferred source of stem cells from related HLA-matched related donors will be unmodified
      bone marrow stem cells.
