           scan.

        -  A patient with a baseline positive scan will have serum drawn for baseline serum
           proteomics assessment then be treated with RAD001 daily for two weeks. On day 10-14,
           another FDG-PET scan and serum assessment will be performed. An optional bone marrow
           biopsy may also be done. On day 15, patients will enter the Phase I portion of the trial
           at the current enrolling dosage or if Phase I is completed patients will enter Phase II.

        -  A patient that does not have a positive scan will enter directly into the Phase I trial
           or Phase II depending on which trial is currently enrolling.

        -  Phase I trial patients will have weekly laboratory evaluations and clinical evaluation
           every three weeks.

        -  Phase II trial patients will have laboratory evaluations on day one and day eight and
           clinical evaluation every three weeks.
