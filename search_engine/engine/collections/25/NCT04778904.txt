    
      This is a multi-centre study conducted in 64 participants, who will each be administered 2
      vaccine injections (IM) on Day 0 and Day 28 as follows:

      Group 1: MVA-HBV + MVA-HBV Group 2: ChAdOx1-HBV + MVA-HBV Group 3: ChAdOx1-HBV + MVA-HBV +
      nivolumab (IV infusion) Group 4: ChAdOx1-HBV + nivolumab + MVA-HBV + nivolumab

      Participants are randomised to treatment as the groups are initiated with a 1:1:1:1
      allocation. A sentinel participant is dosed in Group 1, with further participants in Group 1
      only being dosed at least 48h later. Group 2 is initiated following a Day 7 safety assessment
      of the first 6 participants in Group 1. Groups 3 and 4 are initiated following a Day 7 safety
      assessment of the first 6 participants in Group 2.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the
      treatment regimens; this will be assessed by analysis of the incidence and severity of
      (serious) adverse events and any changes in laboratory values and vital signs.

      The secondary objectives of the study are the determination of the immunogenicity of the
      ChAdOx1-HBV and MVA-HBV vaccines and the impact of PD-blockade, as well as the effect on HBV
      markers; these are assessed by measurements of the magnitude and avidity of HBV-specific CD4+
      and CD8+ T cells and the magnitude of HBV markers.

      Following first vaccination, participants remain in the study for 9 months and attend clinic
      visits for vaccination and assessments on Days 0, 7, 28, 35 and Months, 3, 6 and 9.
