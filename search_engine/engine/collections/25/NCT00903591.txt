      and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. For simplicity, in this protocol, we will refer to
      that study as the "parent" study. The goal of both studies is to examine the interaction of
      radiation exposure and genetic susceptibility factors in the etiology of breast cancer. A
      subset of study participants who consented to 'future contact' in the GWA Study (and those in
      the 'parent' study from selected sites) will be included in an analysis of radiation-related
      heart disease and related conditions.
