      achieved via peripheral or central catheters. Each device is associated with both mechanical
      and infectious complications. Complications associated with central lines are judged to be
      more severe. Some patients actually require the insertion of a central line due to the venous
      toxicity of the drugs or to the necessity of making sure that the infusion is regularly
      administered (example: high dose catecholamine infusion). Some physicians believe that most
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients should have a central venous line inserted, whereas others
      feel that some patients may receive active drugs via a peripheral line in selected instances.
      No study prospectively compared the feasibility, merits and complications of the two
      possibilities (i.e., central or peripheral venous line). This study includes patients that
      can receive either a central or a peripheral line (see inclusion criteria): mainly patients
      receiving large amounts of fluid, moderate doses of catecholamines or of drugs that may cause
      venous injury. Patients are randomized to receive either a peripheral or a central venous
      catheter. Endpoints are the rate of mechanical complications (difficulty in inserting the
      line, need for repeat insertion attempts, occurrence of arterial puncture, occurrence of
      pneumothorax) and of infectious complications (local catheter infection or catheter-related
      bloodstream infection).
