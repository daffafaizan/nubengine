      treatment. This lack of knowledge is a major limitation to the improvement, indispensable, of
      the care of the patients. In clinical routine, particularly in West Indies-Guyana, cardiac
      amyloidosis is a disease poorly identified, whose management remains to be optimized.
      Concordant observations suggest that the frequency of the disease could be significant in the
      Antilles-Guyana: aging of the population, high frequency of an amyloidogenic mutation
      (Val122Il mutation of the transthyretin gene) found in 4% of the Afro-American population,
      recent identification in Martinique by a neurology team of a new founding mutation of the
      transthyretin gene that may cause the disease.

      These elements justified the setting up of a multidisciplinary group whose objective is to
      contribute to the improvement of screening, treatment, and follow-up of patients with cardiac
      amyloidosis.

      An identical diagnostic algorithm will be followed in all centers. Therapeutic management
      will be left to the discretion of the health care teams, who will be communicated regularly,
      the latest management recommendations.

      A frequency of 30% is expected and will be assessed with a power of 80% and an alpha risk of
      0.05. Quantitative and qualitative data will be described as usual. Differences between
      groups will be assessed with parametric or non-parametric tests.
