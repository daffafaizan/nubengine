      lower limbs. Current strategies for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy include
      improved glycemic control, use of analgesics and addition of tricyclic antidepressants and
      anticonvulsants. However, many patients experience unsatisfactory responses and some
      undesired side effects. Considerable evidence implicates impaired nitric oxide synthesis
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathic pain. Several small
      studies have shown that topical nitroglycerin ointment has local vasodilating properties, and
      a previous study has demonstrated that isosorbide dinitrate in spray form as a nitric oxide
      donor relieved some neuropathic symptoms in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Based
      on the findings, the investigators hypothesize that nitric oxide gel could be used as an
      alternative pain-relieving agent for patients with resistant diabetic neuropathic pain.
