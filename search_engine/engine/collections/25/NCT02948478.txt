    
      All patients seeking treatment for breast cancer, regardless of the stage, can be included in
      the study. Three scores of precariousness will be applied to all patients (EPICES score,
      Pascal score and the European Deprivation Index). Patients identified as precarious by at
      least one of those three scales will be in the exposed group. The others will be in the
      non-exposed group.

      Baseline assessment T0:

      Are required only the clinical examination and radiological evaluation with the tumor size
      and node involvement according to TNM classification. A questionnaire will be distributed
      including EPICES score, Pascal score and European Deprivation Index. The baseline
      questionnaire will also assess the socio-economic characteristics of patients and the care
      trajectory before arriving in the center (see appendix).

      Follow-up visits:

      The following questionnaire will be distributed during a consultation that is scheduled in
      the routine care. There will be no additional consultation imposed on the patient.

        -  T1: questionnaire at 3 months after inclusion

        -  T2: questionnaire at 6 months after inclusion

        -  T3: questionnaire at 12 months after inclusion

      Questionnaires will be focused on direct-costs and out-of-pocket costs, socio-economical
      characteristics, rehabilitation, return to work.
