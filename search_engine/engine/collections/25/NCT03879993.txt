      composition and biochemical parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress in people living
      with HIV/AIDS. The sample was composed by patients with HIV/AIDS of both sexes. The patients
      were randomized in two groups, a exercise group (EG), which was receive intervention with
      eight weeks of resistance training, and a control group (CG), that was not to do exercise.
      The cognitive function was analyzed with Stroop Test and Trail Test; body composition was
      evaluated by bioimpedance; blood tests was use to analyze biochemical parameters of
      inflammation and oxidative stress. For statistical analysis was used ANOVA of two factors for
      repeated measurements, having the (EG and PG) group and the time (pre and post exercise).
      Level of significance adopted was P < 0,05.
