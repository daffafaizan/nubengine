      naive patients with mild to moderately severe UC will be recruited (n=15). The patients will
      be randomized into 3 groups; i.e group I (n=5): FMT with placebo, group II (n=5): FMT with
      mesalamine, group III (n=5): Placebo infusion with mesalamine. The patients will undergo
      colonoscopic administration of fecal slurry (groups I and II) or placebo (group III) at weeks
      0,2,6,10 and 14. Mesalamine will be administered in a dose of 4g/day. In case of clinical
      worsening during the study, a short course of steroids will be added. The primary end point
      will be clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2, all subscores ≤ 1) at week 14. Secondary end
      points will be achievement of endoscopic remission (endoscopic Mayo score 0) and histological
      remission (Nancy grade 0, 1) at the end of 14 weeks.
