      Disorder 7-item scale, at admission and discharge. The first experiment compared scores of
      those who received mindfulness training plus standard psychiatric treatment (treatment as
      usual: TAU) against those who received TAU. The second experiment compared age using matched
      scores from participants who received mindfulness training plus TAU. Participants attended
      group therapy for a five-week minimum, and were taught the mindfulness practices of breath,
      acceptance, observation, remaining non-judgmental, and letting go.
