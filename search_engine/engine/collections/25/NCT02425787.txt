    
      Participants who consent will engage with the principal investigator in a one-time
      voice-recorded interview consisting of demographic and open-ended questions. Participants can
      choose to conduct the interview face-to-face or over-the-phone. Completion of the interview
      is expected to take between 30-90 minutes. Validation focus groups are expected to take
      between 30-90 minutes, as well. For the legacy-building cohort, the Child Life Department
      will provide additional information to specify which bereaved families received legacy items,
      and parents will be recruited to participate in an interview centered on the legacy item
      questions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      To conduct qualitative interviews in order to understand what helps and what hinders
      bereavement processes among St. Jude parents, with particular attention to how relationships
      with St. Jude professional care staff affect parental bereavement processes.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

      To qualitatively explore the unique bereavement experiences and challenges of parents of
      children who have received bone marrow transplantation, and compare these experiences with
      those participants whose children did not receive bone marrow transplantation.

      To assess for qualitative similarities among parents with similar responses on questionnaires
      and/or to identify between-group differences on questionnaires among parents with
      qualitatively similar experiences.
