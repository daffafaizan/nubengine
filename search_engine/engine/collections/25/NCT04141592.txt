      at the same time in order to enable a comprehensive disease phenotyping and ability to
      compare immunological, microbiological and metabolic features in patients with varying stages
      of NAFLD and healthy controls. To date there are limited published data evaluating
      simultaneously-obtained samples from adipose, gut and liver tissue and peripheral blood in
      NAFLD. The majority of participants in this study will be recruited from the bariatric
      surgery services enabling multiple tissue samples to be collected at time of surgery with
      minimal additional risk to participants.
