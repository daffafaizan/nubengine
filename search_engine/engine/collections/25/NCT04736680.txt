      protect health have a maximum effect on children. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic a marked
      decrease in pediatric visits was observed in scheduled and on-call visits. This fact can be
      explained by the restriction on people's circulation necessary to contain COVID-19
      dissemination. In this context, the population that attends the Hospital General de Ni√±os
      Pedro de Elizalde was especially affected, since 91% of the patients attending the
      institution live in another district.

      In order to overcome this barrier in access to care, we decided to implement a Telehealth
      Program that uses virtual visits as a tool for access to care. Little is known about the
      effects that these programs can have on patients with exclusive public health coverage.
      Although virtual visits could be a solution for access to care in an oversaturated system,
      there is the possibility that virtual visits could not be carried out and that a significant
      proportion will be lost, increasing inequity and difficulties in access to health.

      Due to the relevance of the topic and the little information available, we propose in this
      study to estimate the proportion of virtual visits appointments lost. On the other hand,
      considering the possibility of avoiding the loss of virtual visits appointments, we propose
      to describe the factors associated with missed appointments and develop a predictive model
      that serves as the basis for improving the Telehealth Program.
