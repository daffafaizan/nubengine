      procedures that in 2 groups difference in time to achieve Ramsay sedation scale was
      0.8min.(In group dexmedetomidine 12.4 & group ketofol 13.2 with S.D of 0.8). The sample size
      came out to be 22 subjects per group at a power of 90 % & confidence interval of 95 %. For
      possible dropouts, it was decided to include 10% extra subjects so finally it was decided to
      include 25 subjects per group. (Total sample size 50 subjects)

      Normality of quantitative data will be checked by measures of Kolmogorov Smirnov tests of
      normality. If data is normally distributed Student t-test will be applied for comparison of 2
      groups. Mann-Whitney U-test will be used for statistical analysis of skewed continuous
      variables or ordered categorical data. Proportions will be compared using Chi square or
      Fisher's exact test whichever is applicable. Wilcoxon Signed rank test will be used for
      skewed data or for scores (time related variables). . For comparison (time related variables)
      of Hemodynamics Repeated Measure ANOVA will be applied. All statistical tests will be
      two-sided and will be performed at a significance level of Î±=0.05. Analysis will be conducted
      using SPSS for Windows
