    
      The Conventus CAGEâ„¢ PH (PH Cage) System Post-Approval Prospective Study (Study) is a
      multi-center, prospective, post-approval clinical study designed to collect device and
      procedure experience in everyday clinical practice.

      Specifically, the study will provide:

        1. Device safety and patient outcome data.

        2. Device usage data.

        3. Performance data for the implant procedure.

        4. Publications.

        5. Early economic benefit data.

      Patient Assessments Demographic and general health data will be collected on all patients at
      the baseline appointment to ensure subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition,
      to these data, x-rays and adverse event reports related to the implanted device, surgical
      procedure and/or study data collection methods will be collected.

      Patients will be seen at baseline, 2-, 6- and 12-week, 1- and 2-year post op.

      Patient participation in this study is voluntary. However, post-implant patient follow-up
      adds to the medical community's understanding of proximal humerus fracture patient outcomes,
      as well as the safety and performance of the PH Cage.
