      undergoing total hip replacement. The study team identified alternative pharmacologic methods
      to block pain pathways to reduce or even eliminate the need for opioids in the intra- and
      postoperative periods, with the goal of decreasing or eliminating exposure to opioids. A
      secondary objective is to assess two core competencies for interprofessional collaborative
      practice (Interprofessional Communication and Teams; and Teamwork) within the
      interprofessional care team implementing the opioid free protocol.
