    
      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the efficacy of single-agent hydroxychloroquine in patients with metastatic
           pancreatic cancer previously treated with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens as
           measured by progression-free survival at two months

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess tumor response rate, biochemical response rate (i.e. decrease in serum CA19-9
           by > 30%), and overall survival

      Translational/Exploratory Objectives

        -  To investigate predictors of response to anti-autophagy therapy with hydroxychloroquine

        -  To explore the kinetics of in vivo autophagy inhibition using peripheral blood WBCs to
           monitor autophagic activity among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine
