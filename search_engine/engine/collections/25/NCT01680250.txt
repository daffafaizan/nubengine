      stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting an estimated 0.2% of population. Of ADPKD patients, 58%
      in 15-24 year, 85% in 25-34 year, and 94% in 35-46 year olds suffer from polycystic liver in
      addition to polycystic kidneys. Several anti-proliferative drugs have been used in clinical
      trials to stop cyst growth both in liver and kidneys. Among them, octreotide and sirolimus
      have been shown to be one of the most promising drugs to reduce cyst volume. Sirolimus
      already has been used as one of the most potential oral immunosuppressants. Moreover, the
      serum trough level is quite easy to measure. Sirolimus is the mTOR inhibitor that has been
      proven to be effective in reducing cyst growth both in animal models. However, its efficacy
      and safety is not well proven in previous studies. This is a open-label, prospective study to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sirolimus to reduce cyst growth in ADPKD patients
      with massive polycystic liver.
