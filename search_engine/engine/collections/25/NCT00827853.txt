      claudication in their legs. Based on the physicians decision such patients may have to
      undergo a peripheral vascular intervention of the SFA, with placement of self-expanding
      nitinol stents. If such a decision is made, the patient will be randomized to either
      cryoplasty balloon post-dilation of the stent or to conventional angioplasty balloon
      post-dilation after obtaining informed consent. At one year, in segment (stent + 10 mm beyond
      its proximal and distal edges) peak systolic velocity by duplex ultrasound will be measured
      in all subjects to assess the rate of binary restenosis defined as a > or = 2.5 times
      increase in peak systolic velocity (primary endpoint). A 6 month resting ankle brachial
      index, and binary restenosis may be assessed as a secondary endpoint of the study.
