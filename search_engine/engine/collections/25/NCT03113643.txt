      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved azacitidine and venetoclax as a
      treatment option for AML. However, the combination of these two drugs with SL-401 has not
      been FDA approved.

      The combination of SL-401, azacitidine and venetoclax has not been FDA approved for BPDCN.
      However, SL-401 has been FDA approved for BPDCN.

      The combination of SL-401 and azacitidine has not been FDA approved for BPDCN.

      In this research study, the study drug SL-401 will be combined with the standard dose of
      azacitidine (for MDS patients) or azacitidine/venetoclax (for AML and BPDCN patients). The
      goal of this research study is to try and determine the safest, highest dose of study drug,
      SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax that can be given to
      patients with AML, BPDCN or high-risk MDS. SL-401 works by stopping or slowing the growth of
      cancer stem cells, which are the undeveloped cells which can develop into cancer cells. The
      goals of this research study are to look at if this combination works to help treat your
      cancer and if there is any lasting effect of this combination. This study will also look at
      how the SL-401, in combination with azacitidine or azacitidine/venetoclax, affects certain
      proteins in your blood and bone marrow. SL-401 has been given to patients with AML, and MDS
      in the past, but this is the first time it will be given in combination with another drug.
