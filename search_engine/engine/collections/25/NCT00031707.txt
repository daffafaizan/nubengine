        -  Compare the appetite-stimulating properties of megestrol vs an eicosapentaenoic
           acid-enriched nutritional supplement vs both, in terms of patient weight, rate of weight
           change, and appetite, in patients with cancer-related cachexia and anorexia.

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens on nausea and vomiting in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate interleukin-6 concentration changes with appetite and weight changes in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to primary cancer (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other), severity of
      weight loss in the past 2 months (less than 10 pounds vs 10 pounds or more), planned
      concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), age (under 50 vs 50 and over), and prognosis (good vs
      bad vs unsure). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.
