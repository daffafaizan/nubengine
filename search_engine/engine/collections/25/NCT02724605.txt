    
      -  A pretransfusion draw of a few drops of patient venous blood, send for analysis by
           i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser. Samples are processed immediately and provide
           laboratory quality results in 2 minutes using the CHEM 8+ i-STAT cartridge for
           measurement of:

             1. Potassium (K)

             2. Ionized Calcium (iCa)

             3. Glucose (Glu)

             4. Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Urea

             5. Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).

        -  Concurrently, a few drops of blood will be taken from the unit to be transfused will be
           analysed by i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser for measurement of previous biochemical
           parameters.

        -  The details of the unit, such as draw date, volume of transfusion, and date of
           transfusion, will be recorded. The RBC unit will be delivered to the operative room from
           the blood bank in an insulated box.

        -  The transfusion is then given as clinically indicated at a rate of 50 to 150 mL/h based
           on the clinician's orders, the patient's weight, and the patient's clinical situation.

        -  Volumes will be transfused to children according to the following top-up transfusion
           equation: desired Hemoglobin (Hb) (g/dl) - actual Hemoglobin (Hb) (g/dl) x weight (kg) x
           3. (usually 10-20 ml/kg).

        -  A second patient blood sample will be drawn one hour after the transfusion and will be
           analyzed by i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyser.

        -  Patient information will be recorded for age, weight, sex, and primary diagnosis.

        -  Demographic and clinical variables will be collected, to include type and quantity of
           all blood products and fluids received and medications administered. All surgical
           procedures will be documented.
