      for the current study includes all four sub- studies, and each of the other three sub-
      studies will be registered ongoing individually. The current study is a prospective national
      survey of body mass index (BMI), and includes all patients with a new spinal cord injury
      hospitalized at Clinic for Spinal Cord Injuries, Rigshospitalet (CSCI) and Spinal Cord Injury
      Center of Western Denmark during a period of 9 months whereby 100 patients are expected to
      participate. Data are collected at admission and discharge. At CSCI BMI is collected every 6
      weeks and all outcome measures will also be collected at follow up 6 months after discharge.
      A VO2peak test at discharge is performed as well, and in some participants accelerometry is
      performed in order to describe the amount and intensity of physical activity. Test- retest
      reliability of the VO2peak test and accelerometry is investigated as well. Patients with a
      new Spinal Cord Injury within the last 12 months, who are admitted for rehabilitation several
      months after the time of injury are also included in the prospective survey. Therefore the
      data for BMI at the time of injury is collected for all patients at admission to primary
      rehabilitation from both the patient journal and also by asking the patient about weight and
      height at the time of injury
