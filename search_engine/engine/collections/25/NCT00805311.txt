      significant carotid atherosclerosis. For asymptomatic patients, AHA guidelines recommend
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for stenosis 60% to 99%, if the risk of perioperative stroke or
      death is less than 3%.

      Although clinical trial data support CEA in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis 60%
      to 79%, the AHA guidelines indicate that some physicians delay revascularization until there
      is greater than 80% stenosis in asymptomatic patients.

      Our study is designed to determine whether optimal medical therapy alone reduces the risk of
      death and nonfatal stroke in patients with carotid artery stenosis as compared with CEA
      coupled with optimal medical therapy.
