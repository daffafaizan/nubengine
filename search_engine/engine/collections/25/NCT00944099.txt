      related to lower weight, body mass index (BMI)and body fatness. It is proposed that eating
      frequently during the day reduces overall energy consumed by preventing the development of
      excessive hunger. As elevated hunger increases the reinforcing value of food, and greater
      intake occurs when the reinforcing value of food increases, eating frequently during the day
      may be a dietary strategy that can aid with reducing energy intake and improving weight loss
      during a behavioral weight control program. Therefore, the purpose of this proposed research
      is to test the effect of manipulating eating frequency on hunger and the reinforcing value of
      food in 50 overweight/obese adults participating in a 6-month behavioral weight loss
      intervention. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) a condition in which
      participants will be given an eating frequency prescription to eat every 2 to 3 hours
      (Grazing); or 2) a condition in which participants will be given an eating frequency
      prescription of eating 3 meals per day (Three Meals). Both conditions will receive an
      identical dietary prescription, a low-calorie (1200 to 1500 kcals/d), low-fat (â‰¤ 30% kcals
      from fat) diet and an identical physical activity goal of 200 minutes of moderate-intense
      physical activity per week. Additionally, both conditions will receive an identical
      state-of-the-art, 6-month, behavioral weight loss program.
