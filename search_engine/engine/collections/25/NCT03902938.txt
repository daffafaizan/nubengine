      biologic sensitivity or cultural objection to use of porcine materials will be excluded.

      Data will be derived from the medical record and surgeon reports as detailed on pre-op and
      follow-up forms. Variables collected include age, gender, medical co-morbidities, body mass
      index, pre-operative audiometric values (including word recognition score, pure tone average,
      and air bone gap), side of surgery, size of operative cavity, infectious state (draining
      versus dry), exact surgical procedure, presence of cholesteatoma, time to dry cavity, time to
      complete epithelialization (as observed directly by the surgeon), and post-operative
      complications (such as persistent perforation, drainage, granulation tissue formation, and
      facial nerve outcomes). Dates and patient number will be recorded. Patients will be randomly
      assigned using randomization software, whereby patients will be assigned a sequential
      research number that is pre-randomized to one research arm. The study cannot be blinded, as
      the surgeon will be able to identify which graft will be used. De-identified photographs of
      the post-operative outcomes at each time point will be recorded photographically. Three
      physicians will review these photographs without prior knowledge of the treatment arm.
