    
      This is a phase II, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Lenalidomide, Ixazomib, Dexamethasone, and Daratumumab in patients with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      The patient population will consist of adult men and women â‰¤ 65 years, who have a confirmed
      diagnosis of standard risk multiple myeloma, who meet eligibility criteria.

      Treatment periods will be defined as 21-day cycles for induction, and 28-day cycles for
      consolidation, and maintenance. Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle intervals
      while they are participating in the study.

      Patients will be assessed for disease response and progression according to the International
      Myeloma Working Group criteria at each cycle during induction and consolidation and every
      other cycle during maintenance.

      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, adverse events, laboratory values, and
      vital sign measurements will be collected and assessed to evaluate the safety of therapy
      throughout the study.

      Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events. Patients will attend an End of Treatment visit after receiving their last
      dose of study drug and will continue to be followed for other follow-up assessments specified
      in the Schedule of events.

      All patients will be followed for survival after progression.
