      young adults.

      Its impact on cerebral vascularization is well known. At the systemic level, it induces
      transient dysfunctions that can develop into severe failures, even in cases of isolated SBI.
      Studies on a mouse model of SBI show alterations in peripheral vascular reactivity that
      persist over time and are linked to endothelial dysfunction, the mechanism of which is a
      decoupling of endothelial NO synthase in a context of systemic inflammation. However, no data
      are available regarding the peripheral vascular consequences of SBI in humans.

      The main objective of this prospective, monocentric, pathophysiological study is to determine
      whether the postocclusive hyperaemic response at the anterior surface of the contralateral
      forearm to the most injured cerebral hemisphere differs between patients with severe brain
      injury and patients with severe trauma without associated head injury matched on sex and age
      (+/- 5 years), by studying the amplitude of post-occlusive hyperaemia (maximum amplitude
      expressed as percentage of vasodilatation and area under the curve : AUC) as a function of
      the group.
