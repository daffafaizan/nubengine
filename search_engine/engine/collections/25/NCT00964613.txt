      sophisticated technology ans specific environment which is not possible in underdeveloped
      countries. we describe a method in which posterior capsular opacification could be managed by
      using only a 27 Gauge needle through pars plana. opacified posterior capsule is under tension
      that is why a small puncture results in a large central opening
