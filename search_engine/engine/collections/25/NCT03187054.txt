      non-inferiority of the primary outcome between POPQ-based surgery and simulated apical
      support-based surgery for anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Participants will
      undergo transvaginal surgery for prolapse, including the assigned procedure for anterior or
      posterior vaginal prolapse under general or spinal anesthesia. Concomitant procedures will be
      performed as intended prior to surgery. Women with a uterus in situ will undergo hysterectomy
      and all women will receive transvaginal vault suspension, including uterosacral ligament
      suspension, sacrospinous ligament fixation, and iliococcygeal suspension with both delayed
      absorbable and permanent sutures, according to the preference of surgeon. Incontinence
      surgery will also be performed for women with documented urodynamic stress incontinence.

      A standardized protocol for enrollment, treatment and data collection will be employed by all
      sites. The study will be a single-blind study, as it is impossible to blind the study surgeon
      for the surgical procedure to which the subject in assigned. However, it is our intent that
      when feasible and ethical, all outcomes assessors and the subjects will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment. Postoperative follow-up will take place after 5 weeks and 6, 12, and 24
      months. Patients will undergo a standard gynecological examination including POPQ and fill in
      questionnaires.
