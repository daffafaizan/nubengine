      symptom monitoring and inform future randomized clinical trials and implementation. Patients
      will be screened at oncology visits for inclusion criteria and will be invited to use a
      mobile app to monitor and track treatment side-effects.

      We will recruit a minimum of 10 cancer patients under systemic anti-neoplasic treatment being
      followed in medical oncology departments in portuguese hospitals. between February 1st and
      March 30th.

      Participants will be invited to register their treatment side effects and symptoms on a
      health app designed for this purpose.

      The Mentora Health App include a PRO-CTCAEâ„¢ based tool (a patient-reported outcome
      measurement system developed by the National Cancer Institute), version 1.1, that includes 80
      symptoms (attachment 1) and has been translated and validated to Portuguese (Portugal) by the
      authoring entity. These symptoms are graded on a five-point scale from 0 (not present) to 4
      (disabling) based on clinical criteria.
