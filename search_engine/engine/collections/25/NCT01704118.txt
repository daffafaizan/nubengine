    
      Routine monitorization will be performed. Lidocaine 1 mg.kg-1, remifentanil 1 mcg.kg-1 (slow
      bolus in approximately 1 minute) and 3 mg.kg-1 propofol will be administered in anaesthesia
      induction.

      In Group P, PLMA with fully deflated cuff and applied water-based lubricant, will be inserted
      using a metal introducer. After insertion, cuff will be inflated with a recommended volume of
      air and then cuff pressure will be adjusted to 60 cm H2O with manometer.

      In Group I, I-gel with its cuff lubricated will be orally inserted along the hard palate
      until resistance will be felt, as recommended by the manufacturer.

      The time between picking up the prepared PLMA (with introducer and deflated cuff) or I-gel
      and the appearance of the first stable capnographic trace will be recorded as the insertion
      time. The conditions for insertion will be ere scored according to mouth (1: full, 2:
      partial, 3: nil), gagging or coughing (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), swallowing (1: nil, 2:
      slight, 3: gross), head or limb movement (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), laryngospasm (1: nil,
      2: slight, 3: complete) and ease of insertion (1: easy, 2: difficult, 3: impossible).

      Fresh gas flow will be adjusted to 3 L.min-1, and after closing the expiratory valve the
      airway pressure at which an audible leak in the mouth occurred will recorded as the 'Pleak'.
      When Pleak reach 35 cm H2O, expiratory valve will be opened.

      Anatomical position of airway device will viewed by inserting fiberoptic bronchoscope through
      the ventilation tube.

      Complications encountered during and at the end of the operation such as desaturation (sPO2
      less than 90%), gastric insufflation, aspiration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm and blood stain
      on the airway device during removal will be recorded.
