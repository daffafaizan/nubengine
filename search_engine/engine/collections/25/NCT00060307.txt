      I. To assess response (confirmed complete and partial response) of patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic papillary histology renal cell cancer treated with OSI-774.

      II. To assess the overall survival and 6-month probability of treatment failure of this group
      of patients.

      III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To
      investigate in a preliminary manner the association of tumor response with tumor expression
      of epidermal growth factor receptor and status of von Hippel Lindau gene mutation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-20
      months.
