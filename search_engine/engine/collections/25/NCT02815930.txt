    
      Senior high cost users (HCUs) with annual healthcare expenditures within the top 5% of
      Ontarians will be identified using established ICES costing algorithms. This cohort will be
      matched to a cohort of non-HCUs using a 3:1 matching ratio (non-HCU to HCU) based on age at
      cohort entry (+/- 1 month), sex and geographic location of residence (based on LHIN) for
      comparative analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the study populations
      and outcomes. Regression analyses will be used to adjust for potential confounders when
      analyzing healthcare resource utilization and costs as a function of HCU status (e.g. income,
      type of residence, co-morbidities, rural/urban) and/or when analyzing sub-populations [e.g.
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF)]. Logistic
      regression will be performed using the patient level data to predict the impact of individual
      factors on the likelihood of becoming a senior HCU.
