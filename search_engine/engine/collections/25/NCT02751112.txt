      hematologic diseases, malignant or not, particularly leukemias.

      The acute Graft versus Host (aGvH) reaction is the most frequent complication, and could
      concern until 50% of recipients. It is mainly linked to immune characteristics of the donor
      which will act versus the graft recipient.

      There is a huge need of a technology that could predict the risk of aGvH, especially in order
      to select a donor in case of several possibilities, in order to reduce morbidity and
      mortality of graft.

      The Predictor' kit allows to predict acute and severe forms of Graft versus Host disease
      before the graft of peripheral hematological stem cells, by the assesment of iNKT cells
      expansion.
