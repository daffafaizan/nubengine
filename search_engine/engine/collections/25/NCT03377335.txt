      dapagliflozin+metformin vs. metformin alone for a period of 6 months in patients with T2DM.

      The research hypothesis is to assess whether dapagliflozin can improve cardio-metabolic
      outcome, reducing subclinical atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and different
      cardio-metabolic markers (including inflammatory markers, cytokines, oxidative stress and
      atherogenic lipoproteins) in patients with T2DM.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of dapagliflozin on subclinical
      atherosclerosis, as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT).

      Primary endpoint: Reduction in cIMT.

      The secondary objective is to assess the effects of dapagliflozin on glycemic parameters
      (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c), endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, atherogenic
      lipoproteins, inflammatory markers, cytokines and microRNAs (miR-130a, miR-27b, miR-29b and
      miR-210).

      Secondary endpoint: Reduction in glycemic parameters, atherogenic lipoproteins, inflammatory
      markers, oxidative stress and improvements in endothelial function, cytokines and microRNAs
      (miR-130a, miR-27b, miR-29b and miR-210).

      The full data for clinical and biochemical analyses will be collected in the same fashion at
      baseline and after 6 months of therapy.

      Control visits by the telephone calls will be made every 2 months. However, in case of need,
      unplanned visits will be scheduled. Unscheduled visits will be performed in case of
      discontinuation, withdrawal, rescue treatment (including adverse event, episodes of
      hypoglycemia) or at any time during the study in case of patient's need.
