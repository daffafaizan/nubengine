      during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. RVP results in an adequate fall of blood
      pressure which presents as an on-off phenomenon. The technique facilitates the dissection and
      manipulation of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and can be
      lifesaving in the case of an intraoperative bleeding or rupture. In a former study blood
      pressure and clinical outcome were used as study parameters. However it is not clear whether
      repetitive periods of pacing are harmless for the patient. Silent cardiac and cerebral
      infarcts may be undetected if only clinical outcome is taken as a study parameter. In this
      retrograde study, the investigators will study the safety of RVP, particularly for the heart
      and the brain, using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography and troponin levels.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repetitive periods of RVP on the
      oxygenation of the heart and brain using magnetic resonance imaging and troponin levels both
      markers for ischemia damage.
