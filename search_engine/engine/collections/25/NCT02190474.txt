    
      The primary objective is to test the feasibility, safety, tolerability and acceptability of a
      mindfulness meditation intervention for adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia/chronic
      widespread pain.

      The purpose of the program is to test how effective an 8-week meditation and stress reduction
      class is in helping adolescents with chronic symptoms (including but not limited to
      fibromyalgia or chronic widespread pain, irritable bowel syndrome, joint pain, chronic
      fatigue, and others).

      Participants will attend group sessions led by an instructor experienced in MBSR in an
      academic setting. The mindfulness meditation group sessions will take place at the Yale
      School of Medicine.

      Participants will attend 90-minute weekly group sessions and a 4-hour retreat with
      approximately 6-8 other study participants at Yale School of Medicine. Participants are asked
      to practice at home by listening to pre-recorded 15-20 minute guided meditations.
