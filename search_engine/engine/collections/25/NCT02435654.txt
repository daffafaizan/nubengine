      third most disabling condition worldwide in youth, and may lead to obvious social dysfunction
      and interfere seriously with neurodevelopmental processes in a young person, which in turn
      has the potential to irreversibly alter the trajectory of his or her life. To improve the
      outcome of the patients of EOS, elaborate and individualized therapeutic regimen is urgently
      needed. The functional gene polymorphisms and drug (antipsychotics) plasma concentration can
      both influence the drug response, but few studies explore the contributions of genetic
      heterogeneity, drug plasma concentration and clinical features of patients to drug response
      together and interactions of above factors in EOS patients. In this study investigators will
      recruit 100 DSM-Ⅴdefined EOS Han patients, older than 7 years old and onset of illness before
      17 years old, and all EOS patients will receive a 8-week systematic olanzepine titration
      treatment and a battery of assessments of treatment effect and safety. Blood olanzepine
      plasma concentration will be tested regularly and genotyping of 8 polymorphisms of 5-HTR2A,
      DRD2 and COMT genes will be conducted by Polymerase Chain Reaction （PCR）, Restriction
      Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and TaqMan probes genotyping technology. The aim of the
      study is to explore the predictive factors on olanzepine treatment response in EOS, which can
      guide the individualized treatment and improve the cure rate of EOS in clinical setting.
