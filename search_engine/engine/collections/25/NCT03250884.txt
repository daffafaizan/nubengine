      diagnostic test. The gold standard used is the diagnostic test based on determination of the
      β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration. But this assay need time and expect women to
      wait for hours. A 5-minutes pregnancy diagnostic test has been developed in France. A
      62-patients study showed that results obtained with the rapid test were correlated with
      results obtained with the test based on determination of the β-human chorionic gonadotropin
      concentration.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the 5-minutes pregnancy diagnostic
      test realized in emergency room, in comparison with the blood determination of the β-human
      chorionic gonadotropin concentration which is only tested in medical laboratory. A little
      amount of total blood sample used for gold standard test will be used to assess sensibility,
      specificity, positive or negative predictive values of the rapid pregnancy diagnostic test.
