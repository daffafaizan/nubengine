      Bispectral Index (BIS) and M-Entropy are examples to these devices, both of which are
      available at our institution. Both BIS and M-Entropy use a unilateral, single channel of EEG
      to derive a number indicating the anesthetic depth. These devices have similar disposable
      skin probes that can be applied on either side of the forehead. Since the depth of anesthesia
      for an individual is the same over the whole brain cortex at a given point in time, BIS
      numbers obtained over the left and right side of the forehead should agree. The same should
      be true for M-Entropy as well.

      A recent study, however, showed that two separate BIS probes, applied over the left and right
      forehead of the same patient at the same time, can give significantly different numbers. This
      has not been studied for M-Entropy. BIS and M-Entropy use different mathematical algorithms
      that process the raw EEG signal to compute a numeric value. Therefore, it is possible that
      M-Entropy may show different results in a similar study setup.

      The aim is to investigate the same-patient reproducibility of M-Entropy by monitoring and
      recording Entropy variables over both the left and the right side of the forehead of patients
      under general anesthesia.
