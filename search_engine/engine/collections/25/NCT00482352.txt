      I. Provide a classification guide that will organize the clinical and laboratory data
      necessary for assigning each patient with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      to a specific treatment clinical trial.

      II. Provide an administrative base to capture classification data for correlative studies
      accompanying current Children's Oncology Group (COG) ALL treatment clinical trials.

      III. Provide a central reference guide for all required and research only ALL studies that
      will be conducted at local and reference laboratories.

      IV. Provide a mechanism for optional banking of leukemia and germline specimens for current
      and future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood collection and bone marrow biopsies at baseline and at the end of
      induction therapy for immunophenotyping for marker identification; molecular testing for
      translocations; trisomy analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); and DNA
      ploidy. Immunophenotype results obtained on this study are used to determine the patient's
      assignment to specific treatment clinical trials (consistent with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia).

      After completion of induction therapy, patients are followed once or twice annually.
