    
      The present study will be conducted in two parts in healthy male volunteers. Part 1 will
      investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single doses of firategrast administered
      as the existing immediate release tablet formulation, as a modified release tablet (3hr)
      formulation and as a simulated gastro-retentive formulation to be administered via a
      naso-gastric tube. Subjects will receive each formulation in a randomised 3-way single dose
      crossover fashion.

      Part 2, based on the review of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data from the first
      two study treatment periods of Part 1, will investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability
      of multiple doses of firategrast administered as the existing immediate release tablet
      formulation, as a modified release tablet (3hr) formulation and as simulated gastro-retentive
      formulation to be administered via naso-gastric tube for a period of 7 days.
