    
      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial assessing the effects
      of one-time oral FMT on the composition and function of the gut microbiome compared to
      placebo in a population of patients with baseline CRE or VRE gut colonization. Participants
      will be adults who have had two consecutive positive stool cultures for VRE or CRE and meet
      all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients (N=90) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio.
      Randomization will be double-blinded. Each subject will be followed for 6 months. Stool
      samples will be taken at baseline and from subjects weekly for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks
      for 8 weeks, then at 6 months regardless of treatment group. All patients will be asked to
      complete a stool diary
