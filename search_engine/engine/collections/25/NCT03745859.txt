      simple guiding system for bronchoscopy. The system provides 3D maps with centerline-to-target
      information extracted from preoperative computed tomography. The ability of the system to
      guide a user to a peripheral target lesion will be evaluated. During bronchoscopy any
      established method for diagnostic sampling is allowed. User Evaluation will be essential to
      decide if the Fraxinus VBN System is beneficial in a clinical setting.
