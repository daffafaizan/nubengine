      which usually detects and kills potential tumor cells. Once cancer has developed the ability
      to evade the immune system it can continue to grow and become a tumor. One potential strategy
      currently being researched, called immunotherapy, uses viruses to stimulate an immune
      response which attacks the tumor.

      Imvamune is a live, non-replicating virus used in Canada to vaccinate adults and children
      against smallpox. It is safe to use in immunosuppressed patients because the virus is unable
      to replicate and spread past the first infected cell. This makes the Imvamune vaccine a
      viable candidate for immunotherapy in immunosuppressed patients who are at a much higher (up
      to 60x) risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers.
