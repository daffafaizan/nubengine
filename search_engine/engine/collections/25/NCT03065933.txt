      mania. It is generally well-tolerated and does not result in the severe adverse effects that
      are associated with many antipsychotics and mood stabilizers used in the treatment of mania,
      such as weight gain and akathisia. There is some suggestion that clonidine may be
      particularly effective in a subset of refractory cases and in patients who cannot tolerate
      antipsychotic medications or lithium. The investigators plan to to study an extended-release
      form of clonidine, which the investigators hope will be even better tolerated than the
      immediate-release form, as an antimanic agent. Subjects will receive an extended-release form
      of clonidine in addition to their usual medication regimen on the second day of this
      three-day study. Rating scales, a record of sleep, and a questionnaire of adverse effects
      will be recorded on each of the 3 days. Any medication changes made by the attending
      psychiatrist and prns administered will be recorded throughout the study. The investigators
      believe that studying as few as 10 subjects will give the investigators a sense as to whether
      the addition of clonidine is helpful in reducing manic symptoms and if the rate of adverse
      effects is unacceptable.
