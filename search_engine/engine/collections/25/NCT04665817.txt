      patients with coronary artery disease whose coronary artery is determined to be 30-90%
      stenosis by quantitative CT analysis (QCT) after coronary CT scan. CT image data will be
      imported for CT-QFR detection and undergo coronary angiography within 30 days. Quantitative
      analysis of coronary angiography (QCA) was performed with the degree of coronary stenosis.
      FFR and QFR were detected during the operation. Use FFR as a reference standard to verify the
      diagnostic performance of CT-QFR and QFR. Compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the two, and verify the
      correlation and consistency of them. Use FFR as a reference standard to compare the area
      under the curve of CT-QFR, QFR, QCT, and QCA. The completion of the project will provide
      patients with a practical non-invasive assessment method of coronary heart disease which
      provides the best treatment strategy.
