        1. Systematic review of all published criteria for colorectal liver metastases (CLM)
           technical resectability (systematic review protocol published on PROSPERO database:
           https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=136748

        2. Expert interviews: Interviews with liver surgeons and radiologists to assess current
           standard practice in CLM technical resectability decision-making and role for novel
           assessment tools

        3. Online questionnaire: Online international questionnaire of liver surgeons to assess
           current standard practice in CLM technical resectability decision-making and role for
           novel assessment tools, in additional to identifying clinical scenarios in which these
           tools may be of greatest benefit

        4. Online case-based survey: Recruitment of 10-20 participants with 'difficult decisions'
           regarding technical resectability, and consent to use results from pre-operative
           assessments to create anonymised online case-based survey. Participants will consent to
           have two additional pre-operative assessments: the LiMAx tests and the HepaT1ca magnetic
           resonance scan. These results from these additional tests will also be used in the
           online survey, We will recruit international liver surgeons to complete this online
           survey, where they will be asked to provide an opinion on technical resectability for
           each individual case scenario, and to specify their operative plan, both before and
           after seeing the results of these novel assessment tools. We will assess for change in
           decision-making on resectability, and change in operative plan after seeing these test
           results. We will also assess for level of agreement between liver surgeons on each
           scenario, and identify where they difficult decisions persist.
