      combined with ipilimumab in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary objective of this
      study is to assess the safety of combining ipilimumab with palliative RT in patients with
      Stage IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are a) to assess the induction of anti-melanoma
      immune responses using laboratory correlative studies of T cell responses to melanoma
      antigens, and b) to compare tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated
      sites with responses in patients with Stage IV disease treated with ipilimumab alone on
      expanded access study CA184045. In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently
      approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT
      will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every
      12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of
      disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A
      total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring
      palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18
      months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor
      imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of
      ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the
      safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase
      II study for proof of principle. If compelling data is obtained supporting this IT + RT
      vaccine strategy, this approach will be extended to other solid tumor types.
