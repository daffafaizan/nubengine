      doses of individual agents. These regimens generally include calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs:
      cyclosporine or tacrolimus), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus or
      sirolimus), and corticosteroids. CNIs and mTOR inhibitors are substrates for cytochrome P450
      3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp); in addition, cyclosporine is a inhibitor of CYP3A4
      and P-gp. Therefore, concomitant administration of those drugs may alter their serum levels.

      It is remained to be evaluated whether the pharmacokinetics or clinical efficacy of
      tacrolimus will be affected when the regimens contain everolimus in clinical practice and the
      effect of ABCB1、CYP3A4、CYP3A5、POR genetic polymorphism on the two Drugs. Mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) has no effect on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus; therefore, MMF is used as a
      control to understand the effects of everolimus on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in patients
      receiving de novo kidney transplants. The effect of ABCB1、CYP3A4、CYP3A5、POR genetic
      polymorphism on the two Drugs was also assessed.
