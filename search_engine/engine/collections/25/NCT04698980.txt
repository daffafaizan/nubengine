      To achieve this study, the following will be done:

        -  Selection of subjects according to their G6PD activity from the list of participants
           previously included in the ELIMALAR Palustop study and from known LHUPM patients in
           Cayenne following a request for a G6PD dosage, whether or not related to malaria.

        -  Collection of clinical data from participants (sex, age, ethnicity of parents and
           grandparents).

        -  Collection of blood samples from subjects showing G6PD activity of the following three
           categories "severe deficiency", "intermediate", "normal".

        -  Determination of G6PD activity by the "STANDARD G6PD" technique from SD BIOSENSOR versus
           the reference enzymatic method
