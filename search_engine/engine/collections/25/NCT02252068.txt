      and pilot testing in an open trial, and a small randomized controlled trial. In both phases,
      opioid use and anxiety symptoms will be measured as the primary clinical outcome, along with
      measures of feasibility and patient satisfaction. These results will be used to further
      refine the treatment manual and to evaluate whether this treatment may enhance outcomes for
      adults with co-occurring opioid dependence and anxiety disorders.
