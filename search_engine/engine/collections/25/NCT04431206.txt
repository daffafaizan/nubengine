      replacement are recruited for a one day study. Study participants will come to the Clinical
      Research Unit (CRU) and one intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted in the forearm for
      oxytocin infusion. Participants in this study will receive oxytocin at a steady rate for 30
      minutes. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the
      Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Core part of this application. Mathematics will be
      utilized to calculate how quickly oxytocin moves from the blood to where it reduces pain.

      Investigators will also do a pain test to determine how much oxytocin reduces pain. For this
      Investigators will place a probe on the skin and heat it to 113 - 117 degrees for 5 minutes.
      Study participants will score any pain they feel on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find
      that pain rises during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0
      to 10 scale.
