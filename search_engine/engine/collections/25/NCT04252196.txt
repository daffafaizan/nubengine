    
      Healthy, age matched participants are invited to test the BAC at Bright Cloud Int Corporate
      Labs (675 US Hwy 1 south, B203, North Brunswick, NJ 08902, USA).

      At the beginning of the usability training, participants will be required to sign a consent
      form, and BCI research staff will go over the details of the study and check inclusion
      criteria (generally healthy individual, age 50 ~ 85, English speaker, cognitively normal).

      Subjects participate in 4 study sessions over approximately 1 month, each session lasting
      about an hour. The BAC table will have a different configuration each session. In the first
      session the table will have 0 tilt (flat). In session 2 it will be tilted 10 degrees
      downwards, in session 3 the table will be tilted up 10 degrees and in Session 4 the BAC table
      will be tilted up 20 degrees.

      The difficulty of the games will also vary from session to session, progressing from the
      lowest difficulty in Session 1 to the highest difficulty in Session 4. Thus a given game will
      not be exactly the same, when played in a subsequent session, so to allow varying interaction
      scenarios.

      At the end of each session, participants will be asked to fill up a custom feedback form. The
      custom form has questions on the system, the rehabilitation table, the controller, the
      therapeutic games they tested, and their overall impression of the experimental device. Each
      question on the custom form is answered on a 5-point Liker Scale.

      At the end of the last session they will fill a standardized USE form, with questions rated
      on a 7-point Likert scale.

      Feedback from participant will be used to improve the device as well as the therapeutic
      games.
