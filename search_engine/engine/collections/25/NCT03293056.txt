      Physical Education of the Federal University of the SÃ£o Francisco Valley. 100 adults, of both
      sexes, will be randomized into two groups, high intensity interval hydrogynastic (HIAI) or
      moderate continuous aquatic gymnastics (HCM). Individuals will be evaluated for primary
      endpoints of muscle strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, flexibility and body
      composition. The secondary outcomes evaluated will be the quality of life, functionality and
      perception of improvement by a Likert-type Improvement Scale, at the following moments:
      initial, final and follow-up of one month after the end of the training. Individuals will be
      assisted for three months, often weekly twice, with sessions lasting 50 min. In order to
      identify differences between and within the groups, an equation of generalized estimates will
      be used as regression model with the syntax according to the multivariate model.
