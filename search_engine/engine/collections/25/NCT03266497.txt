      Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores to compare diet quality between U.S.-born (n=3,837) and
      foreign-born (n=406) non-Hispanic Black adults aged 22-79y, based on pooled nationally
      representative data (NHANES 2003-2012); as well as by length of U.S. residency. Association
      between nativity and diet quality was done using multivariable-adjusted linear regression for
      the continuous total diet quality scores and their components, or multinomial (polytomous)
      logistic regression for categorical tertiles (low, medium, or high) of the total scores and
      their components. The study found that foreign-born Blacks had significantly higher AHEI-2010
      and DASH scores compared to U.S-born Blacks, and more favorable intakes for many of the score
      components. Among foreign-born Blacks, diet quality did not significantly differ by length of
      residency. Foreign-born Blacks were more likely to be in the high than low tertile for fruit
      (including and excluding fruit juice), vegetables (excluding starchy vegetables), percent
      whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, the study suggests that foreign-born Blacks
      have better diet quality compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. Considering nativity among
      U.S. Blacks in nutrition research and public health efforts may therefore improve accuracy of
      characterizing dietary intakes and facilitate development of targeted nutrition interventions
      to reduce diet-related diseases in the diverse Black population in the U.S.
