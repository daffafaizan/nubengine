      I. Assess feasibility, evaluated based on safety and tolerability, of a combination agent
      intervention (once-weekly self-administered intravaginal application of 5-fluorouracil
      alternating with once-weekly provider-applied imiquimod) for treatment of high-grade cervical
      squamous intraepithelial lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on cervical disease regression
      (endpoint based on histologic regression from high-grade lesions to low-grade or no lesions
      and clearance of high risk-human papillomavirus [HPV] detection) between baseline and study
      exit visits.

      II. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on genotype-specific HPV clearance
      between baseline and study exit visits.

      III. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on biomarkers of local immune
      activation (measurement of changes in expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and
      T-regulatory cells and the levels of innate, immune mediating and proinflammatory cytokines
      with intravaginal 5-fluorouracil [FU] and imiquimod) between baseline and study exit visits.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of imiquimod.

      Patients receive topical fluorouracil intravaginally via applicator at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
      11, 13, and 15 and imiquimod intravaginally via applicator at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
      and 16. Patients who are menstruating will delay application until the end of the menstrual
      cycle.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 months.
