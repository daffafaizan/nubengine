      the United States, making them one of the most common neurobiological conditions. Comorbid
      anxiety disorders affect as many as 80% of youth with ASD, causing substantial distress and
      impairment over and above that caused by an ASD diagnosis alone. While cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) has been established as the gold standard treatment for anxiety disorders among
      typically developing youth, a protocol does not exist for early adolescents with ASD and
      comorbid anxiety disorders. Accordingly, we are proposing to develop a CBT protocol for
      anxiety and comorbid ASD in early adolescence.

      Initial protocol development efforts will focus on adapting relevant treatment elements from
      an effective CBT program for younger children with ASD and comorbid anxiety to the
      characteristics and clinical needs of early adolescents. Thereafter, protocol and measure
      development will be refined during Phases I and II of this study through our experiences
      treating a total of 20 young adolescents (ages 11-14 years - 10 will be treated at USF; 10 at
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)) with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s). The
      CBT protocol will then be examined in a trial comparing CBT to a waitlist condition (N = 32
      total; 16 at each study site).

      The two recruitment sites for this study are the University of California, Los Angeles and
      the University of South Florida. The University of Miami will assist with quality assurance
      checks. Considering the rising number of youth diagnosed with ASD, and the lack of tested
      treatment options for those young adolescents with comorbid anxiety, our proposed work toward
      an efficacious CBT protocol will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.
