      tomography angiography (CCTA), has emerged as a novel imaging biomarker of coronary
      inflammation. This study aimed to assess whether increased Pericoronary FAI on CCTA are
      associated with high-risk plaque (HRP) feature as well as local T cell subsets and their
      intracellular cytokines levels in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes ( ACS) patients.
      195 lesions in 130 non-ST elevation ACS patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated by
      CCTA and coronary angiography in this study. Blood were taken from coronary artery
      immediately after the diagnostic angiogram. Local T cell subsets and their intracellular
      cytokines levels were detected by Flow Cytometry. CCTA and pericoronary FAI examinations were
      performed using a 320-detecor (Aquilion ONE, Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan)
      Systems. Coronary plaque characteristics were analyzed cross each of the main coronary
      arteries using commercialized software package (Qangio CT, Medis, The Netherlands).
