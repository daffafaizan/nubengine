    
      Total number of patients: 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Dosage: 5 x 107 live cells. No dose modification is planned.

      Administration: Subcutaneous (s.c.)

      Duration of treatment: Patients will receive treatment for up to 26 weeks. Progression at any
      time point requiring systemic treatment with, for example with chemotherapy or cytokines will
      lead to withdrawal of this patient from the study. All surviving patients of this AGITAM
      trial will be offered the opportunity to transfer to a follow-up treatment protocol with AGI
      - 101H. In this case treatment may continue every 4 - 8 weeks until progression or death or
      withdrawal unless such therapy is contraindicated or patient does not wish to continue.

      Reference therapy: Not applicable.

      Description of medicinal product: The drug substance, AGI-101H, is a whole cell, allogeneic
      melanoma vaccine, representing a mixture (1:1 ratio) of two therapeutic genemodified human
      melanoma cell lines, referred to as Mich1H6 and Mich2H6, which has been gamma-irradiated to
      render the cells non-proliferative. There is no recommended International Non-proprietary
      (INN) Name for the drug substance.

      Methodology: In this open-label study of patients with advanced melanoma, one dose of AGI -
      101H vaccine will be administered s.c.. 20 evaluable patients will be recruited. An
      independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will review all safety data after the first 10
      injections and then after another 10 injections (20 injections in total). Up to that second
      DMC meeting all patients have to stay in the hospital for a 2 hours observation; after the
      analysis of the 20 vaccinations the DMC will review the safety data and may recommend
      reverting to normal outpatients setting.
