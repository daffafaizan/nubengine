      I. Assess the efficacy of Temsirolimus in women with recurrent or persistent (after primary
      therapy) Carcinosarcoma (MMMT) of the uterus.

      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of Temsirolimus in this patient population.

      III. Evaluate secondary efficacy endpoints of time to tumor progression, progression-free
      survival (PFS), 6 month PFS rate, and duration of response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival II.Duration of Response III. Time to progression IV. Time to treatment
      failure

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.
