    
      ET019002-T cell therapy is a novel chimeric T-cell therapy platform that in preclinical
      studies, functionally matches the efficacy of CAR-T cells, but dramatically reduces the
      release of cytokines upon killing of target-positive tumors.The arm of the study is
      experimental i.v. arm:ET019002-T cells administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.The
      intervention is ET019002-T cells(Autologous T cells transduced with lentivirus encoding an
      anti-CD19 (ET019002)-expression construct).
