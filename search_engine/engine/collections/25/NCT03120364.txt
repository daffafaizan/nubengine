    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, parallel-group study to assess the
      Immunogenicity and safety of NBP608 compared to Zostavax which are indicated for the
      prevention of herpes zoster. Total of 824 healthy subjects aged 50 and over are enrolled, and
      each subject is administered with single dose of vaccine which is randomly assigned in 1:1
      ratio. Stratified randomization for age group is used to achieve the balance of treatment
      assignment within age strata.

      Total of five visits are scheduled including two visits via telephone contact. Blood sampling
      is conducted for immunogenicity assessment before and 6 weeks after vaccination at Visit 2
      and Visit 4 respectively. Safety is monitored 1 week, 6 weeks and 26 weeks after vaccination
      through Visit 3*, Visit 4 and Visit 5* (* telephone contact)
