      hematology-oncology wards of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and Harapan Kita Children's Hospital
      in Jakarta, December 2018 through May 2019. Study population includes all children with
      leukemia with febrile neutropenia episodes that are being hospitalized in our hospitals in
      the appropriate time. Subjects were chosen by consecutive sampling. Inclusion criteria
      includes children with leukemia aged 1 month to 18 years old undergoing chemotherapy, having
      fever of â‰¥ 38,3 degree celsius in axillar temperature with ANC < 1000/mm3. Patients' parents
      or guardians must be willing to participate and willing to sign a written informed consent
      form. Exclusion criteria includes patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin
      allergy and/or patients with kidney dysfunction. Block randomization was done to place each
      patient into cefepime or ceftazidime group. Data analysis was done using SPSS ver. 21
      software. Numerical data was shown as mean with standard deviation if the data is normally
      distributed or median with minimum-maximum value if the data is not normally distributed.
      Chi-square as the correlation test was done in order to determine the association between
      free and dependent variables, based on nominal data. Mann Whitney test was done as the
      correlation test in order to test the difference between medians of uncoupled groups and one
      categorical variable, and one interval variable and the not normally distributed data.
