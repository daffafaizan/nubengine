           untreated, or which aneurysms are needed to be treated with clipping or coiling. To
           date, no clinical trials have compared the safety and efficacy between conservative
           treatment and surgical clipping or endovascular coiling for small UIAs.

        2. Study design: A multicenter prospective observation registry study. This study is
           undertaken to conform to the study protocol. Patients will be recruited between December
           2016 and December 2018. Patients are eligible for the study if they meet the inclusion
           criteria and they are not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are met.

        3. Procedures: All patients were interviewed by a multidisciplinary team that consisted of
           vascular neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and anesthetists. If patients
           meet all of the inclusion criteria: an unruptured aneurysms â‰¤5mm are enrolled and then
           followed up at 6 and12 months. Clinical observation, surgical clipping and endovascular
           coiling are the three treatment options for UIAs. In general, when an UIA is detected,
           it should be needed to quit smoking, to aggressively manage hypertension, and to control
           alcohol use. When an aggressive treatment is considered, treatment risks should be
           balanced against the risk of rupture.
