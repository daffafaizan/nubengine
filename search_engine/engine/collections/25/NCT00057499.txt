      designed to prevent pancreatic beta-cell destruction. It does not cause fluctuations in blood
      sugar. This study will evaluate whether the vaccine protects against autoimmune attack at the
      onset of T1DM, before pancreas function has deteriorated. This experimental treatment must
      occur early because 60% to 85% of beta-cells are already destroyed by the time of T1DM
      diagnosis. If beta-cell destruction can be halted, a prolonged remission period after
      diagnosis may occur, with a subsequent delay in diabetes-related complications.

      Participants must have been diagnosed with T1DM for no more than 3 months at the time of
      enrollment in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a vaccine group or
      a control group. Participants in the vaccine group will receive one injection of IBC-VS01;
      participants in the control group will receive a placebo. Participants will then be monitored
      for 2 years. Participants will have ten follow-up visits, which will include blood tests for
      immunological and genetic analysis. Throughout the study, metabolic tests will also be
      performed to measure the remaining capacity of self insulin production of the body.
