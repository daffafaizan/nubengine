      Centre(CHC) Osijek after approval by the Ethics Committee of CHC Osijek and will be organized
      as a prospective randomized trial. Respecting the including and excluding criteria for
      participation in the study, the research will include 70 patients aged 65 years and over who
      are undergoing surgery for proximal femur fractures and will be operated with the same
      operating technique (osteosynthesis with nail). All participants will receive the same type
      of anesthesia and one of two forms of post-operative analgesia, so it will be divided into
      two groups (35 patients) depending on which form of post-operative analgesia receive.
      Randomization will be performed by drawing an envelope in which the specified one or other
      form of post-operative analgesia will be written. The study will be stopped in case of
      serious complications life-threatening (excessive sedation, respiratory insufficiency,
      hemodynamic instability and profound hypotension, heart rhythm disorders), which could
      possibly be related to the administration of drugs used for postoperative analgesia.
