    
      Children < 8 years old who scheduled for elective opthalmic surgery are randomly assigned to
      Magnesium (Mg) group and control group. Before anesthetic induction, modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) is assessed. Routine anesthetic induction is performed,
      and neuromuscular blocker is not used. Laryngeal mask airway is inserted and controlled
      ventilation is started.

      In Mg group, Mg of 30 mg/kg is administered for 10 minutes and then continuously infused
      (10mg/kg/hr) until 5 minutes before surgery end. In control group, the similar volume of
      saline is infused.

      Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale and pain score (Modified Children's
      Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale, CHEOPS) will be measured immediately after and 30
      minutes after surgery.
