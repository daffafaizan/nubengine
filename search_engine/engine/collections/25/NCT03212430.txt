    
      Aim: To investigate the physiological effect of L-Kynurenine after intravenous administration
      to healthy volunteers.

      Hypothesis: L-kynurenine induces vasodilation in the cerebral vessels and trigger headache in
      healthy individuals.

      Methods: 6 healthy volunteers will receive intravenous infusion of L-kynurenine using the
      following doses 50 microgram/kg, 100 microgram/kg, 150 microgram/kg, 300 microgram/kg, 500
      microgram/kg, 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg over 20 min on 7 different days with at least 1 day in
      between. Before and after infusion (at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 min) we will record vital
      signs, circumferences of middle cerebral artery, superficial temporalis artery and headache
      intensity and characteristics.

      The subjects will then have a questionnaire about headache for the following 24 hours.
