      Abraham, a PGY3 in our program and our IRB approval was obtained with much time and effort on
      February 24, 2010. We followed the protocol and so far we recruited just one patient on
      September 19, 2011 who completed the study but we encountered with many unexpected obstacles
      to recruit any more patients to the study. The main obstacle was that the spine surgeons'
      refusal to start the study drug for months after surgery for fear of complications with wound
      healing. Secondly, the few appropriate and eligible patients we tried to recruit declined to
      participate.

      We were unable to recruit any more patients to this study and hence the study was closed.

      The one patient that was recruited completed the study. Since it is only one subject in the
      study, no conclusions can be drawn.
