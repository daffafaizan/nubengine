      tendons, muscles, ligaments, nerves, and other joint structures. If MSP lasts for longer than
      three months, it becomes chronic. The prevalence of chronic MSP (cMSP) increases with aging
      and its ratio changes between 35,7% and 49,8%. The previous studies demonstrated the
      differences in the prevalence of cMSP between men and women. According to most of the
      studies, older women adults are more vulnerable to experience than men due to some
      differences in perception of pain such as biological characteristics, their roles in daily
      life, beliefs or coping strategies with pain.

      Oestrogen has a prominent role in the physiology of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones.
      The decline of this sex hormone during menopause transition could lead to MSP, particularly
      in the postmenopausal period. Indeed, an increasing rate of cMSP in postmenopausal women has
      been reported.

      Coping strategies with pain are used to manage the pain and its impacts. Coping with pain
      requires the self-regulation of individuals using cognitive and behavioral reactions. Dealing
      with cMSP is a process that can need the making of changes in daily life and activities This
      study aimed to compare active and passive coping strategies being used and pain severity in
      postmenopausal women according to their age, marital status, educational status, and exercise
      habits. Also, subdomains of strategies and subdomains of pain and the relationship between
      pain and coping strategies in postmenopausal women with cMSP will be examined.
