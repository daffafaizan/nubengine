      remains no proven treatments except tissue plasminogen activator currently. Based on
      promising results of cell therapy in animal stroke models, efforts to apply cell therapy for
      patients with stroke has been made. UCB possess various stem or progenitor cells and is known
      to secrete neurotrophic factors to repair injured brain. This clinical research aims to
      determine the safety and efficacy of allogeneic UCB for stroke.
