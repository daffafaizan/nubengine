      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to each treatment group to receive paricalcitol capsules or
      placebo. A stratified randomization scheme was used to ensure balance among treatment groups
      with respect to country, gender, and baseline renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
      inhibitor use (yes/no).

      Participants who completed the 48-Week Treatment Period could continue on in the ongoing
      Long-term Follow-up Period that was to last 18 months, with study visits at 6 months, 12
      months and 18 months post Treatment Week 48 Visit. Participants did not receive study drug,
      nor were they to have undergone echocardiogram/MRI procedures during the Long-term Follow-up
      Period.
