      optimal therapeutic effect the International Normalized Ratio (INR) needs to be maintained
      within the therapeutic target range. The time that a patient spends within the therapeutic
      target range is an intermediate quality indicator for patient outcomes and should be
      optimized. For this purpose, we use in our anticoagulation clinic the simple two-step
      Hamilton nomogram, which has been validated by Kim et al. who showed that the nomogram
      improved INR control for warfarin maintenance compared with expertise-based dosing in our
      anticoagulation clinic (see references). Computer systems are also known to outperform
      expertise-based dosing, but no direct comparison of a computer system with a simple nomogram
      has been assessed. In this single-center randomized controlled clinical trial we will compare
      the simple two-step Hamilton nomogram with the widely used computerized dosing management
      system DAWN AC regarding their effect on time in therapeutic range for patients on
      maintenance dosing with target range 2-3.
