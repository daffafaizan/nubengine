      hip arthroplasty. Patients will be grouped based on the revision implants they receive during
      surgery. Patients who receive a full hip revision (stem and cup), will be counted in both
      study groups. The two study groups are:

        1. femoral stem revision (n=30 hips)

        2. acetabular cup revision (n=22 hips)
