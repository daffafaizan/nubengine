      first-episode psychotic patients involving a standardized intervention with monotherapy with
      aripiprazole during the first 6 weeks. Patients and matched healthy controls will be examined
      at baseline and after 6 weeks, 6 months and 2 years.

      Levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are measured by proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC and thalamus.
      Presynaptic Dopamine level is measured with Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography
      (PET/CT)-scanning using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA). Disturbances
      of the reward system is measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . Regional
      cerebral blood flow and activity in the same regions are measured with Pseudo-continuous
      arterial spin labelling (pCASL). The default mode network, functional and structural
      connectivity in the associated macro circuits are measured with resting state fMRI, EEG, and
      diffusion tensor imaging. Structural brain changes (in grey and white matter) are measured
      with MRI. Cognitive functions are measured with a neuropsychological test battery, and early
      information processing with event related EEG and electromyography (EMG) (psychophysiological
      examinations). Further patients psychopathology will be rated.
