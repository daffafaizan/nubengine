    
      In aim one, the investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize
      the brain regions which are activated in response to food portion size and compare these
      regions between high- and low-risk children.

      Second, the investigators will determine the relationship between brain response to visual
      portion size cues and measured food intake when portions are increased in the laboratory.

      Third, the investigators will determine the relationship between brain response to large
      portions and other validated measures of overeating, including satiety responsiveness and the
      amount of calories children consumed from high calorie snacks when they are not hungry (i.e.,
      eating in the absence of hunger).

      Fourth, the investigators will conduct follow-up visits one year after baseline to determine
      the extent to which baseline brain and behavioral responses to portion size predict gains in
      adiposity assessed by anthropometrics (body weight, height, and dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry).

      Secondary study endpoints include the relationship between child behavioral and brain
      response to food portion size and physical activity assessed by accelerometry and
      questionnaires, inhibitory control assessed by a stop signal test, reward-related design
      making assessed by a computer task, working memory assessed by an N-back task loss of control
      eating, child sleep, child working memory, child meal microstructure assessed by
      observational meal coding, parent rated eating behaviors, and parental feeding practices.
