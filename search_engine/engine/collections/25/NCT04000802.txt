      process for a patient with cancer. It allows a sharing of knowledge and decision-making,
      taking into account the opinion of all the specialists involved in the treatment of cancer,
      in order to propose the best possible decision for the patient. Nevertheless, the quality of
      decision-making during CPR depends on other factors such as the quality of presentation of
      clinical cases, the degree of participation of different specialists and the dynamics of
      meetings.

      There are several validated tools for the quantitative assessment of the decision-making mode
      during CPRs. The best known is the Metric Of Decision-Making (MDT-MODe). MDT-MODe is a
      validated tool for the observational evaluation of teamwork and the quality of
      decision-making during cancer CPR.

      MDT-MODe is designed to encourage teams to make holistic decisions tailored to each patient
      and allows an observer to assess, on a case-by-case basis, in a quantitative and objective
      way:

      The quality of the clinical information (antecedents, radiological pathologies, pathological,
      comorbid, psychosocial problems and patients' points of view) Contribution to decision-making
      in teams of key professional groups (surgeons, physicians, oncologists, nurses, health
      professionals, radiologists, pathologists) Taken together, these notes provide an indication
      of the quality of team decision-making.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the decision-making during digestive oncology
      MDT using the validated "Metric Of Decision-Making" tool (MDT-MODe), in the national
      institute of oncology (Rabat, Morocco).
