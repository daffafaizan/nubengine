    
      This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain chemistry,
      connectivity and response to pain in healthy controls and age- and sex-matched fibromyalgia
      patients, and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients
      randomized to either electro-acupuncture or laser acupuncture.

      The investigators will evaluate 80 fibromyalgia patients who will receive acupuncture
      treatment twice a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments. Baseline data from these
      patients will be compared to results from 40 pain-free controls.

      Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.
