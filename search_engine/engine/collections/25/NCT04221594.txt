      anatomy data obtained from CT coronary angiography with dynamic PET data to noninvasively
      measure absolute myocardial blood flow, flow reserve and relative flow reserve across
      specific coronary lesions. These results will be compared to those obtained invasively in the
      catheterization laboratory. The long-term objective of the study is to improve the care of
      cardiac patients by developing, validating and implementing clinically computer-based methods
      to noninvasively determine the physiological significance of specific coronary lesions using
      methods to fuse and quantify multi-modality cardiac imagery.
