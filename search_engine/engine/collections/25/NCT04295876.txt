    
      The BRIDGES Project intervention is culturally-tailored intervention for syndemic-affected
      cis- and transgender women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) that aims to: 1) build skills to cope
      with syndemic-related affective distress, 2) facilitate linkages to both HIV treatment and
      relevant ancillary service providers (e.g., domestic violence, mental health, substance use),
      and 3) teach women interpersonal skills to activate social support networks (e.g., service
      providers, friends, family) when faced with new or ongoing barriers. Participants in the The
      BRIDGES Project are estimated to demonstrate improvements in HIV care outcomes (i.e., linkage
      to HIV care, self-efficacy in ART adherence, retention in HIV care) and syndemic-support
      outcomes (i.e., coping skills, activated social support networks, linkage to and receipt of
      ancillary support services) compared to HIV-infected women assigned to standard of care
      (self-guided access and use of Ryan White case management).
