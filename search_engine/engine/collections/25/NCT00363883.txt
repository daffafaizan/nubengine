      I. To determine response rate measured by RECIST criteria for SAHA in patients with recurrent
      or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to progression and overall survival for SAHA in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.

      II. To provide data on safety and toxicity of SAHA in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on molecular correlates in tissue, oral mucosa and blood to
      determine feasibility and clinical efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and buccal mucosa collection and tumor biopsies (if accessible) at
      baseline and periodically during study for correlative studies. Samples are examined by gene
      expression profiling and immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 26 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
