      complex minimally invasive surgical procedures across different specialties. This study aimed
      to investigate the impact of DVRSS on surgical proficiencies among inexperience novice
      surgeons and compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery.

      Methods Twenty medical students (n=20) without surgical experience were enrolled. After a
      constructive training for basic surgical techniques, participants were randomly allocated
      into DVR or laparoscopy group. Participants were asked to close five cases (also named five
      tasks) of a 2cm long incision on pig stomach by using DVR or laparoscopy. Surgical time,
      successful closure rate and pneumatic bursting pressure of gastric incision withstanding were
      recorded. In addition, participant performance and workload were quantified by using
      performance score, scales of Global Rating Scale Assessment (GSA) and NASA-Task Load Index
      (NASATLI).
