    
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized, single center study of the
      effect of adding the antiretroviral Maraviroc to the antiretroviral treatment regimen
      (HAART)of patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response to HAART but have had a
      sub-adequate immunologic response to treatment. Patients who have had a full virologic
      response (as defined by HIV-1 viral loads of < 48 copies/mL) for 12 months or more are
      defined as having a sub-adequate immunologic response if their CD4 lymphocyte count has not
      gone above 500.

      This pilot study will contain up to 30 patients who will be followed over a period of 12
      months starting from the date of enrollment and addition of maraviroc to their current highly
      active antiretroviral therapy regimen. The main outcome to be followed is the CD4 lymphocyte
      counts at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with the addition of maraviroc.
