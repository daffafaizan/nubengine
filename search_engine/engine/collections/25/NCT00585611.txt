      fashion once daily for six months. Using echocardiography, tonometry, and flow mediated
      dilation of conduit arteries and arterioles, baseline cardiovascular anatomy and physiology
      will be defined. Subjects that enroll in the study will be required to come in for 5 study
      visits. The initial visit is a screening visit; subject consent is obtained and an
      echocardiogram is performed as well as blood tests. At the randomization visit (4-14 days
      following screening), the subject will be provided with drug or placebo in a blinded
      fashion.Also at this visit, subjects will be asked to do a 6 minute walk, QOL questionnaire,
      and vascular function testing. There will be follow-up study visits at 1 and 3 months
      following randomization. At each follow-up visit a medical history, pill count and brief
      physical examination will be performed, a repeat QOL questionnaire administered, and blood
      tests to assess safety of the statin therapy. At 6 months, the final study visit will occur.
      At this visit a full history and detailed physical examination will be performed. Repeat
      echocardiogram, 6 minute walk test, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function examinations
      will be performed.
