      after surgery. However, limited locoregional control remains a key issue in the management of
      oral cavity carcinomas. Appropriate target selection is a key issue in the radiotherapy of
      oral cavity cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the locoregional control in
      PET/CT based radiotherapy treatment planning in the treatment of oral cancer
