      Primary

        -  To examine the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of Irinotecan (CPT-11) and
           Carboplatin as first-line therapy as assessed by response rate in patients with
           chemo-na√Øve extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
