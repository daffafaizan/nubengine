    
      The trial is a randomized, Phase II, open label multi-center trial in adult patients with
      newly diagnosed AML or high-risk MDS as defined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      An initial safety run-in study will be performed administering intensive induction therapy
      consisting of daunorubicin and cytarabine with the study drug volasertib administered prior
      or after chemotherapy, as well as consolidation therapy consisting of intermediate-dose
      cytarabine with the study drug volasertib administered prior or after chemotherapy. After
      establishing the volasertib dose, the randomized Phase II portion of the trial will begin:

      Patients will be equally randomized to DA (daunorubicin, cytarabine), V-DA (volasertib
      administered prior to daunorubicin, cytarabine), and DA-V (volasertib administered after
      daunorubicin, cytarabine). All patients will receive a second induction cycle with reduced
      daunorubicin and cytarabine doses. Patients refractory to the first induction cycle and
      patients not achieving a CR/CRi after two induction cycles will be off-study and followed up.

      Patients in CR/CRi after induction therapy will proceed to consolidation therapy.
      Consolidation will be stratified based on the genetic risk profile (according to ELN
      criteria) and patient-related factors (e.g., age, HCT-CI, comorbidities, patient wish).
      Patients with a favorable genetic risk profile and those patients considered ineligible for
      allogeneic HCT will receive repetitive cycles of consolidation according to initial
      randomization, either MiDAC, V-MiDAC (volasertib administered prior to cytarabine), or
      MiDAC-V (volasertib administered after cytarabine). All other patients are assigned to
      allogeneic HCT.
