      with cervical spinal cord injury. The results revealed the safety of autologous MSC. This
      Phase II, III single-center trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived
      mesenchymal stem cell transplantation direct to injured spinal cord site via laminectomy.
      After recovery from the operation, the subjects receive 4 weeks of physical and occupational
      therapy.
