      data needed to power a larger RCT (e.g., rates of consent, retention rates). Clinical
      outcomes will be assessed for the purpose of detecting unexpected deterioration.
      Investigators will also collect usability feedback regarding the intervention which may be
      used to refine the treatment. Usage data will be used to identify under-used lessons and
      tools and improve their usefulness/appeal. Compliance with assessments will be monitored and
      used to improve retention protocols.
