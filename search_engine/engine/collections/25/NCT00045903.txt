      of two CBTs: exposure and ritual prevention or stress management therapy. Exposure and ritual
      prevention involves imaginal and in-vivo exposure and requires that participants refrain from
      ritualizing. Stress management involves relaxation, assertiveness training, and structured
      problem-solving. Therapy occurs twice per week for 2 months. Participants are assessed
      verbally by an independent evaluator and are asked to complete self-rating forms. Patients
      who respond are followed for up to 1 additional year. Participants continue to take the same
      medication and the same monthly therapy for the first 6 months of follow-up. During the
      second 6 months of follow-up, participants discontinue therapy but continue taking the same
      medication.
