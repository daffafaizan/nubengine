      events in malignant transformation and is readily detectable in apparently normal benign
      breast epithelium adjacent to breast cancers. We hypothesize that DNA methylation of certain
      genes occurs as a field change in benign breast tissue that is at high risk for malignant
      transformation, and as such, can be exploited for tissue-based breast cancer risk
      stratification. Additional work is required to identify new DNA methylation markers
      potentially useful for periareolar fine needle aspiration (RP-FNA)-based breast cancer risk
      stratification, to determine whether these markers are methylated more frequently in benign
      samples from women who develop breast cancer, to determine whether assessment of these
      markers is reproducible, to determine whether tamoxifen reduces DNA methylation, and to
      better understand the pattern of DNA methylation in benign samples from unselected healthy
      control populations. Each of these objectives contributes to advancement of a clinically
      useful RP-FNA-based breast cancer risk stratification test.

      In addition, identification of genes that are preferentially methylated in estrogen receptor
      (ER) negative breast cancer will provide clues to the underlying biology responsible for this
      aggressive form of breast cancer. This knowledge may lead to the discovery of the causes of
      ER negative breast cancer, approaches for recognizing women at increased risk for this type
      of breast cancer, and approaches for reducing this risk.
