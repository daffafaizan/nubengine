      sclerotherapy, embolization or ablation based on clinical and imaging features without
      acquisition of tissue. Over the last two decades there have been significant advancements in
      the understanding of the genetic basis for various vascular anomalies/malformations, which
      may guide use of therapies for individualized treatment.

      As such, given the emergence of novel medications for treatment of vascular
      anomalies/malformations based on genetic information, acquisition of tissue for pathology and
      genomic characterization will be increasingly important as treatment of vascular
      anomalies/vascular malformations moves toward individualized medicine approach.
