    
      Diarrhea-dominated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is studied in subjects by treatment with
      an anaerobic human intestinal microbiota cultured for 15 years and quality controlled with a
      specified content of bacterial species regularly over the years. Inclusion criteria is:
      Diarrheal disease since at least 4 weeks, 18-80 years of age, previously unsuccessful
      treatment with no symptomatic relief of antidiarrheals or resins, and signed informed
      consent.

      Primary outcome was irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS). Secondary
      outcome was Bristol stool scale (BSS).

      Secondary outcome: Changes in fecal microflora distribution and multiplicity as shown by the
      16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) analysis of feces.

      Once eligible for the study, patients were monitored for a run-in period of one week with the
      IBS-SSS and the BSS plus fecal samples for analysis of bacterial species using the bacterial
      specific 16S rRNA differentiation.

      Then, the anaerobic cultured human intestinal microflora (ACHIM) was given twice with an
      interval of 1 week. Thereafter, patients were further monitored over 4 weeks as regards
      IBS-SSS and BSS. Another feces sample was also collected for bacterial 16S rRNA analysis to
      evaluate the microbiota diversity.

      The study will be evaluated using eligible subjects as their own controls by means of
      Wilcoxon's matched-pairs test, alternatively t-test for matched pairs.

      Power analysis show that 40 subjects are needed to study in order to achieve a power of 80%.
