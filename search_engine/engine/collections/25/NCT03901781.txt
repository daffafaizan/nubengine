    
      This clinical trial is a dose escalating design in three (3) cohorts. In the first cohort,
      subjects will be treated with ST266 delivered using a non-invasive trans-cribriform
      intranasal delivery device daily for 14 days, in alternating single nostrils. If there are no
      SAEs and no pattern of concern in the AE's, the Investigator may proceed to the second
      cohort. In Cohort Two, subjects will be administered ST266 to each nostril daily for 14 days.
      As with the first cohort, if there are no safety concerns, the investigator may move on to
      the third cohort. In Cohort Three, subjects will be administered ST266 to each nostril daily
      for 28 days. All subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study drug.
      ST266 will be administered by a health care professional trained to deliver ST266
      intranasally. No efficacy data will be collected.
