    
      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the parasite clearance half-life of arterolane-piperaquine compared to
      DHA-piperaquine in patients with artemisinin resistant uncomplicated falciparum malaria,
      defined by presence of the "K13" mutations in the infecting parasite strain.

      Secondary Objectives :

        -  To assess the therapeutic efficacy of arterolane-piperaquine and DHA-piperaquine for the
           treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria or mixed infection (P.falciparum (PF) + a
           non-falciparum species) at Day 42, stratified by presence of artemisinin resistance in
           the infecting parasite strain.

        -  To assess the frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events of
           arterolane-piperaquine compared to DHA-piperaquine.

        -  To assess other efficacy parameters related to parasite clearance and parasite cure rate
           as well as the gametocyte carriage.

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) data on
           arterolane-piperaquine and DHA-piperaquine.
