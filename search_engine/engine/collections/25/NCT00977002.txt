    
      Prospective, randomized and controlled study at the PICU - University Hospital, Botucatu
      Medical School-UNESP. Patients elegibled are exposed to extubation test. If passed they are
      randomized in two groups: 1) post-extubation PPNIV (PPNIV, n=50), and 2) Inhalatory oxygen
      therapy by nasal catheter or facial mask (O2I, n=50). Patients are observed for 48 hours,
      being considered extubation failure if they need reintubation. Arterial blood gas is obtained
      at the day or programed extubation and one hour after extubation.

      Nasal prongs and facial or nasal masks are used in accordance with child age. All patients
      from this group are kept in PPNIV for a 12 hours at least. Feeding, if released, is done by
      gastric probe.

      In O2IG, patients use facial mask or nasal catheter after extubation. Both groups are
      submitted to physiotherapy and nurse care as the PICU routine Follow up: Variables: age,
      gender, disease and comorbidities, intubation cause , time intubated and invasive ventilation
      use, PRISM score at the moment of admission, risk factors to respiratory distress post
      extubation, Comfort scale just before extubation, use of sedatives (time and mean dose)during
      invasive ventilation. At randomization and one hour later: vital signs, arterial blood gas.
      Patients are followed for 48 hour to evaluate reintubation and then for other complications,
      death and length of stay in PICU and hospital.
