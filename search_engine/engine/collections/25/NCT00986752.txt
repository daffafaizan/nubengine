      for lower extremity vascular disease. Advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)
      and stenting have provided new options for the treatment of the disease in this arterial
      segment. Despite the initial technical success rate of more than 95% the late clinical
      failure remains an important concern.

      Restenosis after PTA occurs in 40-60% within one year. Percutaneous removal of the
      obstructive material through atherectomy may reduce restenosis rate. So far, data in support
      of excisional atherectomy derive from registries. Another attempt to reduce restenosis is the
      use of paclitaxel eluting balloons (PEB). First clinical studies suggest that the use of PEBs
      during percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal disease is associated with significant
      reductions in late lumen loss and target-lesion revascularization.

      There is no randomized comparison of this three different interventional strategies. Thus the
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of these strategies in terms or reduction of
      diameter stenosis at follow-up angiogram.
