      be to establish the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib when used in combination with
      temozolomide and radiation therapy. Secondary goals of this study include: response rate,
      time to treatment failure, 6 month progression-free survival, event free survival and overall
      survival. A correlative study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib used in
      combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide.
