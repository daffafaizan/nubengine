    
      This is a feasibility study evaluating the use of a mathematical model to predict response to
      standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Chemotherapy will be
      protocol-approved chemotherapy regimen containing intravenous Doxorubicin (or Epirubicin),
      Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel (or Docetaxel).

      Patients receive a protocol-approved chemotherapy regimen containing Doxorubicin (or
      Epirubicin), Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel (or Docetaxel) based on the patient and/or
      physician preference.

      Mathematical modeling using the patient's diagnostic core biopsy and baseline MRI of the
      breast will be used to predict the response to above therapy.

      Following the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical approach and adjuvant
      radiation and endocrine therapy are left to the discretion of the treating physicians.
