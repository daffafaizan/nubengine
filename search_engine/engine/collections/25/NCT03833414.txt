      intra-articular distal humerus fractures present as challenge to restore of painless, stable
      and mobile elbow joint. Surgical exposure to all critical structures is of paramount
      importance to achieve anatomic reduction. Conflict still persists regarding the choice of
      ideal approach between triceps-sparing approach compared with olecranon osteotomy approach.
      In this study investigators compare the effect of surgical approach triceps lifting vs
      olecranon osteotomy on the functional outcome after fixation of distal humerus
      intra-articular fractures. Investigators conducted a non-funded, non-commercial,
      retrospective cohort study on participants with closed distal humerus intra-articular
      fractures between 2010 and 2015 at our tertiary care level-1 trauma and university hospital.
      Participants >18 years of age with closed complex intra-articular distal humerus fracture
      were operated using two different surgical approaches, either triceps lifting approach
      (Group1) or with olecranon osteotomy (Group 2). Functional evaluation of the participant is
      carried out with quick DASH scores at the final 1 year follow-up. Investigators concluded
      that triceps lifting approach can be used equally efficiently for exposure of these complex
      distal humerus injuries with no comprise in visibility of articular fragments.
