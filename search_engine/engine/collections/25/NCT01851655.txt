      rehabilitation based on knee motion, pain levels and quadriceps strength.

      Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to
      any study procedures. The study will consist of 2 testing sessions and an 8 week intervention
      (2 visits per week) at the UF&Shands Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine Institute. The testing
      sessions will include clinical measures of knee impairments, questionnaires, biomechanical
