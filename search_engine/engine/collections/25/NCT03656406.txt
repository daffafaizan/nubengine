      the ETT in the trachea in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Most of the literature
      recommend maintaining a pressure of 20-30 cmH2O to prevent cuff-related complications such as
      micro-aspiration or airway trauma. Proper pressure is also important for DLTs used in
      thoracic surgery. Furthermore, the cuff pressure of the ETT can change during the patient's
      positional changes. All things considered, we hypothesized that the change from supine to
      lateral decubitus position, which is essential for thoracic surgery would affect the BCP of
      the DLT.
