      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with previously untreated advanced cancer of the
           urothelium treated with pemetrexed disodium and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive cyanocobalamin intramuscularly once every 9
      weeks and folic acid orally once daily beginning on day -6 and continuing until 3 weeks after
      the completion of study therapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 -18
      months.
