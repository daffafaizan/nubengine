        -  Determine the antitumor activity of O6-benzylguanine and temozolomide in patients with
           temozolomide-resistant methylguanine methyltransferase-positive or -negative
           glioblastoma multiforme previously treated with radiotherapy.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine intravenous (IV) over 1 hour and oral temozolomide
      once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 6
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
