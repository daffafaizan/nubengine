      bioactive agents that are not only inflammo-modulatory but also osteoclast-inhibitory or
      rather, osteostimulative. The hypolipidaemic Statin group of drugs, particularly Rosuvastatin
      (RSV), are known to be associated with alveolar bone formation and periodontal improvements.
      Platelet analogues like Platelet rich fibrin (PRF), being rich sources of growth factors,
      have also come into widespread periodontal regenerative use. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate and compare the efficacy of open-ï¬‚ap debridement (OFD) with or without PRF or PRF +
      1.2% RSV gel in the treatment of intrabony defects (IBDs) in chronic periodontitis (CP)
      patients.

      Methods: Ninety individuals with a total of 90 IBDs were randomly assigned to one of the 3
      treatment groups: 1) OFD alone, 2) OFD + PRF and 3) OFD + PRF + 1.2% RSV gel placement.
      Plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), clinical
      attachment (CA) level and IBD depth were recorded at baseline and at 9 months
      post-operatively.
