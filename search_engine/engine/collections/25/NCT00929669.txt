      treatment as been found that decreases the size of these adenomas, so surgery is the only
      treatment. The reason to think that pasireotide might affect gonadotroph adenomas is that
      pasireotide binds avidly to somatostatin subtype 5 receptors, and gonadotroph adenomas
      express these receptors. For this study, three subjects who have gonadotroph adenomas, as
      judged by a macroadenoma of the pituitary and elevated serum FSH concentration, will be
      treated with a long-acting form of pasireotide once a month for one year. The effect of
      pasireotide on the size of the adenoma will be determined by MRI, and FSH secretion will be
      judged by the serum concentration.
