      known to be relatively weak compared to other antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa,
      dopamine agonist or Mao-B inhibitor and its effects are limited in early months, so it is
      rarely used than other drugs.

      Recently, several studies have identified the long-term effects of amantadine on dyskinesia,
      but the basis is still insufficient.

      Therefore, this study aims to investigate the long-term effectiveness of amantadine in
      patients with PD. Participants who have used amantadine since the early stages of diagnosis
      undergo clinical evaluations including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Movement
      Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Freezing of
      Gait-Questionnaire (FOG-Q), Non-motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) and Parkinson's Disease
      Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). Then, participants stop taking amantadine. To investigate the
      long-term effect, clinical evaluations except MoCA are repetitively assessed at 4- and 8-week
      follow-ups.
