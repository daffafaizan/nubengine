      through circulating autoantibodies that bind to and stimulate the thyroid hormone receptor
      (TSHR). Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is characterized by inflammation, expansion of the
      extraocular muscles and an increase in retroorbital fat. There are currently three forms of
      therapies offered: anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) (thionamides), radioactive iodine (RAI) and total
      thyroidectomy (Tx). There is currently no consensus on the treatment of Grave's disease and
      GO.

      Objective: To examine the difference in the outcome of GO in patients with moderate-to-severe
      GO, who receive Tx versus further ATD after suffering their first relapse of GO or in which
      GO stays the same following the initial decrease in ATD therapy after 6 months.

      Methods: This prospective randomized clinical trial with observer blinded analysis will
      analyze 60 patients with moderate-to-severe GO who receive Tx versus ATD without surgery.
      Main outcome variables include: muscle index measurements via ultrasound and thyroid antibody
      levels. Additional outcome variables include: CAScore/NOSPECS score, superonasal index
      measurements via ultrasound and quality of life score.
