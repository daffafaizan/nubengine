      antigens based on detection of intracellular cytokines through flow cytometry, after
      stimulation with all-tumor antigens and blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 interaction is used.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with cancers are stimulated with 4
      telomerase-peptides or peptides overlapping the entire sequence of survivin.

      This project studies the frequency and role of polyfunctionality of anti-tumor T lymphocytes
      in cancerology with an in vitro technique detecting polyfunctional T lymphocytes with a
      better sensitivity based on removal of an inhibitory PD-1/PDL-1 pathway. It is a flow
      cytometry protocol with various theoretical advantages in terms of reproducibility and
      dynamic monitoring of functionality of different sub-populations of polyfunctional anti-tumor
      T lymphocytes. Moreover, it allows the study of molecular mechanisms involved in
      proliferation of polyfunctional anti-tumor T lymphocytes with the possibility to sort
      sub-populations.

      The use of all-tumor antigens allows the use of this technique to evaluate the presence and
      prognostic or predictive value of this biomarker in various cancers.

      Detection of polyfunctional anti-tumor T lymphocytes can be a biomarker of anti-tumor
      lymphocytic adaptive immunity and a potential eligibility or efficacy criteria for new
      immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL-1 treatments.
