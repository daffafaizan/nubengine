    
      Aim #1: To assess the threshold reinforcing dose and dose-effect curve for IV NSA at low
      doses in young adult LITS.

      Hypothesis #1A: The threshold reinforcing doses for IV NSA will be between 0.0125 to 0.1
      mg/70 kg.

      Hypothesis #1B: The dose-effect curve for NSA will differ between males and females with
      relatively flat curve in female smokers.

      Aim #2: To assess the threshold and dose-effect curve for the positive and negative/aversive
      subjective effects of IV nicotine at low doses and its relationship to nicotine
      reinforcement.

      Hypothesis #2 A: The threshold for the positive effects will be between 0.0125 to 0.1 mg/70
      kg, for the negative/aversive effect it will be â‰¥ 0.1 mg/70 kg.

      Hypothesis #2B: Nicotine reinforcement will be positively correlated with the positive and
      negatively correlated with the negative/aversive subjective effects of IV nicotine.

      Exploratory Aims: To examine the influence of nicotine clearance rate on nicotine
      reinforcement threshold and dose-effect curve.
