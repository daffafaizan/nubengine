    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 therapy groups: megestrol acetate
      alone, exercise plus megestrol acetate, or exercise plus placebo. Therapy continues for 12
      weeks.

      A single dose of oral megestrol acetate or placebo is administered each morning.

      The exercise program consists of aerobic exercise and resistance training performed 3 times a
      week under supervision. Hard aerobic exercise is performed for 45 minutes plus a warm-up and
      cool-down period; the patient chooses to work on 3 of 5 pieces of exercise equipment.
      Exercise intensity is adjusted to a heart rate corresponding to 65% of maximal oxygen
      consumption.

      Resistance training is done on a universal gym; exercises are designed to work all 6 major
      muscle groups. Each exercise is performed at 70% of maximal single repetition resistance.
      Resistance is increased 5% when the patient can perform 15 repetitions without failure.
