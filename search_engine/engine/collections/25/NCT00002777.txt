        -  Compare the efficacy of exemestane vs tamoxifen, in terms of progression-free survival,
           in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety profile of exemestane in these patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. (Phase II of this study closed as of
      6/14/00). Patients are stratified by participating center, prior adjuvant tamoxifen (yes vs
      no), prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no), and dominant site of metastasis
      (visceral with or without others vs bone only vs bone and soft tissue vs soft tissue only).

      Patients are randomized to receive either oral exemestane or oral tamoxifen daily. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 18 months and then at least every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.7 years.
