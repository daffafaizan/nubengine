      by disrupting microvascular structure of tumor. To assess the safety and tolerability of
      NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet), patients with advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled
      in this study. Initial dose of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet) is 5 mg/day, which will be
      escalated until at least 2 of 6 subjects show dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
      Pharmacokinetic profiles and efficacy by tumor response and vascular disrupting activities
      will also be assessed.
