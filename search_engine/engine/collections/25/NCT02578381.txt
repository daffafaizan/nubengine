      come to diagnostic coronary angiography would more often be achieved if there was concomitant
      data with regard to the presence of patient-specific and lesion-specific ischaemia:

        -  that it is the presence and extent of reversible myocardial ischaemia (RMI) that
           dominates over coronary anatomy as a predictor of near term cardiovascular events, as
           well as symptom relief

        -  that prognostic benefit after revascularisation is greatest in patients with the largest
           pre-procedure ischaemic burden

        -  that intra-coronary pressure wire (PW) data are strongly correlated with subsequent
           cardiac events despite the binary nature of the test

        -  that stenting of coronary lesions that are PW negative has a worse outcome than optimal
           medical therapy (OMT)

        -  that PW-directed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in multivessel disease is
           associated with a better clinical outcome than angiogram-directed PCI despite fewer
           treated lesions and less stents

        -  that PW-directed PCI improves prognosis compared to OMT

        -  that mismatch exists in up to 30-40% of lesions encountered at angiography between the
           visual appearance of the severity of the lesion and whether the lesion is "ischaemic"
           (and therefore a target for revascularisation) according to PW.

      The availability of PW has been shown to have had a substantial effect on overall management
      of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (ie when options are still OMT/PCI and
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in several observation studies including RIPCORD and
      the French Registry.

      Yet, despite the seemingly persuasive data summarised here, the uptake of PW at the
      diagnostic stage of the patient pathway is still low. There are, as yet, no suitably powered
      randomised trials using the PW systematically at the stage of diagnostic angiography and
      comparing outcome with management based upon angiography alone. This is the gap that will be
      filled by RIPCORD2.

      RIPCORD2 will use the new Boston Scientific Pressure Wire (BSPW), which is currently
      undergoing first-in-man testing in Chile. The device has, of course, already been internally
      validated by Boston Scientific engineers and scientists, but the purpose of the COMET study
      is to provide independent and objective validation of the performance of BSPW using the
      performance of the St Jude Medical pressure wire (SJPW) as the reference, both using
      inter-wire and intra-wire measurements. Thus, not only will we assess the reproducibility of
      the measurements between the 2 wires, but the investigators will also compare reproducibility
      of measurements from 2 wires of the same manufacturer.
