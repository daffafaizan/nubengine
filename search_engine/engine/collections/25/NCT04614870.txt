      for various infectious diseases including urinary tract infections, peritonitis and joint
      infections. It is likely that wound infection is also accompanied with the elevation of
      leukocyte esterase in wound fluid and on the wound dressing. To test this hypothesis, the
      proposed device - DETEC® Esterase - has been developed to detect elevated leukocyte esterase
      on wound exudates absorbed on the wound contacting surface of wound dressings. With
      increasing esterase levels, this coloration (from colorless/pink to dark purple) becomes more
      intense indicating infection.

      Patients presenting themselves to the clinic with ulcer wounds will be assessed by the
      clinicians. Those with or without clinical signs and symptoms of a wound infection will be
      enrolled and recorded in the study. The participant's first visit can be concurrent with
      enrollment. During this visit, the leukocyte esterase on wounds will be assessed by testing
      wound exudate adsorbed on to participants' wound dressings using the DETEC® Esterase device
      by a project nurse/tester not involved with subjects' wound management and the output
      recorded. Wounds will be managed by the clinicians who are blinded from the device output.
      Consequently, the clinician will send the wound fluids/tissue samples from patients for
      microbiological laboratory testing. Within 15 days following the first visit, the presence or
      absence of infection will then be adjudicated by the provider based on all information. The
      device output will then be correlated with this adjudication.
