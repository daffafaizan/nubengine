      problem that associates physical and mental health complications and community implications.
      The Alerta Alcohol and Alerta Alcohol 2.0 programs are based on the I-Change Model. A CRCT is
      carried out. The schools from Andalusia are randomized either to the experimental (EC-1,
      EC-2) or the control conditions (CC). The EC-1 receives an online intervention (Alerta
      Alcohol, which has adapted from a previous version) with personalized health advice, using
      textual feedback and several gamification techniques, and consists of nine sessions
      (performing seven of them at the high school): session 1 or baseline, sessions 2 and 3 where
      adolescents are provided with answers related to their views to provide highly specific
      feedback regarding their knowledge, risk perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence
      and self-efficacy; sessions 4, 5, 7 and 8 are reinforcement sessions (booster sessions) and
      sessions 6 and 9 are follow-up questionnaires at six and twelve months. The EC-2 receives an
      improved version of Alerta Alcohol (Alerta Alcohol 2.0) using animated videos and new
      gamification strategies. The CC just completes the baseline and the evaluation questionnaires
      and then they are allowed to receive the intervention as well (as a waiting list). To test
      the effectiveness, the primary outcome is BD within 30 days prior to evaluation and alcohol
      use (high-intensity drinking, weekly and any consumption) in the previous week as secondary
      outcomes.
