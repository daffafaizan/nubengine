      clavicle fractures treated at the McGill University Health Centre. Surgeon choice will
      dictate treatment. There is no difference from the current normal therapy choice of each
      individual surgeon. Patients will be offered either operative or conservative management.

      Operative Treatment: Patients with displaced midshaft clavicle fractures will be offered
      operative treatment which involves open reduction and internal fixation with a plate. This is
      the standard treatment for completely displaced fractures in the adult population at our
      Institution based on Level 1 evidence.

      Conservative care: Patients will be treated in a sling for the acute phase of two weeks with
      progressive physiotherapy.
