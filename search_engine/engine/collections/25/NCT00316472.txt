    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study comparing
      niacinamide versus placebo in the reduction of serum phosphorus in hemodialysis patients. A
      determination of baseline laboratory values (serum phosphorus, calcium, albumin, biPTH, uric
      acid, complete blood count (CBC), and an NMR lipid panel) will precede the administration of
      the study drugs. The study will span a period of 21 weeks during which phosphorus levels will
      be checked on a weekly basis. Phosphorus binder dose will remain unchanged unless for safety
      reasons. For the first 8 weeks of treatment, patients will be randomized to either placebo or
      niacinamide. Both medications will be administered with a starting dose of one capsule twice
      per day (BID). Niacinamide and placebo will be formulated in 250 mg capsules. Placebo will be
      packaged to resemble the study drug in all physical attributes. The dose of niacinamide or
      placebo will be increased to 500 mg (2 capsules) BID at week 3 and 750 mg (3 capsules) BID at
      week 5. If hypophosphatemia (< 3.5 mg/dl) is present, then titration will not occur and the
      previous dose will be continued. However, titration will resume in subsequent weeks if the
      serum phosphorus is greater than 3.5 mg/dl. After 8 weeks, patients will undergo a 2 week
      washout period, then crossover from treatment arm to placebo, or vice versa, at week 11.

      At the beginning of week 11, patients will cross over to the other treatment arm (either
      placebo or niacinamide) at one capsule (250 mg) twice per day. Subsequent titration will
      occur at week 13 and week 15. The treatment phase will be completed at the end of week 18. A
      set of labs will be drawn at the start of week 19, followed by a two week washout period.
