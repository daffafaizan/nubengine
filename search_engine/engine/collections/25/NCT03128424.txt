      days post-procedure. An MAE is defined as TLR, amputation of the treated limb or death.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is defined as stent patency as evidenced by a peak
      systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) < 2.5 from DUS obtained within the 12-month visit window with
      no clinically-driven re-intervention within the stented segment.
