      as several large trials of drug therapies have failed to benefit patients. Better
      characterization of these patients is important, and there are open questions regarding
      microvascular disease and remodeling in the HFpEF population. New MRI methods could be ideal
      to better characterize and understand HFpEF and its response to treatments. This project
      seeks to develop, evaluate and apply new MRI methods for high-end perfusion imaging. These
      methods will estimate endo/epi ratios across the cardiac cycle in free-breathing studies,
      which will provide new information about microvascular disease. This is of particular value
      for assessing HFpEF.

      The idea of this project is to combine new techniques for quantitative cardiac perfusion MRI
      imaging that would be ideally suited for answering open questions regarding HFpEF and for
      studying microvascular disease. The methods could potentially also predict patients who might
      respond to particular drug therapies.

      The new techniques include "simultaneous multi-slice" imaging which has not been used this
      way for myocardial perfusion imaging. In particular, we are developing an innovative hybrid
      of the standard saturation pulse and steady state spoiled gradient echo acquisitions. We also
      are developing a new method for using 3D "stack of stars" + 2D slice in the same scan for
      arterial input function assessment to quantify perfusion, and new methods for measuring T1.
