      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using hypofractionated RT in patients with
      stage II-III NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity, if the MTD is reached.

      II. To determine the tumor local control (LC).

      III. To determine the lung cancer disease specific survival (DSS).

      IV. To determine the overall survival (OS).

      V. To assess the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 levels
      as predictive biomarkers for treatment induced tissue injury.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of image-guided hypofractionated RT.

      Patients undergo image-guided hypofractionated RT over 35 minutes 5 days a week for 2 weeks
      followed by 5 fractions of hypofractionated RT boost. Patients also receive standard
      carboplatin and paclitaxel for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months
      for the first 2 years, and then periodically thereafter.
