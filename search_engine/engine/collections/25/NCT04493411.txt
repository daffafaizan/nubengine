      of therapy response in multiple myeloma (MM) using a novel acquisition scheme. WBMRI with
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has demonstrated promising preliminary results for detection
      and response monitoring in MM. While DWI generates high lesion-to-background contrast and
      excellent lesion conspicuity, it suffers from compromised image quality due to geometric
      distortion, particularly at 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a platform which is
      increasingly used in clinical practice. This disadvantage, along with high costs and patient
      dissatisfaction associated with long scan times, have limited wide spread adoption of WBMRI
      with DWI in the clinical practice.

      To overcome these challenges, the investigators have developed an alternative WBMRI
      technique: Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors (DETECT) for
      improved tumor visualization by simultaneously suppressing the confounding signals of fat and
      fluid throughout the body.
