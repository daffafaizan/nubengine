      insufficient fluid intake, and withholding behavior are considered as factors leading to
      constipation.

      Painful defecation is considered a common trigger to faecal retention wich leads to
      reabsorption of fluids and increase in the size and consistency of stools.

      It is often necessary to use laxative therapy to achieve comfortable defecation. PEG-based
      laxatives are considered today the gold standard for treatment of constipation in children.
      PEG formulations differ for composition in inactive ingredients which may have an impact on
      acceptance, compliance and adherence to treatment.
