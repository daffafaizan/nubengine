      cardiovascular disease observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Experimental
      models have shown that hyperuricemia causes hypertension and renin angiotensin system
      activation. In this prospective study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of
      improved hyperuricemia, a minor cardiovascular risk factor, on ED in patients with CKD.
