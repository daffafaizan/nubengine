      antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and methylprednisolone (MePRDL), followed by allogeneic marrow
      transplantation.

      Patients with HLA-nonidentical (5/6 or 4/6) donors and those with a systemic reaction to ATG
      receive the same dosage of myeloablative chemotherapy and rescue. In addition, these patients
      are treated with total-body irradiation, total-lymphoid irradiation, and methotrexate.

      All patients received MePRDL and cyclosporine for graft-versus-host prophylaxis.
