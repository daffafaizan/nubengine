      in both arms at the approved doses and for the approved duration therapy of 1-year. The
      secondary hypothesis will test the role of ticagrelor/clopidogrel alone and together with
      ABSORB BVS implantation in the recovery of vascular function at long-term. This hypothesis is
      tested in the second randomization. The angiographic follow-up will be scheduled at 1 or
      3-year follow-up in order to test the secondary hypothesis either at the moment of the end of
      the antiplatelet therapy or at the moment of scaffold bioresorption.
