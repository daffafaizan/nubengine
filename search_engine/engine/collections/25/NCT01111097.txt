      any solid tumor metastasis (spread) to the brain. Recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs)
      are defined as either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at
      least once or 2) malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the
      brain at least once. They share an increasing incidence, clinical and radiographic
      characteristics, lack of effective therapies, tendency to recur, and poor outcome.
      Importantly, recurrent malignant brain tumor's shared characteristics may be usefully
      exploited by an emerging class of biologic agents called metabolic modulators of which
      Dichloroacetate (DCA) is the drug in the class most thoroughly investigated clinically. DCA's
      mechanism of action and tolerability have been extensively demonstrated in the treatment of
      chronic metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the preciseness of DCA's mechanism of action
      appears to target abnormal tumor cell metabolism.
