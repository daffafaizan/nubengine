    
      I. Study Design: Biomedical

        1. Controls will be used. For the safety of ACES five healthy subjects will be used as
           controls to assess the safety and tolerability of the device. The regular HD treatments
           of each study patient will serve as their own control in assessing the effect of ACES
           use on their HD treatments. The control data are derived from the treatment logs of four
           to eight HD regular treatments taken by the patient.

        2. The study design is an open trial.

        3. No placebo is involved

        4. This is a single center study to be done only at the Medical Center of University of
           Virginia (UVa).

      II. Human Participants Ages: 18 or older Sex: Male and Female Race: All

      Subjects or Patients:

        1. 5 healthy subjects and 20 dialysis patients to complete protocol.

        2. There could be a 50% drop out rate for the dialysis patients.

        3. 30 (Up to 5 healthy subjects and Up to 35 dialysis patients) will be enrolled at all
           sites

        4. All 30 subjects and patients will sign a consent form under this protocol.

        5. The estimated time line for the study is 100% enrollment within 10 months III.
           Statistical Considerations

        1. Is stratification/randomization involved? No

        2. What are the statistical considerations for the protocol? In analyzing the data, if the
           systolic blood pressure (SBP) of a given patient compared with the first blood pressure
           reading after initiating dialysis is larger than the threshold 20 mmHg (condition A) or
           the decrease in mean arterial pressure is larger than 10 mmHg and the development of
           hypotensive symptoms (condition B), this session (hour) will be identified as an IDH
           session (hour). The data may be divided into two groups (one under condition A and one
           under condition B) for further analysis on the impact of the conditions on the
           effectiveness of ACES.

           In our study design, the countermeasure implemented in each "control" session may be
           different. Our study can lead to an answer on whether the use of ACES is more effective
           in alleviating IDH than the "control" countermeasure.

           The researchers will only handle the quantitative data and the analysis of enumeration
           and quantitative data. To assure integrity in and correctness of data analysis, all data
           will be forwarded to a statistician who is not physically involved with the study for an
           independent evaluation.

        3. Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.

           A. On the safety issue: Due to the low compression pressure and no adverse effects seen
           in the use of IAB, we expect that the investigators should not see the development of
           any adverse effect in the current clinical trial. When the investigators carry out 40
           ACES session in Phase II and show no adverse effect, then the likely hood for an adverse
           effect to develop will be at most 2.5%. Even if the occurrence frequency were at 25%, a
           sample size of 16 sessions will be more than adequate to demonstrate the safety
           hypothesis with a confidence better than 99% (i.e. P<0.01).

           B. On the reduction in occurrence frequency. The patients participated in the study will
           have at least 2 episodes in a month. It can add up to an occurrence frequency of 25%.
           This is to say that 20 out of the 80 control sessions will have IDH developed. If the
           occurrence frequency is reduced to 12.5% (i.e. 12 sessions with IDH out of the 80 ACES
           sessions), the data of 80 ACES session will be adequate to show a confidence level of
           99% by the chi square test (P<0.01) that the use of ACES is effective in reducing the
           occurrence frequency. On the other hand, if the frequency estimated from the data of
           Phase II is reduced to 18% (instead of 12.5%), then the data of 80 ACES sessions in
           Phase II will yield a χ2 of about 2.0. With data of 80 more ACES sessions in Phase II,
           the value of χ2 for the same decrease in occurrence frequency may increase to 4 to
           indicate that the reduction in occurrence frequency has a confidence level of 95%
           (P<0.05).

           The above computation analysis has been expanded to examine how test size and the values
           of occurrence rate affect the value of χ2 and subsequently whether the occurrence rate
           is significantly reduced with the use of ACES. The investigators find that the three
           test sizes (80 tests mentioned here, 160 tests and 480 periods mentioned later) set for
           use in the protocol are adequate to carry out the statistical determination.

           Currently the investigators do not have a certain way to predict when IDH will develop.
           Thus, the investigators consider each HD session done on the same patient as
           independent.

        4. The investigators have worked with a retired statistician in designing this protocol.

      IV. Biomedical Research

        1. Healthy subjects:

           In order to fulfill the study statistical requirements, up to five (5) healthy subjects
           will be tested for safety and tolerability of wearing ACES for 3 hours. Each healthy
           individual will then wear the ACES for three consecutive hours in a supine or seated
           position, except for use of the restroom if needed, and assess the measured parameters.

           If no major concerns are identified with this healthy population the use of ACES device
           will be offered for use in dialysis patients who have three or more episodes of IDH in
           the 4 weeks leading up to recruitment.

        2. Dialysis Patients

           Hemodialysis patients at the University of Virginia Kidney Center have their
           hemodialysis done in a seated position (30° to 90°). The investigators will be using the
           ACES device on these patients in a seated position.

           In order to fulfill the study statistical requirements, up to ten (10) ESRD patients on
           HD will be tested for safety and tolerability of wearing ACES during their dialysis
           sessions.

           Screening trial session for Dialysis Patients After the patient reads and signs the
           consent form and passes the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the investigators will
           have him or her to undergo a trial session of ACES. This trial session can be done on
           the same day as the consent form or it can be done on another day that the patient is
           coming for a regular dialysis session. This trial session is designed to find out
           whether the patient can tolerate the compression of the ACES and whether his/her SBP and
           heart rate can be significantly altered by the compression. Over the course of this
           screening trial, the patient will be advised that he can request removal of the ACES
           whenever he/she wishes.

        3. Control & ACES Sessions:

           The patients will undergo a HD treatment as prescribed by their attending nephrologists.
           The investigators expect that the characteristics of these treatments will have the
           following general features:

           • The HD setting can lead to a Kt/V larger than 1.2

           • A procedure or countermeasure will have been prescribed and set up as standard of care
           to deal with the development of IDH.

             -  The measurement of blood pressure and heart rate will be performed by the usual
                dialysis machine for a given patient, providing internal equipment standardization

             -  The blood pressure cuff will be applied to bare skin on the patient's arm

             -  The data obtained for eight regular HD treatments without wearing the ACES will be
                identified as the control data. For each patient, four HD treatment sessions will
                be conducted with the use of ACES in Phase II and four more will be done in Phase
                III if the data of Phase II calls for.

           Preparation to start the hemodialysis with ACES

           • Before the screening test of the patient, the investigators will get the waist
           circumference of the patient. The size of the ACES is chosen from this specification:
           22"~27" (56~68cm)-Small, 28"~33" (71~84cm)-Medium, 34"~40" (86~101cm)-Large, 41"~47"
           (104~119cm)-Extra-Large, 48"~54" (122~137cm)-Extra-Extra-Large 55"~61" (140~155cm).

           • Put on the ACES with its band tips already aligned with the white marking. At this "no
           load" marking, the compression pressure imposed by the ACES is less than 2 mmHg. This
           step is done before the patient is seated and attached to the blood lines.

           • The HD treatment will start as usual.

           During HD Control and ACES session if the patient experiences IDH or SBP drop If the
           study investigators deem that the patient is experiencing symptoms of IDH or sees that
           the SBP drops 20 mm Hg, then a charted course will be used on what countermeasures are
           to be employed.

           Post-dialytic care and data collection • Post dialytic procedure and care will include:

           o Removal of the ACES and one more BP and pulse measurement,

           o Discharge of the patient who is diagnosed as having no PDOH,

           o Whether the patient is asked to come back for another HD treatment the next day,

           o If the patient is classified as one with PDOH, the procedure to discharge the patient
           as prescribed by the physician will be followed. If it is prescribed to take a standing
           up test, it will be done with the ACES on. If the patient is to be sent home, then the
           ACES will be taken off the patient and another standing up test be done. If the patient
           is to be sent to an emergency center, then the physician will make a decision on whether
           to send the patient with the ACES on or with it off.

        4. Events calling for decompression of the ACES.

      If the following complications develop while the ACES is in use the device will be removed •
      A decrease in toe O2 saturation below 90%, • An increase in leg circumference by more than
      10% to indicate leg edema,

      • Pain or cramping in the abdominal area and/or lower extremities being more severe than the
      norm

        -  Vomiting more severe than the norm

        -  Any other threatening complication

        -  The patient requests removal of the device (reason for request will be recorded)

      The study team will investigate whether the complications result from abdominal compression
      imposed by the ACES. If ACES is deemed as the cause, then the ACES will be decompressed. When
      the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) become available
      to Global Monitor, Inc. and is found to be higher than the norm, then a retrospective
      analysis will be made to determine whether the level increase relates to the use of ACES.

      V. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan An adverse event will be considered any undesirable sign,
      symptom or medical or psychological condition even if the event is not considered to be
      related to the investigational drug/device/intervention. Medical condition/diseases present
      before starting the investigational drug/intervention will be considered adverse events only
      if they worsen after starting study treatment/intervention. An adverse event is also any
      undesirable and unintended effect of research occurring in human patients as a result of the
      collection of identifiable private information under the research. Adverse events also
      include any problems associated with the use of an investigational device that adversely
      affects the rights, safety or welfare of patients.

      The symptoms or disease developments described as the exclusion criteria (i.e. beyond the
      first six) will be considered as adverse effect. The symptoms or excessive decrease in SBP,
      for example, that are normally associated with hypotension development and are found to be
      common in HD patients of UVa clinics will be reported but not considered as adverse event and
      not used as a trigger to discontinue the ACES session.

      The adverse event will be reported to FDA in a case report form.
