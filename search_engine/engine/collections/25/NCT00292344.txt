      unformed stools with enteric symptoms) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial
      wherein they were given rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days (R) (n = 102),
      loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool not to exceed 8 mg/day
      for 2 days (L) (n = 104) or both drugs in the same dosage schedule (L/R) (n = 104). The major
      outcome parameter was time from initiation of therapy until passage of the last unformed
      stool before becoming well (TLUS).
