      incidence of cardiovascular disease and reduces the risk of death in the young population.
      Low-intensity interval training increases muscle circulation and improving the uptake of
      oxygen. Both high-intensity circuit training and low-intensity interval training enhance body
      composition, quality of life, functional fitness and decrease body mass index. These
      trainings also motivate participants to continue their exercise. This study will help us
      determine whether high intensity or low-intensity training is more helpful in improving the
      functional strength and weight efficacy in overweight and obese females. As obesity is on the
      rise in modern society, our results will help improve the quality of life of obese and
      overweight females.
