      effectiveness of 2 Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs), Mobile+Group LAMP and Mobile LAMP,
      compared to usual practice. Effectiveness will be assessed by pain functioning over the
      12-month follow-up period using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference score. The
      investigators will test the following primary hypotheses: (1) Mobile LAMP will be more
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by change in the BPI interference score over
      the 12-month follow-up period) compared to usual practice, (2) Mobile+Group LAMP will be more
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by BPI interference score change over the
      12-month follow-up period) compared to usual practice, and (3) Mobile+Group LAMP will be more
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by BPI interference change over the 12-month
      follow-up period) compared to Mobile LAMP without the group component. The investigators will
      test the following secondary hypotheses: (1) Comparison of intervention group with secondary
      outcomes listed below, and (2) primary and secondary hypotheses comparisons will be confirmed
      in gender-specific strata. The primary outcome will be measured as change in BPI interference
      score over the 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported
      measures related to pain, comorbid mental health conditions and function, expected mediators
      of treatment effects, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects and measures captured in
      electronic health records. These outcomes will be assessed at 10 weeks, 6 months and 12
      months. Implementation data will be collected and described, using the guided Reach,
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.
