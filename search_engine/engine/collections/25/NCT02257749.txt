      beyond the first few weeks of injury. There is limited evidence with respect to the best ways
      to treat persistent post-concussion symptoms in youth following concussion. There is a small
      amount of literature that suggests active rehabilitation as a positive intervention for
      promotion of recovery of persistent post-concussion symptoms. However, this approach to
      rehabilitation has yet to be explored using a randomized control trial protocol.

      Therefore, this study aims to answer the following question: Is a 6 week active
      rehabilitation program in combination with a comprehensive education intervention (standard
      care) effective in reducing post-concussive symptoms and improving functional recovery
      compared to receiving comprehensive education intervention alone among youth experiencing
      persistent post-concussion symptoms?

      We hypothesize:

        1. youth ages 10 to 18 years who present with persistent self-reported post-concussion
           symptoms 4 weeks after the initial injury and receive the active rehabilitation
           intervention, will present with decreased post-concussion symptoms at the completion of
           the intervention.

        2. youth ages 10 to 18 years who receive the active rehabilitation intervention, will
           present with more complete functional recovery and increased participation in
           unrestricted physical activity at the completion of the active rehabilitation
           intervention compared to children receiving the comprehensive education intervention
           only
