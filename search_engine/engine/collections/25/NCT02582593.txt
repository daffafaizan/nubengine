      individuals who are at increased risk for transitioning to dementia, particularly those with
      the amnestic variant of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). While waiting for causative cures
      and preventive approaches, investigators are faced with the task of identifying modifying
      therapies that might alter the course or slow down the transition from normal cognition to
      MCI to dementia.

      The proposed study hopes to contribute to this mission by testing the viability of a
      different type of intervention, one involving transcranial delivery of near-infrared (NIR)
      wavelengths (808-904nm). Near-infrared stimulation is safe, non-invasive and appears to
      improve mitochondrial function by promoting increased production of intracellular adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) and possibly improved blood flow. Perhaps most compelling are recent
      findings of reduced beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic Alzheimer's mouse
      models after exposure to real vs sham transcranial NIR stimulation. Preliminary human
      involving traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and young adult populations have also been
      promising in terms of positive effects of NIR on cognition.

      The overall goal of the present study is to learn whether this unconventional NIR stimulation
      approach has potential for improving cognition in older adults. To do so, investigators will
      conduct a randomized sham controlled pilot trial. The intervention will involve six sessions,
      over a 2-week period in which real or sham stimulation is transcranially applied using a
      delivery system that has been FDA-approved as a nonsignificant risk since 2003. Researchers
      hope to learn whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, has positive effects on cognition
      and mood in older adults.
