      postmenopausal breast cancer, with the greatest potential for primary prevention occurring
      during the premenopausal years. However, surprisingly, no study to date has examined the
      effects of a standard behavioral weight loss intervention on breast cancer risk markers in
      premenopausal women. Understanding the effects of weight loss in premenopausal women is a
      critical next step in existing research and will inform the development of future breast
      cancer primary prevention programs. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility
      of recruiting, treating, and retaining 20 overweight/obese women in a 12-week randomized
      control trial examining feasibility and effects of a behavioral weight loss program on breast
      cancer risk markers in premenopausal women. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      a 12-week comprehensive behavioral weight loss program (n=10) or control condition (n=10).
      All women will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment.
