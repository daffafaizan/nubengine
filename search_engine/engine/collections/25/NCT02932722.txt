      control, propofol, or sevoflurane group. Patients in the control group will receive remote
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on their upper arms before anesthetic induction. Patients in
      the propofol or sevoflurane groups will receive RIPC after anesthetic induction using
      propofol or sevoflurane, respectively. In all patients, arterial blood samples will be
      obtained before and after each RIPC. From the samples, human dialysate will be obtained and
      perfused to rat heart through Langendorff apparatus before ischemia-reperfusion injury to the
      rat heart. Infarct size of the sectioned rat heart will be compared among the three -
      control, propofol, and sevoflurane - groups.
