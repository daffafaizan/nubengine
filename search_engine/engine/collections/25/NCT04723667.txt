      is projected to have a three-fold increase to over 150 million by 2050.1 Dementia is
      characterized by progressive deterioration in cognitive functions that interferes an
      individual to live independently.2 It jeopardizes the quality of life of the sufferers and
      their families, and poses tremendous economic burden on health and social systems.4 In 2018,
      the total cost incurred by dementia worldwide was up to US$ 1 billion and it was forecasted
      to double in 2050.5 Since dementia is incurable, efforts to mitigate the burgeoning
      population of dementia should be directed to its prodromal reversible stage, that is, mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI).

      MCI refers to the transitional stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and
      dementia. It is characterized by cognitive decline in a single or multiple cognitive domains
      including memory, executive functions, attention, language and visuospatial skills, but the
      ability to engage in activities of daily living is preserved.6 The global prevalence of MCI
      is 10 to 20% in persons aged 65 or older, and up to 25.9% for those aged above 80.5 Current
      research effort focuses on addressing the cognitive symptoms of persons with MCI (PwMCI),
      least attention was paid to the co-existing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Such
      non-cognitive symptoms, indeed, affect persons in different stages of cognitive impairment,
      there is no exception for MCI.1 NPS is an umbrella term that captures psychological and
      behavioural symptoms, typical psychological symptoms encompass depression, apathy and
      anxiety, which may cluster into a syndrome and precipitate behavioural symptoms such as
      agitation and disinhibition.7 Two systematic reviews8,9 simultaneously reported that up to
      85% of the MCI population are afflicted with at least one of these symptoms, with depression
      being the most prevalent followed by anxiety and irritability. Comparing to those without
      such symptoms, they tend to have poorer quality of life, more severe functional loss, and
      with a fourfold increased risk for progression to dementia.10-12

      Despite of the fact NPS is highly prevalence among PwMCI, effective management with
      comprehensive outcome measurement is yet to be determined. An empowerment-based,
      comprehensive multimodal intervention with MCI-specific outcome measurement on overall NPS is
      warranted. Such intervention should cover skills compensation with transferral into daily
      life, lifestyle reform, strength-based activity, cognitive restructuring and disease-specific
      education.
