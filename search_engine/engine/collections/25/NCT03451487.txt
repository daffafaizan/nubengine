      hepatotoxic adverse effects; suicidal or unintentional overdose of AAP-induced
      hepatotoxicity. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is thought contribute to the responsible
      reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone (NAPQI) of AAP overdose-induced hepatotoxicity.
      Pharmaceutical excipients are inactive ingredients that are added to a pharmaceutical
      compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible response of Panadol®
      (AAP alone) and SafeTynadol® (AAP with various selected excipients combination) formulations,
      while observing the AAP toxic metabolites (AAP-Cys) circumstances change in healthy
      volunteers. According to the current safety data, could be potentially develop
      hepatotoxicity-free AAP new formulation drug.
