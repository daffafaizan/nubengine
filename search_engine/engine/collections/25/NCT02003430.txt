      gynecologic cancers. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) tool which measures
      functional status (including the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL)), among many
      other important geriatric related conditions, was developed by Hurria and colleagues.
      Geriatric assessment variables including functional status predicted for toxicity in older
      patients receiving chemotherapy and surgery for multiple cancer types., 2 We hypothesize that
      I-ADL can be used to predict treatment tolerance in patients of all ages receiving pelvic
      and/or paraaortic region radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies.
