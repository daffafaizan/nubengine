      and emerging evidence suggests that a significant number of children, particularly those with
      darker skin pigmentation, have inadequate levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The
      optimum level of circulating 25(OH)D has not been clearly defined in children, nor is it
      known what functional outcome measures are ideal for defining this level, or if these
      requirements would differ by race. Graded doses of vitamin D3 supplementation will be used in
      this dual-site, 12-week trial. The investigators hypothesize that a dose-response
      relationship will be observed between vitamin D supplementation and intermediate endpoints of
      skeletal health, and that race will modify these responses.
