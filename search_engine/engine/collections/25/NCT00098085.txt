      autologous investigational vaccine (HSPPC-96) from the tumor tissue of patients with
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

      All patients will undergo surgery to remove the tumor and will be followed for recurrence and
      overall survival.

      The primary goal of this trial is to determine if HSPPC-96 can be made from the tumor tissue
      of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

      The secondary goals are to further characterize the safety and efficacy profile, to evaluate
      disease recurrence in patients receiving, and to evaluate overall survival in patients
      receiving HSPPC-96.

      HSPPC-96 is an investigational, immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's own
      tumor, which is collected at the time of surgery. A portion of the tumor tissue is sent to
      Antigenics' manufacturing facility where it will undergo processing to create a vaccine. This
      vaccine may help the patient's immune system attack cancerous cells while leaving healthy
      cells alone.
