      energy in the visible and near infrared spectrum. The LT-300® is designed for the
      ophthalmologist to use in the treatment of the eye with photobiomodulation (PBM), a process
      by which cellular mechanisms are induced by light. PBM is being utilized in many indications,
      such as wound healing, soft tissue injuries, joint pain, myofascial pain, nerve injuries,
      muscle fatigue for temporary improvement in blood flow and reduction in inflammation. The
      mechanism of PBM at the cellular level has been ascribed to the activation of mitochondrial
      respiratory chain components resulting in stabilization of metabolic function and initiation
      of a signaling cascade, which promotes cellular proliferation and cytoprotection. The LT-300®
      will provide a preset treatment of PBM to the subject's eye and retinal tissue through the
      open and closed eyelid.

      Approximately 30 subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus PBM treatment
      with the LT-300 system, or standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus Sham treatment with
      the LT-300 system. Subjects randomized to each group will receive two 3-week treatment
      sessions (9 treatments per session) and follow-up visits extending to one year. The primary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PBM with respect to visual
      and anatomical outcomes of subjects with Dry AMD.
