      determine the actual number of cohorts enrolled and the BIIB014 dose given to each subject.
      Since all enrolled subjects will be receiving BIIB014, this study is being listed as a 1-arm,
      Single Group study (actual study design is dose escalation).

      Participating subjects will be required to reside in the clinical unit for 10 to 14
      consecutive days. Participants will receive 1 oral dose of BIIB014 daily for 8 to 12
      consecutive days. During the study, subjects will undergo 2 PET scans and 1 MRI. Frequent
      blood sample for pharmacokinetic assessments will also be performed.
