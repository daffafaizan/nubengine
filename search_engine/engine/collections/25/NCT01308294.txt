    
      The primary objective of this study is:

        -  to evaluate melanoma antigen specific immune response induced by this vaccination with
           tumor antigenic peptides derived from MAGE-A3 (Melanoma Antigen family A3) (MHCI:
           MAGE-A3.A2 and MHCII: MAGE-A3.DP4), NY-ESO-1 (New York Esophageal squamous cell
           carcinoma antigen-1), Melan A (analog ELA and native EAA) and NA-17A with IMP321
           (ImmuFact)/ LAG-3Ig (Lymphocyte activation gene-3 immunoglobulin-like domains) as
           adjuvant/immunostimulant, formulated with Montanide ISA-51.

        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of this vaccination

      The secondary objective is to document tumor responses in patients following this
      vaccination.
