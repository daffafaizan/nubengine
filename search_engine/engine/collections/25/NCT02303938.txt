      will undergo a home-based exercise program (intervention) or will be assigned to the active
      controle group. Patients in the intervention group will undergo a 6-month home-based exercise
      intervention. An individual exercise prescription will be based on the patients' level of
      aerobic fitness (VO2peak) as measured with cardiopulmonary testing (CPET; on a cycle
      ergometer with ECG and gas exchange measurement) at baseline. Patients will exercise (e.g.,
      running, biking, swimming) three times per week for 6 months. Session duration will vary
      between 20 minutes and 45 minutes. Patients in the active control group will be advised to
      walk regularly based on brochures from 30minutenbewegen.nl.

      All primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0; prior to randomization),
      and at completion of the 6-month exercise intervention (T1), and at a similar time-point for
      patients in the active control group. These will include indicators of feasibility (accrual,
      adherence, compliance and attrition), subjective and objective physical fitness measures,
      neuropsychological performance scores, and self-reported cognitive symptoms and mental
      wellbeing.
