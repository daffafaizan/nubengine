    
      This investigation is designed as a prospective, open, non-comparative, PMCF investigation to
      confirm safety and performance of Avance Solo NPWT System in subjects with traumatic wounds
      (n=34), subacute (e.g., dehisced wounds) wounds (n=34), and flaps and grafts (n=34). This is
      a multi-center study that will take place in approximately 5 European countries. The eligible
      subjects will be both in and out patients and all will be treated with Avance Solo NPWT
      System, for up to 28 days.

      Treatment will be stopped if the wound is considered healed, has a high enough percentage of
      graft take, or enough flap viability by the judgement of the clinicians before the complete
      treatment time (28 days).

      The primary performance endpoint will include assessment of wound progress compared to last
      visit during a maximum 28 days investigation period. Wound progression is determined by the
      Investigator and will be assessed at each follow-up visit and measured by three outcomes:

        -  Deteriorated

        -  No change

        -  Improved
