    
      Patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus with a diagnosis of type B aortic
      dissection or intramural hematoma who do not receive a surgical intervention during their
      index hospitalization, or planned intervention on follow up, and are discharged on medical
      therapy consisting of strict heart rate control and BP control will be included in the study.
      They will be either randomized to standard therapy to measure BP at home (standard of care)
      or intervention arm consisting of Withings Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, which will
      transmit BP recordings from smartphone to MyChart/EPIC (test arm). All patients will first
      receive a 24 hour ambulatory monitor regardless of treatment assignment to establish baseline
      BP pattern. Following this patients randomized to intervention arm will utilize their
      Withings Blood Pressure Monitor. Providers on the study team will then adjust the patient's
      hypertensive medications to ensure their BP is below a systolic goal of 120 mmHg utilizing
      downloaded recordings available in the electronic medical record.

      The primary clinical endpoint is the change in mean 24 hour systolic blood pressure between
      the start of the study and the end of the study period (4-week period). Secondary outcomes
      will include the number of patients able to achieve a therapeutic systolic blood pressure of
      120 mmHg with both mean BP cuff and in office visit at end of 4 week period, increase in size
      as measured by computed tomography (CT) scan of the aorta, hospitalization or emergency room
      (ER) visits for symptoms from dissection or uncontrolled hypertension, hospitalization or ER
      visits for hypotension, all-cause mortality, and need for surgical intervention (open or
      endovascular).
