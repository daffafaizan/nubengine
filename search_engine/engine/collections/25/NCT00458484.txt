      Primary

        -  To evaluate and compare the clinical safety of utilizing four different schemes of
           radiosurgical ablative techniques for treating poor surgical candidates with renal
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic efficacy of four different schemes
           of radiosurgical ablation of renal tumors in poor surgical candidates.

      Serum Blood Marker Objective:

        -  To determine if serum markers collected before and after radiation may give a predictive
           indication of tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients undergo placement of 2-3 fiducial markers in or near the renal tumor. Patients then
      undergo 4 fractions of stereotactic radiosurgery in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Treatment may repeat at 6 months if tumor is still present.

      After radio-surgery, follow-up will be done at 1 , 3 and 6 months and then every 6 months
      post radiosurgery for a total of 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
