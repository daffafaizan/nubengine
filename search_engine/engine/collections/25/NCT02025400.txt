      candidates for a knee or shoulder orthopedic outpatient physical therapy referral were
      randomized to a 6-week treatment course of either PT or eRehab. Patients were evaluated for
      outcome scores (KOOS or DASH), pain NRS-11 scores, patient subjective outcomes and cost of
      treatment.
