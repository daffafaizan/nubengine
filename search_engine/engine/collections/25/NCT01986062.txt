    
      This is a dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in
      approximately 100 pediatric patients (aged 6 to 12 years) with ADHD. Eligible patients will
      enroll in the study to take open-label AR11 twice daily and undergo dose optimization
      activities for 8 weeks. Patients who achieve a stable dose during the dose optimization
      period will continue participation and will be randomized to take double-blind medication
      (AR11 or placebo) orally twice daily for 1 week. At the end of the first double-blind
      treatment period, patients will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms in a laboratory classroom
      setting utilizing SKAMP and PERMP assessments. At the end of the second double blind
      treatment period, patients will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms in a second laboratory
      classroom setting utilizing SKAMP and PERMP assessments.
