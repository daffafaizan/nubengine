      orthopaedic procedures, but its effectiveness (like the effectiveness of many surgical
      operations) has never been proven in prospective trials. The evidence supporting the use of
      arthroscopy in treatment algorithms for knee OA comes largely from case series and cohort
      studies. These studies have shown that about 50% of patients report pain relief following the
      procedure. Predictors of poor outcome following arthroscopy include marked mal-alignment,
      restricted range of motion, advanced radiographic changes, and prior surgery. Improved
      outcomes are predicted by preoperative mechanical symptoms caused by loose bodies, meniscal
      tears, or radiographic evidence of mild articular degeneration.

      The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial.

      Each patient will undergo a preoperative MRI of their affected knee joint to identify
      existing pathology (e.g. meniscal tears, loose bodies, chondral flaps). The results of the
      MRI will not be revealed to physicians, patients or data collectors. This will ensure that we
      have information on the existing joint pathology within each group and that prognostic
      variables between groups were sufficiently balanced (i.e. comparable rates of similar
      pathology per group). The primary outcome measure is self-reported quality of life (WOMAC).
      Secondary measures include self-reported functional ability (LEFS), swelling, pain and
      frequency of analgesic use (patient diary), and general health (SF-36). Assessments will take
      place preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
