    
      This clinical investigation is designed to assess the workflow feasibility of FLASH
      radiotherapy treatment in a clinical setting, as well as the toxicities, and pain relief when
      used to treat bone metastasis(-es) in the extremities (excluding feet, hands, wrists). FLASH
      radiotherapy has been shown in preclinical studies to cause less injury to surrounding normal
      tissues during radiation treatment, while still having similar tumor cell killing. Patients
      at least 18 years of age with painful bone metastases located in the limbs will be considered
      for the study. These patients represent an ideal population for a feasibility study of FLASH
      radiotherapy as they are known to benefit from the palliative effects of radiotherapy using
      single dose radiation regimens of 8Gy which is what is being used in this investigation.
      After treatment, patients will be assessed for pain response as well as any adverse
      side-effects of radiation. The workflow feasibility of the treatment will also be evaluated.
