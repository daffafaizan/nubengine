    
      This is a phase II signal-searching study in a range of tumor types with the potential to
      identify novel tumor indications for combination therapy with olaparib that can subsequently
      be explored in dedicated studies. Patients will be enrolled in this study based on molecular
      markers from genetic profiling performed on their tumors prior to study entry (outside of
      protocol). The trial will also identify genetic determinants of response and resistance.

      Patients with tumors harboring damaging mutations in Homologous - DNA repair (HDR) genes or
      mutations such as ATM, CHK2, MRN (MRE11/NBS1/RAD50), CDKN2A/B and APOBEC will be treated with
      olaparib or olaparib and AZD6738. Enrollment to the olaparib monotherapy arm will be
      completed prior to commencement of enrollment to the olaparib and AZD6738 arm. Patients with
      tumors harboring IDH1/IDH2 mutations will be treated with olaparib. Patients with tumors
      harboring either TP53 or KRAS mutations or mutations in KRAS and TP53 will be treated with
      AZD1775 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT, or ARID1A mutations
      or other molecular aberrations leading to dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway will be
      treated with AZD5363 plus olaparib.
