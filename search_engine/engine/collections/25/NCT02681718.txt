      hyperglycemia (defined as Hemoglobin-A1C (A1C) at or above 9%) among adults with diabetes.
      Patients from a safety-net hospital will be randomized into three groups: 1) a control group,
      2) an intervention providing diabetes self-care text messages, or 3) an intervention using
      community health workers to provide diabetes education and linkage to care. Secondary
      objectives include increasing diabetes knowledge, improving diabetes self-management, and
      increasing use of primary care (i.e., make one visit to the physician in 6 months) among the
      intervention participants. A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the most appropriate
      way to reduce the burden of uncontrolled diabetes.
