      bond between the resins restorations with the dental substrates, but they have mechanism of
      action different.

      The success of resin composite restorations is reliant upon adhesion to the underlying tooth
      via adhesive systems. The mechanism of adhesion to enamel and dentine could be involved for
      one hand, the etching the substrates with 30-40% phosphoric acid, followed by the application
      of a primer and subsequently an adhesive resin 3 steps etch-and- rinse approach or 2 steps
      when to combine the primer and adhesive into one bottle. For another hand, the self- etch
      systems with acid monomers in their primer, allow conditioning the surface without phosphoric
      acid step. So, they consist of either a self-etching primer accompanied by an adhesive resin
      applied as a subsequent step (2 steps) or a self-etch adhesive, which does not require a
      separate primer (1 step).
