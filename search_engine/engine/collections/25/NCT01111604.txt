    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in participants
      with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with 1 of 3 modified FOLFOX-6 (folinic acid
      [FA] + fluorouracil [5-FU] + oxaliplatin [mFOLFOX-6])-based regimens, as second-line therapy.

      During 2010, there has been an identified shortage of injectable folinic acid (FA) in the
      United States. Levo-folinic acid (LFA) will be allowed as a substitute for FA in the
      mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen in circumstances in which FA is not available, to facilitate
      continuity of participant care.
