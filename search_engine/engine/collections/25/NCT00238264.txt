      Primary

        -  Determine the marginal-failure rate in young patients with low-grade gliomas treated
           with reduced-field conformal radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival rates
           of young patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate MIB-1 labeling index with progression-free survival and overall survival of
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo reduced-field conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline or 6 weeks after completion of study treatment and
      then at 2 and 5 years (closed as of 10/27/2010).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
