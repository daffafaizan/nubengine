    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ATR kinase inhibitor BAY1895344
      (BAY 1895344) with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity by overall response rate (ORR), progression-free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      II. Determine the response and clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response +
      stable disease) of BAY 1895344 with FOLFIRI in colorectal and gastric/gastroesophageal
      cancers.

      III. Evaluate tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      damage signaling in the context of the chemotherapy backbone alone and when combined with BAY
      1895344.

      IV. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan.

      V. Evaluate the PK profile of BAY 1895344. VI. Evaluate the relationship between ATM status
      by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical efficacy of the BAY 1895344/FOLFIRI combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the exposure-response relationship between drug exposures and toxicity and
      response, and UGT1A1 genotype.

      II. Evaluate the relationship between tumor mutations and clinical efficacy of the BAY
      1895344/FOLFIRI combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BAY 1895344, irinotecan, and fluorouracil with
      fixed-dose leucovorin followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive BAY 1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and
      irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV over 46 hours,
      and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 day in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year or until their disease gets worse or they begin a new treatment for
      their cancer.
