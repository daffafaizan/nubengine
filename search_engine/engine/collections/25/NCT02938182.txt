      underlying mechanisms of association between the right-to-left shunts (RLS) and migraine may
      concern with platelet aggregation and paradoxical embolization. In the present study,
      migraineurs without taking prophylactic medicines regularly will be given only clopidogrel 75
      mg daily for three months. Migraineurs who are unresponsive to at least two commonly applied
      preventive medications, clopidogrel 75 mg daily will be added to his/her existing
      prophylactic migraine regimen for three months. Patients will be followed up at the third
      month and the sixth month for headache frequency, attack duration of headache, migraine
      disability assessment scale（MIDAS）scores, headache impact test（HIT-6）scores and visual
      analogue scale（VAS）scores. Investigators will evaluate the changes of these measurements
      between baseline and the follow-up time. The aim of the study is to evaluate the prophylactic
      effectiveness of clopidogrel for migraineurs with RLS.
