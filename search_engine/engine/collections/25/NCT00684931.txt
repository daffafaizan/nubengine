      motor hyperactivity. Morphological neuroimaging studies in ADHD children have revealed
      cerebellar abnormalities, however data in adults regarding cerebellum alterations are scarce.
      In this study we will analyse the conectivity of the cerebellum of adults ADHD patients. We
      will use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique, and morphological data will be compared
      with the neuropsychological status.
