      study. Subjects will first undergo cryosurgery of all clinically apparent AK lesions, limited
      to the face or balding scalp. Three weeks after cryosurgery, subjects will then be randomized
      (1:1 according to standard randomization tables) and directed to apply either Carac 0.5%
      cream or placebo cream (Cetaphil Cream) to the face or balding scalp at bedtime for seven
      consecutive days, washed off each following morning. Each does of study cream will be applied
      at approximately the same time of day and will remain on the skin for approximately eight
      hours. Subject evaluation, Investigator Global Assessments, Quality of Life lesion counts and
      photography shall be performed at Baseline. At Week 3, study drug will be dispensed and the
      global assessments and assessment of improvement will be performed. A Medication Tolerability
      Assessment will occur at Week 4 when the study drug will be returned. Investigator Global
      Assessment, lesion count, Global Assessment of Improvement and Quality of Life will be
      measured at Week 8 and Week 26 (or end of study). Photography will be done at Week 26 or end
      of study.
