    
      This is a phase 1b/2 open-label pilot study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of
      nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma.

      An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Multiple cycles
      may be administered until the patient is withdrawn from therapy.

      Overall response rates as well as individual categories of response (complete response-CR,
      partial response-PR, stable disease-SD and progressive disease-PD) will be determined using
      RECIST 1.1. Time-to-event endpoints, including progression free survival (PFS) and OS
      (overall survival) will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Evaluation of stable
      disease at 9 weeks will also be assessed. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using
      the NCI CTCAE (v4.0, May 2009).
