      grade provide rich information about prognosis and enable to stage the disease. As in any
      other oncological pathology, stage of disease at diagnosis is the major determining factor
      for estimating survival. Ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation is performed in this
      study, in patients with stage I-II (TNM) after the neoplasia is treated (surgical removal of
      the tumor) prior to systemic therapy, when indicated.

      Among young women there is a greater incidence of basal type tumors and HER2 (human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2), which do not always express hormone receptors. In early stages of
      the disease, the controlled ovarian stimulation procedure, after removal of the tumor, has
      not revealed any worsening in the prognosis of the disease, in terms of overall survival and
      disease-free survival (absence of local or distant recurrence).

      It is a study that aims to collect data retrospectively from 2008 to 31 December 2015. To
      this end, we will collect the follow-up data, up to 5 years for patients from 2008, 2009 and
      2010. Four years for patients in 2011, 3 years for 2012, 2 years for 2013, one year for those
      included until 31 December 2014 and patients followed until 31 December 2015. Each patient is
      called in order to request data authorization, to complete and track information.
