    
      An interventional randomised control trial that will include 374 participants who will be
      healthcare workers at variable risks of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while managing patients both
      suspected and confirmed with COVID-19 infection.Each participant will undergo detailed
      clinical evaluation to confirm eligibility, complete blood count, retinal imaging and ECG
      rhythm lead at baseline. A nasopharyngeal swab for reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) will also be taken. The enrolled participants will be randomised to two
      treatment arms with the experimental arm receiving Tab.Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400mg twice a
      day on day 1 followed by 400mg weekly for 11 weeks. The placebo comparator arm will receive 2
      tablets twice daily on day 1 followed by 2 tablets weekly for 11 weeks. The participants will
      be followed up via phone call weekly to ensure drug compliance, occurrence of drug-related
      side effects or respiratory symptoms. The final visit 4 will mark the end of study at 12
      weeks from randomisation when a repeat nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR will be
      taken.The primary outcome measures will be prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined
      by a negative RT-PCR in the experimental arm at the end of 12 weeks and HCQ safety as
      determined by occurrence of adverse events.
