      to blast waves during tactical training. Subjects participating in this study will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Device wearing during the tactical training or 2)
      Non-device wearing during the tactical training. The helmets of all participants will be
      outfitted with an accelerometer which will measure the magnitude of every concussive blast
      wave sustained by the subject. Effectiveness of the device will be determined via differences
      in brain MRI and EEG, vision and hearing testing prior to and following standardized
      breaching and diversionary device scenario training.
