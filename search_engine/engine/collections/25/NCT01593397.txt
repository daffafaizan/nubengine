      metabolism, elimination, and effect. We will differentiate the insulin resistant phenotype
      amongst obese individuals on the basis of both laboratory (fasting insulin, triglycerides,
      fasting glucose) analysis, and quantitative and qualitative adiponectin expression. We will
      determine the effect of insulin resistance on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      anesthetic induction agents and opioids, using propofol and fentanyl as examples.
