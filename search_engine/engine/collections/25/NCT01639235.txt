      the confined workspace of commercial aircraft prior to the ban of cigarette smoking is
      responsible for long-term damage on the health of nonsmoking flight attendants. We will
      compare the data collected from our pre-ban flight attendant participants to age-matched,
      nonsmoking controls from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)
      database. The results of our study should permit us to determine if SHS exposure is the cause
      of long-term increased cardiovascular morbidity and risk, as well as increased susceptibility
      to respiratory illnesses.
