      Primary

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel,
           cisplatin, and radiotherapy improves overall survival compared with paclitaxel,
           cisplatin, and radiotherapy alone in patients with esophageal cancer treated without
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy
           improves local control by increasing the clinical complete response and decreasing local
           recurrence in these patients.

        -  To evaluate adverse events in these patients.

        -  To evaluate endoscopic complete response rates in these patients.

        -  To evaluate if the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy
           improves the Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) score of the Functional Assessment of
           Cancer Therapy - Esophagus (FACT-E) quality of life tool.

        -  To evaluate the quality-adjusted survival of each treatment arm using EQ-5D if the
           primary endpoint supports the primary hypothesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (adenocarcinoma vs squamous), cancer lesion size (< 5 cm vs â‰¥ 5 cm), and disease status of
      celiac nodes (present vs absent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
