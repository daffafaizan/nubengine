    
      Analysis of cCTA and OCT was conducted under blind in independent organizations.

      After unblinding the cCTA and OCT case identification number, the OCT image was co-registered
      to cCTA data.

      After co-registration of cCTA and OCT lesion locations, the minimal lumen area (MLA) was
      detected with both modalities. FFROCT was calculated using OCT-updated models in which
      cCTA-based lumen geometry was replaced by OCT-based lumen geometry.

      Lesions were grouped according to their severity of calcification (using Agatston score) and
      minimum lumen diameter.
