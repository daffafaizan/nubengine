      involuntary actions, which will increase the neuronal activity in order to maintain body
      homeostasis. Stress is one of the most common causes of migraines. When it occurs for a
      prolonged period, there will be an over-stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system that
      will lead to dysautonomia, generating the rapid consumption of the neurotransmitter
      norepinephrine at the same time that adenosine, dopamine. It is believed that before the
      headache, the levels of norepinephrine are elevated, causing a vasoconstriction of
      extracranial vascularization, followed by a vasodilation resulting from the release of the
      other hormones previously mentioned, thus instituting the painful phase of migraine. Thus,
      migraine acts on the vascular system through changes in its homeostasis, predisposing the
      occurrence of future ischemic and/or hemorrhagic episodes to the brain and cardiac levels.
      The disruption of this system with the multifactorial mechanisms of migraine manifestation
      can then result in an increased risk of coronary heart disease and other changes in cardiac
      functioning, acquiring highly harmful potential for the human body. The interest in this
      study started in view of the numerous uncertainties within the scientific sphere regarding
      the possible systemic impacts caused by migraines after detailed research on the subject. The
      same becomes relevant, as it will contribute to the development of knowledge about headaches.
