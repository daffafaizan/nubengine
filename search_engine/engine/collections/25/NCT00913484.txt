        1. To compare the efficacy of disulfiram versus placebo for the treatment of buprenorphine
           maintained patients with concurrent opioid and cocaine dependence. Study hypothesis 1 is
           that disulfiram is superior to placebo.

        2. To evaluate whether dopamine-B-hydroxylase (DBH) genotypes associated with high,
           intermediate or low enzyme activity predict responses to disulfiram treatment of cocaine
           use in buprenorphine treated subjects. Study hypothesis 2 is that disulfiram efficacy is
           higher in subjects with low DBH compared to subjects with high DBH.

        3. To explore whether baseline measures of alcohol use predict response to disulfiram.
           Study Hypothesis 3 is that the effects of disulfiram on cocaine use are independent of
           the severity of baseline alcohol use.
