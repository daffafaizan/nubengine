      with T1D to be randomly (1:1) assigned to receive islet either into the liver through the
      portal venous circulation (standard procedure; arm A, n=6) or directly into the BM at the
      level of the iliac crest (arm B, n=6). Patients will be selected from those eligible for
      islet Tx based on local practice and guidelines.
