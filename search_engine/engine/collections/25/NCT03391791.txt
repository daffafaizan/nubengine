    
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who
      have received lentivirus-mediated genetically engineered T Cell Receptors in an Adaptimmune
      sponsored clinical trial. The study is designed in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance on
      gene therapy trials.

      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Adaptimmune clinical studies. The study will include
      subjects who have received various T cell receptors including but not limited to
      MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T and MAGE-A4ᶜ¹º³²T. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation (i.e., new medical
      history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer
      therapies and investigational products in other clinical studies) with careful attention to
      adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or lentivirus-induced diseases. Blood
      samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of cells with lentiviral vector
      sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and chemistry and
      hematology laboratory assessments. Subjects will be followed for survival.
