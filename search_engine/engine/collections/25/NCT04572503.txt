    
      A prospective analytic study will be conducted on a total number of 20 patients presented
      with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea for whom Barbed suture modified anterior
      palatoplasty will be performed.

      Surgical Steps

        -  Procedure will be performed under general anesthesia

        -  Bilateral tonsillectomy will be performed.

        -  Then, the inferior portion between upper 2/3 and inferior 1/3 of palatopharyngeus muscle
           will be partially released

        -  Then, a rectangular shaped strip of mucosa and the underlying submucosa will be removed
           at the center of the soft palate consisting of 0.5-0.7 mm in length and with width
           corresponding to the tonsillar fossae distance.

        -  Then,the stripped area will be sutured by single resorbable polydioxanone barbed
           bidirectional size 0 monofilament suture by introducing one needle at the center point
           of the wound then will be passed laterally within the palate, turning around
           pterygomandibular raphe till it comes out at the most superior part of the raphe at one
           side the thread will be pulled until it hangs at the central transition zone which is a
           free zone present between the two directions of the thread.

        -  Then, again the needle will be passed back through the tonsillectomy bed and then this
           suture will be suspended around the raphe again; a gentle traction is then applied on
           the thread only and no knots are taken.T

        -  The opposite side will be done by the same way.

        -  Finally, each thread will be come out at the raphe of the same side, for locking of the
           stitches and looseness prevention; a superficial stitch in the opposite direction is
           taken, and then the thread is cut while bushing the tissue downward for more traction.
