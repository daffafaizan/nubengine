      is a constituent of hops (Humulus lupulus). Hops and its constituents have a long history of
      use for a variety of conditions. However, knowledge is limited regarding the measurable
      biological markers of human exposure, and the role of xanthohumol metabolism by
      microorganisms present in the gut. This information is necessary for the development of
      xanthohumol as a potential therapeutic intervention in conditions such as inflammatory bowel
      disease.
