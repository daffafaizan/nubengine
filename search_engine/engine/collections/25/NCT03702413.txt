    
      In the American Heart Association guideline 2018, endovascular therapy (EVT) has been
      strongly recommended as class of recommendation (COR) I for for the patients with acute
      cerebral large vessel occlusion (LVO), the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 6
      or more. The efficacy of EVT for the patients with low ASPECTS remains unclear.

      This study is a prospective, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), Japanese, two-arm,
      randomized, controlled, post-market study to compare the effectiveness of endovascular
      treatment as compared to best medical treatment alone for acute large vessel occlusion
      patients with large ischemic core (ASPECTS 3-5 or DWI-ASPECTS 3-5).

      Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized for the Intention to treat
      analysis set. The randomization will be stratified by treatment institutes, patient's age
      (less than 75 years old or not), time from symptom onset (0-2 hours or more than 2 hours),
      and stroke severity (NIHSS 21 or more/less than 21), and administration of rt-PA.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the
      following two treatment arms: Arm 1: best medical treatment Arm 2: best medical treatment
      plus endovascular treatment

      Primary outcome of this study is to investigate efficacy of endivascular treatment in acute
      stroke patients with large ischemic core (ASPECTS 3-5 or DWI-ASPECTs 3-5) as compared to best
      medical treatment alone.

      Approximately 40 sites in Japan Patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) based on
      focal occlusion in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and/or the
      intracranial segment of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA), determined by Magnetic
      Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA), and who meet all
      eligibility criteria will be considered for study enrollment.
