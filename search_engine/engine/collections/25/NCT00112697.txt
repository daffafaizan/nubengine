    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with unresectable
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with radiotherapy and docetaxel in
           combination with either fluorouracil or cisplatin as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy to the celiac area once daily 5 days a week for 6
           weeks. Patients also receive docetaxel IV weekly and fluorouracil IV daily for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive docetaxel as in arm I. Patients also
           receive cisplatin IV weekly for 6 weeks.

      In both arms, patients experiencing disease progression after completion of chemoradiotherapy
      may receive additional courses of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
