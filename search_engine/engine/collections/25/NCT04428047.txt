      their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one the 2 cohorts
      described below:

      Cohort A (43 patients): Non-oropharyngeal HNSCC, or Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
      (SCC) that are human papillomavirus (HPV) negative, or Oropharyngeal SCC that are HPV
      positive and smoker â‰¥20 pack year (PY).

      A Minimax two-stage Simon design will be used with an unacceptable rate of pathological
      response of 30% or less and a hypothesized actual pathological response rate of 50% or more.

      In the first stage, 28 patients will be accrued. If the observed number of patients with a
      pathological response is 7 or less, then the study for the cohort A will conclude to
      inefficacy and patient recruitment in this cohort will be stopped.

      Cohort B (16 patients): Oropharyngeal SCC that are HPV positive and non-smoker or smoker <20
      PY (former or active).

      The design for this cohort will be a single-stage design.

      All trial-related interventions will be strictly similar for these 2 cohorts.
