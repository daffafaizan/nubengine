      divided into two groups with FMR and NAFL according to the random number table. One side of
      the face was treated with FMR device and the other side was treated with NAFL device.
      Subjective and objective adverse reactions were recorded during the operation. Subjective
      adverse reactions were recorded after each treatment. The VAS score of patient satisfaction
      and the blind method score of standard photo observer were used for subjective evaluation,
