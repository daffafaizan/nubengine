    
      Patients who have criteria of sepsis, with normal renal function on admission will undergo
      Renal Doppler Ultrasound examination to measure Renal resistive index.

      Patients will be divided into 2 groups:

        1. Group (A) patients with renal resistive index between 0.6 and 0.7 (normal RRI).

        2. Group (B) patients with renal resistive index more than 0.7 (high RRI).
