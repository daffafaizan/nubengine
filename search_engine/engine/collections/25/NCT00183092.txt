      neurodegenerative disease with a mean duration of about eight months. Beyond the debilitating
      cognitive and motor deficits that accompany CJD, the difficulty in treating behavioral and
      mood disturbances and the rapidity of its course compound its tragedy. Recent results from
      experiments show that, at physiological concentrations, the anti-malarial drug quinacrine
      permanently clears abnormal prion proteins from cell culture. The demonstrated efficacy of
      quinacrine in cell culture, its relative safety and well known side-effects in the clinical
      setting, and the universal fatality of CJD justify quinacrine as an immediate candidate for
      the treatment of CJD.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of the medication quinacrine
      on survival in sporadic CJD (sCJD). This will be accomplished by bringing approximately 60
      patients with probable or definite sCJD over approximately three years to UCSF for evaluation
      and initiation of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled (delayed treatment start)
      treatment study of quinacrine. Each patient will have a 50:50 chance of being placed on
      quinacrine or placebo upon study enrollment; however, all patients will be offered quinacrine
      after two months. Prior to study enrollment, patients will have a comprehensive clinical
      assessment to confirm the diagnosis of sCJD. Participants will come to UCSF for initial
      evaluation, potential study enrollment and, if possible, return to UCSF for follow-up at two
      and twelve months. Patients will receive telephone follow-up (every 2 weeks for the first two
      months and monthly thereafter) and local blood and testing to monitor for possible medication
      toxicity.
