      Primary

        -  Compare the objective response rate at 6 weeks in women with brain metastases secondary
           to breast cancer treated with radiotherapy with vs without temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the tolerability.

        -  Compare the duration of response.

        -  Compare local progression-free survival.

        -  Compare overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo isocentric radiotherapy to the brain 5 times a week for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive oral temozolomide once
           daily for 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 6 months and then every 6
      months for 2 years.
