      enhancing muscle function by additional cutaneous afferent stimulation. The objective of this
      study was to analyze the effect of KT on countermovement jump (CMJ) and 20-m sprints
      immediately and 24 hours after its application on the quadriceps and gluteus maximus. A total
      of 37 male soccer players (19.7 Â± 0.9 years old) were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups:
      experimental group: KT activation (KTact), placebo group: sham tape (KTst), and control group
      (CG). Participants performed a 30-minute preliminary warm-up, after which they conducted CMJ
      and 20-m sprint tests. These tests were repeated later (with KT application or not) and after
      24 hours.
