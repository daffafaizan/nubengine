      and autism spectrum disorder.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the beneficial effect of wet versus dry
      therapeutic body wraps through an exploratory randomized controlled open label blinded
      outcome assessment approach.

      The primary objective is the comparison of change in ABC irritability scores from baseline to
      3 months between the two groups. According to the potential recruitment, we plan to recruit
      30 subjects in each group. This sample size could allow us to detect a minimum effect size of
      0.74 between the 2 groups (considered large in literature) with a power of 80% (two-sided
      test and type I error of 5%).

      As described elsewhere, wet or dry session will be organized through twice-a-week sessions
      for a 3-month duration.

      Comparison in primary outcome (ABC irritability score) between the 2 groups will be performed
      using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for the baseline value. The standardized
      difference (effect size) will be computed taking into account the adjustment for baseline and
      its 95% confidence interval will be estimated using a bootstrap resampling. The validity of
      the ANCOVA model will be checked by examining the model residuals.

      The same methodology will be used for the secondary outcomes.
