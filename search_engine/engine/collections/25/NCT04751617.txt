    
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared, causing a wide range of
      symptoms, mainly respiratory infection. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly over
      several months, affecting patients across all age groups and geographic areas. The disease
      has a diverse course; patients may range from asymptomatic to those with respiratory failure,
      complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on
      quality of life, body composition and respiratory function in patients with a history of
      COVID-19.

      The patients after COVID-19 will be included in the pulmonary rehabilitation protocol. The
      duration of rehabilitation will depend on the patient's condition: from 7 to 14 days.

      Measurements:

        -  quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF)

        -  body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, BC-420 MA, Tanita)

        -  weight, height and BMI

        -  spirometry (Spirometr PNEUMO, abcMED)

        -  diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (LUNGTEST 1000)

        -  morphology (CRP, D-Dimer, WBC) and gasometry (pCO2, pO2)

        -  chest computed tomography (CT).

      These parameters will be recorded before the first day of rehabilitation (baseline), after
      completion of rehabilitation protocol, and three months after completion the rehabilitation
      protocol. A change in evaluated parameters will be assessed.

      This will be a prospective, interventional, non-randomized study. All patients will be
      enrolled by Podkarpackie Center for Lung Diseases in Rzesz√≥w.
