      excellent tolerability and even efficacy at weekly intravenous doses as low as 80-120 mg/m2
      over 4 consecutive weeks. These clinical results confirm experiments laboratory studies.
      Laboratory studies using Veltuzumab administered subcutaneously showed potent activity based
      on B-cell depletion. The current study's goal is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing
      schedule of veltuzumab can be established in patients with NHL or CLL
