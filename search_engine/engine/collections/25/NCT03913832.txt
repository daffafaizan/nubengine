    
      A prospective, randomized, multi-centre study in subjects with small vessels, i.e. at least
      one de-novo lesion in a small vessel (≤2.5mm). Vessel size will be determined first by QCA
      on-line (screening, pre-procedure). If, based on QCA on-line the vessel size pre-procedure is
      ≤2.5mm and following a successful pre-dilatation (i.e. no angiographic dissections type CDEF
      and TIMI>2), the subject will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to Magic Touch or SeQuent Please
      Neo. OCT will be performed post pre-dilatation (guidance) prior to drug coated balloon (DCB)
      treatment. The DCB balloon size will be selected based on OCT measurements.
