      For example the proton pump inhibitors decrease the absorption of some protease inhibitors
      used in HIV treatment or of some oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in oncology. Proton
      pump inhibitors increase the pH in the stomach and might therefore decrease the solubility of
      other drugs with decreased absorption as a consequence.

      Boceprevir (BOC) is an Hepatitis C (HCV) NS3 serine protease inhibitor that has recently
      received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The drug substance is
      slightly soluble in water and administration with food increases the oral bioavailability of
      BOC relative to the fasted state, by 40% to 60% based on AUC.

      Omeprazole (OME) is the most frequently used proton pump inhibitor. It is the second most
      prescribed drug in The Netherlands, with 5 million prescriptions a year.

      OME is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and is known to induce CYP1A2 and inhibit CYP2C19.
      BOC is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and is not metabolised by CYP1A2 or CYP2C19. No
      interaction on metabolism of BOC is expected. However, an increase of OME levels may be
      expected due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by BOC.

      As proton pump inhibitors are widely used it is relevant to know if a drug-drug interaction
      between proton pump inhibitors and BOC exists which might influence the bioavailability of
      BOC.

      This study is designed to determine the effect of multiple dose omeprazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of boceprevir and vice versa.

      Furthermore, the safety of steady state boceprevir combined with multiple dose omeprazole
      will be evaluated.
