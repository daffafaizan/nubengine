      using two different exercises, treadmill and bicycle. Walking and cycling present the most
      commonly used physical activities which are applicable to most individuals on a daily basis.
      The investigators aim to demonstrate that individual changes of pulse pressure during these
      types of exercise can be assessed in cfLVAD patients.

      In a feasibility study (work package 2) the investigator will enroll 6 cfLVAD patients to
      perform home-based physical activity programs including walking a defined number of steps per
      day with a predefined speed and cycling with a predefined power [watt] on a bicycle
      ergometer. The performance of the patients will be monitored over seven days using a wearable
      activity device.
