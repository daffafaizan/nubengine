      open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with eyedrops; rather, these studies suggest that more effective
      control of glaucomatous damage can be obtained by immediate filtration surgery. In addition,
      increased attention to the impact of therapy on health-related quality of life has added
      another consideration in deciding upon appropriate treatment of such patients.

      The Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS), a randomized, controlled clinical
      trial, is being conducted to determine whether patients with newly diagnosed OAG are best
      managed by the conventional approach of topical pharmacologic agents or by immediate
      filtration surgery. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either a stepped medication
      treatment regimen or filtration surgery to control their OAG. Sample size requirements
      indicated that 300 patients were needed for each treatment approach; a total of 607 patients
      were ultimately recruited for the CIGTS.

      Patients randomized to the medication treatment arm are receiving a stepped regimen of
      topical medications, beginning with a single agent (typically a beta blocker), with
      additional medications added upon documented lack of intraocular pressure control or evidence
      of progressive visual field loss. If medications fail to control the patient's OAG, a series
      of treatment steps begin with argon laser trabeculoplasty and conclude with trabeculectomy.

      In the surgical treatment arm, patients underwent immediate trabeculectomy and, with
      documented failure, proceed to argon laser trabeculectomy, then conclude with medications.
      Patients, rather than eyes, are randomized to the two treatment arms; if both eyes are
      eligible for treatment, the treatment course for both eyes is the same and was determined in
      the randomization.

      Following randomization, participating community ophthalmologists affiliated with the study
      have been allowed to manage the medical and surgical care of study patients. However, all
      patients are seen at the Clinical Centers for standardized followup examinations at 3 and 6
      months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter; in addition, patients randomized to the
      surgical arm will receive, at a minimum, postsurgical followup at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month.
      At the Clinical Center visits, examination of the eye(s) includes evaluation of visual
      acuity, visual field, and intraocular pressure. The results of these tests determine whether
      treatment should be changed. In addition, before and at regular intervals after treatment,
      patients are being interviewed by telephone to assess their health-related quality of life. A
      questionnaire that includes the Sickness Impact Profile, Visual Activities Questionnaire, and
      other components is being used.
