      malignancies. Although the complete remission rate is as high as 93% by using CD19-targeting
      CAR-T technology, approximately 60% patients will have recurrent disease. Among all the
      recurrent patients, two thirds is revealed to loss their CD19 expression on B cell surface.
      For overcoming this issue, we establish a new chimeric antigen receptor containing humanized
      single chain antibody sequence to target CD22 molecule on B cells.
