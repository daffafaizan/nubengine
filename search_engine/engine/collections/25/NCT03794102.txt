      done on the use of water versus saline for irrigation during ureteroscopy.

      This study will evaluate whether the use of water or saline during ureteroscopy has any
      clinical implications. The investigators will compare the amount of fluid absorbed and
      differences in electrolytes between the two participant groups.
