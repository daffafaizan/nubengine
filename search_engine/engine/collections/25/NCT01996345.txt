      to infer, from the data for use of pessary to prevent preterm birth, and the data regarding
      the efficacy of cervical cerclage in reducing bleeding and preterm birth in patients with
      placenta previa to this clinical conundrum. If cerclage improves pregnancy outcomes in
      patients with placenta previa, the use of a vaginal pessary should be a less-invasive but
      similarly efficacious alternative to maintain cervical length. The purpose of this study is
      to compare two treatment options reasonably used in clinical practice. Use of cervical
      pessary is not expected to increase antenatal costs beyond the minimal cost of the pessary.
      Additionally, given the results of the available clinical trials on cerclage maintaining
      cervical length and decreasing bleeding, this procedure has the potential to decrease the
      cost of both antepartum admissions for bleeding and neonatal care.

      A substantial number of women with placenta previa will not hemorrhage until they reach the
      third trimester, thus, by allowing for enrollment and pessary placement as late as 32w0d, the
      intervention may be applied to the broadest "at risk" population. As previously mentioned
      literature on the use of cerclage in patients with placenta previa and short cervix are
      limited by a reduced number of eligible subjects and concern over safety issues has not been
      assuaged by these small studies. As pessary placement appears to carry little if any risk
      based on a number of published studies, eligibility can be expanded to any cervical length.
