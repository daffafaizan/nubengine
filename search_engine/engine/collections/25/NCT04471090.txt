      effects converge, promoting the development of collapse in the dorsal areas of the lung.
      These among others include deep sedation, relaxation, prolonged immobility and the supine
      position. This results of an added impairment in lung function both in the mechanical and gas
      exchange. In addition lung collapse contributes to a significant increase in the
      heterogeneity the distribution of alveolar ventilation and perfusion that may increase the
      risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

      Postural therapy is widely recommended as prevention/treatment of pressure ulcers, whose
      presence, according to the Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SEMICYUC), is a
      quality criterion for intensive care units (ICUs), with a prevalence of 18% in these units
      compared to 7.8% in adult hospitalization. However, how postural changes may affect lung
      function is an aspect that has been scarcely studied. Given the strong influence of gravity
      on lung function, positional changes can produce significant alterations in the distribution
      of trans-pulmonary pressures (a decrease along the vertical gravitational axis of
      approximately 0.25 cmH2O per cm). Depending on the severity, distribution and location of the
      respiratory pathology, positional changes may have a significant effect either benefiting or
      impairing the patient's condition.

      The investigators will dynamically assess the effects of routine lateral positioning up to
      30-40ยบ by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), a non-invasive, radiation-free
      functional bedside imaging technique that allows to monitor the regional distribution of
      ventilation and perfusion.
