      visit. Immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is extremely
      important in preventing short-interval and unintended pregnancies. The postpartum period is
      an excellent time for intrauterine device (IUD) or implant insertion as women are often
      highly motivated to prevent unwanted pregnancies at this time. Per the American College of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), expulsion rates for immediate postpartum IUD insertion are
      higher than for interval or post-abortion insertion. Despite the higher expulsion rate of
      immediate postpartum IUD placement over interval placement, cost-benefit analysis data
      strongly suggest the superiority of immediate placement in reduction of unintended pregnancy,
      especially for women at greatest risk of not attending the postpartum follow-up visit. This
      study will randomly allocate participants one to one to the Kyleena or the Mirena IUD group,
      and participants will be blinded to allocation of groups. Participants will follow up at
      routine postpartum visit within 4 weeks of delivery, and a second follow up will be performed
      at 10 weeks. Ultimately, this study will attempt to provide more detailed information on the
      difference of rates of expulsion and discontinuation of the different-sized Mirena and
      Kyleena intrauterine devices.
