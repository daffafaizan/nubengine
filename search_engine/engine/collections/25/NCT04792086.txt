      various levels of lockdown strategies. Norway locked down major parts of the society from
      March 2020. Specifically, this meant that public services were closed (e.g. most in-home
      healthcare services, day care centres, group exercise/gyms and services that offer
      physiotherapy, medical and psychological consultation). For people with cognitive impairment
      and dementia, social distancing and self-isolation may have limited the use of normal
      strategies (e.g., distraction, stimulation, and social interaction) that are routinely
      adopted to manage some of the dementia symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms. A lack of
      daily routines may change the clinical conditions of patients with dementia. Worsening of
      preexisting and/or the onset of new neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur, in addition to a
      possible decline of cognitive and functional capacities

      Aim: The overarching aim of this project is to provide decision makers with vital information
      to improve the healthcare of people with dementia and cognitive impairment in the context of
      an epidemic.

      Method: We will use four data sources:1) The fourth wave of the Trøndelag Health study (HUNT,
      HUNT4 70+), 2) Three national health registries (The Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR), the
      Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (NRPHC) and the Norwegian Prescription Database
      (NorPD)), 3) A postal questionnaire concerning social isolation during the COVID-19 epidemic,
      and 4) The Ageing in Trøndelag study (AiT), which is a follow-up of the HUNT4 70+ study.

      With this linkage of cohort data and national health registry data, we can identify factors
      that may make people with cognitive impairment and dementia vulnerable to loss of healthcare
      services because of COVID-19 and subsequently to negative health consequences.
