    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 2 different Body Warming to Alter (Thermo)
      Regulation and the Microenvironment (B-WARM) regimens on altering tumor blood flow in
      patients with a variety of malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if duration and thermal dose of B-WARM changes duration and extent of tumor
      blood flow changes in patients with a variety of malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees Celsius (C) for 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees C for 2 hours.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days.
