    
      A genitourinary fistula is defined as an abnormal communication between the urinary (ureters,
      bladder, urethra) and the genital (uterus, cervix, vagina) systems.

      The true incidence of genitourinary fistula is unknown. Uro-genital fistulas are a great
      challenge for women in developing countries.

      The new classification of genitourinary fistula divides genitourinary fistulae into four main
      types, depending on the distance of the distal edge of the fistula from the external urinary
      meatus. These four types are further subclassified by the size of the fistula, extent of
      associated scarring, vaginal length or special considerations:

      Type 1: Distal edge of fistula > 3.5 cm from external urinary meatus Type 2: Distal edge of
      fistula 2.5-3.5 cm from external urinary meatus Type 3: Distal edge of fistula 1.5 - < 2.5 cm
      from external urinary meatus
