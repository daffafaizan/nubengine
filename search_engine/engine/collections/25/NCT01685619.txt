      are used to predict whether a person is likely to have a good response to chemotherapy or
      not.

      Three of the tests involve new genetic-based technology. One of these tests is called
      comparative genomic profiling. This test can detect genetic abnormalities that current
      testing methods are not able to detect. Another test involves micro-RNA profiling. The final
      test involves RNA sequencing. The researchers think these tests might be useful in predicting
      how well a person will respond to treatment.

      The novel laboratory tests being evaluated as part of this study are still in the early
      phases of development and cannot be used for clinical decision making. Participants enrolled
      in this study will not be informed regarding their individual results with respect to the
      study tests that are conducted using their biospecimens.

      The following information (data) will be collected regarding study participants: diagnosis,
      results of relevant clinical tests, age, gender, treatment and outcome during the 2 year
      study follow-up period. The study also involves the completion of study questionnaires at six
      different time points over the course of the two year study follow-up.
