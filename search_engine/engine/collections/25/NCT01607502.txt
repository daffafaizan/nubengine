      a database as well as blood samples in a biobank. The combination of anamnestic and clinical
      data and biomarkers should provide a better characterization of our patients and should
      improve the analysis of the disease development of different PH forms and therapeutic
      aspects.

      After given informed consent patients' data are entered in a database at different time
      points. The database includes parameter of several invasive and non-invasive investigations
      like right heart catheterization (RHC), echocardiography, ECG, pulmonary function tests,
      cardiorespiratory exercise testing, 6-minute walk test, computed tomography, MRI,
      polysomnography, blood gas analysis and laboratory data as well as demographic data of the
      patients.

      The blood samples are taken during routine punctuation and are stored in our biobank.
