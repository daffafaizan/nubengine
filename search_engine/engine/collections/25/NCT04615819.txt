      evaluation process, or peer navigators (PN) who were former KT patients to help patients
      "navigate" their way through KT evaluation, can help vulnerable patients with ESKD overcome
      barriers to transplant listing. After culturally and contextually adapting the two
      interventions, we will use a comparative effectiveness (CER) approach to conduct a pragmatic
      randomized trial of 398 ESKD patients to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of the two
      approaches in disadvantaged groups at a university-affiliated transplant center with large HL
      and AI ESKD patient populations, and we will compare results to historic comparison
      populations (local and national). We will assess facilitators and barriers to widespread
      implementation and conduct a cost effectiveness analysis. Although it is expected that KTFT
      will be more effective than PN, KTFT may also be more costly, requiring significant
      administrative and clinical changes in the transplant center, which may be impractical to
      maintain. Further, KTFT may lead to more patient ambivalence because the shortened evaluation
      period will give them less time to consider their treatment options. Thus, an important
      aspect of the proposed study is to comparative the effectiveness of the two methods.
      Ultimately, our study will inform transplant programs faced with disparities in KT about
      which disparity-reducing intervention to use given their particular needs and resources.
