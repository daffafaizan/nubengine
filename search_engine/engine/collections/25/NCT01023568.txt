      the Glidescope® (Verathon Inc, Bothwell, USA), the AWD® (Pentax Corporation, Tokio, Japan)
      and most recently the Truview PCD (Truphatek International Ltd, Netanya, Israel). The use of
      videolaryngoscopy devices in adults have demonstrated some advantages including, minimal
      trauma on the airway and better view of the glottis.

      The Glidescope is designed with a 60º angle and a camera on the inferior aspect just at the
      inflection point. The view is obtained anteriorly and the camera is located remote from the
      glottis providing a good visual field. The video image is displayed on a Liquid Crystal
      Display (LCD), with electronic recording available. Despite a good experience using
      Glidescope in adults, few studies have been published in pediatric patients. Kim et al. in a
      randomized study comparing the use of Glidescope with direct laryngoscopy in children,
      demonstrated better or equal laryngoscopic view with longer time for intubation using the
      Glidescope.
