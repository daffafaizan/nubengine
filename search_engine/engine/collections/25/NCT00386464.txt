      Patients with forced vital capacity above 60% of the predicted value can join. Patients will
      be assigned to either start using non-invasive ventilation at night or continue their usual
      care. After three months, patients will switch over to the other treatment group. For
      example, a patient who was initially assigned to continue their usual care would begin using
      non-invasive ventilation after three months.
