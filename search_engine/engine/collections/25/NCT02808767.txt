        1. Compare the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in acute myocardial
           infarction treated with emergent PCI.

        2. Assess the safety of switching to clopidogrel after remission of the acute phase of MI
           in patients for whom economic barriers do not allow to continue treatment with prasugrel
           or ticagrelor. All randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction have been
           treated with standard therapeutic procedures in accordance with the guidelines of
           European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Participation of patients in the study is not
           connected to any deviations from the ESC guidelines recommendations.
