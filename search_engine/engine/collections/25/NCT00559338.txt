      that our higher risk patient population might realize a decrease in the return admission rate
      as a benefit from early ED administration of nesiritide. We also acknowledged that the safety
      of nesiritide in our patient population had not been well established. Thus, we opted to test
      the hypothesis that an 8-hour ED infusion of nesiritide [in addition to protocol specified
      standard therapy] in ADHF patients from an urban patient population consisting of
      predominately African Americans and Hispanics will decrease 30-day readmission rates without
      provoking harm.
