      pacing. Traditional ventricular pacing causes ventricular dyssynchrony that in turn causes
      cardiac contraction dysfunction. CRT pacing provides better ventricular synchronization, but
      not the optimal, especially in patients with narrow QRS. CRT non-response rate is at 30%. His
      bundle pacing utilizes naturel His bundle-Purkinjie system to provide optimal physiological
      pacing. But many pacing-indicated patients have abnormal His bundle-Purkinje system, thus His
      bundle pacing cannot provide optimal pacing in patients with abnormal cardiac conduction
      system. Moreover, the pacing threshold is high during His bundle pacing. More recently, left
      bundle branch pacing is proposed. However, LBBP will generate right bundle branch block
      pattern, another kind of weak ventricular synchronization. Thus, the investigators propose to
      excite the left and right bundle branches area simultaneously to normalize ventricular
      synchronization. The purpose of this study is to explore the electrocardiogram (ECG)
      characteristics of simultaneous stimulation of right and left bundle branches area.
