      I. Overall survival (OS) will be the primary endpoint.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS). II. Time to disease progression and sites of progression.
      III. Response rate. IV. Toxicity of the combination in this population. V. Quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-21 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3
      months for up to 5 years.
