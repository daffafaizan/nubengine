      controlled, sequential ascending single and multiple oral doses design to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, PK, and food effect of MB-110 in healthy volunteers.Part A will recruit
      2 groups (Groups 1 and 2) of 8 healthy volunteers in each group. Within each group, 8
      subjects will be randomized 6:2 to receive MB-110 versus placebo.Subjects in Group 1 will
      receive either 50 mg of MB-110 or placebo under fasted conditions during the first visit
      (Cohort 1); and either 50 mg of MB-110 or placebo under fed conditions during the second
      visit (Cohort 3) where food effect will be evaluated. Subjects in Group 2 will receive either
      100 mg of MB-110 or placebo under fasted condition during the first visit (Cohort 2); or 200
      mg of MB-110 or placebo under fasted condition during the second visit (Cohort 4). In Cohort
      5, 8 subjects will be selected from Group 1, Group 2, or new recruitment if the washout time
      is insufficient from the previous cohort. Subjects in Cohort 5 will be randomized 6:2 to
      receive MB-110 at dose of 200 mg or placebo once daily for 5 consecutive days.

      Part B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending oral dose design
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of MB-110 in subjects
      infected with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b, 2a, and 3a.Part B will recruit 3 cohorts
      (Cohorts 6, 7, and 8) of treatment-na√Øve HCV infected subjects in each cohort. In Cohort 6,
      12 subjects infected with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b will be randomized 5:5:2 to receive
      two dose levels of MB-110 or placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days. In Cohort 7, 6
      subjects infected with Hepatitis C virus genotype 2a will be randomized 5:1 to receive MB-110
      or placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days. In Cohort 8, 6 subjects infected with Hepatitis
      C virus genotype 3a will be randomized 5:1 to receive MB-110 or placebo once daily for 3
      consecutive days.
