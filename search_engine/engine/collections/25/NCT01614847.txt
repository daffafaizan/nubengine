      Introduction: Tear hyper-osmolarity may be a fundamental cause of dry eye in many cases.
      Hyaluronate is an agent used in some artificial tears, which binds water and can protect
      against evaporation. It may therefore be an effective treatment for tear hyper-osmolarity.

      Purpose: Our purpose was to measure changes in tear osmolarity over time following
      instillation of Blink Contacts, an isotonic ocular lubricant containing hyaluronate. We
      hypothesized that even in isotonic solution, the water-binding properties of hyaluronate
      would reduce tear osmolarity. This will help us better understand efficacy of this treatment
      and develop a rational basis for dosing schedules.

      Methods: After baseline osmolarity measurements, eight subjects received either Blink
      Contacts or normal saline drops in both eyes. We re-measured osmolarity five minutes later,
      and then at 15-minute intervals up to 95 minutes. Subjects also rated comfort at each time.
      The next day, the experiment was repeated with the alternate drops for each subject.
