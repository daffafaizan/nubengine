    
      Ulceration of the diabetic foot is a result of multiple problems including repetitive stress
      on a neuropathic or insensate area that is often associated with an underlying bony
      prominence. By healing diabetic foot ulcers quickly the risks of infection, osteomyelitis
      (infeciton of the bone) and limb loss can be reduced.

      This study will evaluate the ability of Apligraf to heal diabetic foot ulcers that have been
      present for at least 2 weeks and are between 1 - 16 cm2 in area. Patients will be randomized
      to either (50:50 chance) treatment with Apligraf or a saline moistened dressing regimen
      (standard therapy). All patients will receive standard cares for the ulcers which includes
      debridement, orthotics and off-loading throughout the treatment period.
