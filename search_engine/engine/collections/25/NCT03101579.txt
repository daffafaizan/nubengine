      progressive leptomeningeal metastases from non-small cell lung cancer after leptomeningeal
      metastases-related treatment. The regimen of pemetrexed (Alimta, Eli Lilly and Company) is
      10/15/20 mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, twice per week for 2 weeks, followed by once per week
      for 2-4 weeks. Pemetrexed and dexamethasone are administrated by intrathecal injection via
      lumbar puncture. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are administered to reduce the frequency of
      myelosuppression. Folic acid 200-400 μg is administered orally once daily, prior to the first
      intrathecal pemetrexed, until 21 days after the last intrathecal pemetrexed. A single dose of
      vitamin B12 1000 μg is administered by intramuscular injection before the first intrathecal
      pemetrexed，once per 3 weeks. To detect the pharmacokinetics of intrathecal pemetrexed, the
      serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected. These samples would be analyzed by
      spectrometer for drug concentration.
