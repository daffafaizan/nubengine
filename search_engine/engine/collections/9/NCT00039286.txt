        -  Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)
           positron emission tomography (PET) as compared to conventional imaging in determining
           the extent of disease in women with primary or recurrent breast cancer.

        -  Determine how often clinical management and operative intervention plans for patients
           are altered based on these FDG-PET scan findings.

        -  Determine whether FDG-PET results in more accurate detection of disease in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 IV. Approximately 1 hour later, patients
      undergo positron emission tomography imaging. Some patients may undergo a repeat scan in 4-6
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: (50 with primary disease and 50 with recurrent disease) will be accrued
      for this study within 1-2 years.
