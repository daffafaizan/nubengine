      patients with elbow limitation, aged between 20-55 years will be randomly divided into two
      groups: GMI group and standard rehabilitation (SR) group. Interventions will be applied for
      12 sessions. The patients will be assessed before, after six-week treatment and six-week
      follow-up. The pain on activity, at rest and at night will be assessed with Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS). Pain pressure threshold of the elbow and soft tissue around the elbow will be
      evaluated by digital pressure algometry. ROM will be assessed with a digital goniometer.
      Isometric muscle strength will be measured with a handheld dynamometer of elbow flexors and
      extensors. Grip strength will also be assessed. Recogniseâ„¢ will be used for assessing the
      right-left discrimination. The functional status and kinesiophobia will be evaluated by
      Disabilities Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, respectively.
      The Global Rating of Change will be used to evaluate patient satisfaction. The Vividness of
      Movement Imagery Questionnaire 2 (VMIQ-2) will be used for evaluating the individuals'
      ability to mental imaginary.
