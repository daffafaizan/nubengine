    
      The primary objective of the Chocolate Touch study is to demonstrate non-inferior safety and
      non-inferior effectiveness of the Chocolate Touch™ compared to the Lutonix® drug coated
      balloon catheter. These data are intended to show safety and effectiveness of the Chocolate
      Touch sufficient to support regulatory approval to market this device in the United States
      for use in superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

      Study success is defined as statistical demonstration of the non-inferiority hypothesis tests
      for both the primary safety and effectiveness hypothesis.
