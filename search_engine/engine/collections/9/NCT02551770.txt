      The primary objective is to evaluate the regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain by
      comparing the change in clinical attachment level from baseline to 12 months between the test
      and control arms. The regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain will also be assessed by
      comparing the changes in gingival margins, changes in average probing pocket depth, changes
      in full mouth plaque score, changes in bleeding on probing, and changes in root dentin
      hypersensitivity from baseline to 12 months between the test and control arms.
