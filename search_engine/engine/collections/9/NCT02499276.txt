    
      Cross-over, prospective, randomized controlled monocentric trial . Patients on pressure
      support ventilation will be ventilated with PSV, NAVA, PAV, and V-PSV (in a randomized
      sequence).

      In each mode the level of assistance will be set to achieve a similar tidal volume of 6-8
      ml/kg.

      The following data will be measured and recorded: airway flow and pressure, electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), blood gases, electrical impedance tomography, end tidal
      partial pressure in carbon dioxide (PEtCO2).

      Will be calculated: the coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation (SD)/mean) of the
      peak pressure (Ppeak), EAdi and of the main descriptors of the breathing pattern, the
      prevalence of the main patient-ventilator asynchronies, the prevalence of tidal volume (VT)
      >10ml/kg, ventrodorsal repartition of ventilation and inhomogeneity index, dead space
