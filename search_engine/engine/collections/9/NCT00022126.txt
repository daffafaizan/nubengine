        -  Determine the feasibility of dexamethasone-based induction chemotherapy followed by
           augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) consolidation chemotherapy with or without
           allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in infants with previously untreated acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical prognostic features associated with outcome in these patients.

        -  Compare the biologic characteristics of the leukemia cells with outcome in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising oral dexamethasone 3 times daily on days 1-14;
      daunorubicin IV on days 1, 8, and 15; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and
      asparaginase intramuscularly (IM) on days 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, and 22. Patients also
      receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on days 1, 8, and 15 (and days 4 and 22 for overt CNS
      disease).

      Patients with M1 or M2 marrow after induction therapy receive augmented consolidation therapy
      when blood counts recover. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 29; cytarabine
      IV or subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-5, 9-12, 30-33, and 37-40; oral mercaptopurine on days
      1-14 and 29-42; vincristine IV on days 15, 22, 43, and 50; pegaspargase IM on days 15 and 43;
      and methotrexate IT on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Patients who do not receive bone marrow transplantation (BMT) proceed to interim maintenance
      #1 when blood counts recover. Patients receive methotrexate IT on days 1, 11, 22, and 32;
      methotrexate IV and vincristine IV on days 1, 11, 22, 32, and 43; and pegaspargase IM on days
      2 and 23.

      When blood counts recover, patients receive delayed intensification #1 comprising vincristine
      IV on days 1, 8, 15, 43, and 50; doxorubicin IV on days 1, 8, and 15; oral dexamethasone 3
      times daily on days 1-7 and 15-21; pegaspargase IM on days 4 and 43; cyclophosphamide IV on
      day 29; methotrexate IT on days 29 and 36; oral thioguanine on days 29-42; and cytarabine IV
      or SC on days 30-33 and 37-40.

      When blood counts recover, patients receive interim maintenance #2 comprising vincristine as
      in interim maintenance #1; methotrexate IT on day 1 and IV on days 1, 11, 22, 32, and 41; and
      pegaspargase IM on days 2 and 23.

      When blood counts recover, patients receive delayed intensification #2 comprising
      vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and
      thioguanine as in intensification #1. Patients also receive methotrexate IT on days 1 and 29.

      When blood counts recover, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising methotrexate IT on
      day 1 and orally on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78; vincristine IV on
      days 1, 29, and 57; oral dexamethasone 3 times daily on days 1-5, 29-33, and 57-61; and oral
      mercaptopurine daily. Treatment repeats every 84 days for 6 courses.

      Patients with an allergy to pegaspargase replace it with asparaginase IM on the days after
      receiving methotrexate IV during interim maintenance #1 and #2 and daily over 6 days in place
      of each dose of pegaspargase during delayed intensification #1 and #2.

      After augmented consolidation therapy, patients meeting the following criteria may receive
      BMT in place of chemotherapy:

        -  In remission

        -  Exhibiting chromosome translocation involving 11q23 or Ph+{(9;22)}

        -  Available HLA-A, B, DR genotypic identical relative donor

        -  No uncontrolled infection

        -  Adequate organ function Within 3-4 weeks of consolidation therapy, patients undergoing
           allogeneic BMT receive cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -5; cyclophosphamide IV
           over 30 minutes on days -7 and -6; and methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days -2 to
           0. Patients also undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 to 0. Patients
           receive allogeneic BMT on day 0. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV every 12 hours
           beginning on day -1, switching to oral when possible, and continuing until day 60.
           Patients then taper cyclosporine over the next 60-120 days.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1-2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
