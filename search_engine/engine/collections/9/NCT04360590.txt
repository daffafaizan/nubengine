    
      12 pediatric patients, admitted in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with moderate PARDS
      and who failed up to 3 SBTs in less than 7 days, were enrolled in this study. These patients
      underwent three studies conditions, lasting 1 hour each: Pressure support ventilation 1,
      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist and Pressure support ventilation 2.

      During each trial were recorded the patient tracings of flow, airway pressure and electrical
      activity of diaphragm for the patient-ventilator interaction analysis.
