      FDA approved for relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis in women with a
      uterus who have not been diagnosed with estrogen dependent neoplasia. The overall purpose of
      this research is to demonstrate in a preliminary fashion that despite reduction in menopausal
      symptoms, (Duavee®) does not increase and may decrease proliferation in benign breast tissue
      in a cohort of peri- or post-menopausal women at moderately increased risk for breast cancer.
      If this pilot shows rapid accrual, good retention, and lack of significant increase in the
      risk biomarker Ki-67 in benign breast tissue, a larger prevention trial is envisioned
