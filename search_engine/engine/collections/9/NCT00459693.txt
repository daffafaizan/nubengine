      receptors associated with GABAa receptors. Although PBR was initially identified in
      peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, later studies identified PBR
      in the central nervous system. In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low levels in some
      neurons and glial cells. PBR can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation,
      because activated microglial cells in inflammatory areas express much greater levels of PBR
      than in microglial cells in resting conditions.

      PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using
      [11C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195). However, this
      classical ligand provides low levels of specific signal. Recently we developed a new ligand,
      N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [11C]PBR28, which showed much greater
      specific signal than [11C]PK11195 in non-human primates. ln the present protocol we plan to
      perform a kinetic brain imaging study with [11C]PBR28 in HlV-seronegative controls,
      HIV-seropositive, non-impaired patients, and HlV-seropositive patients with minor cognitive
      motor disorder(MCMD). Each subject will recieve a brain-dedicated PET scan with 20
      mCi[(11)C]PBR28.
