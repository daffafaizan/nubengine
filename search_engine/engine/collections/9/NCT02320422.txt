      blood levels within the last year are eligible for the study. Patients will be recruited from
      amongst the roster of liver transplant recipients treated at the Recanati-Miller Transplant
      Institute at Mount Sinai. The intervention will be pilot-tested on up to 15 non-adherent
      patients. Patients will be identified using an innovative biomarker for non-adherence-by
      calculating the degree of fluctuation between individual medication blood levels. The
      telemetric intervention (administered via telephone, or interactive video chat applications
      such as FaceTime ® or Skype ®) will enable the intervention team (IT) to address
      non-adherence from a remote location, using a structured, tailored approach that accommodates
      specific patient needs. The approach includes a focus on psychological avoidance.
