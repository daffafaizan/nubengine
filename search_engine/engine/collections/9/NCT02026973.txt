      in healthy aging individuals (1-3). Sex-steroid deprivation accentuates GH and IGF-I
      depletion, since Te and E2 stimulate GH and IGF-I production in older adults, hypogonadal
      patients of all ages, and patients undergoing gender reassignment (1,2,4). Tamoxifen blocks
      the effect of Te, suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation in men (5). E2 also
      stimulates GH secretion in women, putatively via the nuclear estrogen receptor (ER-alpha)
      (1,2,6,7). Because Te, E2 and GH fall with menopause, and Te is converted to E2 by
      aromatization in the body (8-10), we postulate that diminished Te concentrations, Teâ†’E2
      concentrations and low E2 mediate low GH output in older women. What remains unknown is
      whether the low E2 levels in postmenopausal women retain GH-stimulating effects. To test this
      notion would require blocking: (i) aromatase-enzyme activity, which mediates E2 synthesis
      from Te, and/or (ii) estrogen receptor-alpha, which transduces most of E2's stimulation of
      the GH axis.
