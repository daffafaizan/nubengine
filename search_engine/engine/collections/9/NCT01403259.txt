      nasopharyngeal carcinoma is limited. Previous studies showed that both S-1 and oxaliplatin
      were effective in head and neck cancer. Moreover, SOX (S-1 plus oxaliplatin) was proved to be
      tolerable in advanced stage gastric cancer. Therefore, we aim to evaluate this regimen in
      salvage setting of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
