      mortality and morbidity. To date, ARFI elastography has been known to correlate with the
      degree of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease. However, ARFI velocity has not yet been
      reported in HIV patients. The aim of this study was to identify the normal range of ARFI
      velocity and liver stiffness value by recruiting HIV patients without abnormal liver function
      and chronic liver disease.
