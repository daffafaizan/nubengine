      in progressive joint inflammation and destruction. At present, there is no known cure for
      this disease. As a consequence of the potential side effects, many RA patients turn to other
      alternative remedies such as specialised diets and/or dietary supplements in a bid to relieve
      their symptoms. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the effectiveness of high fiber
      multigrain supplementation on the level of clinical disease severity measures, blood
      inflammatory molecules, together with the nutritional status changes in RA patients, as
      compare with conventional drug treatments.
