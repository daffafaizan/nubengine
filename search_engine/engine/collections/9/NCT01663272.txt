      cabozantinib prevented the development of metastatic disease in an intra-cardiac injection
      model in NOD/SCID mice. Additionally, the combination of cabozantinib and gemcitabine
      demonstrated improved tumor control compared to either agent alone in a relevant orthotopic
      implantation mouse model.

      Combining gemcitabine with the c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic cancer is
      a novel strategy that takes advantage of an established cytotoxic agent with one that targets
      a pathway known to be important for the growth, dissemination, and resistance of this
      disease.
