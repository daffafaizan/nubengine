      surgery. However, extensive studies report that remifentanil,administered at 0.2ug/kg/min or
      0.4ug/kg/min intraoperatively, can result in postoperative hyperalgesia and increase the
      consumption of analgesics when compared with low dose (0.05ug/kg/min). However, a recent
      experimental study shows that large dose of remifentanil can inhibit pain hypersensitivity
      through erasing the spinal sensitization of pain. The present study thus hypothesizes that
      higher dose of remifentanil (1.2ug/kg/min) may attenuate postoperative pain. The present
      study will compare the effect of two different dose of remifentanil (0.2ug/kg/min and
      1.2ug/kg/min) on postoperative pain. Patients undergoing thyroidectomy will be recruited, and
      mechanical threshold will be measured in the remote region of surgical site preoperatively.
      The patients will be randomly divided by two groups, 0.2ug/kg/min (group I) and 1.2ug/kg/min
      (group II). After operation, mechanical threshold and visual analogue scale (VAS) will be
      measured as the indicators of postoperative pain. The consumption of morphine will also be
      compared between these two doses of remifentanil.

      The present study may find optimized dose of opioid usage in the patients undergoing surgery
      to relieve the postoperative pain.
