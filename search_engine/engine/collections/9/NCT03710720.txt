      app during implementation of TF-CBT in comparison to TF-CBT as it is usually administered, as
      well as feasibility of methods that would be utilized in a larger scale evaluation of the
      toolkit. Clients will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions, TF-CBT plus the TIPS
      app or TF-CBT as usual. Study duration is six months and includes four total assessments,
      which will be completed by hand. These assessments will occur over the 12-16 weeks of TF-CBT
      that clients would receive whether they choose to participate in the study or not.
      Participation in this study may broaden your child's treatment to target prevention of risk
      behaviors, but that cannot be guaranteed.
