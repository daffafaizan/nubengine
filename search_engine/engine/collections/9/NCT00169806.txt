      and document the location and characteristics of each stone, papillae and calyces. One or
      more small papillary biopsies are taken for analysis to help determine the point of origin of
      the kidney stone and histological studies are undertaken to determine tissue differences
      amongst different types of stone formers. Approximately one month after surgery, metabolic
      studies are undertaken to further review potential causes of stone formation.
