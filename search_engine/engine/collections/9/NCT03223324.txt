    
      The study is a single-center prospective paired comparison trial, to determine the
      equivalence of the Monica Novii Patch System with FDA cleared Doppler FHR, TOCO UC and photo
      plethysmograph MHR Predicate. Patients admitted for threatened pre-term labor and for
      pre-term labour & delivery will be monitored with both devices simultaneously for FHR, UC,
      and MHR. Only the data from predicate devices will be available to the clinical care team.
      The equivalence of the Novii data will be compared to that of the simultaneously obtained
      predicate device data. Since TOCO UC and Doppler FHR are prone to artefact or error in a
      Pre-Term Labor population, the principal investigator or a member of the study team will
      decide on:

        1. One 30 minute period of 'interpretable' Doppler FHR, photo plethysmograph MHR and TOCO
           UA from each of the admitted threatened pre-term labor subjects, when the subject is
           experiencing contractions as demonstrated by the TOCO UC trace and these contractions
           represent the clinical presentation.

        2. One 30 minute period of 'interpretable' Doppler FHR, photo plethysmograph MHR and TOCO
           UA from each of the pre-term labor & delivery subjects ending as close to delivery as
           practical. As above the TOCO UC contractions should represent the clinical presentation.
           The selection of the 30 min periods will be based on data from the predicate only (the
           Novii FHR and UC data will not be available to the study team). The two 30 min periods
           will be used for the statistical equivalence calculation.

      All recorded data will be made available for visual review.
