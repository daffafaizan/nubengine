      functional connectivity within the brain, which is associated with cognitive functioning.
      Observational studies suggest that regular physical activity is associated with higher
      cerebral blood flow and improved cognitive function. However, the mechanistic links among
      regular physical activity and cerebral blood flow with advancing age are unknown. In this
      context, it is unclear if aging or exercise training status alters the neurovascular coupling
      of blood flow in the brain. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to examine the
      age-related changes in cerebral vasodilatory capacity, an important homeostatic mechanism and
      marker for effective regulation of cerebral perfusion, in order to determine how it is
      mechanistically linked to cognition. Additionally, the investigators will explore the
      potential beneficial effect of physical activity on the relationships between cerebral
      vasodilation and cognition in humans.

      The research aims are:

        1. To determine if cerebral vasodilator responses are affected by age and exercise training
           status in healthy adults.

        2. To compare the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition on cerebral vasodilator responses in
           healthy adults.

        3. To determine the neurovascular counter-regulatory response to cyclooxygenase inhibition
           in healthy adults.
