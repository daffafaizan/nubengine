      well-known aspect during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and many efforts have been made
      for obtaining the personalization of the treatment, identifying different biomarkers that may
      predict the ovarian response such as age, basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), AMH and
      antral follicle count (AFC). The number of oocytes retrieved is the main expression of
      ovarian response and it remains a relevant prognostic marker in women undergoing In Vitro
      Fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) cycles. Consistent evidence shows
      that an optimal - rather than a maximal - oocyte yield is the preferred achievement after COS
      when fresh embryo transfer is scheduled. In fact, live birth rates steadily increase when an
      optimal number of oocytes is collected, whereas low response and hyper-response are
      associated with lower implantation rates, increased obstetrical risks and, at least when
      considering hyper response, increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in the
      fresh cycle. Among the different biomarkers, AMH and AFC seem to have the best performance in
      predicting ovarian response to exogenous FSH.

      Nevertheless, until now, there is often discordance between the AMH level and AFC in clinical
      practice. In cases of discordance, which indicator should be chosen to individualize the
      starting dose of gonadotropins? Until now, no direct comparison of the new automated
      immunoassay of AMH with AFC has been carried out considering the number of retrieved oocytes
      as primary endpoint.
