    
      Background: Literatures have shown that patitents with locally advanced gastric cancer could
      potentially benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, but whether this can improve
      patitents' outcome is still unclear.

      Patients and methods: In this study , patients with histologically confirmed gastric
      adenocarcinoma with pre-operative staging are cT3N2/N3M0, cT4aN+M0 and cT4bNanyM0, aged
      between 18-75 years old, with adequate organ function and having an Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group performance status score â‰¤2, are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with DT45Gy/25f plus three cycles of XELOX therapy
      (Capecitabine 1000mg/m2, BID, D1-14; Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on day 1 for a 21-day cycle) or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone using XELOX regimen following by D2 gastrectomy and adjuvant
      chemotherapy with same dosage of XELOX therapy for up to 3 cycles. The primary end point is
      disease free survival (DFS), and secondary end point is 5-year overall survival (OS),
      pathological complete remission (pCR) and treatment safety. The final study analytics are to
      be conducted at the end of the 5th year after the last patient's enrollment.
