    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 LAR and
      standard treatment with gemcitabine. We will utilize a staggered, sequential dose-escalation
      design to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SOM 230 LAR when combined with standard
      doses of gemcitabine. Cycle will be defined as 28 days.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Gemcitabine is administered by IV
      infusion. The dose should be based on the patient's actual baseline body weight; the dose
      will be recalculated if there is a weight change of > 10% from baseline. The dose of
      gemcitabine will be given over 30 minutes, weekly every 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest
      period. SOM 230 LAR will be administered as an intramuscular dose determined by the dosing
      schema, every month.
