      establish its effectiveness in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity due to obstetrical
      hemorrhage. The sites are two maternity teaching hospitals in Egypt: El Galaa, in Cairo and
      Assiut University in Assiut.

      Our main aim was to test the efficacy of the NASG on women suffering from obstetric
      hemorrhage as compared to hemorrhaging women who do not receive the NASG. Our primary outcome
      was Extreme Adverse Outcomes (EAO) - a combined outcome of maternal mortality and severe
      morbidity. Secondary outcomes included mean measured blood loss and incidence of emergency
      hysterectomy.
