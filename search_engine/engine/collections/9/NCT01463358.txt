    
      Primary endpoint

      First occurrence of a composite of Syncope of any origin OR Presyncopal episode with
      documented cardioinhibitory origin OR Atrioventricular block of any degree; all associated
      with patient symptoms

      Design:

        -  Randomized, prospective, single blinded, two parallel arms

        -  Treatment group : DDD60 - programmed in DDD mode / 60 lower limit

        -  Control Group: DDI30 - programmed in DDI mode / 30 lower limit

        -  Randomization type: block randomization: Block size: 4, allocation ratio 1:1

      Sample: 100 patients

      Population

        -  Patients with bifascicular block with at least one syncopal episode within the last 6
           months preceding enrollment.

        -  Patients should be negative to a series of pre-enrollment screening in order to exclude:

        -  Brady-tachy syndrome, vasovagal syncope or carotid sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation,
           inducible AV block

        -  Ejection fraction >=40%

        -  Mean nocturnal heart rate >=35 bpm
