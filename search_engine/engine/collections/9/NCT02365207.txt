    
      Patients with muscle invasive (≥T1) bladder cancer will be given 3-6 treatments (based on
      treatment response) intravesical TICE® BCG. BCG is an attenuated, live culture preparation of
      the Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) strain of Mycobacterium bovis.

      After completion of BCG treatments the patient will undergo a cystectomy. A portion of
      bladder tumor tissue and lymph nodes will be collected for research purposes during the
      cystectomy.
