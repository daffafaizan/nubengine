    
      -  This is an open-label study which means both the patient and the doctor will know what
           drugs and doses the patient is receiving throughout the study.

        -  Patients will receive 8 cycles of study treatment with bortezomib, dexamethasone and
           rituximab. Each cycle is 21 days long. Therapy is given on the first, fourth, eighth and
           eleventh day of each cycle, followed by a 10 day rest period. The first 4 cycles will be
           given one after the other. Three months after completing the fourth cycle of therapy,
           patients will receive one cycle of therapy every three months for a total of four more
           cycles.

        -  On the first, fourth, eighth and eleventh day of each cycle, the patient will receive
           bortezomib and dexamethasone as an intravenous injection through a needle in your vein.
           On the eleventh day only, the patient will also receive rituximab as an intravenous
           infusion after getting bortezomib and dexamethasone.

        -  Prior to each infusion of rituximab therapy, the patient will be asked to take some
           medications to prevent or reduce side effects of rituximab. These medications are
           benadryl, tylenol, and possibly more steroids. The doctor will determine which of these
           drugs are appropriate for the individual patient.

        -  During the rituximab infusion, the patients blood pressure and pulse will be monitored
           frequently and the infusion rate may be decreased depending upon the side effects
           experienced.

        -  After therapy is completed, the patient will be followed every three months for 2 more
           years for office visits and laboratory tests to determine how well they are doing and if
           the therapy continues to benefit them.
