      This has stimulated a debate about whether DFT testing should be performed at all.1-3
      However, this dialog has primarily centered around left sided implants, a group that is
      characterized by a small incidence of high defibrillation thresholds (DFTs).

      The mechanism of phase duration programming to improve DFTs would seem to be most effectively
      applied to a group of patients with a high incidence of high DFTs such as right sided
      implants. This study therefore aims to prospectively evaluate direct phase duration
      programming on DFTs in right sided implants.
