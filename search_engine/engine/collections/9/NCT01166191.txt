      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes on FDG-PET scan to a dose of 45Gy in 30 fractions
      in 3 weeks (1.5Gy BID). Radiotherapy will be delivered concurrently with cisplatin (or in
      case of a creatinin clearance of <60ml/min, carboplatin) and etoposide chemotherapy. When
      after 4 cycles of chemotherapy and concurrent chest radiotherapy, no disease progression is
      observed and the WHO performance status is 0-2, PCI (prophylactic cranial irradiation) will
      bee offered to a dose of 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions.

      The radiation doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be
      applied, as well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in
      standard practice at MAASTRO clinic.
