    
      Patients with locoregional non small cell lung cancer are registered on study after tumour
      volumes are outlined by a radiologist and prior to the commencement of any treatment.

      All patients must have recorded the volume of disease in the primary tumour (and of involved
      nodes > 1 cm diameter) as measured from a CT scan performed according to a standard set of
      conditions.

      Following registration patients are treated with Definitive radiotherapy with or without
      chemotherapy. Follow-up will occur with the collection of a minimum amount of data every 12
      months from the date of registration on study.

      Quality Assurance procedures will be implemented with each site that participates in the
      study.
