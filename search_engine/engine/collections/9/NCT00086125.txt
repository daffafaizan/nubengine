    
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of AP23573 in patients with
      specified relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies by evaluating the response rates
      as defined for the individual malignancy categories. Secondary objectives include evaluating
      time to disease progression, progression-free survival and duration of response; evaluating
      the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of AP23573; describing health-related
      quality of life measurements; and exploring the safety and tolerability of AP23573 at the
      specified dose level.

      Protocol Outline: Open label, non-randomized parallel cohorts of five disease-specific
      cohorts with a minimum of 21 patients per cohort. Each patient receives a fixed dose of
      AP23573 administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes daily for five days (QDx5) to be
      repeated every 2 weeks.
