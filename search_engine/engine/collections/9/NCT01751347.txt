      Epinephrine or 10 ml of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 Epinephrine.

      In the case of a single digit surgery such as the trigger finger release, the dose will be
      adjusted to 5ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine or 5ml of 1% Lidocaine with
      1:100,000 Epinephrine.

      An additional 5ml of study drug will be prepared in a separate syringe and administered when
