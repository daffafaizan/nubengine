      umbilicus. Hernias affect a significant proportion of the population and can vary from
      producing no symptoms at all, to causing a blockage to the bowel that requires urgent
      surgery. Hernias affect people of all ages and degrees of health, but become increasingly
      common with age. As our population ages and therefore becomes generally more unwell, the
      risks of surgery increase. Recent evidence suggests that emergency hernia repair is
      associated with worse outcomes than planned procedures. At present there are limited
      guidelines for the management of acutely symptomatic hernias and therefore practice varies
      between hospitals.

      This cohort study will capture information on patients treated in the UK for acutely
      symptomatic hernia, and will provide information on variation in assessment, and technical
      aspects of repair. It will also capture health utility data out to 90 days post discharge
      from hospital.
