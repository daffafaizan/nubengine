    
      In prosthetic knee surgery, there is a certain number of patients with post-operative
      nocturnal pain.

      The purpose of our study is to determine the impact of this problem and to better understand
      its risk factors.

      This is a poorly studied issue and the study could better detect, evaluate and treat painful
      patients after knee replacement surgery.
