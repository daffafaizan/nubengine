    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare, in a Phase III setting, disease-free survival and overall survival of
      patients who have undergone potentially curative resection of Dukes' B or C carcinoma of the
      colon randomly assigned to adjuvant therapy with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin vs.
      5-fluorouracil/levamisole vs. 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/levamisole.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Single-agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation.
      5-Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with Leucovorin calcium, Citrovorum Factor, CF, NSC-3590.
      Arm II: Single-agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation plus Biological Response Modifier
      Therapy. 5-FU; with CF; plus Levamisole, LEV, NSC-177023. Arm III: Single-agent Chemotherapy
      plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. 5-FU; plus LEV.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,800 evaluable patients will be accrued over about 3 years; an additional
      2 years will be required before final analysis.
