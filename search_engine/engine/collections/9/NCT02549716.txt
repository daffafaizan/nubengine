      detrimental micro and macroscopic effects on the brain that can ultimately cause secondary
      brain injury. The anti-pyretic effects of oral acetaminophen have been studied in critically
      ill patients but no study has been able to compare these effects to the IV form of
      acetaminophen also known as OFIRMEV. The investigators wish to explore the notion that IV
      acetaminophen will be more effective than enteral acetaminophen in reducing the incidence of
      non-infectious fevers in critically ill patients. In addition, the investigators propose to
      study the levels of inflammatory cytokines after administration of IV or enteral
      acetaminophen, as well as, determine the incidence of vasospasm in SAH patients treated with
      IV acetaminophen. Currently, external ventricular drain (EVD) placement is the "standard of
      care" in patients who present with SAH and altered mental status/coma. The presence of an EVD
      allows for continuous sampling and removal of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as necessary to
      alleviate dangerous elevations in intracranial pressure. This clinical scenario allows for a
      unique, continuous outlet to access the CSF, without placing patients at risk, and without
      further invasive procedures (i.e. repeated spinal taps). These samples of CSF can be assayed
      for levels of acetaminophen, as well as inflammatory markers of fever which include
      interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and thromboxane-2 (TXA-2), in patients selected
      to be given enteral or IV acetaminophen.
