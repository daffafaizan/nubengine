    
      Purpose: It is hoped that by determining acceptability, safety and efficacy of this widely
      used short course, single-dose bowel preparation regimen, pediatric gastroenterologist can
      have a standardized bowel preparation for colonoscopy that will be acceptable to pediatric
      patients and their parents.

      Research Design: This study is a prospective medication trial. It will utilize laboratory
      data to detect any electrolyte changes, a patient questionnaire to assess an acceptable
      duration, tolerance and side effects of the regimen. Efficacy of the cleanout will be
      assessed using a published standardized bowel preparation scale by the endoscopist at the
      completion of the colonoscopy.

      Methodology /Technical Approach (including the number of subjects to be studied.): We
      estimate that 50 patients aged 8-18 years old military dependents who are undergoing a
      colonoscopy by the Pediatric Gastroenterology service at WRAMC/WRNMMC will be enrolled in the
      study between 1 Sep 2010 and 31 Dec 2011.
