2497. pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septumwhen the pulmonary valve is atretic andthe ventricular septum intact, the rightventricle usually consists of a small chamberwith a very thick wall capable of de-veloping high pressure.  this pathologic pictureis associated with clinical findingssimilar to those in tricuspid atresia-cyanosis,decreased pulmonary flow, left ven-tricular preponderance on the electrocardiogram,and early death.  the diagnosismay be confirmed by heart catheterization andselective angiocardiography with in-jection into the right ventricle, but the risk isgreat.  surgery has never been suc-cessful in the past; but because of the equallyhopeless prognosis on medical treat-ment, attempts should continue to be made.anastomosis of the superior vena cavato the right pulmonary artery appears to offerhope of success in the future.
