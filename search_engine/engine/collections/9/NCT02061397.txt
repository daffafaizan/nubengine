      ensure eligibility for the study. If found to be eligible, the participant will be given
      simvastatin at a starting dose of 20 mg, to be taken each evening by mouth. If after 2 months
      the simvastatin 20 mg dose is tolerated, the dose of simvastatin will be increased to 40 mg
      each evening by mouth. Doses may be adjusted as needed, should the participant experience
      side effects from simvastatin. The participant's dose of everolimus or sirolimus is not
      expected to change, as this is a dose that has been previously tolerated. If side effects
      occur as a result of the combination of drugs, the dosages may be adjusted by the study
      physician (investigator).
