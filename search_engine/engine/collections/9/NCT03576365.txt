      Distress and voice handicap were positively correlated, and perceived control moderated the
      relationship. Perceived control is associated with less distress in a variety of medical
      conditions, has an impact beyond that of coping and personality, and can be increased via
      targeted intervention.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the
      two groups. Both groups involve completing surveys and receiving information online about
      voice problem.

      Participants complete an initial baseline assessment focused on voice function and emotions,
      including items from the Perceived Control Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10, Perceived Stress
      Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18. Finally, the participants will complete some brief
      feedback questions about the material.

      Next, twice a week for up to three weeks participants will complete check-ins from the online
      program. Participants in the intervention arm will complete self-guided exercises and brief
      assessment questions. Participants in the information-only arm will complete mini knowledge
      quizzes.

      All participants will complete brief a post-intervention assessment parallel to the baseline
      assessment. Lastly, they will have an opportunity to provide final feedback on their
      experience.

      Follow-up with each participant will occur one and three months after finishing the program.
      Questionnaires will be sent via email including Voice Handicap Index-10, Present Perceived
      Control-8, and questions regarding treatment adherence and voice outcomes.
