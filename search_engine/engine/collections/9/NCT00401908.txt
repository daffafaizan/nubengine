      increased in the setting of acute coronary heart disease. The aim of the study is to
      establish the relative importance of the risk factors contributing to the death rate from
      acute digestive tract bleeding in patients admitted with acute coronary heart disease. This
      study will be conducted at MMC and involve collecting your clinical information from our
      medical records and computer systems. Approximately 200 adult patients with acute coronary
      heart disease and acute digestive tract bleeding admitted to MMC will be enrolled and
      followed up for 1 year after recruitment. We propose to develop criteria and a scoring system
      that will assist your doctors in caring for patients like you in the future.
