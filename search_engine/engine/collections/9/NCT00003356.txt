      follicular B-cell lymphoma treated with a combination of rituximab and low-dose interleukin-2
      (IL-2). II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 when given in conjunction with
      rituximab in this patient population. III. Assess whether antibody dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) is enhanced by in vivo exposure to IL-2 and whether ADCC activity
      correlates with clinical response in these patients. IV. Assess the incidence of
      antirituximab antibody formation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-5 and rituximab IV on
      day 3. Courses repeat weekly for up to 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients with low-grade/follicular lymphoma and 14-29
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma will be accrued for this study within 2-5 years.
