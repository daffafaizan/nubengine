      versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) for the treatment of acute cholecystitis
      considering the surgeon's work experience. This study examines complications, mortality
      rates, cost-effectiveness and safety of DLC versus ELC. This prospective randomized clinical
      trial was performed between November 2015-2016 in our General Surgery Clinic. Patients
      suffering acute cholecystitis in their first 72 hours of pain were enrolled in one of the two
      study groups: Group L (n:88) patients treated surgically with laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      immediately or Group D (n:88) patients first treated medically and than treated surgically
      with delayed (4-8 weeks later) laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All operations and medical
      treatments were done by surgeons having work experience <2 years.
