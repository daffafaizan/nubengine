      positioning by treating 20 patients using the device. Patients will be planned with CARA
      positioning and standard of care positioning. CARA plans will be evaluated to ensure all
      treatment planning goals are met and patients will proceed to treatment with CARA
      positioning. This pilot study will ensure that patients can be safely treated with the CARA
      and provide us with valuable information from therapists, oncologists and patients about the
      performance of the current design. This will also inform the direction of design improvements
      and the production of educational materials for training practitioners in the use of the
      device. Overall, this will prepare us for a randomized clinical trial of the CARA positioning
      technique versus current standard of practice to assess whether reduced toxicity can be
      achieved using the CARA technique.
