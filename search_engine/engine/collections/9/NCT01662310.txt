    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned
      drug), randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by a chance), placebo-controlled,
      and parallel-group study of paliperidone ER tablets. The study will consist of 6 phases: 14
      days of screening phase, 8 weeks of open-label run-in phase (participants will be flexibly
      dosed with paliperidone ER once daily in a dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg), 6 weeks of
      stabilization phase (participants will continue to receive the fixed dose of paliperidone
      ER), double-blind (DB) phase of various length (participants will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either paliperidone ER or placebo and this phase will be completed after
      86 relapse events are observed or if the study is positive at the interim analysis), 6 months
      of open-label extension (participants who experience a relapse event or who remain relapse
      free for the entire duration of the double-blind phase and participants who are enrolled at
      the time the study is terminated, will be eligible for this phase. All participants will be
      treated with paliperidone ER and safety and tolerability information will be collected during
      this phase) phase and 6 months of follow-up phase (participants who withdraw during the DB
      phase for any reason other than relapse will be followed for 6 months or until they
      experience a relapse). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
