      once-weekly D-cycloserine improved negative symptoms in schizophrenia subjects. We set out to
      test whether DCS combined with cognitive remediation would improve learning of a practiced
      auditory discrimination task and whether gains would generalize to unpracticed cognitive
      tasks.

      The proposed study consists of an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group
      trial of D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia outpatients.
      The primary outcome measure is change in performance on the MATRICS cognitive battery
      composite score after 8 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include a measure of processing
      speed assessed after weeks 1, 2, 4 & 8, and changes in negative symptoms and measures of
      functioning after 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, all outcome measures will be repeated at 6
      months to assess persistence of benefit.

      Hypotheses:

        1. D-cycloserine will significantly improve cognitive performance as measured by the
           composite score on the MATRICS battery compared to placebo after 8 weeks of cognitive
           remediation.

        2. D-cycloserine will significantly improve negative symptoms as measured by the SANS
           compared to placebo after 8 weeks when combined with cognitive remediation.

        3. D-cycloserine will significantly improve measures of functioning (GAS, QoL and CGI) at 8
           weeks compared to placebo when combined with cognitive remediation.

        4. D-cycloserine effects on cognition, negative symptoms and functioning will persist
           compared to placebo when assessed at 6-month follow-up.
