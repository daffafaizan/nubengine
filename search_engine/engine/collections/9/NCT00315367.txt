      Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this project is to examine the effects of Donepezil HCI
      (Aricept®) on memory induced brain activation patterns in the context of a double-blind,
      crossover trial of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We will perform task activation
      experiments involving two cognitive domains. The proposed work on MS patients should yield
      new information regarding functional anatomic relationships during cognitive activity, and
      how these relationships change as a function of drug treatment.
