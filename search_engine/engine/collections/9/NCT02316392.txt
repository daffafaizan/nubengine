      recruit about 5 lung transplant patients per year for 3 years. We will follow these patients
      at 6 months and 1 year with Hyperpolarized Helium-3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging and image
      guided bronchial biopsies to detect early BOS and to better understand BO disease
      progression. The biopsies will provide future research for rapid determination of cellular
      and molecular mechanisms that lead to BOS and to facilitate identification and validation of
      translatable pharmaceutical targets.
