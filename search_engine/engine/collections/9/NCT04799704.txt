      in both symptomatic and less symptomatic patients by means of serial sampling.

      A sample of the tears / conjunctiva will be taken with a soft brush (similar to a cotton
      swab) every three days until the end of the hospitalization. In addition, you must complete a
      questionnaire that assesses the symptoms present.
