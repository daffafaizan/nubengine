      during oocyte retrieval procedure in patients with only one follicle. Double lumen needle
      will be used and direct follicular aspiration without flushing will be performed for all
      patients. If an oocyte will be obtained, the patient will be assigned to group A. If not, at
      least 1 course of follicular flushing will be used until retrieval of an oocyte and the
      patient will be assigned to group B.
