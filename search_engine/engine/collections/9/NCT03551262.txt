      (NVUGIB) over the past decade including prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding, optimal use of
      endoscopic therapy and high-dose proton pump inhibition, this still carries considerable
      morbidity, mortality and health economic burden Of particular note are the re-bleeding rates,
      one of the most crucial predictive factors of morbidity and mortality that has not
      significantly improved as evident from longitudinal data in the past 15 years Although huge
      advances have been made in terms of therapeutic endoscopic devices available today, complete
      haemostasis of complicated lesions (i.e. severe bleeding from large vessels or fibrotic
      ulcer) still remains a challenge and can be difficult to achieve. In particular, traditional
      clipping devices often appear technically difficult to place and insufficient to provide
      adequate tissue compression to obliterate large bleeding vessels.

      The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) (Ovesco Endoscopy AG, Tubingen, Germany) system is a recently
      developed endoscopic device. In a preliminary experience, it has been successfully used in
      patients with severe bleeding or deep wall lesions, or perforations of the GI tract.

      Recent retrospectives studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of OTSC in patients
      undergoing emergency endoscopy for severe acute NVUGIB after failure of conventional
      techniques and as first-line To the best of the investigator's knowledge, no randomized
      clinical trial have been performed investigating the use of OTSC as first-line endoscopic
      treatment in patients with high-risk NVUGIB.
