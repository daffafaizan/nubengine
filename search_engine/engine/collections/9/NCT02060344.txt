      support centers.

      Study participants aged 18-74 years underwent an extensive clinic exam and assessments to
      determine baseline risk factors. Annual follow-up interviews will be conducted for 2-4 years
      to determine health outcomes of interest. Study results will be disseminated through
      scientific journals and also conveyed to the communities involved in the study in order to
