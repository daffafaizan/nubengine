    
      In this study, 26 adult women meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as defined
      in DSM 5, will be randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase I
      clinical trial of pregnenolone (i.e. each participant receives 500 mg/d, 800 mg/d
      pregnenolone and placebo in random order). The study will consist of three 7-day treatment
      exposures to each pregnenolone dose with a 14-day washout between each exposure. Baseline
      evaluation will include medical and psychiatric history, psychiatric interview, standard
      laboratory analyses (i.e., blood draw, ECG), and a brief cognitive battery. Neuroimaging will
      be collected after each study drug or placebo administration. Study drug tolerability and
      participant safety will be assessed throughout the study (6 in-clinic visits + a safety
      visit) using structured clinical interviews, self-report questionnaires, and standard
      laboratory analyses.
