      hospitals in Germany have confirmed their participation. Hospitals are randomized into two
      groups: a control and an interventional group. The control group receives conventional CMEs.
      The interventional group receives tools for increasing awareness such as posters and
      brochures. Quality measure such as benchmarking and feedback of quality indicators are used.
      Depending on the improvement process tools such as SWOT analyses and resistance radar will be
      implemented.

      The CRT was preceded by a 5 months observational study (Dec. 2010 - April 2011). In about
      1000 patients, participating hospitals documented their patients with severe sepsis or septic
      shock into a register. These data are used for final sample size calculation of the CRT and
      for stratification of the randomization.

      The groups switch after completion of the CRT and observation continues. Thus, centers of the
      control group now receive the change management while the former intervention group is now
      without external support and is assessed for sustainability of the intervention. This study
      phase is planned for Nov. 2013 until March 2015. Sample size will be calculated when the CRT
      has been finished.
