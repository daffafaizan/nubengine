      Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk for osteoporosis. This study
      was to investigate the effectiveness on quality of life (QOL), patient satisfaction in
      postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene/cholecalciferol combination therapy. In addition,
      we analyzed adverse events to assess the safety profile of this drug.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-critical observational study of women receiving
      raloxifene/cholecalciferol (raloxifene 60mg + cholecalciferol 800 IU, Rabone DÂ®, Hanmi
      Pharma, South Korea) combination therapy to treat or prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis.
      Data will be collected from patients receiving routine treatment at about 105 primary,
      secondary, or tertiary medical institutions in South Korea. Each subject visits the
      institution according to the protocol that designed the follow-up visits for six months to
      examine changes in, and factors influencing quality of life (EQ-5D-5L method), patient
      satisfaction with efficacy and convenience (questionnaire), and safety. This study will
      approved by the institutions' IRBs and is in compliance with clinical research ethics
      regulations.
