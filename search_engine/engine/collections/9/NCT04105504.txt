      weeks, used as a skin-whitening agent.

      The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, set at
      Dermatology outpatient clinic at three different hospitals in Indonesia, Gatot Seobroto Army
      Hospital Jakarta, Dr. dr. Wahiddin Soedirohoesodo Hospital Makassar, and University of
      Sumatera Utara Teaching Hospital Medan.

      Ninety healthy females, aged between 33 and 50 years, were randomized to receive either
      glutathione capsules (500 mg) or placebo capsules, which were identical in appearance and
      packaged in identical-looking containers. The capsules were taken once daily for 12 weeks and
      evaluated every 4 weeks. Compliance was assessed by counting the remaining capsules at each
      follow-up visit.

      At each follow-up visit, subjects were asked to grade the overall response and questioned
      regarding adverse events. The objective or main outcome was total reduction (improvement) of
      spot UV, spot polarization, and skin tone measured at five different sites for each indices,
