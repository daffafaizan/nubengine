      mortality of congenital heart disease. Inhaled iloprost has been approved for the treatment
      of adults with PH, but little is known about the effects in children with PH.

      Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue. When applied by inhalation, it selectively dilates
      pulmonary vessels without side affecting the systemic circulation. There is no RCTs of
      iloprost have previously been performed in this indication.
