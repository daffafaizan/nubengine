      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study will enroll patients from the UC Davis
      Multiple Sclerosis clinic. At a single study visit, we will confirm eligibility, obtain
      clinical information, and collect blood samples. We will then process these samples to obtain
      RNA for subsequent microarray analysis. DNA will also be used to examine single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) on chips that allow us to examine 1 million of these SNPs. The SNPs may
      allow us to diagnose a disease like multiple sclerosis or to predict a treatment or cause. In
      addition, the DNA may be used to determine if there are any small mutations in any of the
      genes in the individuals who donate their blood. Additional studies will be done on blood
      plasma, testing for inflammatory molecules called eicosanoids and cytokines. The data from
      these tests will be superimposed on the microarray data to determine a molecular profile for
      each patient. We will then compare the data obtained between patient groups to determine gene
      alterations specific for each condition.
