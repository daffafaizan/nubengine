      Screening: Participants will have test, procedures, and assessments done for safety and
      eligibility. Some may be done for research purposes only. Several visits may be needed to
      complete the screening part of the study.

      Study Drug Period: During this part, participants will take the study drug as prescribed by
      the study doctor. While on the study drug, participants will visit the clinic about once a
      week for tests, procedures, and assessments for safety, eligibility, and research only
      purposes.

      End of Study Drug Visit and Follow-up: Participants will be asked to make an End of Study
      Drug visit about 30 days after the last dose of study drugs for safety, eligibility, and
      research only purposes. After this visit, participants will continue to have follow-up visits
      about every 8 weeks. If participants are experiencing side effects, they will be followed
      weekly for about 4 weeks, then monthly until resolution or stabilization.
