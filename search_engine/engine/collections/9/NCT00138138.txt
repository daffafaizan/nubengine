    
      This study is open to men who have prostate cancer and report feeling fatigue. We will
      examine the impact of psychostimulant treatment on depressive symptom severity,
      neuropsychological test performance, and overall quality of life, as well as compare the
      frequency and severity of treatment associated adverse side effects. We will be conducting a
      six-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial, evaluating the
      relative benefits and risks of methylphenidate, (a psychostimulant medication). Medication
      will be given in once or twice daily dosages (at 8 am and noon) and titrated by one capsule
      every 2-3 days as needed to treat fatigue and as tolerated. Patients will be examined
      regularly for safety. We will monitor vital signs and response to the medication. This study
      will be the first of its kind to evaluate a pharmacologic intervention for fatigue in cancer
      patients that utilizes a novel psychotropic agent (psychostimulant), and assesses outcome
      with measures of fatigue, as well as side effects, psychological distress, depression and
      overall quality of life.

      Objectives: To study the efficacy of methylphenidate vs. placebo in the treatment of fatigue
      in ambulatory men with prostate cancer.

      To study the frequency and severity of adverse side effects associated with this
      psychostimulant drug.

      To study the effects of psychostimulant treatment for fatigue on related domains of
      psychosocial function and quality of life.
