      diagnose or more difficult to treat are eligible to participate in this study. All enrolled
      patients will have targeted sequencing of tumor performed. Sequencing results will be
      reviewed for clinically significant findings including determination of whether any mutations
      exist that suggest potential for activity of a targeted therapy (iCat recommendation).
      Results will be returned to the patient's oncologist and follow-up data will be collected.

      In this prospective multi-center cohort study, the primary objective is to describe the
      outcomes of pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors according to whether or not they
      received of targeted therapy matched to an iCat recommendation. The primary clinical outcome
      of interest is the endpoint of overall survival (OS), with progression-free survival and
      response rate (RR) as key secondary clinical outcome measures. To address this hypothesis,
      825 patients will enroll from an anticipated 11 participating institutions over 3 years.
