    
      Randomized study with 6 visits. For all dose groups a screening visit will be followed by a
      baseline visit 14 days later (qualification period). At the end of the qualification period
      patients who still exhibit signs of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) at the baseline visit
      will be enrolled into a 3-month treatment period. At the baseline (Day 0) visit, patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive either AZR-MD-001 ointment/semi-solid drug or AZR-MD-001
      vehicle twice-weekly.
