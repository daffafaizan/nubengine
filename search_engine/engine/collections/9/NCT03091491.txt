    
      This study examines the outcome of nivolumab single agent versus nivolumab-ipilimumab
      combination in patients with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC who have failed one line of standard EGFR
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) and not more than one line of chemotherapy regimen. The use
      of 3rd generation EGFR TKI for patients with acquired mutation that substitute a threonine
      (T) with a methionine (M) at position 790 of exon 20 (T790M) is allowed.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either nivolumab monotherapy
      (Arm A) or nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy (Arm B) and will be stratified according
      to the following factors:

        -  Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL1) status: <1% vs â‰¥1%

        -  Presence of brain metastasis

        -  Institution: National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute, and
           Johns Hopkins Singapore-Tan Tock Seng Hospital

      Both arms will continue with treatment regimen till disease progression or discontinuation of
      treatment due to adverse events.

      Arm A patients are allowed to cross over to Arm B in the event of clear-cut disease
      progression.

      On-study tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 12
      weeks till clear-cut disease progression.

      The radiologist will be blinded to the treatment arm that the patient is randomised to ensure
      an objective response evaluation.
