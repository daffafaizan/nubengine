      correlated with enhanced well-being and improved resilience in a variety of populations.
      Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to reduce stress and symptoms of burnout in
      physicians. However, the two studies that included residents were observational trials
      evaluating the effect of an abbreviated, informal mindfulness course.

      The aim of the investigator's study is to assess whether a standardized course in mindfulness
      meditation (Mindful Awareness Practices, MAPs) reduces self--reported signs and symptoms of
      stress, burnout, depression, anxiety, loneliness and poor sleep quality in residents in
      pediatrics training. This study is a randomized controlled trial using 2 parallel groups. The
      pediatrics residents randomized to the intervention will participate in a standardized
      mindful awareness practices intervention consisting of one live 45- minute session and 5
      web--based self--study sessions. The live session will be administered by a trained
      mindfulness educator at the UCLA Westwood, Olive View Medical Center and Cedars--Sinai
      Medical Center campuses. The waitlist group will have the opportunity to participate in the
      same course once the study has been completed. Participants will respond to questionnaires to
      assess for levels of stress and other mental health measures before and after the
      intervention to see if the intervention group had a reduction in symptoms compared to the
      waitlist group.
