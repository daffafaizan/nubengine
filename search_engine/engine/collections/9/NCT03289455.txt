      expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL
      will be enrolled in both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in
      order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the
      autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a CD19 and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product.
      Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO3
      intravenously as a single or split dose and will then enter a 24-month follow-up period.
