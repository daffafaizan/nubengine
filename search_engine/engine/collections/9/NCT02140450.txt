      proven.Acute intraocular pressure elevation most probably is volume related and long term
      intraocular pressure elevation relates to pharmacologic features of the medications which
      results in anatomic changes in the angle of anterior chamber.Numerous studies found an
      intraocular pressure elevation right after the injection and quick normalization within
      maximally 30 minutes.This intraocular pressure elevation which lasts about 30 minutes, can
      result in irreversible visual loss especially in patients with critical remaining nerve
      fibers in the optic nerve head, as occurs in glaucomatous patients. Is there any way to
      prevent or even shorten this time of intraocular pressure elevation? We tried in our study to
      find a suitable response for a question above, so we used several anti-glaucoma agents
      (Timolol, Brimonidine, Acetazolamide, Mannitol versus placebo) as a prophylaxis to prevent
      acute intraocular pressure elevation right after intravitreal bevacizumab injection.
