      in patients with relapsed non-mucinous EOC, who have had disease progression following
      maintenance therapy with a Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] polymerisation
      inhibitor (PARPi) and a complete or partial radiological response to subsequent treatment
      with platinum-based chemotherapy or may have no evidence of disease (if optimal cytoreductive
      surgery was conducted prior to chemotherapy), and no evidence of a rising CA-125. Patients
      will be enrolled on the basis of their breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1, BRCA2)
      status into one of two cohorts (BRCA1/2 [+ve] and BRCA1/2 [-ve]). The BRCA1/2 (+ve) and
      BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohorts will be randomised separately. Within each cohort, patients will be
      randomised by prospective allocation in a 2:1 ratio (Olaparib: matching placebo).
