      gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the perianal area. Symptoms depend on location of
      the disease, however, many patients experience some aspect of recurrent abdominal pain,
      nausea, emesis, and unintentional weight loss. A common and challenging dilemma is how to
      manage patients who continue to have some degree of symptoms despite a common treatment
      regimen typically consisting of corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti-TNF alpha
      therapies. With the recent wave of medicinal cannabis legalization in many states, many
      patients have begun using cannabis or commercially available cannabidiol-containing compounds
      as an adjunct therapy for their symptoms related to chronic inflammation and pain.
