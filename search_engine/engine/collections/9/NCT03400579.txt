      ischemic conditioning (RIC) by emergency medical services (EMS) in the prehospital setting.
      Eligible patients will be at least 18 years of age, and require ground ambulance transport to
      the hospital. Patients suspected of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) based on the
      prehospital electrocardiogram and thus requiring urgent intervention in the cardiac
      catheterization lab will be excluded.

      All subjects will undergo the standard RIC procedure (i.e., up to four cycles of alternating
      5-min inflation and 5-min deflation) with the autoRICÂ® device (CellAegis Devices, Inc.). The
      automated procedure will be initiated by paramedics during ambulance transport, and the RIC
      cycles will continue through emergency department (ED) arrival and stay for a total of 40
      minutes.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the duration of RIC administered in
      patients having the procedure initiated in the prehospital setting. The investigators
      hypothesize four cycles of RIC will be completed in at least 80% of patients having the
      procedure initiated. Secondary objectives are to assess enrollment rates and protocol
      implementation; paramedic acceptability of protocol; and patient tolerability of RIC.
