    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of tetracaine,
      para- butylaminobenzoic acid (PBBA), and oxymetazoline after intranasal administration of the
      recommended, weight-based Phase 3 dose of Kovacaine Mist (Tetracaine Hydrochloride with
      Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride) to healthy pediatric subjects.

      Kovacaine Mist is an anesthetic solution containing 3% tetracaine hydrochloride and 0.05%
      oxymetazoline hydrochloride. A single spray dose of 100 μL Kovacaine Mist contains 3 mg
      tetracaine HCl and 0.05 mg oxymetazoline HCl. A two-100 μL spray dose (a total of 200 μL) of
      Kovacaine Mist contains 6 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.1 mg oxymetazoline HCl. A two-200 μL spray
      dose (a total of 400 μL) of Kovacaine Mist contains 12 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.2 mg
      oxymetazoline HCl.

      Kovacaine Mist will be administered based on the weight of the subject as summarized in the
      table below. Subjects weighing 10 to <20 kg will receive 1 intranasal spray of 100 μL of
      Kovacaine Mist at time D0. Subjects weighing 20 to <40 kg will receive 2 intranasal sprays of
      100 μL (total dose 200 μL) administered 4 minutes apart at times D0 and D4. Subjects weighing
      40 kg or more will receive 2 intranasal sprays of 200 μL (total dose 400 μL) administered 4
      minutes apart at times D0 and D4.
