      myofascial trigger point. Participants will be asked to perform a sustained scapular
      elevation task at their peak force until the force decrease 50 %, which indicates upper
      trapezius muscle fatigue. There are two purposes in the current study: (1) to compare the
      differences between overhead athletes with/without upper trapezius myofascial trigger point
      during arm elevation in scapular kinematics and muscles activities (2) to investigate the
      effects of upper trapezius muscle fatigue on scapular kinematics and muscles activities in
      overhead athletes with/without upper trapezius myofascial trigger point. The first hypothesis
      is that the subjects with upper trapezius myofascial trigger point will show significant
      difference in scapular kinematics and muscles activities when compared to subjects without
      upper trapezius myofascial trigger point. Besides, the investigators suggest that subjects
      with/without upper trapezius myofascial trigger point will show significant difference in
      scapular kinematics and muscles activities after upper trapezius muscle fatigue, especially
      in subjects with upper trapezius myofascial trigger point. The outcome measurements includes
      scapular kinematics (upward/downward rotation, external/internal rotation, posterior/anterior
      tilting) and muscles activities (upper trapezius, serratus anterior, lower trapezius).
