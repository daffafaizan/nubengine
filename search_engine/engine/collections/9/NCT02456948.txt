    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter proof-of-principle trial
      of adjunctive minocycline for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). The
      study tests the antidepressant efficacy of minocycline as an adjunct to an antidepressant
      standard treatment (AD-ST), for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). The
      respective AD, for which non-response has been documented, must be on a stable regimen for at
      least 14 days prior to inclusion. AD-ST will then be continued throughout the trial. Trial
      medication is adjunct oral minocycline 200 mg/day or placebo. Response to treatment will be
      measured via the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The total study duration
      for each patient will be 6 weeks.
