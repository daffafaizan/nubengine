      sensory fibers. Conventional subjective tooth assessments (percussion, palpation, cold, and
      electrical pulp testing) and objective pulpal blood flow measurements will be used for teeth
      that are planned for extraction and also up to 2-5 additional teeth in each participant. The
      correlation between a single combined score from collective conventional subjective tooth
      assessments and the objective pulse oximetry reading for selected teeth will be used to
      evaluate if pulse oximeter measurements are a reliable marker for patient's reported
      symptoms.
