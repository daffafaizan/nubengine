      the major advancements in LASIK has been the introduction of Femtosecond Laser technology for
      flap creation. Several studies have compared microkeratome and femtosecond laser technology,
      showing superior accuracy and precision of flap dimensions in the latter.

      The Femtosecond Laser technology provides different parameters and settings that can be
      changed according to the surgeon's preference. One of such parameters is the side-cut angle.
      Some of the most common side-cut angles used today include 45, 70, 90, and 110 degrees.
      Previous studies have reported on the visual outcomes of side-cut angles, but head to head
      comparisons are lacking. Currently, there are no studies comparing the safety and efficacy of
      the 70 and 110 side-cut angles in FS-LASIK. Information regarding the outcomes and
      complication rates between these side-cut angles will provide an objective measure that can
      be used when deciding which one is more suitable in FS-LASIK.

      One angle will be performed on the right eye and the other on the left eye. The study will
      evaluate uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, intraoperative, and
      postoperative complications. Performing different side-cut angles on the same individual will
      allow a direct comparison of outcomes, minimizing confounding variables.
