        -  Determine the efficacy of exemestane and trastuzumab (Herceptin), in terms of response
           rate and time to progression, in postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally
           advanced hormone-responsive, HER2/neu positive breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral exemestane
      once daily. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
