      symptomatic bacterial Vaginosis(BV). Standard treatment for BV is metronidazole. Although the
      reported cure rate is as high as 90%, the recurrence rate is 58% after 12 months. The study
      hypothesis is that GoldenCare will cure BV. This is a proof of concept study to collect
      preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of GoldenCare.
