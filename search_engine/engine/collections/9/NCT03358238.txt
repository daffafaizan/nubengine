      depression. Bipolar disorder is successfully treated by combining medication with
      psychosocial therapy, but care can prove inadequate in practice. With gaps in coverage and
      medication, along with imprecise guidelines on when, where, and how to intervene, promising
      psychosocial therapies require adaptive strategies to better address the specific needs of
      individuals in a timely manner. To accomplish this, however, requires evidence-based
      practices for adapting a psychosocial therapy. The long-term goal of this study is to address
      this knowledge gap, by establishing a mobile health platform for translating a psychosocial
      therapy in bipolar disorder into an effective adaptive intervention.

      An important first step and the specific goal of this study is to answer the question of how
      to engage individuals with bipolar disorder in long-term monitoring of their daily patterns
      of mood, stress, sleep, circadian rhythm, and medical adherence. To answer this question,
      individuals with bipolar disorder will interact with a smart-phone application and activity
      tracker over six weeks. Individuals will record their symptoms twice-daily with the
      smart-phone application while activity, sleep, and heart rate are recorded with their
      activity tracker. In addition, individuals will be interviewed on a weekly basis. The study
      focuses on testing three engagement strategies: using activity trackers rather than
      self-reports; reviewing recorded symptoms with another person on a weekly basis; and
      synthesizing a person's data into charts and graphs.
