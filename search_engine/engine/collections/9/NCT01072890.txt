      inhibitors, and other novel agents, patients rarely achieve complete disease response and
      ultimately undergo disease progression. The limited efficacy of single-target inhibition may
      be due to numerous, overlapping signaling pathways involved in Renal Cell Carcinoma
      proliferation and growth. A strategy of multi-target "vertical inhibition" of the overlapping
      aberrant VEGF and mTOR pathways by combination therapy may translate to enhanced efficacy
      over each single agent alone. We hypothesize that temsirolimus and pazopanib can be
      administered safely in combination and that combined targeting of the mTOR and VEGFR
      signaling pathways will be effective in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.
