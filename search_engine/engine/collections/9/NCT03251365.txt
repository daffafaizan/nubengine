      HGUCR, authors will include a population of 42 patients, n = 21 in each group, I and II, with
      diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which will be surgically resected with curative
      intention, in the next two years, 2017-2018, with extended follow-up for at least two years
      more for survival study Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral
      contrast, 21 subjects were required in the first group and 21 participants in the second
      Group to detect as statistically significant difference between two proportions, for group I
      is expected to be 0.05 and for Group II 0.4, in relation to survival in five years. It has
      been estimated a rate of loss of patients of 10%

        -  Group I. After cytoreductive surgery, R0, and intestinal reconstruction, the patient
           after multidisciplinary study will receive adjuvant treatment with iv gemcitabine , 1000
           mg / m2 for at least 4 cycles

        -  Group II.After a R0 cytoreductive surgery, HIPEC is performed with gemcitabine, 120mg /
           m2 for 30' + adjuvant treatment with iv gemcitabine , 1000 mg / m2 for at least 4 cycles
           The aim is identifying morbidity and mortality associated to treatment by cytoreductive
           surgery and HIPEC with gemcitabine+ systemic chemotherapy,Group II, respect to a
           conventional treatment group that includes cytoreductive surgery with systemic
           chemotherapy, Group I,and identifying survival of the experimental Group with treatment
           with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC with gemcitabine ,respect to the conventional
           treatment group,GI
