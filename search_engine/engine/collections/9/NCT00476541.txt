    
      The overall objective is to improve the cure rate of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The specific aims are as follows:

      1.1 Therapeutic aims

      To improve the event-free survival (EFS) of AML patients who undergo risk-adapted therapy.

      To improve the overall survival (OS) by reserving stem cell transplantation (SCT) to
      high-risk patients based on cytogenetics and response to induction therapy.

      To compare the outcome of SCT using HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) or HLA-matched unrelated
      donor (MUD).

      To assess the efficacy and toxicity of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg) as post
      consolidation therapy.

      1.2 Biologic aims

      To study minimal residual disease (MRD) levels in blood and bone marrow (BM) at defined time
      points and to study the prognostic impact of MRD.

      To test in vitro cellular drug resistance at diagnosis and relapse, and correlate these data
      to background factors and clinical outcome.

      To secure storage of biological material from diagnosis for future biologic studies
