      Domicile) to reduce hospitalization duration in patients with COPD exacerbation. This
      strategy will enable an early return home, patients using an innovative device that
      automatically adjusts and wean the oxygen flow (FreeO2 system) coupled to telemedicine and
      tele-rehabilitation.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that a strategy for an early return home with a home
      hospitalization managed by telemedicine will reduce the length of hospitalization by 50
      percent from 30 days.
