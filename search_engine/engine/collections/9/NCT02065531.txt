    
      Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Objective: to determine the effects of myofascial soft
      tissue release versus mobilization with impulse technique torsion (anterior) on pain,
      disability and kinesiophobia in individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain.

      Methods and Measures: sixty-four individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

      Intervention: For 12-week, the group 1 will undergo treatment comprising a myofascial soft
      tissue release protocol (1/week) and the group 2 will receive a mobilization with impulse
      technique torsion (anterior) (1/week).

      Main Outcome Measures: Intensity of pain, disability, fear of movement, isometric endurance
      of trunk flexor muscles and lumbar mobility in flexion data will be collected at baseline,
      and 24hr after the last manual therapy application. Mixed-model analyses of variance will be
      used to examine the effects of the treatment on each outcome measure.
