        -  Determine the complete radiographic response in patients with newly diagnosed primary
           CNS lymphoma treated with methotrexate and thiotepa.

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether tumor expression of BCL-6 is associated with response to this
           chemotherapy regimen and survival of these patients.

        -  Describe the relationship between initial response to steroids (if administered),
           response to this chemotherapy regimen, and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive thiotepa IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive methotrexate IV
      over 4 hours on days 1 (8 hours after thiotepa) and 14. Beginning 24 hours after the start of
      methotrexate infusion, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV or orally every 6 hours until
      rescue is achieved. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving disappearance of enhancement
      of disease on MRI receive an additional 28-day course followed by maintenance therapy
      comprising thiotepa and methotrexate once a month for 11 courses.

      Patients undergo neuro-ophthalmologic exams annually for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-20
      months.
