      BTX-A-HAC NG solution (50 U) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified according to gender and
      severity of glabellar lines at maximum frown (moderate to severe) at Baseline. A single dose
      of BTX-A-HAC NG solution 50 U or placebo was injected on Day 1. Subjects were then monitored
      at the study centre for 30 minutes. On Day 4, subjects were contacted by telephone for
      adverse event monitoring and to record concomitant medications and treatments.

      Subjects attended follow-up visits at the study centre on Days 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 148
      and 183. The Day 183 follow-up visit was the end of study visit; all subjects who had
      completed the Day 183 Visit were considered to have completed the study.
