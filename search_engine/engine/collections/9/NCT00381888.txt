      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of prolonged (4 weeks) fondaparinux sodium administration in
           venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients undergoing gynecologic oncology surgery.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks).

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Beginning after surgery, patients receive fondaparinux sodium subcutaneously once daily on
      days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremities between day 28-35.
