    
      This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, three-period, two-way crossover study in healthy
      subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, three treatment
      periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each period will be two days in duration (Day 1 through
      Day 2) for dosing and sample collection. There will be a minimum of four days washout between
      doses.

      Within no more than 21 days (Day -21) and no less than two days (Day -2) prior to the start
      of Period 1, subjects will undergo routine screening procedures including physical
      examination (PE), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, clinical laboratory safety
      tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), serology screen, and drug/alcohol
      screen.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted into the study center on Day -1 of Period 1 for baseline
      assessments. During each period, subjects will receive a single 25 mg oral dose of
      lenalidomide on Day 1 according to the assigned treatment sequence. Serial blood sampling for
      the determination of lenalidomide concentrations in plasma will be performed for 24 hours
      post dose, and safety will be evaluated. Subjects will be domiciled at the study center from
      Day 1 of Period 1 through Day 2 of Period 3, including the 4 day washout between each dose of
      IP. All subjects will be discharged from the study center on Day 2 of Period 3 following
      completion of required study procedures.

      A follow-up phone call will occur approximately four days (Â±2 days) after discharge from the
      study center.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation
      (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).
