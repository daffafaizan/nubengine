      dairy consumption to lower levels of dairy consumption during an energy deficit resulting
      from 300 kcal of exercise. Participants were 24 sedentary and overweight boys, 13-15 years of
      age and girls, 12 to 14 years of age, and consuming 1 or fewer servings of dairy and less
      than 600 mg calcium per day at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either higher
      or lower dairy for 6 days and then crossed over to the opposite treatment subsequent to 2
      weeks of wash out. The investigators provided all meals and snacks for the participants
      during the higher and lower dairy conditions. During the wash out period, participants were
      instructed to consume their normal diet as assessed at baseline which consisted of 1 or fewer
      servings of dairy and less than 600 mg calcium. Participants stayed in the calorimeter at
      baseline, day 7, and day 28 (end of study), after crossover. The calorimeter measured
      substrate oxidation under the condition of a 300 kcal energy deficit due to exercise.
