      I. Identify baseline clinical characteristics and treatment strategies in patients with
      AIDS-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) that correlate with long-term survival (>= 2
      years). (Primary clinical objective) II. Identify differentially expressed genes in PEL that
      are associated with long-term survival (>= 2 years). (Primary genomic objective)

      OUTLINE:

      Medical chart review is performed and patient information is collected regarding human
      immunodeficiency virus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS medical history, staging of
      AIDS related malignancy, and type of treatment. Previously collected tissue samples are
      analyzed via ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and microarray.
