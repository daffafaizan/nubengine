    
      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial in which hypertensive hemodialysis patients will be
      randomized to a low dialysate sodium (Na) of 135 mEq/L or a standard dialysate Na of 138
      mEq/L. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to the low arm. Dialysate Na will be lowered 1 mEq/L
      every 2 weeks, as tolerated. Tolerance will be assessed by symptoms, intradialytic
      hypotension (IDH) episodes (systolic BP <90 or intervention for symptoms or BP drop during
      dialysis), achievement of dry weight. The trial will last for 6 to 12 months, for an
      individual, depending on when they entered the trial. The primary outcome is feasibility and
      safety of using the lower dialysate sodium which is assessed by symptoms during or
      immediately after dialysis, intradialytic hypotension episodes and the frequency of emergency
      room visits and hospitalizations. Several secondary outcomes will be measured including blood
      pressure prior to dialysis and at home, change in plasma Na over time, dry weight,
      post-dialysis weight, interdialytic weight change, symptoms of thirst and dry mouth,
      self-reported dialysis recovery time, relative blood volume change during a single treatment
      (via 'Critline') and, in patients without an implanted electronic device, extraceullular
      fluid volume (via bioimpedance).
