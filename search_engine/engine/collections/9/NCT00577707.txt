      resectable stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. However, the 5-year survival continues to be disappointing
      despite this standard of care. This study incorporates targeted therapy with an epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as part of a multimodality
      strategy for stage IB-IIIA resectable NSCLC tumors with a known EGFR activating mutation. The
      rationale for including only patients with EGFR mutations is based on recent data that
      reported that patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumor harbor EGFR activating mutations had
      an objective response rate of 71% with gefitinib compared with a 1% objective response rate
      in patients with EGFR wild-type tumors.
