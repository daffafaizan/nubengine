      has been slow. We hypothesize that longitudinal CSF access can provide insights regarding
      tumor identity, behavior and the efficacy of candidate therapies. Although multiple studies
      have evaluated CSF from patients with brain tumors, very few have collected CSF at multiple
      timepoints throughout the course of disease. However, multiple samples over time are needed
      to determine if candidate biomarkers accurately reflect the evolution of disease. CSF is
      typically obtained via lumbar puncture which is inconvenient and often uncomfortable. This
      protocol will evaluate the safety and feasibility of placing Ommaya reservoirs at the time of
      surgery. It is anticipated that reducing barriers to CSF access through placement of an
      Ommaya reservoir may expedite brain tumor research and facilitate the development of
      individualized treatment strategies.

      An Ommaya Reservoir will be placed during a planned brain tumor operation. Following the
      routine portion of the planned procedure, the Ommaya reservoir will be placed under the scalp
      with the catheter tip placed either within the ventricle or the resection cavity. Presence of
      the Ommaya reservoir will enable CSF to be easily accessed at any time in the future. It is
      expected that CSF will be collected at 2 or more timepoints. CSF will be stored in the Mayo
      Clinic neuro-oncology biorepository and made available in a de-identified manner for multiple
      research projects. The patient and his/her provider(s) may take advantage of the Ommaya
      reservoir and/or banked CSF samples to facilitate participation in any relevant IRB-approved
      research study(s), and/or to facilitate individualized management. The details of each time
      the Ommaya is accessed will be documented as part of this trial.
