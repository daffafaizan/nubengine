      genomic landscape of ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically at the
      time of disease progression following treatment with ALK inhibitors. Recently, secondary ALK
      mutations, L1196M and G1269A have been described in patients with acquired resistance to
      crizotinib. A small subset of ALK positive lung cancer patients who progressed after
      treatment with ceritinib had tumors available for molecular analysis. Secondary mutations
      found included G1202R, F1174C, and F1174V. While this is interesting, an unbiased genomic
      study (exome or whole genome sequencing) using massively parallel sequencing at the time of
      disease progression is critical to fully understand the clonal evolution and the molecular
      mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance. To the best of the investigators' knowledge,
      such a study has not yet been reported.

      The investigators believe the time is ripe now to comprehensively characterize genomic
      alterations using massively parallel sequencing technology of ALK driven adenocarcinoma of
      the lung to fully understand the clonal heterogeneity before therapy and fully understand the
      clonal evolution and the molecular mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance. A better
      understanding of genomic alterations through an unbiased comprehensive approach likely would
      lead to rationally designed therapy to augment response to ALK inhibitors.
