      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Insulin Tregopil (2 dose levels: 30 mg, 45 mg) compared
      with IAsp in the treatment of T2DM patients. Part II of the study is the Phase III,
      multi-center, randomized, open label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Insulin Tregopil (30 mg or 45 mg based upon the outcome of Part I data) compared with IAsp in
      the treatment of T2DM patients. For Part I and Part II, the study duration will be
      approximately 37 weeks (3 weeks Screening, 8 weeks Run-in, 24 weeks Treatment, 2 weeks Safety
      follow-up). An Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate the data
      from Part I of the study. Part II of the study will be initiated after approval from the
      office of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      recommendation based on review of data from Part I of the study. In both Part I and Part II
      of the study, T2DM patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5 to 10% (both inclusive), on
      stable dose of metformin ± oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) ± basal insulin who are eligible
      for insulin glargine administration as per investigator discretion and who satisfy the
      selection criteria will be enrolled. The eligible patients will go through a Run-in period of
      8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks Run-in period, eligibility will be checked and patients will
      enter the treatment period of 24 weeks and will be allocated to 3 treatment arms (Part I) or
      randomized to 2 treatment arms (Part II); if found eligible for randomization. A total of 90
      patients in part 1 and 268 patients in part 2 will be randomised to the treatment arms from
      approximately 40 centers in India.
