      the reduction of signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Demonstration of
      efficacy is a statistically significant improvement in itching on a 0 to 4 patient subjective
      assessment itch score compared to the vehicle arm and at least a 25% (or 1 full unit or more)
      improvement in itch scores. Efficacy for bulbar redness scores would be indicated by a
      statistically significant improvement in redness on a zero to 4 based on the investigators
      objective assessment compared to the vehicle group. Differences of at least 25% on the four
      point scale would be considered clinically significant when attained at the majority of time
      points.
