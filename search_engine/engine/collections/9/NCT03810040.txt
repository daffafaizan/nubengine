      date, there is no report of the effect of different diameters denuding pipette on the embryos
      quality. To investigate the effect of denuding pipette in IVF outcomes, we plan to recruit
      women undergoing IVF treatment cycles and classified them into two groups according to the
      different diameters. The participants were divided into two group. Odd-numbered days the
      zygotes were degranulated with the 140 microns needles. Even-numbered days the zygotes were
      degranulated with the 150 microns needles. Consequently, the rate of fertilization, zygotes
      cleaved, top quality embryos on D3, and blastocysts obtained were recorded.
