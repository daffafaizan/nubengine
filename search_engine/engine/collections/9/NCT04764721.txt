      headaches (non-specific neurological symptoms), while others develop specific neurological
      manifestations, including stroke, related to increased bleeding disorders, seizures and signs
      of encephalitis.

      The coronavirus enters the central nervous system through the olfactory bulb, causing
      olfactory and taste dysfunctions. These symptoms may appear before, during or even after the
      general symptoms.

      Indeed, 18F-FDG PET-CT, which reflects neuronal glycolytic metabolism, shows early variations
      in neuronal function, even in the absence of morphological changes visualized by MRI
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).

      Moreover the tropism of Covid-19 is essentially pulmonary and it is accepted that acute
      pulmonary lesions are independent risk factors for cerebral hypoxia. Furthermore, the
      cytokine storm due to COVID-19 and the resulting hyperinflammation state may induce a
      transient increase in pressure, with endothelial and vascular lesions and increased capillary
      permeability, and promote pulmonary oedema leading to secondary cerebral damage.

      The lung/brain relationship is therefore essential to be studied in pathologies whose main
      tropism is the lung.

      18F-FDG PET has the advantage of being able to explore both cerebral metabolism and the
      metabolism of COVID-19-related lung lesions.

      The hypothesis of this study is that 18F-FDG PET-CT can objectify and characterize central
      nervous system involvement in Covid-19 infection. It also makes it possible to study the
      relationship between cerebral metabolism and the metabolism of pulmonary lesions following
      Covid-19 infection.
