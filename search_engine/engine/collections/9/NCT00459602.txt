      Subjects will undergo all the routine preoperative testing, the same as would be required if
      they were not participating in this study. This testing includes a blood sample and an
      electrocardiogram (ECG). Follow up visits will be done at 2 weeks after surgery, 6 weeks
      after surgery, and 1 year after surgery. Except for the 1 year visit, these office visits are
      routine and would be requested even if you were not participating in this study. At each of
      these visits, subjects will be asked about their level of pain and the amount and type of
      pain medication their are taking. Data gathered for this study will be on outcomes only.
