      without diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at inclusion, in order to identify factors
      influencing the age of onset of the disease.

      The total study duration will be approximately 4 years.

        -  Inclusion period : 2 years

        -  Follow-up period per patient : 2 years

      Patients will be then followed during 10 years for routine medical follow-up. In case of
      Alzheimer's disease onset during this period, all data regarding diagnosis of AD will be
      collected for the study. Data about dementia evolution and mortality in case of AD diagnosis
      during the study will also be collected during this follow-up period.
