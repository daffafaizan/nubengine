      (AYA) patients have an extremely poor prognosis despite current intensive treatment regimens.
      Johns Hopkins piloted an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) platform using a reduced
      intensity conditioning (RIC) and partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical) related donors for
      this population of pediatric and AYA solid tumor patients.With this strategy, investigators
      demonstrated that RIC haploBMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is feasible and
      has acceptable toxicities in patients with incurable pediatric and AYA solid tumors; thus,
      this approach serves as a platform for post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse and
      optimize progression free survival. In this trial, the central hypothesis is that the
      efficacy of alloBMT for high risk solid tumors can be improved by developing methods to
      augment donor T cell responses against antigens selectively or uniquely expressed by tumor
      tissue.

      Investigators aim to demonstrated that Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) blockade with
      nivolumab will be safe and well tolerated after RIC haplo BMT, initially in a relapsed
      population (Part A) and ultimately when given pre-emptively (Part B).
