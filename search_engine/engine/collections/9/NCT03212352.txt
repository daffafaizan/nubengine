      combination of mifepristone with misoprostol is superior to the use of misoprostol alone in
      terms of complete evacuation of products of conception (primary outcome), patient
      satisfaction, complications, side effects and costs (secondary outcomes). The trial will be
      performed multi-centred (hospitals), prospectively, two-armed, randomized, double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled.

      Women with ultrasonographically confirmed early pregnancy failure (6-14 weeks postmenstrual),
      managed expectantly for at least one week, can be included. Before medical treatment with
      misoprostol (two doses 400mcg (four hours apart), repeated after 24 hours if no tissue is
      lost), patients will be randomized to oral mifepristone (600mg) or oral placebo (identical in
      appearance). The investigators aim to randomize 460 women in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by
      centre.

      After six weeks, the primary endpoint, complete or incomplete evacuation, will be determined
