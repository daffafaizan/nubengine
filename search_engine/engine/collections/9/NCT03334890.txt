      tomography (CT) and serum CEA test. CT cannot be used frequently to monitor the instant
      change of lesions, while CEA cannot cover all patients due to its low sensitivity. The
      objective of this study is to assess the performance of the methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) in
      assessing the surgical therapeutic effect of CRC.

      This study plans to recruit 50 CRC patients with stage II-IV CRC. Plasma samples before
      surgery, one day after surgery and seven days after surgery will be collected from each
      subject. mSEPT9 level will be measured at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months
      after surgery and relevant chemotherapy to monitor the possible recurrence of CRC. The mSEPT9
      level will be measured by the Epi proColon 2.0 assay. The serum CEA will be measured parallel
      at the identical time points.

      Primary outcomes include the plasma mSEPT9 levels before surgery, one and seven days after
      surgery.

      Secondary outcomes include the serum CEA levels before surgery, one and seven days after
      surgery. It also includes the size of cancer for each patients, the ratio of patients with
      mSEPT9 complete response (CR), partial response(PR), progressive disease (PD) and stable
      disease (SD).
