    
      This study has 3 options: ovarian cancer screening, PSDO, and RRSO. You may choose which
      study group you want to take part in. However, you must let the researchers know what your
      choice is before any testing for the study begins. The 3 study groups are described in detail
      below.

      GROUP 1: OVARIAN CANCER SCREENING:

      Study Visits:

      For this group, there is no testing required before starting the study. If you agree to be in
      Group 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound inside the vagina) to look at your
           ovaries and fallopian tubes.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA125 levels. This test is
           used to screen for ovarian cancer.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life. This should take up to 15
           minutes.

      Every 6 months for up to 3 years:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.

        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries and fallopian tubes.

      At the end of Years 1, 2, and 3, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a gynecologic
      oncologist (a doctor for women's cancer) and/or recommend that you have your ovaries and
      fallopian tubes removed.

      Length of Study:

      You may have study visits for up to 3 years. You will be taken off study early if you develop
      cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      At any time or preferably at the end of 3 years, you will have the option to cross over and
      choose one of the treatment options (Group 2 or 3).

      Follow-Up:

      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical
      history. If you are called, the calls should last about 5 minutes.

      GROUP 2: FALLOPIAN TUBE REMOVAL WITH DELAYED OVARY REMOVAL (PSDO):

      Salpingectomy:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 2, the study doctor will
      discuss the salpingectomy surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible
      benefits. You will be asked to sign a surgical consent form. After that, the salpingectomy
      will be scheduled.

      Most patients have salpingectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you
      will likely go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay
      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your fallopian
      tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be
      cancerous, a tissue sample or a complete ovary will be removed during surgery and tested. If
      cancer is found, a gynecologic oncologist would perform your cancer surgery.

      Post-Salpingectomy Follow-Up:

      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing. The
      calls should last about 5 minutes.

      One (1) month after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions (wounds).

        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      The pathology (tissue) results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the
      1-week phone call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will
      refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.

      Ovarian Cancer Screening Period:

      Every 6 months or until your delayed oophorectomy after the salpingectomy:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.

        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries.

      You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire 1 time a year until 1 year after your
      delayed oophorectomy.

      Pre-Oophorectomy Testing:

      After the 3-year screening period, you will have a pre-oophorectomy visit. The following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and CA-125 testing.

        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries, if this has not been
           done in the last 6 months.

        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire, if this has not been done in the
           last 6 months.

        -  You may have other tests performed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Oophorectomy:

      If your pre-surgical testing is normal, the study doctor will discuss the planned surgery
      with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will be asked to sign a
      surgical consent form. After that, the oophorectomy will be scheduled.

      Most patients have oophorectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you
      will likely go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay
      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries
      will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be cancerous,
      a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.

      Post-Oophorectomy Follow-Up:

      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.

      One (1) month after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.

        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a
      gynecologic oncologist.

      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      At 1 year after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.

      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI. If the results show cancer, the study doctor
      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.

      Length of Study:

      You will have study visits until 1 year after your oophorectomy. You will be taken off study
      early if you develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up:

      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical
      history.

      GROUP 3: REMOVAL OF FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES AT THE SAME TIME (RRSO):

      RRSO:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 3, the study doctor will
      discuss the surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will
      be asked to sign a surgical consent form. After that, the RRSO will be scheduled.

      Most patients have RRSO performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you will likely
      go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay overnight in the
      hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries and
      fallopian tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that
      may be cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.

      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a
      gynecologic oncologist.

      Post-Surgery Follow-Up:

      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.

      One (1) month after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.

        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a
      gynecologic oncologist.

      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      At 1 year after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA-125.

      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI. If the results show cancer, the study doctor
      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.

      Length of Study:

      You will have study visits for up to 1 year after surgery. You will be taken off study early
      if you develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up:

      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical
      history.

      This is an investigational study. At this time, the only known method that may lower your
      risk of ovarian cancer is to have both of your ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (RRSO).
      Screening for ovarian cancer does not lower the risk that you will develop cancer. PSDO has
      not previously been studied and may not lower your ovarian cancer risk. PSDO is currently
      being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 80 women will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 60 will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.
