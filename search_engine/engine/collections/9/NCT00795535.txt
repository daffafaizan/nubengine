      and are transported by helicopter to Ryder Trauma Center or who are already admitted to the
      trauma center for presumptive traumatic brain injury. In addition to the EKG, trauma patients
      may also be connected to either an non-invasive NIR Monitor, which provides real-time
      information about perfusion status and/or a bispectral EEG monitor, which provides real-time
      information about brain metabolic activity.
