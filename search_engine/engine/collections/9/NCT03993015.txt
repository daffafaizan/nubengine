      questions that assessed the participants' knowledge, interest, and management of early
      pregnancy in France, Belgium and Switzerland1. Knowledge about early management of pregnancy
      was limited among the practitioners surveyed ; 211/306 (69.0%) participants reported
      incorrect management when they visualized a gestational sac without embryo and 265/306
      (86.6%) misinterpreted changes in serum levels of chorionic gonadotropin during early
      pregnancy.

      To fill this gap, the investigators developped a computerized tool who is following strictly
      the most recent criteria of diagnoses in the field of early pregnancy. This tool should be
      evaluated in an observational study, using data of real patients without modification of
      their management.
