      identified in respiratory muscles, in the acute and chronic phases, and may compromise the
      lung function of these individuals. Studies have shown that lower Pimax values are found in
      non-community ambulators, and gait velocity has been reported as an important indicator of
      functionality after stroke, with higher gait velocity values associated with greater
      community participation and better Quality of life.

      Aim: This study will test the hypothesis that training of the inspiratory muscles is
      effective in improving strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles and functional gait
      perfomarnce, activities of daily living and quality of life with stroke subjects.

      Design: For this prospective, triple-blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke
      will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental
      group will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus
      regulated at 50% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week
      over six weeks during 30 minutes/day. The control group will undertake the same protocol, but
      the participants will receive the threshold devices with minimal resistance valves. At
      baseline and post intervention after the cessation of the interventions, researchers blinded
      to group allocations will collect all outcome measures. After 12 weeks will collect again
      maximal inspiratory pressures and functional gait performance.

      Study outcomes: Primary outcomes will be functional gait perfomarnce. Secondary outcomes will
      include inspiratory endurance, activities of daily living and quality of life.
