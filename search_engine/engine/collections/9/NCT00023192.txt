      function. Patients are profoundly immunocompromised and plagued early in life with recurrent
      and often life threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly
      improves immune function in patients with CGD. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate efficacy of a novel approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is
      designed to promote partial or complete donor stem cell engraftment (hematopoietic chimerism)
      with reduced transplant related morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to reduce toxicity
      from pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning, a highly immunosuppressive, low intensity bone
      marrow conditioning regimen will be used. Patients will be transplanted with peripheral blood
      stem cells from an HLA identical family member. The graft will be enriched for hematopoietic
      stem cells in an attempt to decrease the risk of graft versus host disease. Donor T-cells
      will be infused at various time points following the transplant to augment donor
      hematopoietic chimerism and aid in immune reconstitution. Patients treated with this approach
      will be compared to patients who are considered transplant-eligible but lack an HLA identical
      family member. These patients will be treated using the current standard of care. The primary
      end points of this study are to demonstrate reduced incidence of CGD-like infections in the
      transplanted patients compared to the controls (efficacy) with acceptable incidence of acute
      and chronic graft versus host disease and transplant related mortality (safety). Long term
      follow up data from transplanted patients and concurrent controls will be analyzed to confirm
      the association between establishment of hematopoietic chimerism and clinical benefit.
