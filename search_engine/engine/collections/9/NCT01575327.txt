      In spite of oxygen therapy, desaturations frequently occur during exercise in COPD patients.
      Although current recommendations are to add 1 L/min to the baseline oxygen flow during
      exertion, a new closed-loop system (FreeO2) automatically and continuously adjusts the oxygen
      flow to the patient's needs based on the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2),
      end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and respiratory rate. A preliminary study showed significant
      improvement in exercise tolerance in COPD patients not needing oxygen therapy. Although
      oxygen flow could be two fold increased during exercise, a worsening hypercapnia is plausible
      in severe COPD.

      Aim of this study is to evaluate this system during endurance shuttle walking test in COPD
      patients with oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      Methods: The investigators proposed to conduct a controlled, randomized cross-over study
      comparing the efficacy of a Closed-loop System for Oxygen Delivery (FreeO2) as compared with
      fixed oxygen flow during an endurance shuttle walking test in patients with COPD, oxygen
      therapy and hypercapnia.
