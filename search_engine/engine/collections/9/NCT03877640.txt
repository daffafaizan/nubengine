      Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive one treatment cycle of
      active treatment or sham. The device will be equipped with 3 protocols in addition to the
      standard protocol, two of which are identical to the standard protocol (for active treatment)
      and one of which does not deliver HIFEM (for sham treatment). The active treatment arm
      consists of 6 treatments, 2 per week, with at least one day in between. Follow-up visits will
      occur at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the last treatment. Unblinding will take place at the 12
      week follow up visit, and subjects assigned to the sham arm will be crossed over to active
      treatment, beginning their first treatment on that day, completing 6 treatments and 2 follow
      up visits. Once unblinded the subject will be treated with the standard protocol of the
      device.

      After the informed consent is signed, and inclusion and exclusion criteria completed,
      participants will complete validated questionnaires and undergo a baseline physical therapy
      assessment of pelvic floor muscle strength.
