    
      The following data will be collected at baseline:

      Date of birth Handedness Family history of Parkinson's disease Time of first motor symptom
      onset Laterality of symptom onset Time of diagnosis Time of first pharmacological
      intervention (if applicable) First antiparkinsonian drug

      The following data will be collected at every visit/update Current living conditions Current
      non motor complications Current medications Hoehn and Yahr staging Clinical Impression of
      Severity Index in Parkinson's disease (CISI-PD)

      Patient self assessments: PDQ8, NMS-Questionnaire, EQ5D-5L, Patient Reported Outcome in
      Parkinson's Disease (PRO-PD)

      Parkinson Kinetigraph (PKG) accelerometry based recording of spontaneous movement patterns
      over a 6x24h period. The following indices will be extracted: median bradykinesia score
      (BKS), median dyskinesia score (DKS), Fluctuation Dyskinesia Score (FDS), Percent daytime
      with Immobility (PTI%), Percent daytime with tremor (PTT%).

      The primary analysis will be descriptive and include demographic composition of the
      population, clinical characteristics and objective measurement data. In addition to indices a
      standardized qualitative assessment of PKG recordings will be made to identify motor
      fluctuations. Correlations between clinical ratings, patient reported outcomes, disease
      duration, age, medication and objective measurement indices will be studied

      In the prospective phase of the study the development of objective movement recordings will
      be studied along with the development of clinical ratings and patient reported outcomes.
