      Currently, both 23-gauge and 20-gauge instrumentation are commercially available for PPV. No
      studies have reported the efficacy of 23-gauge PPV compared to 20-gauge PPV for primary
      pseudophakic RRD. As a result, many retinal surgeons choose the modality based on personal
      preference.
