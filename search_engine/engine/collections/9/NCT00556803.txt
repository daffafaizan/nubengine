      as a bridge to transplantation. Of the various percutaneous local ablative therapies,
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has attracted the greatest interest because of its
      effectiveness and safety for small HCC â‰¤ 5.0 cm, with a 3-year survival rate of 62% to 68%, a
      low treatment morbidity of 0% to 12%, and a low treatment mortality of 0% to 1%. Prospective
      randomized trials have shown RFA to be better than percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in
      producing a higher rate of complete tumor necrosis with fewer numbers of treatment sessions
      and better survival.

      Unfortunately, the complete tumor necrosis rate for tumors larger than 5 cm is less
      favorable, and the local recurrence rate can be as high as 20% even in small HCC less than
      3.5 cm. The high local recurrence rate may be due to residual cancer cells not killed by RFA
      or adjacent microscopic satellite tumor nodules.

      Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) has proven to be an effective and palliative
      therapy for unresectable HCC. And some prospective randomized controlled trials have shown
      that adjuvant TACE after curative resection for HCC can improve the overall survivals and
      decrease the recurrence rates. But there have not been any studies about TACE as an adjuvant
      therapy after RFA for HCC.

      Thus, the purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate whether TACE as an adjuvant
      therapy after RFA for HCC will improve the outcomes of RFA.
