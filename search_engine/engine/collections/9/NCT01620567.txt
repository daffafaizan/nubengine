      supplementation with daily meals containing 1 avocado or isocaloric amounts of chickpeas
      and/or potatoes on cognitive function in older adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups. Secondary analyses will determine whether baseline macular pigment
      density (a non invasive measure of lutein and zeaxanthin in neural tissue) predicts relative
      effectiveness of the intervention on cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma
      biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants will be recruited from
      community-dwelling men and women aged >50 yr, and potential participants will be screened to
      meet cognitive and functional criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those
      who appear to meet criteria will undergo further screening. The study will include baseline
      (0 month), 3 and 6 month visits for study procedures, and monthly telephone calls. Given that
      there is a visible difference between the two interventions, a blinded study is not possible.
