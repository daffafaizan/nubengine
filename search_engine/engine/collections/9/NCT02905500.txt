      in Public health. The World Health Organization leads since the 1990s the "Global Burden of
      Disease" study. This study has for objective to estimate the burden of various causes of
      death and morbidity in a given population. It defines a standardized measure allowing the
      comparisons between the various countries. The measure developed internationally is the
      Disability-adjusted life year (DALY).

      For the Indian Ocean zone, the international study provides values of DALYs for Madagascar,
      Seychelles and Mauritius. The estimation of DALYs for Reunion Island are based on data of
      mainland France and does not take into account specificities from Reunion Island. To better
      define Public health priorities, it seems essential to decline this measure at the regional
      level.
