      food additive. It is a natural anti-inflammatory compound and has shown anti-tumor activity
      in the laboratory. During this study, you will receive much higher doses of curcumin than can
      be obtained from the diet.

      During the study, you will receive curcumin by mouth every day. You will be required to take
      up to 16 pills per day each morning. Every 8-week period you take curcumin is considered a
      "course" of treatment. The number of courses you receive depends on how you are responding to
      treatment. You can continue treatment as long as the disease does not get worse. If the
      disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the
      study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      You will be given a questionnaire to complete at the beginning of the study and once a week
      while you are on therapy to help the medical staff understand how the different symptoms from
      your disease are affecting you. This questionnaire, which should take about 5 minutes to
      complete, can be done over the telephone or with the help of one of the study staff during
      your visits.

      At the end of each course of treatment (every 8 weeks), you will have a physical exam and the
      tumor will be re-evaluated using CT scans and/or blood (about 2 tablespoons) tests.

      This is an investigational study. Curcumin is a commercially available substance, which is
      commonly used as a food additive. Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
