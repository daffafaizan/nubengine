      diminishing the proliferation of angiogenesis-dependent solid malignancies. Distantly
      metastatic, unresectable medullary thyroid carcinomas, as well as de-differentiated papillary
      and follicular thyroid carcinomas, which no longer concentrate radioiodine, have no known
      effective systemic therapies. We have verified, in the context of a completed phase 2
      clinical trial, that thalidomide has significant activity in thyroid carcinomas that are no
      longer radioiodine avid and are rapidly progressive. This activity has only limited
      durability of around 7 months and is associated with significant toxicities of sedation,
      constipation and neuropathy.

      REVLIMID速 (lenalidomide) is an analog of thalidomide with the chemical name,
      alpha-(3-aminophthalimido) glutarimide. REVLIMID速 is noted to be more potent than thalidomide
      in inhibiting the production of TNF-alpha. It has more than doubled the inhibition of
      microvessel growth at the same concentration as thalidomide in a rat aorta angiogenesis model
      as well as greatly enhanced activity as an IMiD. Most importantly, it lacks much of the
      toxicity of thalidomide, particularly in regards to somnolence, neuropathy, or biochemical
      effects. In fact, patients with multiple myeloma, known to be resistant to thalidomide, were
      still seen to exhibit clinical responses to REVLIMID速. This makes REVLIMID速 an appropriate
      agent to investigate in a phase 2 trial in thyroid carcinoma.
