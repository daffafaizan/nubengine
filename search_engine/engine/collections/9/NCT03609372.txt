      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This single
      arm evaluation (embedded within arm 1 of a 2-arm cluster RCT) will test the sustainability of
      improvement made in repose to a bundled intervention including HPV vaccine communication
      (done through online educational modules and live office practice sessions), performance
      feedback reports (that pull from electronic health record (EHR) data, and compare
      participants performance to their own previous performance and those of others) and provider
      prompts (via EHR and also office staff prompts, e.g., placing Vaccine Information Statements
      (VISs) on desk) to reduce MOs and increase HPV vaccination rates.
