      ankle prosthesis developed by a Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Meridium of
      Ottobock Co., a representative commercial ankle-type robotic prosthesis, passive prosthetic
      limb that the patients have been using so far.

      In order to compare the above three types of prostheses in terms of their effectiveness and
      safety, the robotic prosthesis will be evaluated after 30 minutes of familiarization after
      applying, and the evaluation interval using the two types of robotic prostheses will be 2
      weeks to eliminate the carryover effect. For evaluation, 3D motion analysis, dynamic EMG
      analysis, energy consumption analysis, 6 minute walk test, Berg balance scale, Locomotor
      Capabilities Index, and Korean-Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire will be used.

      For safety analysis, any kinds of safety issues including skin abrasion, bone fracture, or
      tendon/ligament injury due to fall down injury will be recorded and categorized for
      statistical analysis.
