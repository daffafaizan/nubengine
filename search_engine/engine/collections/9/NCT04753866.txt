      implant rehabilitation, there is a need to know the influence of said rehabilitation in the
      lower third profile of the patients. Then, through facial scanning, this study's purpose is
      to evaluate three dimensional changes that arise since the initial state that the patient
      presents to the office until is rehabilitated through 3D discrepancies and 2D linear
      measurements.
