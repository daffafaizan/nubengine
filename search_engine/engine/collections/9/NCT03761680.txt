      nutritional support with ONS is one of the first and most common treatment approach in the
      patients at nutritional risk. Treatment with ONS may reduce mortality and complications in
      hospitalized patients.

      There are no standards on the type of administration of ONS in terms of timing throughout the
      day leading to individual approaches. ONS are conventionally served as snacks by nurses,
      nursing aids or gastronomy personnel between the main meals. The MEDPass-mode offers a
      different approach by serving ONS together with the medication, three or four times per day,
      in unusually small portions. Preliminary trials suggest that compliance and cost
      effectiveness may be improved with the MEDPass-mode.

      Enhancing compliance to ONS may not consequently lead to improved total energy and protein
      intake throughout the day. There has never been a large trial in which total energy- and
      protein intake of the subjects was studied consequently and systematically throughout the
      hospitalization. Therefore, this trial will bridge this gap by studying total energy- and
      protein intake as primary outcomes.
