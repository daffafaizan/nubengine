      and serving as a significant barrier to working among those whose health is otherwise stable
      or restored by antiretroviral (ARV) medication. Fatigue in HIV is associated with disability
      and diminished quality of life. It may be caused by ARVs or by the virus itself. This study
      will determine if modafinil can reduce fatigue in HIV/AIDS patients.

      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      modafinil or placebo daily for 4 weeks. Participants who show an improvement in symptoms will
      receive modafinil for an additional 8 weeks. Participants who do not respond to modafinil
      will have the opportunity to receive other drug treatments. All participants will have weekly
      study visits for the first 4 weeks of the study and biweekly visits for the remainder of the
      study. At each visit, participants will complete various tasks to determine cognitive
      function and self-report scales will be used to determine symptoms of depression and fatigue.
