      the potential for progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), followed by fibrosis
      and ultimately cirrhosis. The gold standard to evaluate fibrosis in patients with NAFLD is
      liver biopsy. The investigators aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of using the galactose
      single point (GSP) test which recommended by the US FDA to quantitatively measure liver
      function in patients with NAFLD.
