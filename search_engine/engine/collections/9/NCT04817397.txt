      pneumonia affecting patients . Common clinical features During hospitalization started to
      appear including acute respiratory infection , inflammatory reaction , fever, pneumonia,
      cough, fatigue , anosmia .

      The patient known suspected if he has a clinical picture of viral pneumonia, exposure
      history, and radiographic findings [CT] or [MRI] chest consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.
      the gold standard and the Final diagnosis (PCR) positivity for the presence of coronavirus .

      The immune response to respiratory infection causes neutrophils to collect inside the lung
      especially the alveoli. Neutrophils aggregation may lead to collateral tissue damage and
      cytotoxicity. According to Previous studies apoptosis of lymphocytes occurred due to the
      release of anti-inflammatory cytokines resulting in lymphopenia. high levels of circulating
      neutrophils have been demonstrated in COVID-19 patients(

      A lot of literatures and studies have demonstrated the value of what is called neutrophil/
      lymphocyte ratio (LNR) as a simple prognostic ratio correlated to morbidity and mortality. Up
      to our knowledge, there is no study utilized such ratio in COVID-19 ICU admitted patients, so
      that, this study has been built
