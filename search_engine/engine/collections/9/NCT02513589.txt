      Inflammation, through a key player, the macrophage, is associated with increased metabolic
      activity of atherosclerotic plaque and its possible rupture. Inflammation within the plate is
      thus a marker of instability. These data underscore the importance of a prospective
      evaluation of inflammation with specific imaging with PET tracers inflammation.
