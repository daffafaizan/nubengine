      not a well-established, general anesthetic technique that clearly decreases the risk of
      postoperative respiratory complications in these patients. If OSA patients have significantly
      decreased postoperative opioid requirements and improved recovery profiles in the PACU, the
      protocol could have significant implications in defining future standardized general
      anesthesia recommendations for patients with this disease. Ultimately, the aim of this study
      is to substantially reduce overall postoperative morbidity and mortality associated with
      obstructive sleep apnea. The objective of this study is to compare the postoperative recovery
      profile of OSA patients receiving standard Sevoflurane inhaled anesthesia with normal saline
      infusion versus Sevoflurane combined with a low-dose ketamine infusion.
