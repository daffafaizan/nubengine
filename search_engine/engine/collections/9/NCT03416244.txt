    
      Cancer - including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) - is a disease of the elderly, more
      than 60% of all tumors arise in patients with the age of 65 years or older. In contrast,
      little is known about the biology and progression of cancers in these patients, since most
      clinical trials enroll patients with age limits of 70 or 75 years.

      While most patients undergo chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation in first-line, the role of
      second-line therapy is less well understood. No treatment standard has been established so
      far and there is a clear unmet medical need. This is particularly true for geriatric patients
      for whom palliative systemic therapies are especially challenging.

      Hence, the primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate a significant survival benefit
      of two experimental immunotherapy regimens (Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab
      combination) in elderly patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer compared to
      historical data of standard chemotherapy regimens.
