    
      Background:

      Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymoma
      and thymic carcinoma. New options for treatment are necessary in patients with advanced
      thymoma and thymic carcinoma that have progressed on cisplatin-containing therapy. The
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway is being studies in various malignancies including
      thymoma and thymic carcinoma. IMCA12 is an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody that has shown
      activity in patients with thymic malignancies.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the objective response rate (partial response (PR)+complete response (CR))
           to IMC-A12 monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent thymoma or thymic
           carcinoma.

        -  To evaluate time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and
           overall survival (OS)

        -  To assess safety of IMC-A12

        -  To perform immunohistochemistry for IGF1R expression on tumor samples of thymoma and
           thymic carcinoma (exploratory)

        -  To correlate response to therapy with changes in fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission
           tomography (FDG-PET) imaging at baseline and first restaging

        -  To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of IMC-A12

        -  To perform pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis in blood for the detection of IGF1R, AKT and
           pAKT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) (exploratory).

        -  To assess circulating endothelial cell, circulating endothelial progenitor cells, immune
           subset analysis and glucose transport in peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes
           (exploratory).

        -  To evaluate anti-cytokine antibodies in peripheral blood (exploratory).

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma or thymoma who have previously
           been treated on at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen

        -  Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function

        -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of
           IMC-A12 therapy

      Design:

        -  Patients will receive IMC-A12 at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously once every three weeks

        -  Treatment with IMC-A12 alone will continue until disease progression

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE) Version 3.0 until December 31, 2010, and by CTCAE Version 4.0 beginning January
           1, 2011

        -  Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.0 criteria will be performed every 2 cycles

        -  Correlative studies including tissue immunohistochemistry studies will be done on
           existing tumor blocks

        -  Blood samples will be collected for for PK's, PD's, circulating endothelial cells
           (CEC's), circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEPC's), immune subsets, glucose
           transport and cytokine antibodies.
