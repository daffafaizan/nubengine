      and a pathology accompanying increasing age. Renal function might be an important modifier of
      treatment effects.

      Population-based administrative claims databases are increasingly used in large-scale
      comparative outcomes studies of drug treatments. However, claims databases often lack
      information on laboratory tests results limiting their usefulness in Real-World Evidence(RWE)
      research of patients with renal impairment.

      There is a need to develop methods for identification of patients with renal dysfunction from
      healthcare administrative claims-based proxies.

      The main objective of this study is the development of algorithms/models to predict eGFR
      values and/or classes for patients at certain time point based on entries in claims database
      (demographic characteristics, clinical diagnoses, procedures and drug treatments) for a
      general population and a variety of use-cases (atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease,
      type 2 diabetes mellitus patients sub-populations). To achieve this, modern data-driven
      machine learning techniques will be applied to discover relationships between renal status,
      measured by eGFR, and longitudinal patient-level data.

      Evaluation of models' performance (out of sample validation, benchmark test, performance
      differences between eGFR value prediction algorithms and classification models tailored for
      the pre-defined eGFR classes) will be done as well.
