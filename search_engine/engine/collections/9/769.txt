linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfaticain the first part of the present paper a study is presentedof the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author hasnoticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-vidual.the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiographyshows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspectsvary according to the disease's different stages and there isnot always a relationship between the duration period of thesymptoms and the changes observed.in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of thelymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization ofanastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymphflow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophydue to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliaclevel causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacralanastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causingtheir dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-rent lymphatics.in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results togetherwith risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chieflyinfluenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglialsclerosis.
