      it is considered a cornerstone in the so-called fast track multimodal perioperative approach,
      which includes early ambulation, oral nutrition, multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia and
      optimized fluid therapy. This strategy has improved patient outcome after surgery and reduced
      hospital length of stay. Immobilization after surgery is associated with increased risk of
      complications including venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism),
      muscle wasting, pneumonia and atelectasis, thereby impending convalescence.

      However, early postoperative mobilization can be delayed due to failed orthostatic
      cardiovascular regulation, resulting in postoperative orthostatic hypotension (OH), defined
      as a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 10 mmHg or
      postoperative orthostatic intolerance (OI), characterized by dizziness, nausea, vomiting,
      visual disturbances or syncope.

      Previous studies investigating the incidence and pathophysiology of postoperative OI and OH
      included mixed patient populations. Hitherto no studies have been performed looking into the
      incidence and pathophysiologic hemodynamics of postoperative OI and OH specifically in
      patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers (ARBs), antihypertensive agents with potential effects on cardiovascular
      compensatory functions.

      The current study aims therefore to estimate the incidence and gain knowledge on
      pathophysiological hemodynamics of postoperative OI and OH in patients receiving ACEIs and
      ARBs.
