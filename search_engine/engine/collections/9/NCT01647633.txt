      same criteria. They will be instructed on keeping a nasal diary of symptoms "runny, itchy,
      congestion, sneezing, voice changes and throat clearing". They will have blood drawn for
      allergy testing. After a 1 week run-in, subjects will return their diary. If they still
      qualify based on the diary they will have baseline labs drawn and baseline breathing test
      (Spirometry) performed. They will also have a nasal wash and specimen collection performed.
      They will be instructed on use of the nasal wash. There will be three more weekly visits
      before study conclusion which will include diary submission, Spirometry and nasal wash and
      specimen collection. On the final visit blood will again be collected as well.
