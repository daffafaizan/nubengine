      reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. Subgroup analyses of the large
      clinical studies, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention (WOSCOP) and Cholesterol and
      Recurrent Events (CARE), have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins may extend to
      mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. A variety of mechanisms accounting for these effects
      have been suggested. Among these, the anti-inflammatory activity is particularly attractive
      because inflammation is considered an early step in the development of atherosclerosis. Thus,
      statin therapy has been shown to lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a plasma
      marker of inflammation, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Furthermore, statins may possess
      anti-inflammatory properties by their ability to reduce the number of inflammatory cells in
      atherosclerotic plaques. Red Yeast Rice contains Lovastatin and lowers LDL-cholesterol.
      However, it is not known to what degree Red Yeast Rice may lower LDL-cholesterol in a
      European population. Some reports have suggested an effect of Red Yeast Rice on fasting blood
      glucose by an unknown mechanism.
