      and periodontal disease have a bi-directional relationship; people with diabetes are at
      higher risk of tooth loss and poor oral health may impact nutrition and inflammation. Even
      among those with access to medical treatment for their diabetes, access to dental care may be
      challenging. In spite of their higher oral health risk, diabetic adults are less likely than
      their peers to attend a dental visit annually. While oral hygiene measures for
      ventilator-dependent patients have become standard of care, the oral health of less
      critically ill hospitalized patients has been noted to decline over the course of their
      hospitalization and patients generally do not have access to dental treatment., However,
      invasive dental treatment (restorations, tooth extraction, and periodontal scaling) has been
      demonstrated to be safe even for critically ill hospitalized patients. The inpatient setting,
      where patients are already receiving services from multiple disciplines and patients do not
      need to travel to see a healthcare provider, presents a unique opportunity to make
      integrative oral healthcare services accessible to diabetic patients, and to increase oral
      health knowledge of those health professionals caring for patients on an inpatient medical
      ward.

      This study will involve provision of dental prophylaxis ("tooth cleaning") as well as
      motivational interviewing focused on oral health care-seeking behaviors provided by a dental
      hygienist to patients with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes who are hospitalized on a medicine
      floor of Massachusetts General Hospital.
