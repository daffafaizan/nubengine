      randomized, open-label, two-period crossover (1-week washout interval) bioequivalence study.
      Blood samples were collected at pre-dose (0h) and 0.5, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and
      12 hours after drug ingestion. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2,
      Area-under-curve0-12h and Area-under-curve0-inf) were calculated from plasma concentrations
      for both formulations in each subject.
