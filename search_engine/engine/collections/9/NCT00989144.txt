      HIV seronegative clinical specimens not used as part of any research protocol. The specimens
      in this study are discarded anonymous samples from the Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT)
      facilities at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. The specimens cannot
      be linked to the tested subjects. The samples will be labeled using the anonymous clinic
      identification number which is a 7 digit number with the first 2 digits representing the year
      and the following 5 digits representing the sequence of which the client sought care in that
      calendar year. Preliminary Study of Early, Primary HIV Infection in a High Risk Cohort.
