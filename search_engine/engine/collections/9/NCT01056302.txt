      iterate on complex procedures based on individual patient data in 3-D from a CT scan. The
      software will allow surgeons to both see and feel the results of their interventions - for
      example, the quality of the bite or bone alignment of a reconstructed jaw following severe
      trauma - before the actual surgery, leading to better planning, fewer errors, shortened
      surgery time and improved outcomes for the patients. The purpose of this study is the
      evaluation of a visuohaptic planning system for mandibular trauma surgery that is based on
      interactive manipulation of CT data.
