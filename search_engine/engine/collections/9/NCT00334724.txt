      organ damage and appears to be a prognostic indicator with respect to cardiovascular
      mortality and cardiovascular events. However, whether BP control by home BP monitoring exerts
      cardioprotective effects rather than by clinic BP monitoring in elderly patients remains
      unknown. In this study, a total of 500 elderly patients diagnosed with essential hypertension
      will be randomly divided into 2 groups; target BP level, home SBP <135 mmHg and home DBP <85
      mmHg (home BP control group), clinic SBP <140 mmHg and clinic DBP <90 mmHg (clinic BP control
      group). Olmesartan at doses of 20 mg/day will be administered and increased up to 40 mg, if
      antihypertensive effect is inadequate. Study visits will be made bimonthly for at least 1
      year. The antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects including systemic levels of
      C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, and arterial stiffness will be compared
      between the two groups.
