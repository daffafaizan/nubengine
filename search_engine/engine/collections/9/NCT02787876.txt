      usually receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil
      recovery. However it needs daily injection of G-CSF. Pegteograstim is a new formulation of
      PEGylated recombinant human G-CSF analogue pegfilgrastim. In this study, investigators aimed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegteograstim on chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in
      children with solid tumors.
