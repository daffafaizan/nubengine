      Americans. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of this stress reduction
      program in improving well-being and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke in African
      Americans.

      No drugs are involved with this study. Participants will be randomized (randomly selected) to
      either participate in an 8 -week stress reduction program or a control group (no stress
      reduction program). The stress reduction program entails attending a 2- hour small group
      class once a week for 8 consecutive weeks at Loyola University in Maywood. Classes will be
      offered in the evening and will focus on teaching effective strategies for coping with daily
      stress, particularly stress associated with being an African American.

      Blood and saliva samples will be collected at the beginning of the study, in the middle of
      the program (4 weeks), at the end of the program (8 weeks) and 3 months after the program
      ends. Blood samples will be analyzed for cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1c (a measure that
      reflects blood sugar over time), and cytokines (which reflect inflammation in the body).
      Saliva samples will be assessed for a hormone called cortisol..

      Participants will also complete several written questionnaires to gather information about
      their stress, social status, perceive discrimination, mood, diet and exercise. Participants
      will be paid $25 for each of the three data collection time points ($75 total). Those
      participants who are randomized to attend the stress reduction classes will also be provided
      $15 for each class that they attend (8 X $15 = $120) to help cover travel expenses.
