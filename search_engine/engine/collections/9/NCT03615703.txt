      impulsive aggression. The task will be combined with functional MRI to establish a reliable
      BOLD signal during testing in developing healthy subjects (8-12 years old) and, to determine
      the feasibility to perform the task.

      Additionally, the levels of neurotransmitters Glutamate and GABA will be measured using
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
