      articaine in two concentrations, 2% and 4%, in association with 1:200,000 adrenaline, for the
      removal of lower third molars. Onset, duration of postoperative analgesia, duration of
      anesthetic action on soft tissues, intraoperative bleeding, hemodynamic parameters,
      postoperative mouth opening and wound healing at the 7th postoperative day were evaluated.
      This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of two concentrations (2% and 4%) of the local
      anesthetic articaine, a local anesthetic of moderate duration, associated with adrenalin at
      1: 200,000 in 50 patients aged less than 18 years and in need of extraction of the two third
      molars with similar positions. Evaluated the following parameters: 1) onset of action of the
      anesthetic agent, 2) the total amount of anesthesia used during surgery, 3) onset and
      duration of surgery after the administration of the local anesthetic, 4) the incidence, type
      and severity of adverse reactions, 5) postoperative control of mouth opening, 6) subjective
      evaluation of postoperative pain, 7) postoperative duration of anesthesia, 8) Total amount of
      relief medication and 9) heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure before during
      and after surgery. The comparative analysis of the data and the application of proper
      statistical tests provided the basis for an assessment of the efficiency of both
      concentrations of the local anesthetic articaine (2% and 4%) with adrenalin at 1: 200,000.
