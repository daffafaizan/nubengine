    
      CLEO study is performed in two parts (part A and Part B). The sponsor is currently recruiting
      only for the Part B of the study.

      Part A will be an inpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      CLE-100 in MDD participants currently treated with an antidepressant drug. It will include a
      screening phase (up to 35 days), a 1 week inpatient double-blind treatment phase and an
      outpatient post treatment safety follow-up phase of 1 week after last study drug
      administration.

      Part B will be a study to assess the safety and efficacy of CLE-100 in MDD participants
      currently treated with an antidepressant drug with inadequate response to standard
      antidepressant therapy.

      The participants will remain on their current antidepressant therapy with no dose change
      during the study.
