    
      A 3-D digital body camera that employs non-intrusive white light phase profilometry and 24
      coordinated charge-coupled cameras scans and produces a "point cloud" image of the subject.
      The result of the two-minute scan process is an accurate three-dimensional body model of the
      subject, consisting of over 1.2 million surface points. The point cloud is compressed to
      provide programmable measurement extraction profiles (MEP's) that automatically extracts
      linear and circumferential measurements. Subjects are scanned and anthropometrically measured
      pre-operatively, and at 3, 6 and 9 months post-op.
