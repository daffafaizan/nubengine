      about 3.9 million infected patients in the United States, with an estimated 36,000 new cases
      in the US each year. 70-85% of infected individuals develop a chronic infection complicated
      by chronic liver disease during the next 20 to 30 years, which is the tenth leading cause of
      death in the US. HCV is implicated in the development of hepato-cellular carcinoma. Chronic
      HCV hepatitis is the most frequent reason for liver transplantation. HCV genotype 1 is the
      most common genetic variant of HCV causing HCV hepatitis in the US. It responds less well to
      conventional anti-HCV treatment than the other HCV genotypes, so that 60% of genotype 1
      patients fail conventional therapy due to the virus's resistance to treatment and/or due to
      toxic side effects of the therapy.

      Extracellular levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin c) attainable only by high-dose, intravenous
      administration, are reported to have in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer and anti-viral effects
      in humans and animals. Ascorbic acid briefly generates extracellular hydrogen peroxide, an
      oxidative stress specifically toxic to cancer cells and cells infected with viruses,
      including HCV, but not to normal cells. High-dose, intravenous ascorbic acid has been given
      to large numbers of patients, particularly cancer patients, with anecdotal reports of good
      safety and occasional benefit. Given the foregoing, the investigators propose that there is
      sufficient rationale for a careful pilot study of the safety and anti-viral efficacy of
      infused ascorbic acid in HCV genotype 1 hepatitis.
