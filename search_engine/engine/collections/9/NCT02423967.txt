    
      The study is designed to enroll forty children aged 1-18 with recurrent Clostridium difficile
      Infection (CDI). Recurrent CDI is defined as an infection that persists after three rounds of
      appropriate antibiotics. Enrollees will be randomly assigned to receive Fecal Microbial
      Transplant using stool from either a screened relative as per current protocols versus using
      frozen stool that has been collected from healthy volunteers.

      Primary outcome will be the eradication of the Clostridium difficile as defined by
      elimination of diarrhea with a negative Clostridium difficile toxin stool test.

      Secondary outcomes will include a measure of quality of life pre and post Fecal Microbial
      Transplant using a validated quality of life survey instrument, the Health Act Child Health
      Questionnaire. The investigators will also assess for inflammation in the stool using
      lactoferrin and calprotectin and evaluate the stool microbiome in recipients pre and post
      transplant using sequencing to look for any pattern that predicts successful eradication.
