    
      Our research was carried out to our obstetrics clinic between 01 Agustus 2015 - 01 December
      2020.

      Patients transplanted due to postpartum bleeding and patients requiring surgery due to
      abnormal postpartum bleeding in our clinic will be included. Patients with a previously known
      bleeding disorder will not be included in the study. In our study, the parameters of the
      patients who had bleeding due to postpartum uterine atony and who needed uterine surgery
      previously underwent triple Hayman compression suture to stop bleeding will be included in
      the study. Patients with a triple Hayman suture covering the upper 2/3 of the uterus to stop
      uterine bleeding will be evaluated in the study.
