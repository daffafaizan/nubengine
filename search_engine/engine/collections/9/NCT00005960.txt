      median survival, and overall survival in patients with chemotherapy naive hormone refractory
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with sequential
      docetaxel. II. Assess for any improvement in pain over time in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 3-5 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days 1, 22, 43, and 64, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 85, 106,
      and 127 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy
      infusions and continuing until blood counts recover. G-CSF must be discontinued at least 24
      hours prior to starting subsequent chemotherapy infusions. Pain and analgesic use are
      assessed before study, every 3 weeks during study, after completion of study, and then at 3
      months after completion of study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 42-105 patients will be accrued for this study over 18
      months.
