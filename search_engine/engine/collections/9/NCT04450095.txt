      ischemic damage the kidney undergoes during partial nephrectomy for kidney lesion removal.

      In such procedure, it is common to clamp the kidney blood vessels in order to eliminate blood
      flow in the surgical field that will enable clear visibility to differentiate the tumor
      tissue from the normally kidney parenchyma.

      Later, after removing the tumor lesion and suturing the tumor bed, the blockage is released
      and the renal blood flow returns.

      The blockage itself and its release causes damage to the kidney tissue that is usually
      reduced by the kidney's cooling (through ice crystals)and as well as intravenous injection of
      mannitol.

      In this study, patients were divided into 2 groups randomly, assigned the receipt in the
      order of recruitment.

      The first group will receive the standard treatment and the other will be given before and
      after surgery endothelin antagonists in addition to the standard treatment. The drug will be
      given once a day for 5 days, starting 48 hours before surgery. Treatment efficacy assessment
      will be based on comparison of renal function (serum creatinine level and glomerular
      filtration) as well as biomarkers of acute renal damage (NGAL, KIM-1, and others) that will
      be taken from patients before and at different time points after surgery: urine samples to be
      taken at the following time points: - 3 , 8,24,48,72 hours after surgery. Blood samples will
      be taken at the following time points: - 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after surgery.
