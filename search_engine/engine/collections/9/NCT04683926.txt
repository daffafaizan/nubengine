    
      An open-label, randomized, balanced, single-dose, four-treatment, four-period, four-sequence
      (using a Williams' square design) cross-over study with each dose separated by >3 days. There
      are 4 sequences (Sequence 1, Sequence 2, Sequence 3, and Sequence 4), and 4 Periods (Period
      I, Period II, Period III, and Period IV). Sequence 1 order is 30 mg dose with food (Period
      I); 30 mg dose fasted (Period II), 20 mg dose fasted (Period III), and 20 mg dose fasted
      (Period IV). Sequence 2 order is 10 mg dose fasted (Period I); 30 mg dose with food (Period
      II), 20 mg dose fasted (Period III), and 30 mg dose fasted (Period IV). Sequence 3 order is
      20 mg dose fasted (Period I); 10 mg dose fasted (Period II), 30 mg dose fasted (Period III),
      and 30 mg dose with food (Period IV). Sequence 4 order is 30 mg dose fasted (Period I); 20 mg
      dose fasted (Period II), 30 mg dose with food (Period III), and 10 mg dose fasted (Period
      IV).

      To account for potential dropouts, up to 32 eligible subjects will be randomized to obtain a
      target sample of 24 subjects with PK responses at each of the four treatment periods (based
      on our completed phase 1 study in 43 subjects, dropouts are unlikely (~5%); see Section
      1.2.2). Before each oral dose, subjects will be fasted overnight for at least 10 hours.
      Treatment sequences will include the following four unblinded single-dose oral treatments: 1)
      desmetramadol 1 x 10 mg tablet; 2) desmetramadol 2 x 10 mg tablets; 3) desmetramadol 3 x 10
      mg tablets; and 4) desmetramadol 3 x 10 mg tablets following a high-fat, high-calorie
      breakfast served approximately 30 minutes before dosing and entirely consumed within 20
      minutes. All subjects will fast for an additional four hours after desmetramadol
      administration. The fed treatment should be administered the Omnitram dose approximately30
      minutes after the start of the meal. Desmetramadol will be administered with approximately
      240 ml of water. No water is allowed one hour before and one hour after each desmetramadol
      administration.

      This will be an inpatient study. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical pharmacology unit
      on Study Day -1, and administered a single oral dose treatment on Study Day 1, Study Day 4,
      Study Day 7 and Study Day 10. After completing study procedures on Day 11 the subject will be
      discharged from the facility.

      Blood specimens for plasma preparation and PK analysis will be collected at the following
      times: pre-dose (0 h), and post-dose 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24,
      and 32 h.
