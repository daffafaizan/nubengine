      are arguably the most important system in which to intervene. In 2010, Congress passed the
      Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act to better align school meal standards with the Dietary
      Guidelines, making school meals a nutritious option for students. Increasing participation in
      the school meal program, therefore, especially among low-income youth, has the potential to
      improve dietary intake among students and ultimately reduce childhood obesity.

      Over three school years, the University of California (Berkeley's School of Public Health and
      the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources' Nutrition Policy Institute) will evaluate
      an innovative, student-centered school-lunch intervention to increase school lunch
      participation and improve dietary intake among low-income middle and high school students.
      The project will be conducted in the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), a large
      and diverse urban district serving over 32,000 students (70% of total) eligible for free or
      reduced-price meals. The intervention, developed in partnership with the global design firm
      IDEO, aims to promote healthier habits by leveraging principals of behavior economics. The
      intervention involves the following three components: 1) a smartphone application (SmartMeal)
      that allows students to pre-order school lunches, receive nutrition information about school
      lunch options, and provide feedback about meals to food service staff, 2) distributed points
      of sale for school meals, achieved through the addition of mobile food carts and vending
      machines, and 3) a staff wellness curriculum that encourages staff to promote school meals
      and model healthful eating behaviors to students.
