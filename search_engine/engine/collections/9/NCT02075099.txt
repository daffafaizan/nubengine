      fainting events still occur. They can have an impact on the frequency of donation as well as
      on the blood donor's motivation and that in their close entourage. This impact should not be
      overlooked in the context of the increasing need for blood components and tighter budgets..

      In some other national health systems, the donor is given a drink shortly before giving blood
      and / or donors are advised to do lower-body muscle tensing exercises whilst giving blood.

      The present study has a factorial design and compares 3 arms for hydration criteria and 2
      arms for exercise criteria with cluster randomization (1 cluster = 1 blood donation unit).
      The randomization plan will be stratified according to the type of EFS donation unit (French
      Blood Donation service: Etablissement Fran√ßais du Sang): Fixed/Mobile unit; and also on the
      location of the of mobile blood donation unit: in companies, towns or schools. In the latter,
      the blood donors have a potentially higher risk of presyncopal or syncopal reactions.

      3 arms:

        -  500mL of an isotonic drink to be drunk immediately before blood donation

        -  500mL of slightly mineralized water to be drunk immediately before blood donation

        -  Advice to drink one glass of fruit juice or water before blood donation In the 3 arms,
           the centralized randomization will balance the numbers of blood donations in which the
           donors will perform lower-body muscle tensing exercises , or not, during the blood
           donation.

      Main objective:

      To assess the impact of preventive measures, including rapid hydration with 500mL of an
      isotonic drink versus hydration with 500mL of water or simple advice to have a drink; and
      advice to perform lower-body muscle tensing exercises during the whole blood donation, on the
      prevention of presyncopal and syncopal reactions during blood donation and in the following
      48 hours.
