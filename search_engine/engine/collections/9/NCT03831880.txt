      with daily Genotropin followed by 12 weeks of treatment with weekly somatrogon, or 12 weeks
      of treatment with weekly somatrogon followed by 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin.
      Subjects will have study visits at Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Subjects will also be
      followed up by phone 8 to 12 days after each treatment period begins (Week 1 and Week 13).
      Subjects and caregivers (as a Dyad) will complete questionnaires assessing treatment burden
      at baseline and at the end of each 12 week treatment period. All subjects/caregivers will
      receive a follow up phone call at Week 28.
