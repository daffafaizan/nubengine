      orthodontic tooth movement of the first premolars to induce OIIRR. The first molars will be
      stabilized, using a special appliance to help movement of the premolars. This type of
      appliance design has been used for many years in similar clinical trials by many researchers
      and has received wide acceptability without reported problems to the teeth during the
      experimental period. Ultrasound will be applied for twenty minutes per day, starting the day
      the springs are activated, for four weeks, using an ultrasound device (Exogen Inc., West
      Caldwell, NJ, USA). Only the first premolar will be receiving ultrasound. The patients will
      be instructed on how to have the ultrasound transducer. The non LIPUS treated premolars will
      be receiving sham transducers. A visual analogue scale will be provided to the patients to
      record any pain or discomfort that the patient might experience during or after application
      of ultrasound. It is expected that there will be no evidence of any deleterious effect on the
      intervening soft tissue as we did not informed with any discomfort experienced by the
      patients in our preliminary study. After four or eight weeks of LIPUS treatment, the springs
      will be removed, and the first premolars will be extracted, using a non-traumatic technique.
      The extracted teeth will be fixed, and studied by Î¼-CT then they will be processed to be
      analyzed histomorphometrically
