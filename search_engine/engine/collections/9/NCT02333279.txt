      cancer over time. We will consider time to first formation of non-skin solid cancer after
      solid organ transplantation as well as the cumulative number of non-skin solid cancer
      formation over time. Both aspects are equally important and will be reflected in the analytic
      methods of this study. Theses analyses will be restricted to the most prevalent
      transplantation types of heart, kidney, liver, and lung.
