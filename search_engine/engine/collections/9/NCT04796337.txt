    
      This Long-term Follow-up Study (LTFU) study is supported by data from the PULSAR study in
      which treatment with sotatercept resulted in hemodynamic and functional improvements in the
      study participants, including those receiving maximal PAH therapy with double/triple drug
      combinations and intravenous prostacyclin.

      The primary objective of this open-label, LTFU study is to evaluate the long-term safety and
      tolerability of sotatercept when added to background PAH therapy in adult subject with PAH
      who have completed prior sotatercept studies.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate continued efficacy in adult subject with PAH who have
      completed prior sotatercept studies.

      Participants eligible to enroll in the study will have participated in and completed the
      relevant study requirements of the parent PAH sotatercept clinical studies
