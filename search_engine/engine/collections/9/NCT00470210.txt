      HCV-RNA antibodies and cure the infection. Studies have shown that high doses of ribavirin
      are associated with higher response rates than those achieved with ribavirin at dosages of
      800-1200 mg/d.

      The main aim of this trial is to assess the sustained virologic response to treatment with
      peginterferon alfa-2a plus high-dose ribavirin in HIV-infected patients coinfected with HCV
      genotypes 1 or 4 who have had persistent transaminase elevations and lack of response to
      previous treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin at dosages of 800-1200 mg/d.

      The second aim will be to measure changes in serum HCV-RNA titers and the percentage of
      patients achieving serum viral loads of < 50 IU/mL during treatment. Finally, we also intend
      to evaluate the safety of this treatment regimen.
