      history of recurrent MDRO infections. Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and
      provide written, informed consent will provide a pre-FMT stool sample. The FMT will be
      administered by enema in the outpatient setting by trained personnel. Patients will provide
      stool samples 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-FMT. The subjects will also be monitored
      for potential adverse events, recurrence of MDRO infections, infections that may be related
      to FMT, and worsening of existing comorbidities or development of new comorbidities.
