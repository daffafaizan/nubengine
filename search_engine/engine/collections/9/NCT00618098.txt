      reversal agent in patients under vitamin K antagonist therapy with the need for urgent
      surgery or invasive procedures was not clinically inferior to that of FFP.

      The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      Octaplex compared to FFP in patients under vitamin K antagonist therapy with the need for
      urgent surgery or invasive procedures.
