      pathological types, natural history, treatment modalities in endemic and non-endemic regions.
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is both radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Chemoradiotherapy is the
      main therapy choice for the locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However,the
      optimal chemoradiotherapy regimen has not been determined. Many new drugs including docetaxel
      and gemcitabine have been incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC. The
      investigators designed the present study with induction chemotherapy follow by CCRT for
      locoregionally advanced NPC in non-endemic Northwest China, comparing induction chemotherapy
      regime of TP and GP. The primary objectives were overall response rate (ORR), acute toxicity,
      tolerance; second objective were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), rate
      of distant metastases,late adverse events and quality of life.
