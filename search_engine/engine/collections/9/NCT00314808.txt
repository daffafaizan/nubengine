      changes, pain, fatigue, mobility, insomnia, mood, bowel patterns, concentration and
      appearance (Donaldson and Fields, 1998). There has been little information published on the
      impact of these symptoms in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) population. More specifically,
      to date, there has not been an investigation that demonstrates the efficacy of an
      intervention on improving appetite, and decreasing nausea and vomiting in patients with GBM.
      This need serves as the basis for the current proposed investigation utilizing Dronabinol, a
      cannabinoid known to decrease incidence of nausea and vomiting, as well as controlling
      appetite changes for terminally ill patients receiving chemotherapy. In addition, there is no
      published research on the use of Dronabinol and dose limited toxicity for the brain tumor
      population.

      In this study, patients will receive daily Dronabinol therapy through their chemotherapy
      cycle. Patients will complete daily appetite and nausea/vomiting logs, as well as receive
      telephone follow-up from the research coordinator to assess impact of treatment. This will be
      assessed through two consecutive cycles of chemotherapy.
