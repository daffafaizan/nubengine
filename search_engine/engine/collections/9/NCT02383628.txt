      flow, near-infrared ICG angiography, has been applied to neurosurgical patients undergoing a
      wide variety of cerebrovascular procedures. This technique offers the advantage of real-time
      visualization of cerebral blood flow through the operating microscope at the time the
      procedure is being performed. Indocyanine green is an ideal agent for imaging vessels as it
      is tightly bound to plasma albumin, has a short half-life, and maintains an acceptable safety
      profile. Furthermore, the excitation and emission profiles for ICG lie in the near-infrared
      wavelengths, which allow penetration and imaging of vessels below a few millimeters of
      tissue.

      Patients with either an aneurysm, compressive syndromes or pituitary and intracranial tumor
      will be enrolled in the study. By taking advantage of the natural fluorescence of indocyanine
      green (ICG) within the red spectrum and applying a light filter to the endoscope eyepiece and
      camera it will show as to whether this technique provides adequate visual information to
      differentiate perfusion in tumor and surrounding structures and to evaluate normal vessels
      for aneurysm and compressive syndromes procedures.
