      of major classes of drug metabolizing enzymes. Twelve healthy male subjects will participate
      in a pharmacokinetic study prior to and following supplementation with Visbiome probiotics
      for 28 days.

      The investigators will determine the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous midazolam
      [metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases
      (UGTs) and sulfotransferase (SULTs)] and acetaminophen (metabolized by UGTs and SULTs), and
      the circulating concentrations of endogenous compounds (i.e., testosterone and vitamin D
      metabolites) prior to and following supplementation with Visbiome probiotics for 28 days. In
      addition, the investigators will compare the fecal microbiota composition and plasma
      lipidomic and metabolomics profiles to assess the impact of Visbiome supplementation.
