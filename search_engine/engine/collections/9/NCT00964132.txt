      the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. NRX 194204,
      a second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because NRX
      194204 is significantly more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs than a first
      generation approved drug, it is associated with fewer adverse events in clinical use. This
      study seeks to investigate NRX 194204 monotherapy in patients who have failed any 2 prior
      therapies.
