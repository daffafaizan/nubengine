      I. To determine if in-office movement trackers identify those patients who are at highest
      risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) on early and developmental therapeutics (EDT) cancer
      trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Secondary objectives are related to outpatient activity trackers. I. To determine the
      association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination, with baseline
      measurement of activity classification using outpatient activity trackers in the 7 days after
      screening visit.

      II. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination,
      with the change in activity level classification between the week after screening visit and
      the week after the start of EDT.

      III. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination,
      with averaged activity level classification in the first 4 weeks of the EDT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participant in movement assessment during 2 clinical trial visits. Patients also
      wear a Fitbit to track movements and complete a smartphone based Patient Reported Outcomes
      (PRO) diary over 5-10 minutes to measure physical function, fatigue, sleep disturbance,
      social isolation, appetite, and body weight for up to 180 days.
