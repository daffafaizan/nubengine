      probationers and parolees in Baltimore City, Maryland and Providence, Rhode Island will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: 1) On-site rapid testing conducted by
      research staff co-located for the purposes of this study at the probation/parole office; or
      2) Off-site referral for rapid HIV testing at a community health center or HIV testing
      clinic. Inclusion criteria will be: 1) Adult probationer/parolee; 2) not known to be HIV
      positive, and 3) resident of greater Baltimore or Providence throughout the study period.
      Exclusion criteria will be: 1) unable to give informed consent. The second study is a
      randomized trial, whereby all individuals identified at community corrections with HIV will
      be offered enrollment in a one-year intervention study to examine the ability to improve
      linkage into HIV care. Participants will be randomized to receive one of two conditions: 1)
      Project Bridge for one year, or 2) Treatment as Usual-referral to standard level of care.
      Moreover, those randomized to TAU will be given an opportunity to "crossover" to PB if they
      have failed to engage in treatment during the first three months. The rationale for choosing
      the two cities of Baltimore, MD and Providence, RI is due to the historically high rates of
      heroin addiction that is associated with multiple HIV-related risk behaviors in these two
      cities and a high likelihood of being on probation and/or parole. Furthermore, Maryland ranks
      10th and Rhode Island ranks 4th in the nation in the number of probationers per 100,000 adult
      residents.
