      protocols, categorized depending on their good (GSR, n=20) (less than 20% motility decrease)
      or bad (BSR, n=20) (more than 20% motility decrease) survival rates. Sperm mRNA was extracted
      using Trizol protocol, suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and frozen at
      -80 degrees until the microarray experiments were performed. RNAs were analyzed on Agilent
      Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples were pooled in 4 (5 samples/pool and 4 pools/group). Finally, 8
      Agilent One colour Whole genome microarray (44K) were performed with pooled samples, 4
      microarrays per group.

      The results will be evaluate to detect those genes differentially expressed.
