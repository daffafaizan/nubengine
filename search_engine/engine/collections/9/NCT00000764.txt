      intraepithelial neoplasia; thus, anogenital epithelial may become an increasingly important
      cause of morbidity, and possibly mortality, as the HIV epidemic matures. Clinical studies of
      non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the progression
      of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states.

      In the Phase I portion of the study, 20 patients per site each receive isotretinoin in
      escalating doses. If a patient experiences grade 2 or worse toxicity (or grade 3 or worse
      hypertriglyceridemia), dose is reduced to the previously tolerated dose for the remainder of
      the 6 week period. Patients are then reassessed for anal neoplasia; those with no progression
      and no grade 2 or worse toxicity receive an additional 6 weeks of isotretinoin in combination
      with interferon alfa-2a. For Phase II of the study, a separate group of patients who have
      undergone ablative therapy are randomized to one of three arms (26 patients/arm):
      isotretinoin alone at the dose tolerated by at least 60 percent of patients in Phase I;
      isotretinoin plus interferon alfa-2a; or observation only. Treatment continues for 48 weeks.
