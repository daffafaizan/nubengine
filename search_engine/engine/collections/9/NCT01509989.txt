    
      This international multicentric prospective study is an observational study that will include
      consecutive SLE patients treated with HCQ and with SLE flare (defined by the SELENA-SLEDAI
      flare composite). The study will only require the sampling of 1 vial of whole blood for the
      dosage of HCQ (that would be centralized and performed in PITIE-SALPETRIERE Hospital at the
      completion of the study). The patients and the physicians will also have adherence
      self-questionnaires to complete, and the physicians will complete a patient data sheet.

      The end points are adherence of the treatment in the whole group, and subgroups, adherence
      according to the severity of SLE, and the relationship between patient's questionnaires,
      physician evaluation of adherence and blood HCQ dosage.

      If investigators confirm their previous data, this study might demonstrate that a significant
      proportion of patient candidates for treatment escalation are in fact nonadherent to the
      treatment. It might further demonstrate the interest of HCQ concentrations monitoring, both
      in "real life" and in therapeutic study in SLE as it may avoid unnecessary, expensive or even
      hazardous regimen escalation.
