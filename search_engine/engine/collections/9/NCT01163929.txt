      HER-2 positive operable breast cancer. All patients will receive 18 weeks of neoadjuvant
      treatment.

      The trial has an initial 2 week "biomarker lead in" phase. During this two week phase
      patients will either receive Trastuzumab alone or Trastuzumab + Everolimus. This two week
      lead in phase will be randomized open label. The rest of the 16 weeks of the neoadjuvant
      trial treatment is non randomized open label.

      For the first two weeks of neoadjuvant treatment the eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either receive or not receive Everolimus. This assignment will be accomplished by
      a previously prepared schedule (maintained by the investigational pharmacy), such that
      investigators are unaware of assignment until after the subject has been enrolled on the
      study and received assignment of Everolimus or not.
