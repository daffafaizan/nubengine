      We have already described the increased expression of GITR-glucocorticoid induced TNF-related
      family receptor during active disease and a decrease in its expression when disease activity
      diminishes. We have preliminary observations in uveitis patients to suggest that suppressors
      of cytokine activity (SOCS) 1, 3, and 5 may also be active during either a Th1 or Th2
      mediated disease. We wish to see if there is a correlation between these markers and whether
      they can serve as an indicator of impending activation of disease before actual clinical
      disease, and how therapy may alter their expression. Patients with uveitis will receive
      standard evaluation and treatment for inflammatory uveitis under this protocol Blood will be
      drawn when specific clinical criteria are reached for correlation of potential markers with
      disease activity.
