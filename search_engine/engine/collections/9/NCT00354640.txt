      Primary

        -  Assess the effects of concurrent anastrozole and simvastatin on anastrozole's
           steady-state concentration in postmenopausal women with history of invasive breast
           cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ or at high risk for developing breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Study the effect of concurrent simvastatin and anastrozole on estrogen suppression in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients continue to receive oral anastrozole once daily (as prior to study entry). They also
      receive oral simvastatin once daily for 14-18 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      diagnosis of new or recurrent breast cancer.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and after study therapy for analysis of
      anastrozole and hormone (estradiol and estrogen) concentrations.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
