      following acquired brain injury. If BTX injections reduce spasticity, few studies have
      examined its effect on the improvement of active function of the upper limb.

      Motor task involves the muscles agonists and antagonists by phenomena of muscular
      coactivation.

      In post-stroke patients, functional cortical reorganization secondary to the phenomena of
      plasticity leads to a reduced motor selectivity. The increase of muscular coactivation
      correspond to the spastic cocontraction, which are a little evaluated in clinical practice
      and research, whereas they appear to have a greater impact than spasticity on limitation of
      active movement.

      This study does not evaluate the efficacy of treatment (BTX injection) but the effect of this
      treatment on a component of muscle hyperactivity, the spastic cocontraction.

      In addition to the 5 follow-up visits, patients have 6 intercurrent visits. These visits are
      less invasive and include only a clinical assessment with surface EMG registration. These
      evaluations will evaluate the efficacy and harm effect of BTX on clinical parameters and on
      the spastic co-contraction index. Five intercurrent visits I1, I2, I3, I4, I5 are perform
      respectively 2 weeks after T1 and, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks after T2.
