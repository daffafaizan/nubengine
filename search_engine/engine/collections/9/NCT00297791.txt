      either of the two procedures at a randomization ratio of 2:1 in favor of the laparoscopic
      procedure. Excluded are patients with a carcinoma treated by local resection and palliative
      resections. The trial will be stratified according to participating centre, resection type,
      and preoperative radiotherapy.

      If the 95% CI for the difference of the 3-year locoregional recurrence rates excludes a
      difference greater than 5% in favor of the conventional procedure, non-inferiority of the
      laparoscopic procedure will be concluded. Assuming both rates are 10%, 1000 evaluable cases
      are required in total for a power of 80%.

      Analysis will be primarily on an intention to treat basis. Definition of conversion is
      defined by protocol.
