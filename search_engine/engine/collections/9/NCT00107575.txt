      cessation. This clinical trial examined whether smoking cessation treatment that incorporates
      brief alcohol intervention can improve smoking cessation outcomes (7-day verified point
      prevalence abstinence) and reduce drinks consumed per week. Heavy drinkers seeking smoking
      cessation treatment were assigned by urn randomization to receive, along with 8-weeks of
      nicotine replacement therapy, either a 4-session standard smoking cessation treatment (ST, n
      = 119) or standard treatment of equal intensity that incorporated brief alcohol intervention
      (ST-BI, n = 117).
