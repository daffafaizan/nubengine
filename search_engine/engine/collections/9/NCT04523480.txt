      testes. Testosterone pellets is a long-acting formulation of TRT that is delivered
      subcutaneously to men diagnosed with low T. Advantages to subcutaneous testosterone pellets
      include ease of delivery and decreased risk of the medication being transfer upon skin
      contact to woman or children. Long acting testosterone replacement Implantation of six to ≥10
      testosterone pellets (450 to ≥750 mg) increased total testosterone into the therapeutic range
      at 1 month post-implantation and sustained therapeutic levels (>300) for 4-6 months.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups. In one of the groups the
      treatment will include implantation of Testopel ® 750mg (10 pellets with 75mg pellet) one
      time, in the second group, treatment will include compounded subcutaneous testosterone 800mg
      (8 pellets with 100mg pellet) one time and in the third group, treatment will include
      compounded subcutaneous testosterone 800mg (4 pellets with 200mg pellet) one time.

      The treatment takes approximately 30 minutes and will include: Clean and numb the insertion
      site with lidocaine at 1%, followed by small incision in the skin, implantation of pellets
      into subdermal fat layer and sealing the incision with Steri-strip. This is the current
      standard of care of Testopel insertion and same procedure will be followed with both
      compounded and commercial pellets.
