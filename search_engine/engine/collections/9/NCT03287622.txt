      optimizing opioid risk recognition, informed analgesic decision-making, and drug
      storage/disposal behaviors among parents of youth who are prescribed these agents for home
      use. The study aims are to determine whether the Scenario-Tailored Opioid Messaging Program
      (STOMP) will: 1) Improve parents' opioid risk understanding and their analgesic
      decision-making; 2) Enhance parents' analgesic self-efficacy, analgesic use, storage
      behaviors and their children's pain outcomes, and 3) To demonstrate that the STOMP plus
      provision of a simple method to get rid of left-over opioids will effectively nudge parents
      to safely dispose of left-over opioid analgesics. Parents whose children are prescribed
      opioids for acute, short-lived pain after surgery will be randomly assigned to receive our
      interventions or a routine provider informational interaction at the time of opioid
      prescribing. Parents will be surveyed about their opioid familiarity, knowledge, risk
      perceptions and common analgesic decision-making at baseline and after hospital discharge.
      Parents will also record their child's pain medication use and symptoms after discharge. Data
      will be analyzed to determine whether the STOMP educational intervention with or without the
      behavioral nudge intervention will enhance parents' risk perceptions, their decision-making
      skills and their opioid handling behaviors.
