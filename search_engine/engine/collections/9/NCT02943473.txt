    
      This is a phase 2, open-label, single center, prospective pilot study designed to assess the
      efficacy of ibrutinib in subjects with high risk smoldering multiple myeloma.

      All enrolled subjects will be treated with ibrutinib 560 mg (4 capsules, each containing 140
      mg) taken PO daily for 12 cycles (28 days each). If a subject demonstrates benefit from
      ibrutinib, therapy may be extended beyond 12 cycles to a maximum of 2 years. Subjects who
      progress and meet criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma will be withdrawn from study.

      An initial cohort of 15 subjects will be accrued. If 4 or more patients progress to
      symptomatic myeloma in one year, then the study will be reviewed with the FDA to determine
      whether to employ a higher dose of ibrutinib, or to stop for futility. Otherwise, 21
      additional patients will be accrued for a total sample size of 36.
