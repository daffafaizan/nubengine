      poor outcome in major depressive disorder.

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  Identifying neuroimaging biomarker like Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) predictive of poor
           outcome in major depressive disorder;

        -  Identifying morphological biomarker like volumetric abnormalities (Voxel Based
           Morphometry - VBM), other than the cortical thickness, predictive of poor outcome in
           major depressive disorder;

        -  Identifying clinical features (sociodemographic, clinical dimensions such as apathy or
           anxiety) predictive of poor outcome of depression.

      This study expect to assess on a large population of patients:

        -  Clinical and neuroimaging markers (morphological and perfusion) predictive of poor
           outcome in major depressive disorder, allowing early identification of patients at risk
           of poor therapeutic response. These markers should allow a better stratification of
           patients;

        -  A better characterization of pathophysiological processes involved in major depressive
           disorder at different stages of the illness;

        -  Development of innovative technologies such as treatment with repetitive transcranial
           magnetic stimulation, or neurofeedback using real time fMRI, on both aspects of
           evaluation of the effectiveness and optimization of procedures.

      Such a study would open up on thinking in terms of therapeutic management. Indeed, recurrent
      and potentially resistant forms and screened using such predictive neuroimaging biomarkers
      could serve more specific therapeutic approaches in a preventive approach.
