    
      Diabetic polyneuropathy is one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes.
      Neuronal hyperexcitability is thought to be a key factor in the development of neuropathic
      pain.

      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of
      diabetic polyneuropathy and painful diabetic polyneuropathy.
