    
      This was a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, 3-arm study designed
      to compare the efficacy and safety of a once daily dose of QAW039 with placebo in non-atopic
      and atopic asthmatics both inadequately controlled despite receiving a low dose ICS
      background therapy, over a 12 week treatment period. Efficacy and safety of a once daily dose
      of QAW039 was also compared with an increased dose of ICS in atopic asthmatics taking low
      dose ICS as background therapy.
