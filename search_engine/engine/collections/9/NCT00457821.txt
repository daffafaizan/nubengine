      of dosing, in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have a G551D-CTFR gene mutation.
      Enrollment of 39 subjects occurred at 15 centers in the US, Canada, and Germany.

      The study was conducted in 2 parts:

        -  Part 1 consisted of Group A and Group B. Subjects in Group A (10 subjects) were
           randomized to receive 25 mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours [q12h] (4 subjects), 75 mg of
           ivacaftor q12h (4 subjects), or placebo (2 subjects) for 14 days. Following a 7- to
           28-day washout period, subjects who received active study drug crossed over to the
           alternate dose strength of ivacaftor for an additional 14 days. Placebo subjects
           continued to receive placebo for an additional 14 days. Subjects in Group B (10
           subjects) were randomized to receive 75 mg of ivacaftor q12h (4 subjects), 150 mg of
           ivacaftor q12h (4 subjects), or placebo (2 subjects) for 14 days. Following a 7- to
           28-day washout period, the subjects who received active study drug crossed over to the
           alternate dose strength of ivacaftor for an additional 14 days. Placebo subjects
           continued to receive placebo for an additional 14 days.

        -  Part 2 consisted of Group C; these subjects did not participate in Part 1. Subjects were
           randomized to receive 150 mg of ivacaftor q12h (7 subjects), 250 mg of ivacaftor q12h (7
           subjects), or placebo (4 subjects) for a total of 28 days. Ivacaftor doses studied in
           Part 2 were selected following an interim pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and
           statistical analyses of data from Part 1. The 2 doses selected for Part 2 were
           anticipated to enable better definition of the optimal therapeutic dose.
