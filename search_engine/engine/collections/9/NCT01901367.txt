      I. To evaluate feasibility, adherence, completion rates and participant satisfaction
      associated with a family based lifestyle intervention for overweight pediatric acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients or those at high risk to become so (body mass index
      [BMI] >= 50th percentile).

      II. Assess changes in BMI z-score, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure
      exercise tolerance and physical activity at baseline, immediately post intervention and three
      months later.

      III. Assess changes in serum glucose, insulin, leptin and adiponectin in patients over the
      intervention course and at 3 months post intervention.

      IV. Assess changes in self-reported quality of life, physical activity, caloric intake, and
      fatigue associated with the nutrition and exercise program in the participant and their
      primary caregiver.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan and monthly
      booster follow-up sessions from the nutritionist and exercise physiologist and weekly phone
      counseling with a trained health coach to address barriers to improve plan adherence.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
