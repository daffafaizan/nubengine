      worldwide, with a global prevalence of gestational hyperglycaemia estimated at 16.9%. In
      Canada, Atlantic provinces have been recorded with the highest prevalence of diabetes at 6%.
      The Diabetes Canada Practice Guidelines recommends the low glycemic index (GI) diet to type 1
      and 2 diabetes mellitus and has recently updated its guidelines to include a recommendation
      for GDM. This said, barriers to GI knowledge translation have been identified. This study
      uses a prospective parallel randomized control trial design. Procedures and materials have
      been adapted from NCT01589757. The Kirkpatrick Model (Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, and
      Results) informed intervention development and evaluation strategies. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate whether a distance low GI education intervention, adapted from Diabetes
      Canada's GI education materials, will significantly yield a lower average GI (primary
      outcome) in participants than traditional standard care medical nutrition therapy for
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. We hypothesize that participants who receive the low GI
      intervention will have a lower dietary GI than those who received usual IWK standard care for
      GDM.
