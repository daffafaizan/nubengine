      Flavivirus status will be determined at baseline (before the first dose) and the vaccine
      immunogenicity assessment will be at 28 days after each vaccination. Reactogenicity data will
      be collected in all subjects after each dose. Serious adverse events and adverse events of
      special interest will be collected throughout the study.
