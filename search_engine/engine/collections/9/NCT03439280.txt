      people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This study will assess
      the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of TAK-079
      monotherapy and will provide a preliminary assessment of its activity against MM. The study
      is designed to consist of 2 phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2a.

      The study could enroll approximately 100 participants. The study population of Phase 1 will
      consist of approximately 55 participants. Participants in Phase 1 will be assigned to TAK-079
      and dose-escalation will range from 45 mg to 1800 mg.

      The study population of Phase 2a will consist of approximately 48 participants. Dose for
      Phase 2a will be based upon review of the available safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamic data from the preceding cohorts of Phase 1.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 42 months (3.5 years). In Phase 1, participants who stop
      treatment for any other reason other than PD will continue to have progression-free survival
      (PFS) follow-up at the site every 4 weeks from the last dose of study drug up to 12 months or
      until PD, death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal or study termination. Participants
      will be followed 30 days after last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent
      alternative anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, for a follow up assessment.
