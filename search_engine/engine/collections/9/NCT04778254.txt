      PEEK group received attachment-retained obturators with milled PEEK framework, metal group
      received an attachment-retained obturator with metallic framework and conventional group
      received conventional clasp-retained obturators with metallic framework (Control group).
      Evaluation included radiographic evaluation and patients' satisfaction where two scales were
