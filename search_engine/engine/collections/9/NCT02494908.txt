      microstructural brain alterations after performing a cognitive task and to compare those
      changes in patients with PD to healthy controls of the same age.

      PD patients and controls will undergo a full cranial MRI scan for depiction of anatomy and
      structural abnormalities (scan duration ~40 min). Immediately afterwards the subjects will
      play a car race computer game (Need for Speed) for 90 minutes. Following the game, the
      patients will undergo an additional DTI MRI scan (~15 minutes).
