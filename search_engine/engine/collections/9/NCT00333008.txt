      with more than half of the patients being over the age of 60 years. Elderly patients with
      cancer are defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology as a "special population" due
      to their disease characteristics, additional health problems, and need for aggressive
      supportive care strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. The combination of
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) remains as standard therapy
      for the treatment of DLBCL, but elderly patients tend to tolerate the CHOP therapy less when
      compared to younger patients. Cardiac toxicity, as well as decrease in blood counts, are the
      most common side effects in the elderly population. For these reasons, many doctors are
      reluctant to use standard combinations and doses of chemotherapy in the elderly for fear of
      increased morbidity. DLBCL in the elderly is also somewhat unique in that the elderly
      patients appear to have more aggressive disease and poor overall outcome. In order to
      maximize the tolerability of treatment and thus potentially enhance overall treatment success
      in this population, it is necessary to look at alternative treatments. This clinical trial is
      based on currently accepted standard NHL therapy (CHOP-Rituximab) in which Doxil is
      substituted for Adriamycin. Growth factor will be used for support of acceptable blood
      counts. Chemotherapy regimens that include rituximab are now the gold standard for treatment
      of DLBCL. If indeed, delivering full dose chemotherapy without treatment delays leads to
      higher remission and cure rates, then this offers a significant proportion of NHL patients
      who are elderly a chance for cure rather than providing treatment for comfort measures while
      preserving quality of life.
