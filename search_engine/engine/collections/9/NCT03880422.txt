      I. Assess the effect of individualized nutrition and exercise counseling interventions on
      myokine expression and body composition in prostate cancer (PrCa) patients being treated with
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine any changes in muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength and functional
      capacity resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.

      II. Determine any changes in myokines, circulating inflammatory and frailty-associated
      cytokines resulting from the nutrition and exercise counseling interventions.

      III. Determine the effect of the study interventions on dietary intake, physical activity,
      fatigue, and quality of life.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate changes in secondary objectives with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and
      testosterone levels.

      II. Evaluate adherence to nutrition and exercise advice. III. Evaluate assessment tools and
      recruiting strategies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive an individualized diet plan for 6 months. Patients complete an
      individualized home-based exercise program aerobic and resistance exercise over 10-30 minutes
      per day, at minimum 3 days per week for 6 months, and a progressive resistance exercise
      program including an individually tailored prescription targeting the chest, shoulders, arms,
      and leg musculature for 1-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions, 5 days per week over 6 months.
      Patients also attend monthly educational meetings for 6 months.
