    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To assess the efficacy of adjuvant sunitinib malate or adjuvant valproic acid used for 6
      months to improve overall survival (OS) at 2 years in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the efficacy of adjuvant sunitinib malate and adjuvant valproic acid used for
           6 months in preventing the development of distal metastases (relapse-free survival, RFS)
           in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

        2. To confirm the safety and tolerability of 6 months of adjuvant sunitinib and adjuvant
           valproic acid in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

        3. To assess the quality of life during the adjuvant treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To determine whether blood myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) concentration and
      other inflammatory cytokines correlates with OS and RFS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) daily for 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive valproic acid PO daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
