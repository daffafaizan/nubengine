    
      Bronchiolitis is a viral disease of very variable evolution going from a simple outpatient
      treatment to the necessity of hospitalization in intensive care.

      This epidemic disease is found all year round with a seasonal peak from mid-October to late
      winter.

      The risk factors for progression to severe or prolonged bronchiolitis have been highlighted,
      but the duration of hospitalization is difficult to predict, which leads to organizational
      difficulties in the services and additional anxiety for the families.

      The management of beds during winter epidemics can be a source of difficulties for
      hospitalization services, with the need to temporarily increase reception places or transfer
      children to other hospitals.

      Oxygen rescue is the main factor limiting the discharge of the pediatric ward. This criterion
      seems to us more suitable than the total duration of hospitalization.

      Indeed, other factors such as the family environment or food difficulties can delay the
      child's departure from the service. Their assessment seems to be more subjective, their
      assessment may vary from one doctor to another.

      Better management of beds during winter epidemics could help to avoid changes in service
      during hospitalization, thus facilitating relationships between caregivers and families.
