      among residents in deprived neighborhoods a randomized controlled trial is performed. Women
      aged 14-49 years and men aged 14-39 years from two low income neighborhoods in Barcelona
      (Catalonia, Spain) who had not undergone an irreversible contraceptive method and aren't
      planning a pregnancy have been recruited in 2011-13. The intervention consists of a
      culturally developed and theoretically-based brief counseling in community settings. The
      primary outcome is the consistent use of very effective contraceptive methods (optimal use).
      Secondary outcomes analyzed are the incorrect use of very effective contraceptive methods and
      use of less effective methods stratified by sex and migrant status. Differences within
      subgroups from baseline to 3 months - follow up are analyzed and intervention effects are
      assessed with adjusted robust Poisson regressions.
