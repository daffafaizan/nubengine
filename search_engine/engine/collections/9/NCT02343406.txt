    
      The study objectives were to assess whether depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) alone or in
      combination with temozolomide (TMZ) improved overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
      (PFS), tumor response, quality of life, neurological deterioration-free survival (NDFS), and
      steroid use compared to standard treatment with lomustine single agent or TMZ re-challenge in
      adult subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age with centrally-confirmed recurrent epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioblastoma. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      depatuxizumab mafodotin in children <18 years of age was evaluated in a pediatric substudy.
      The EMEA-001732-PIP02-15 pediatric investigation plan was withdrawn on 07 July 2019 due to
      the discontinuation of the depatuxizumab mafodotin research program.
