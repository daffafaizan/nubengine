      growth markers. Vandetanib is not approved by the FDA for use in treating breast cancer. This
      study will compare vandetanib to a placebo.

      The proposed study is designed to determine the change in Ki-67 expression on paired breast
      cancer samples obtained before and after treatment with vandetanib. Other tumor markers
      including RET, TUNEL and phosphorylation specific levels of ERK1/2, AKT and mTOR will also be
      assessed on the paired samples.

      Those who have a core biopsy of the breast which demonstrates invasive breast cancer and
      requires surgical excision of the lesion will be eligible for inclusion in the study. The
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib 300 mg, will be given once a day for 7-14 days prior to
      surgery. Following surgery, tissue markers would be analyzed on each of the paired samples,
      allowing for rapid assessment of in vivo response to TKI treatment.
