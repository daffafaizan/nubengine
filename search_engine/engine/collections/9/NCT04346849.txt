      placement of a compatible material and subsequent coronal restoration of the tooth. Mineral
      trioxide aggregate is the gold standard material used in pulpotomy; however it has been
      implicated in tooth discoloration due to it radioopacifier. newer calcium silicate based
      materials including Biodentine and bioceramic have different opacifier and claimed not to
      cause tooth discoloration in laboratory studies.

      In this clinical study tooth color measurement of teeth treated by pulpotomy using these 3
      materials will be taken using vita easy shade device immediately after placement of the
      materials, 6 months and 12 months after the treatment then yearly up to 5 years. The
      discoloration potential of these 3 materials will be compared. Factors that may influence
      tooth discoloration will be also measured and analyzed including buccal wall thickness and
      time of bleeding control after pulpotomy.
