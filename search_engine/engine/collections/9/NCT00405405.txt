      prognosis. Improvements in outcome have been achieved via the combination of chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is needed to optimize results, although recent
      data suggest a benefit from induction therapy as well. Nonetheless, despite high remission
      rates, most of these patients will suffer local-regional and/or distant recurrence from their
      disease.

      The proposed study will build upon the framework of chemoradiotherapy (induction plus
      concurrent) via the addition of a double biologic therapy. Specifically, the combination of
      bevacizumab and erlotinib will be used, as has been studied in other types of cancer.
