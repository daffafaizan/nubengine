      (ABZ sulphoxide and ABZ sulphone) in non-infected human volunteers.

      Objective 2. To characterize the pattern of albendazole (ABZ) and its main metabolites (ABZ
      sulphoxide and ABZ sulphone) urinary excretion in non-infected human volunteers.

      Objective 3. To determine the optimal and the longest period time after treatment where
      either ABZ and/or its metabolites can be measured in urine as an indirect assessment of an
      individual's adherence to treatment.
