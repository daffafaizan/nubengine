      separate occasions: (1) Buspirone vs. Trazodone vs. placebo for 2 weeks; the patients will be
      blinded to whether they are taking trazodone or placebo; buspirone cannot be blinded because
      it is dosed twice a day and is up titrated during the two weeks of administration. The
      initial dose of Buspirone is 15 mg daily (7.5 mg bid.). To achieve an optimal therapeutic
      response, at intervals of 2 to 3 days the dosage may be increased 5 mg per day until a
      maximum dose 30mg/day is reached. After the two week treatment a sleep study will be
      repeated. Trazodone will be given at 100 mg dose before bed-time. (2) Cross over medication
      for two weeks will be followed by a second sleep study followed by two weeks washout. (3)
      Cross over medication for two weeks will be followed by another sleep study. To assess the
      clinical effect of the drug on breathing during sleep a qualitative polysomnography will be
      performed for 2 hours the same night after taking the drug/placebo. This will allow the
      determination of ventilatory changes and the determination of the number of respiratory
      events (apnea/hypopnea index).
