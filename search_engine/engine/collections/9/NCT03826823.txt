      metal cannula is the only method used at our hospital. It is painful procedure because it
      requires grasping the cervix with a tenaculum and inducing some cervical dilatation during
      introduction of the cannula. The aim of this pilot study was to modify the technique of HSG
      using a thinner than normal catheter, and without grasping the cervix with a tenaculum.
      Leakage of the dye through the cervix was prevented by pressing on the portiovaginalis of the
      cervix using the vaginal speculum.
