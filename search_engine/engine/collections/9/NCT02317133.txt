      A. During an inflammatory HSP flare, is there a quantitative and / or qualitative defect in
      plasma Tregs? Are such blood anomalies real or are they due to a modification of the
      distribution of theses cells to localized sites? B. In the asymptomatic phase, are there
      quantitative or functional abnormalities among Tregs in subjects with HSP compared to healthy
      control subjects? C. Are Treg abnormalities associated with modifications in other blood cell
      lineages, including B cells secreting IgA and abnormally glycosylated IgA1, and secretion of
      cytokines during acute relapses and during the asymptomatic phase? D. Can streptococcus or
      other oral or digestive pathogens (bacterial or viral) (as suggested in other chronic
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ) provoke (via stimulation Th3) isotype commutation
      towards secretion of IgA1 at the origin of HSP? Does HSP intestinal damage or imbalance of
      the intestinal microbiota allow the translocation of intestinal microorganisms that sustain
      this stimulation?
