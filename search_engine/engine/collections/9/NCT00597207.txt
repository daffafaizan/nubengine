      of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Several studies document
      sub optimal quality of manual chest compressions and this may influence outcome. However,
      studies comparing manual and mechanical chest compressions have resulted in conflicted
      results. The investigators think this may be based on methodology and design issues of the
      trials as much as not focusing on training and experience in operating a mechanical device
      clinically. Therefore the investigators will focus on these issues and implement three phases
      in the study (In field training, Run In phase, and Study phase). The investigators will also
      focus on early use of mechanical CPR after arrival at patient side and randomization at
      arrival. In order to achieve this the investigators will follow the Norwegian CPR Guidelines
      with 3 min CPR before defibrillation and the 3 min algorithm. Quality of CPR will be
      monitored.
