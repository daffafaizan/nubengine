      damage and inflammation. Melatonin is a hormone produced in brain and regulate sleep rhythm,
      temperature, production of other hormones and function of organs. Furthermore melatonin can
      modify cell damage and inflammation. After surgery the production of melatonin is disturbed.
      The purpose of this study is therefore to determine whether treatment with melatonin can
      reduce cell damage and inflammation in connection with laparoscopic gall bladder surgery.
