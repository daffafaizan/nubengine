    
      This is a prospective observational study. Patients will be followed during a single
      admission for development of colonization or infection with MDR-GNB. Patient clinical
      characteristics, including infections, surgeries, and antibiotic exposure, will be collected
      in real-time.

      Weekly surveillance wound and peri-rectal swabs and, if intubated, biweekly deep endotracheal
      or tracheostomy aspirates will be collected, de-identified, and stored from all patients and
      examined for the presence of MDR-GNB. All GNB isolates from blood, urine, respiratory, and
      wound cultures will be collected, coded, and stored.
