      the quality of life and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care alone.
      Docetaxel is an active agent for treating patients with gastric cancer. S-1, an oral 5-FU
      prodrug, is active against AGC as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin in phase
      III trials. Therefore, a single-arm phase II study was conducted to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of biweekly docetaxel and S-1 (DS) combination therapy as second-line treatment in
      patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer.
