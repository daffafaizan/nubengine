      of the European Conformity Approved (CE marked) CardioKinetix Parachute Implant System. The
      primary objective is to establish quality-of-life and cardiac output benefit of the Parachute
      Implant of patients presenting with symptoms of heart failure due to ischemic heart disease.
      A maximum of 105 treated patients and approximately 25 control patients may be enrolled, with
      a maximum of 25 treated patients enrolled from any one center. The Primary Endpoint is an
      improvement of Quality of Life of patients treated with the Parachute Implant at 6 months
      compared to baseline using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) Questionnaire. The
      Secondary Endpoint is an improvement in Stroke Volume Index (mL/m2) of patients treated with
      the Parachute Implant at post-procedure compared to pre-procedure.
