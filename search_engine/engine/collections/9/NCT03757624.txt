      major curvature and spread down to the table.in operating room..3 cm x 3 cm three tissue
      samples will collect from the specific locations. These three locations are ; fundus( 1 cm
      from the top of staple line) , corpus (middle of the major curvature , antrum ( 1 cm far from
      the bottom of staple line ). All these points 5 mm far from the major curvature. 6 samples
      will prepare totally. 2 samples for each location ; one mucosa and one all layer of gastric
      wall for each location .These 3 points will examine about wall thickness(mucosa-
      submucosa-muscularis propria -serosa ) After saving the measurements in operating room;the
      gastric specimen will deliver to a pathologist to put the specimen into the % 10 formol
      solution. After 24 hours ;pathologist will save all of new measurements same in operating
      room. The measurements of sample are ;height , length , width . After the completion of the
      measurements the investigator will compare the results found in operating room in fresh
      specimen with pathologist 's results after formol. After that the investigator will be able
      to decide the shrinkage of gastric tissue in % 10 formol solution.
