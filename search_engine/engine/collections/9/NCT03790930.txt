      and treatment of spinal disease. Classification of specific targets (e.g. individuals,
      lesions, etc.) is one of the most common mission of medical image analysis. However, it is
      time-consuming for spine surgeons or radiologists to conduct manual classifications of spinal
      CT, which may also be correlated with high inter-observer variance. With the development of
      computer science, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique to classify images from
      individual level to pixel level. The main of the study is to automatically identify and
      classify the lesions, or segment targeted structures on spinal CT with deep learning.
