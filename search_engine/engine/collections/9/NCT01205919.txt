      internet-based interventions for a variety of mental disorders during the last years. A
      Swedish research group developed an internet-based self-help training for patients with
      chronic tinnitus showing promising results (Andersson et al., 2002; Kaldo et al., 2007; Kaldo
      et al., 2008). This self-help training was now adapted for German-speaking patients. The
      present study evaluates the efficacy of this treatment in a randomized controlled trial
      conducted in Germany. Further aims are a process evaluation of the treatment and the
      identification of predictors of efficacy.
