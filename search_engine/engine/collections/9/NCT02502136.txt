      be enrolled in this study. The participants will be divided into 2 groups according to the
      examination field, esophagogastroduodenoscopy group (320 participants) and colonoscope group
      (320 participants). The participants in each group will be divided into sedated endoscope
      subgroup and sedated and unsedated endoscope subgroup (each subgroup is inclusive of 160
      participants). Carbon dioxide (CO2) or room air will be used randomly to insufflate the bowel
      lumen during the procedure in each subgroup.
