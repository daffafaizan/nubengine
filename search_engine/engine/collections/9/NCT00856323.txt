      assessments; received rapid HIV testing; provided specimens for syphilis, gonorrhea and
      chlamydia testing; and received a medical examination. Those who reported a high-risk sexual
      or drug exposure episode with an HIV-positive or serostatus-unknown source within the
      preceding 72 hours immediately initiated postexposure prophylaxis. All other participants
      received a 4-day ''starter pack'' of Truvada to be initiated only in the case of a future
      high-risk exposure to HIV. All participants began the voucher-based CM intervention upon
      study entry. For the initial 8 weeks of study conduct, participants presented to the study
      site three times weekly for a urine drug screen for methamphetamine metabolites. Participants
      who provided urine samples that were negative for methamphetamine metabolites earned
      vouchers, which escalated in value for successive negative urine samples. A participant with
      a missing sample or a sample positive for methamphetamine metabolites did not earn vouchers.
      Accrued vouchers were never forfeited and could be redeemed at any time during the study for
      gift certificates or goods or services that promote healthy, pro-social behaviors; vouchers
      could not be redeemed for cash.
