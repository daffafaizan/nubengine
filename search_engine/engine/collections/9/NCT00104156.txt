      therapy; however, cost, side effects, and varying levels of effectiveness warrant the need
      for development of new treatments. Qigong therapy, which involves deep meditation, breathing
      exercises, and the harnessing of energy, may be an effective treatment for OA.

      According to traditional Chinese medicine, Qi (Chi) is the "life force" that flows through
      the body and keeps people healthy and vital. In the practice of traditional Chinese medicine,
      arthritis is thought to be due to a blockage of the flow of Qi or a buildup of abnormal or
      damaging Qi. It is believed that releasing this buildup or breaking the blockage of Qi
      through Qigong therapy may relieve OA symptoms.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive five sessions of either Qigong therapy or
      sham treatment over a period of 2 weeks. During Qigong therapy, a therapist will send his or
      her Qi to the arthritic knees through touch and meditation. Similar body work will be
      performed during the sham treatment, but no Qi will be harnessed. Self-report scales that
      measure pain, stiffness, anxiety, daily drug use, CAM use, and overall functioning will be
      used to assess participants. The assessments will occur at study start and at a 3-month
      follow-up visit.
