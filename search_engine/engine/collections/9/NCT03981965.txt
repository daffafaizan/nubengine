      derived from the European project FOCUS had an effect on the adherence to a physical activity
      (PA) program (primary objective), and ii) the effect of the program, which included 2 h/week
      of PA, on a group of dimensions related with general health, frailty, psycho-cognitive
      parameters, and quality of life (QoL) (secondary objectives).

      The study comprised 24 weeks in which a group of 90 postmenopausal women were randomised to
      three arms, two in which participants were performing PA, and one control (no intervention).

      The first PA group followed the FOCUS guidelines, in which women received monthly health
      talks and had an internet mailbox to facilitate contact with health professionals.

      The PA program consisted of a twice per week 1-hour session along 24 weeks. This period was
      divided into two parts, a first supervised phase in which women followed group sessions under
      direct supervision of a monitor, and a second period in which the groups of women followed
      the same exercise pattern, but autonomously. A mobile phone support system (social network
      whatsapp) was used for inter-connection and mutual support during the autonomous period.
      Assessments were performed at baseline and then at 12 weeks and 24 weeks, representing the
      completion of the supervised and the autonomous periods, respectively.
