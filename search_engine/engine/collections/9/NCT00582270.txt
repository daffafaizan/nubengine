    
      This is a prospective observational clinical study of possible infectious disease-associated
      antigen drive in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma (follicular and
      nonfollicular cohorts).

      Eligible patients with a new diagnosis of indolent lymphoma will be enrolled after informed
      consent. All patients will be tested for possible known infectious diseases that may
      contribute to antigen drive (H. Pylori; Hepatitis C), as well as for other infectious
      diseases not yet established as contributing to antigen drive (Borrelia; Chlamydia; and small
      bowel overgrowth). All patients will have a complete history recorded regarding other
      possible chronic infections, and an infectious disease consultation, as indicated.

      Patients with positive antigen-drive infectious disease studies will be treated as indicated
      with standard antibiotic regimens and response (both infectious disease as well as lymphoma
      status)will be documented and recorded.

      The primary objective of this study is (1) to evaluate the possible association of infectious
      diseases in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma. The secondary objective of
      this study is to evaluate possible lymphoma response the in patients treated for positive
      infectious disease studies; and to evaluate EBV immune responses in these previously
      untreated patients.
