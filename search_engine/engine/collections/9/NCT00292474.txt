      Patients were stratified by presence or absence of medically treated diabetes mellitus and
      vessel diameter (<3.0 mm or >/=3.0 mm), then randomized 1:1 to receive either the TAXUS Stent
      or a Control stent. Additional study stents were permitted to optimize outcomes. The study
      was considered complete (with regard to the primary endpoint) after all patients enrolled had
      completed the 9 month follow-up.

      Enrollment of 1172 patients was planned; 1326 were treated and randomized at 73 centers
      involving 76 sites by 8 July 2002 with 667 in the TAXUS group and 659 in the Control group.
