      total of 12 doses in an outpatient setting in stage IV melanoma and kidney cancer to attempt
      to determine the response rate, how long the responses last, and median survival of this
      regimen in these two diseases. Responding patients and those with absence of disease
      progression may receive additional cycles of therapy every 3 weeks.
