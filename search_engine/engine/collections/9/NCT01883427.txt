      prospective study. The children started with a visit to an ENT doctor and after inclusion the
      children started to spray twice daily with glucose oxidase+glucose or only saline+glucose for
      3 months. During this period the parents were asked to fill in a home protocol recording
      upper respiratory tract symptoms as: rhinitis, cough, fever, ear ache. After 6 weeks and 12
      weeks the children had scheduled visits to the ENT department, where an ENT doctor examined
      the throat, nasal cavity and the ear drums for otitis media. After 12 weeks of treatment a
      nasopharyngeal swab was taken for bacterial culture.
