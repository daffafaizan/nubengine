      teaching hospitals in Taiwan. This trial will recruit 320 patients fulfilling all of the
      following criteria: patients more than 20 years old, HCCs diagnosed by AASLD image criteria
      or pathology, medium-sized HCCs in BCLC intermediate stage and not more than 5 cm in maximum
      diameter and not more than 5 tumors that TACE is indicated, chronic HBV carrier (HBsAg+) with
      detectable HBV DNA in blood, ECOG performance status (PST) 0-2, Child-Pugh score â‰¦7, serum
      bilirubin < 2 mg/dL and prothrombin time (PT) prolongation < 3 seconds, and willingness to
      adhere to treatment and follow-up plans. Patients are ineligible if they have any of the
      following exclusion criteria: any vascular invasion by tumors, extra-hepatic metastasis,
      concurrent any other malignancy, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, previous any HCC
      treatment, previous or current any antiviral therapy for HBV, concomitant other therapies for
      HCC except TACE, liver cirrhosis with severe gastroesophageal varices (EVF3 or with red color
      sign), poorly-controlled ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, contraindication for invasive
      procedures such as recent gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage, contraindication
      to TACE such as allergy to contrast, pregnancy, sepsis, etc., chronic renal failure with eGFR
      < 60, concurrent any other chronic viral hepatitis with HCV, HDV, or HIV). The Primary
      endpoints of this study will be 1-, 3-year overall survival, and the secondary endpoints of
      this study will be time to tumor progression and time to liver decompensation.
