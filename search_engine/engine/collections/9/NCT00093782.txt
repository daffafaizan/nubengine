      I. To assess the objective tumor response rate (i.e. partial or complete responses as defined
      by the RECIST criteria) in patients with progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumours given
      CCI-779.

      II. To assess the stable disease rate and duration, time to progression, median survival
      time, 1-year survival rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinomas
      given CCI-779. As of 19 July 2010, overall survival follow-up is to be discontinued for the
      four remaining patients on long term follow-up. At that point in time, these patients had
      been off-treatment for 3 to 5 years. Time to progression and median survival times will be
      based on the currently available data.

      III. To measure baseline levels of various elements up- and downstream of the mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR). Where post-treatment biopsies are available, they will be
      analyzed for suppression of elements in the mTOR pathway as well as for any effect on cell
      cycle progression, apoptosis or anti-angiogenic effects.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional
      courses beyond CR or PR.

      Patients are followed up for survival.
