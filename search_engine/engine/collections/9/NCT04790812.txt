    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial is designed to
      compare the postoperative pain reduction of a single agent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug (NSAID) and NSAID combination regimen administered preemptively. Subjects will be given
      a single oral dose of a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor (celecoxib 200mg), or
      celecoxib 200 mg in combination with acetaminophen (APAP 1000 mg) 30 to 60 minutes prior to
      the procedure. Oral surgery involving at least one impacted mandibular third molar will be
      performed using a combination of intravenous sedation and local anesthesia following UTHealth
      School of Dentistry (UTSD) surgical protocol. All subjects will be released with identical
      postoperative instructions and prescriptions for pain management. Nonopioid pain management
      will be prescribed as follows: 600mg ibuprofen with 500 mg APAP every 6 hours for the first 3
      days, then as needed for pain. Subjects will be asked to document medication consumption,
      postoperative pain and complications for the following 3 days using a Qualtrics survey. An
      oral and maxillofacial surgery resident or faculty on call can offer emergency intervention
      with prescription of an opioid analgesic.
