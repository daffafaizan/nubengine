      integration of HeartLogic for managing patients with heart failure. There are no endpoints.

      Phase II of the MANAGE-HF trial will assess the clinical effectiveness of remote monitoring
      of heart failure patients with implanted CRT-D or ICD cardiac devices that contain the
      diagnostic feature HeartLogic. This feature uses S1 and S3 heart sounds, night time heart
      rate, thoracic impedance, and respiration to alert clinicians when a patient's heart failure
      is worsening. The MANAGE-HF study will compare remote monitoring using HeartLogic alerts to
      drive heart failure care against patients with remote monitoring but without HeartLogic
      alerts.
