      appropriate regimen for pupillary dilation up until now. Therefore, the authors were
      interested to find out the most appropriate regimen for complete ocular examination, based on
      the finding that a pupil diameter of 6 mm or greater is adequate for indirect ophthalmoscopy.
      The authors hypothesize that a single dose of 1% tropicamide and 10% phenylephrine is
      adequate to complete the job and are conducting this prospective randomized clinical
      controlled trial to prove the hypothesis.
