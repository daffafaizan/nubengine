      study wound that may impact upon infection rates following debridement with the WoundWand
      Debridement Device or Standard of Care (SoC) surgical (sharp) debridement. Additionally, the
      clinical investigation will evaluate reduction in wound size post-debridement and gather
      Health Economic data relating to wound bed debridement with the WoundWand Debridement Device
      or SoC.
