    
      The study is composed of two stages: Part 1 Accelerated Titration Phase and Part 2 Dose
      Escalation Phase with initial fixed priming dose.

      The starting dose for part 1 is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 2 dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg QW and 1
      mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 28 days.

      Part 2 will have 4 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW、10mg/kg QW、20mg/kg QW and 30mg/kg QW). Conventional
      3+3 Dose Escalation will be adopted. DLT observation period is 28 days.
