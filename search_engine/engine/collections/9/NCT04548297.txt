      and healthy individuals of similar age and sex to patients will be included in the study. The
      sensation of foot sole, joint position sensation, attention, fatigue, body awareness, and
      physical activity level will be evaluated.

      The investigators will use t-tests to compare for quantitative variables and chi-square for
      the categorical variables between groups. In addition, the investigators will examine the
      correlations between the sensation of the foot sole, joint position sensation, attention,
      fatigue, body awareness, and physical activity level using Pearson bivariate correlations.
