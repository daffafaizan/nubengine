      through phosphodiesterase inhibition (i.e., a potent bronchodilating action, which is often
      used for the treatment of bronchial asthma) or via adenosine receptor blockade .It is
      generally considered that the majority of actions ascribed to therapeutic doses of xanthines
      (caffeine and theophylline) are due to their action as adenosine receptor antagonists.

      To the best of the investigator's knowledge this hypothesis was not reported in patients
      scheduled for major pelvi-abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia , and aminophylline
      was not given as premedication to test this hypothesis as it was previously administrated
      after the end of surgery ,also it was recommended by previous clinical studies to evaluate
      the effective dose of aminophylline that affect the extubation and recovery time.
