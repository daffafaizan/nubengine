      biologically-based implants derived from acellular human dermis, porcine small intestinal
      submucosa, and porcine dermis have been reported in a variety of complex abdominal wall
      repair procedures. A variety of surgical techniques and implant placement methods have been
      described, with no one standard technique achieving precedence. Biologic implant
      reinforcement of a myofascial closure by means of component separation, or at a minimum,
      where three-layer fascial approximation is not possible, sublay placement (i.e., closure of
      the posterior rectus sheath under the implant) are described strategies. These techniques
      allow placement of the implant against an intact fascial layer and may improve implant
      incorporation into host tissue. However, the current literature shows few, if any,
      prospective, randomized, head-to-head comparisons of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM)
      allograft and porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) xenograft when used as a reinforcing
      material in the repair of large abdominal hernias by a component separation technique.

      The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) has manufactured and processed Flex HD
      Acellular Hydrated Dermis. This acellular dermis is derived from human skin. In complicated
      ventral hernia repairs, this type of graft tissue is necessary. Flex HD has been shown to
      reduce operative time, lower operative costs and provides minimal elasticity.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine and compare the outcomes associated with
      the use of Flex HD®, a human acellular dermal matrix (HADM), and Strattice™, a porcine
      acellular dermal matrix, (PADM) when used as a reinforcing material in the repair of large
      complicated abdominal wall hernias.
