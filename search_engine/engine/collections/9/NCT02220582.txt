      longevity and health care costs, in Canada and globally. Cardiovascular risk factors account
      for up to half of the attributable risk for dementia, mediated in large part by difficult to
      detect microvascular disease of the brain. In this study the investigators will try to
      understand the role of the societal structure, nutrition, access to health services, and
      other socio-environmental and contextual factors on cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical
      disease and clinical cardiovascular events at the individual and population levels. We will
      try to identify markers for early subclinical dysfunction in the brain, vessels, heart and
      abdomen using magnetic resonance imaging and investigate the associations with contextual and
      individual determinants of these markers, as well as to assess the predictive value of novel
      markers of subclinical dysfunction on the development of clinical cardiovascular events.
