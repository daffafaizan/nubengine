      forms of lipodystrophy. However, it is still under investigation for patients with partial
      forms of the disease based on FDA decision on February 24, 2014. The study investigators have
      been carrying out a protocol in patients with partial lipodystrophy, specifically familial
      partial lipodystrophy. There have been a number of patients who have been treated under this
      protocol who are not covered by the currently approved label, but who have experienced
      significant clinical benefit.

      This study allowed continued treatment of patients with partial forms of lipodystrophy who
      volunteered and completed treatment under the investigators' completed protocol (MB002-014)
      and who derived significant clinical benefit as judged by an amelioration of their hemoglobin
      A1c, triglyceride levels, and/or reduction in their baseline diabetes or lipid therapies that
      affect quality of life.

      In this long-term study, there were three individuals whose data were excluded from final
      data analyses as explained in the results, however all participants were included in the
      presentation of baseline data as well as tabulated safety data.
