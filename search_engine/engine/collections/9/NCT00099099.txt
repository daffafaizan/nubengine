      University are enrolling overweight men and women aged 20-42 in a 1-year study to develop an
      effective calorie restricted regimen that minimizes hunger and prevents weight regain. The
      study also examines the effects of weight loss on body composition, metabolism and aging. Two
      different diets containing usual foods and a healthy balance of nutrients will be tested at 2
      levels of caloric restriction, 10% and 30% (in other words, 90% or 70% of what one would
      normally eat). Weight loss is expected for most volunteers participating in this study, but
      cannot be guaranteed.
