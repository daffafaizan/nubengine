      common complication in these patients after surgery and is associated with worse outcomes,
      including prolonged hospital stay, poor functional recovery, decreased cognitive function,
      increased health care costs, and elevated mortality rate. Previous studies showed that, for
      elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit after non-cardiac surgery, low-dose
      dexmedetomidine infusion improved subjective sleep quality and reduced delirium early after
      surgery; it also increased survival up to 2 years and improved life quality in 3-year
      survivors. The investigators hypothesize that dexmedetomidine supplemented intravenous
      analgesia (in the form of patient-controlled analgesia) can also reduce delirium and improve
      long-term outcomes in elderly patients after orthopedic surgery.
