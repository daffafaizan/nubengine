      In the 50-70s, LSD was also used to study psychotic-like states in normals ("model
      psychosis") and in "psycholytic psychotherapy". Potential research and therapeutic uses of
      LSD are now re-recognized and may include its use in brain research, treatment of cluster
      headache, and aid in psychotherapy and in terminally ill patients. A better and contemporary
      understanding of the pharmacology of LSD is important in the light of its widespread
      recreational, and potential scientific and therapeutic uses. The study has no primary
      therapeutic intentions but aims for a solid account of the clinical pharmacological
      characteristics of the drug. To characterize the acute physiological, psychological,
      endocrine, and pharmacological response to the administration of a single dose of LSD in
      healthy subjects the investigators use a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
      cross-over design with two experimental sessions. Subjects will participate in a placebo and
      a LSD session. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout
      the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics and endocrine
      measurements.Additionally long-term psychological changes associated with the LSD experience
      are assessed.
