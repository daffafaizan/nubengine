    
      The LUCY Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      post-market registry to evaluate the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Platform when used in the
      endovascular treatment of female patients.

      The primary endpoint is the Major Adverse Event (MAE) rate within 30 days of the initial
      procedure. MAEs will be adjudicated and reported based upon an independent Clinical Events
      Committee (CEC).

      Secondary endpoints of the study will be achieved by demonstrating the benefits in female
      patients (Treatment Group) are comparable to male patients (Control Group) despite the fact
      that historically fewer female patients have been eligible for EVAR, and they have
      experienced a higher rate of access-related complications and higher mortality rates.
      Secondary endpoints will be evaluated through 1 year (365 Â± 60 days) post-procedure.

      A maximum of 45 sites across the United States are expected to enroll 225 subjects (75
      females in the Treatment Group and 150 males in the Control Group).
