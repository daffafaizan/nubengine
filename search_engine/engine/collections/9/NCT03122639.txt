      endothelial dysfunction in OSA by restoring complement inhibition. The preliminary data
      indicate that the expression of CD59 on the EC surface is preserved in OSA patients who are
      receiving statins and that statins prevent CD59 internalization and MAC deposition in IH
      leading to reduced inflammation. The study proposes to determine whether statins restore
      endothelial protection against complement activity in OSA patients using double-blind
      placebo-controlled parallel group randomized study design. The hypothesis: The proportion of
      CD59 on the EC surface is increased while MAC deposition is decreased after 4 weeks of
      atorvastatin 10 mg daily compared with placebo in OSA patients who adhere with CPAP or do not
      adhere with CPAP.

      The proposed studies may advance our understanding of vascular dysfunction in OSA and provide
      the basis for large, long-term clinical trials of novel therapeutic strategies, such as
      addition of statins to the standard CPAP therapy, for preventing and/or reversing vascular
      risk in OSA.
