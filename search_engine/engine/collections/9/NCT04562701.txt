    
      seventy-three patients diagnosed as mechanical low back pain. Firstly, gluteus maximus (GM)
      strength was measured isometrically as a force (kg) and then converted to torque (Nm). GM
      strength was normalized for body weight and height using the following formula: % (body
      weight × h) = torque (N × m) ×100 / body weight (N) × h (m), then assessment of hamstring
      length flexibility using the active knee extension method.

      Data was collected and the correlation was determined.
