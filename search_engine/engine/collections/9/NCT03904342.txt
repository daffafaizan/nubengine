      advanced (Stage 3 or 4) cancer who screen positive for moderate depression and are receiving
      care at the Solomont Center for Hematology and Medical Oncology at Boston Medical Center
      (BMC) with the following specific aims:

        1. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide, design a
           pilot implementation strategy for introducing the Sophie CBT system and iHope system
           into the clinical context of care (Months 1-4)

        2. Conduct a pre-implementation pilot study with randomization of 20 cancer patients who
           screen positive for depression and/or anxiety into two arms with Sophie CBT or iHope
           telemedicine (10 participants each) to: a) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
           appropriateness of implementing the Sophie CBT and iHope interventions in an ambulatory
           cancer treatment center and b) evaluate the potential impact of the Sophie CBT and iHope
           interventions on measures of depression, anxiety, coping, and quality of life for cancer
           patients with comorbid depression (Months 5-10)
