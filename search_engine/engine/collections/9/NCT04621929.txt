      inter-connected diseases, particularly uric acid nephrolithiasis (UAN) with or without
      components of calcium oxalate (CO). Obese or overweight diabetics have a six-fold increased
      risk to develop UAN/COUAN due to the inability to properly add buffer (ammonium) to urine. Of
      the FDA approved drugs in the weight loss market, the combination medication phentermine/
      topiramate is the most effective and has a unique side effect of alkalinizing the urine
      (making it less acidic). The hypothesize of this project is that treatment of obese, diabetic
      patients with phentermine/topiramate will reduce the incidence of UAN/COUAN by 1) direct
      urinary alkalinization and 2) weight loss. Weight loss will indirectly improve urinary
      buffering ability through improvement in insulin sensitivity and will decrease renal
      oxidative stress. The investigative team proposes an 18 month, feasibility pilot study,
      randomizing 30 obese and diabetic individuals with UAN/COUAN to either phentermine/topiramate
      (n=20) or a pragmatic control group (n=10) who would remain on standard medication regimen
      (citrate salts, allopurinol, diet, etc).
