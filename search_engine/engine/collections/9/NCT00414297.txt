      promising therapeutic alternative for at least 20% of all Patients with Coronary Artery
      Disease (CAD). Beside growth factors, physical exercise has been shown to improve coronary
      collateral function. Extracorporal Counterpulsation (ECP) mimics physical exercise in a
      standardized way. Before and after ECP treatment, a quantitative invasive assessment of
      absolute collateral flow (by calculating the CFI, i.e. Collateral Flow Index) and myocardial
      perfusion is performed (with calculation of the CPI, i.e. Collateral Perfusion Index and MPR,
      i.e. Myocardial Perfusion Reserve).

      The study setting is single-blinded, sham-controlled and proceptive .
