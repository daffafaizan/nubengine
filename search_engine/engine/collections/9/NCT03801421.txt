      retrospective cohort study from the investigator has demonstrated that continuous mass suture
      with PDS led to shorter incision closure time, early wound healing and comparable incisional
      complications versus interrupted thread suture. As such, the current RCT study will include
      100 subjects with major abdominal incision. They will be divided into two groups randomly:
      Mass suture gorup, mass continuous suture with PDS, Control group, interrupted suture with
      thread. The wound healing time, stitches removal time and incidence of incision complications
      will be compared between the two groups.
