    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized,
      multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) and prospective (study following participants forward in time) study of tramadol
      hydrochloride-paracetamol tablets. Participants will receive 1 to 2 tablets of tramadol
      hydrochloride-paracetamol orally once daily (each tablet containing tramadol 37.5 milligram
      [mg] and paracetamol 325mg). Participants may be given the additional dose according to the
      clinical requirement. The total treatment duration will be 6 hours. The total study duration
      will be 4 months. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by pain intensity and pain relief.
      Participants will evaluate the pain severity and pain relief at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours
      respectively after the first dose; and the drug efficacy and overall satisfaction level at
      the end of 6 hours after the first dose. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
