      there are no reasonable standard treatment options and for patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma with progressive disease.

      In this study, the participant's white blood cells (T-cells) will be collected and modified
      such that the T-cells are able to recognize specific molecules (called NKG2D-ligands), that
      are expressed on the surface of cancer cells in these diseases. This modification is a
      genetic change to the T-cells. The modified T cells, called CM-CS1 T-cells, are then given
      back to the participant by a single intravenous infusion. In this study, participants will
      not receive any chemotherapy prior to infusion of the CM-CS1 T-cells.

      The study will evaluate whether it is safe and feasible to administer CM-CS1 T-cells to
      participants with AML/MDS-RAEB and multiple myeloma. It will also evaluate whether the CM-CS1
      T-cells have a beneficial effect against the cancer cells. Another goal of the study is to
      learn more about the persistence and function of the CM-CS1 T-cells in the body.

      Participants will be followed very closely during the first month after infusion. They are
      required to remain within 50 miles of Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) for 10 days
      after the infusion and will be followed three times per week for the first 21 days and at day
      28. Subsequently, participants will be followed monthly until 6 months after infusion, every
      3 months until 15 months after infusion and at 24 months after infusion. Because this study
      involves gene transfer, participants will be followed yearly for up to 15 years.
