      demonstrates deficiencies in communication in the PICU which could impact decision making.
      This study team has developed a navigator-based intervention call PICU Supports. PICU
      Supports aims to provide the following types of support to parents of patients in the PICU:
      emotional; communication (between healthcare team members and parents/families as well as
      among healthcare team members ); decision making; transitions out of the PICU (i.e. discharge
      transitions to a non-PICU hospital bed, a long term care facility, or home); and information.
      Support is accomplished by navigator engagement with parents and healthcare team members and
      the guided use of navigator supported ancillary tools provided to parents and healthcare team
      members as needed. During the patient's PICU stay, the navigator activities and use of
      ancillary tools is directed by the family's needs. Thus PICU Supports uses a predefined
      framework of activities and tools to provide individualized support directed by the needs of
      the parent and the patient situation. This research will test PICU Supports in the clinical
      setting. This will be accomplished by conducting a pilot study of PICU Supports at Ann &
      Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Lurie Children's Hospital), followed by a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention, PICU Supports, to a control,
      parental receipt of an educational brochure. The RCT will be conducted at Lurie Children's
      Hospital and at University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital (Comer Children's
      Hospital).
