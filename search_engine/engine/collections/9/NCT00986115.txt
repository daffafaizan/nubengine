      epilepsy patients. Patients will be assessed for neurocognitive outcomes, seizure frequency
      and side effects. After a two-month prospective baseline during which seizure frequency and
      neurocognitive parameters are documented, patients will be randomized to either memantine or
      placebo and evaluated after twelve months on study drug. The treatment period will consist of
      a one month dose escalation phase, followed by an eleven month maintenance phase. The dose
      escalation is 5 mg in PM for days 1-7, 5 mg twice daily for days 8-14, 5 mg in AM and 10 mg
      in PM for days 15-21 and 10 mg twice daily from day 22 and continue. The neuropsychological
      battery performed during baseline will be repeated at the end of the twelve month treatment
      period. No special procedures are required for this study, except the neuropsychological
      testing, which is not a routinely performed evaluation for adult epilepsy outpatients.
