    
      Shortening of pectoralis minor (PMi) muscle affects the scapular excursion that results in
      limited shoulder flexion range of motion (SFROM). The purpose is to evaluate the effect of
      Stretching of PM muscle along with the strengthening of lower trapezius (LTR) muscle to
      increase the length of PM muscle (PML) and limited SFROM in young adult females with rounded
      shoulder posture.

      Randomized sixty female subjects with rounded shoulder posture into two groups: Group A
      performed active Stretching of PMi along with the strengthening of LTR muscle(n=30); group B
      performed dynamic Stretching of PMi muscle only. Scores of outcome measures were recorded
      before and post interventions on day 0, day10th, and day21st, respectively.
