      I. Determine the objective overall response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory
      aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with BMS-247550 (ixabepilone).

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      duration of response, overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if the
      patient becomes a candidate for stem cell transplantation.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.
