      pharmaconutrition supplement (IntestaminÂ®) to an energy adjusted standard elementary diet and
      to investigate its affect on clinical efficacy and tolerability in critically ill patients
      with sepsis/SIRS.

      Methods: This was a prospective controlled randomized study in 58 critically ill patients.
      They received either Intestamin or a diluted Fresubin solution. After 10 or 14 days
      inflammatory parameters, catecholamine need, and maximal enteral delivery were determined.
