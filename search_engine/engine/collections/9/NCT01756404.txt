      double-blind (neither investigator nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned
      treatment), placebo-controlled (one of the study medications is inactive), ascending multiple
      dose study (increasing doses of study medication) to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus) in otherwise healthy obese volunteers. The study will consist of 3
      phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and an end of study (or follow-up)
      phase. Volunteers will be assigned to 5 cohorts (groups) made up of 16 otherwise healthy
      obese men and women. Within each group, 12 volunteers will be given canagliflozin once or
      twice daily and 4 volunteers will be given placebo (inactive medication) once or twice daily
      for 14 days. The dose of canagliflozin will be different for each of the 5 groups and the
      second group will not begin treatment until at least 21 days after the first group start
      treatment. This 21-day gap will be applied to all subsequent groups. Each volunteer will
      participate in the study for approximately 58 days.
