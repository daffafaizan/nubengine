      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (Arm B). The first 10 subjects randomized to Arm
      B (Y-90 TARE + bevacizumab + atezolizumab) will be assessed for safety after two cycles. If
      there are no Grade ≥ 3 unexpected toxicities; possibly, probably or definitely related to
      TARE in combination with bevacizumab and atezolizumab the combination will be deemed safe and
      accrual will continue.

      Subjects randomized to receive bevacizumab and atezolizumab (Arm B) will start the
      combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab 4 weeks (± 1 week) after TARE treatment. Full
      recovery from the procedure is required prior to systemic treatment:

        -  AST and ALT ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dL

        -  Manifestations of post-embolization syndrome (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting, and
           abdominal pain) have resolved to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
           for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 Grade 1

        -  No significant medical events (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, cardiac events,
           hepatorenal syndrome) during or after the TARE procedure.

      These subjects will continue the study drugs for a total of 24 months from the TARE
      treatment, until intolerable toxicity or disease progression occur.
