    
      Patients with gluten-sensitivity are rigourously checked for wheat allergy and celiac
      disease. Genotyping for DQ2/8, serological detection of celiac specific antibodies, and
      gastroduodenoscopy are performed. Furthermore, a skin prick test and detection of wheat
      specific IgE are done.

      After exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy patients are considered as patients with
      NCGS.

      Patients and healthy controls are asked to consume a low FODMAP diet for two weeks, followed
      by a 5 day washout and subsequent two week gluten-free diet.

      At the beginning and the end of each diet the participants fill in questionnaires concerning
      Nutrition (Freiburger Nutrition protocol), psychological well-being index (PGWB),
      gastrointestinal symptom Rating score (GSRS), and stool consistency (Bristol stool Chart).
      Furthermore, stool samples are selected at each time point to determine the microbial
      pattern.

      NCGS patients with ongoing complaints will have a second gastroduodenoscopy at the end of the
      study.
