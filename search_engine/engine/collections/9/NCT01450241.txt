      unresolved question regarding the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment for patients
      with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin. Current guidelines recommend at least seven days
      of antibiotic treatment. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of early antibiotic
      discontinuation in patients with febrile neutropenia. We plan an open label randomized
      controlled trial to compare early antibiotic discontinuation to the accepted prolonged
      antibiotic treatment protocol
