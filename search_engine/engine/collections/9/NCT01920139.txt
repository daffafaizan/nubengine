    
      Women with suspected or recently diagnosed breast cancer and ipsilateral abnormal appearing
      axillary lymph nodes underwent fine needle aspiration immediately followed by core biopsy of
      the same lymph node.Cytology results from the fine needle aspiration (FNA)and histology from
      the core biopsy were compared to surgical pathology from axillary node excision to determine
      if either method of percutaneous node sampling was more sensitive in detecting metastasis.
      Pain during each procedure was also compared.
