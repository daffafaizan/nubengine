    
      Approximately 600 million people worldwide are infected with the Human Papilloma Virus. In
      the majority of cases people can clear the virus on their own however in cases where the
      infection is not recognized or is left untreated, the result can be cervical cancer.

      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of Hsp-E7 and Poly-ICLC administered
      together as a vaccine for Cervical Intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). There will be 4 cohorts
      of subjects in the study each given a higher dose than the one prior providing that prior
      dose has been well tolerated and deemed to be safe.

      Subjects will be immunized every 28 days for a period of 8 weeks (3 administrations).

      Posttreatment evaluation will occur 4 weeks after the last of 3 injections. Subjects with CIN
      2 or 3 disease at the time of enrollment will be eligible to undergo clinically appropriate
      therapeutic treatment of the cervix at the twelfth of the study.
