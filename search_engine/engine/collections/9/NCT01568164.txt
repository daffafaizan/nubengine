      1997), yet there is no cure. The American Heart Association reports the nearly five million
      Americans are afflicted. Approximately 1.5 million admissions in the US are due to heart
      failure; it is the number one cost-item for Medicare, comprising 6% of its total
      expenditures.

      BioVentrix has developed the PliCath heart failure system, which is used to place permanent
      cardiac implants into the heart for the purpose of excluding scar, reconfiguring abnormal
      cardiac geometry that is causing dysfunction, by excluding an abnormal portion of the
      ventricular wall. Conceptually, the final configuration in SVR can be achieved by placing
      these implants.

      The procedure called PliCath Epicardial Catheter-based Ventricular Restoration System (ECVR)
      is designed for left ventricular volume reduction in patients with heart failure in a
      magnitude similar to that of the predicate surgical procedure, but much less invasively. The
      PliCath HF System utilizes anchors that are implanted into the scarred portion of the heart,
      which when deployed, exclude some of the scar similar to what is excluded by cinching the
      purse string suture with the patch, rendering the ventricle smaller, and is employed in a
      surgical setting, with and without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The PliCath HF System has anchors (implants) that are deployed using fluoroscopic imaging.
