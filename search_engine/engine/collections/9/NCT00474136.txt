    
      This study is an open-label, three-treatment, six sequence, three-period, single center
      crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous diclofenac sodium DIC075V
      (18.75 mg and 37.5 mg) versus oral diclofenac potassium (CataflamÂ® 50 mg) in healthy adult
      volunteers following single- and multiple-dose administration. Each treatment sequence
      received 1 dose every 6 hours (for a total of 4 doses per treatment sequence) with a 48-hour
      washout period between treatment sequences.
