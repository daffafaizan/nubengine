      medical history, and clinical and phenotypic data will be obtained. Participants who meet the
      eligibility requirements are willing to continue in the study, will return for a sampling
      visit during which â‰¤20ml CSF and approximately 50ml blood will be collected following an
      overnight fast: blood will be obtained via venipuncture and CSF will be obtained via lumbar
      puncture using local anaesthetic if required. Some participants may be invited to return for
      an Optional Repeat Sampling Visit approximately 4-8 weeks later.

      When participants have completed the Initial Sampling Visit, and Optional Repeat Sampling
      Visit, if relevant, their participation in HDClarity will be considered completed. However,
      participants may be invited to participate in the study multiple times, allowing at least 11
      months between Screening Visits.
