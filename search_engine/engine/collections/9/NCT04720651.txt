    
      Pes planus (Flat foot) deformity is a common chronic foot and ankle condition characterized
      by flattening of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), rearfoot valgus and abduction of the
      midfoot on the hind foot.

      A flexible pes planus is caused by tibialis posterior dysfunction, ligament loosening,
      Achilles tendon shortening, and weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles. These deformations
      cause plantar flexion and adduction of the talus bone and valgus of the calcaneus bone.

      Up to our knowledge:

        1. No previous studies investigated whether all flat foot is usually associated with
           gastrocnemius and soleus muscle tightness or it is a random association.

        2. And whether tightness of gastrocnemius and soleus is highly found in all cases of flat
           foot.

      Consequently this study is conducted.
