      device in improving daily asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with
      monolingual Spanish- speaking guardians who have LEP during a six-week intervention period
      when compared to baseline medication adherence rates in a preceding six-week run-in period.
      The secondary hypothesis is to determine whether the patient reminder system can improve
      asthma symptom control during the same six-week intervention period. The third hypothesis is
      to assess if there are specific, patient behavior characteristics which are associated with
      the success of a novel asthma medication reminder system.
