      toxicity and virological efficacy. EFV concentrations in dried blood spots and matched plasma
      and will be evaluated to determine the utility of dried blood spot measurements in measuring
      EFV plasma concentrations. Measurements dried blood spots could potentially be a cheap and
      easy alternative to measurements in plasma. Dried blood spots can be easily collected from
      venous blood or fingerprick, do not need plasma separation and potentially need less
      stringent storage conditions during shipment.
