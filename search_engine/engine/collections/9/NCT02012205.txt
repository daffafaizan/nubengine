      To evaluate the effectiveness of wet cupping in the treatment of NSLBP:

        1. Primary objective: To assess the effect of wet cupping on Pain (difference in the NRS
           from base to the end of two weeks) compared to the control group

        2. Secondary objectives :

      I-To compare Functioning (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) from the base to the end of the
      two weeks of wet cupping sessions& two weeks later in the two groups II-To compare NRS from
      base to two weeks after the end of cupping III-To compare Number of Acetaminophen tables
      taken at the end of two weeks. IV-To evaluate Safety of wet cupping

      SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis of this study is that the improvement of Numeric Rating
      Scale (NRS) for Pain at the end of the study will be greater in the Wet Cupping Treatment
      group than in the Control group

      Overall Design: a randomised, waiting-list controlled, open-label, parallel trial.

        -  Study Type: Interventional

        -  Condition: Persistent Non Specific Low Back Pain (PNSLBP)

      Case definition parameters:

        -  Low back pain: is defined as pain and discomfort, localized , below the costal margin
           and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain.,

        -  Persistent low back pain: is defined as low back pain persisting for at least 12 weeks.
           We do not deal specifically with repeated, short bouts of pain.

        -  Nonspecific low back pain: is defined as" low back pain that is not attributable to a
           recognizable, known specific pathology (e.g. infection, tumour, osteoporosis, fracture,
           structural deformity, inflammatory disorder (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis), radicular
           syndrome or caudal equine syndrome)."
