    
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial that
      will last up to 12 weeks.

      This placebo-controlled portion will be followed by a 6-week open label
      extension/stabilization phase. In order to be eligible for participation in the
      extension/stabilization phase, subjects must: 1) in the investigator's opinion have had no
      dose-limiting side effects likely to be attributable to aripiprazole (APZ); 2) participated
      in the blinded portion of the clinical trial for a minimum of 4 weeks.
