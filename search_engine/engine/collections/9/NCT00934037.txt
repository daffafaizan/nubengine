    
      The Combined Coronary angiography and myocardial perfusion imaging using 320 detectors
      computed tomography (CORE-320) was designed as a prospective, multi-center, international,
      blinded study designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multi-detector computed
      tomography using 320 detectors for identifying coronary artery luminal stenosis and
      corresponding myocardium perfusion defects in patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease. The primary analysis will be a comparison of the diagnostic capability of the
      combination of quantitative 320-MDCT angiography and quantitative perfusion imaging to the
      combination of conventional coronary angiography and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging at
      the patient level. A positive patient will be defined as having at least one vessel with a â‰¥
      50% diameter stenosis defined by quantitative coronary angiography and a corresponding
      positive SPECT territorial myocardial perfusion defect.
