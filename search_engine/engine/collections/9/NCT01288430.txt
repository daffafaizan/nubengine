      in each cohort will be given increasing doses of the study drug until a maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined as the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). The drug will be administered as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no
      interruption between cycles if no unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor
      progression are observed.

      After determining the RP2D, Part 2 of the study, which is a dose expansion study will begin
      in which subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who developed acquired resistance
      to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib,
      gefitinib, afatinib (and others) or whose tumors carry an ALK translocation and are resistant
      to ALK inhibitor therapy, will be treated with DS-2248 at RP2D. The drug will be administered
      as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no interruption between cycles if no
      unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor progression are observed.
