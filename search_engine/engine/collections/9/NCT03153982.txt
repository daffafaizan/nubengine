      up to 28 days for delays in planned surgery. Ruxolitinib will be dispensed in 5 mg tablets.
      Participants will either take three tablets (15 mg) in the morning and evening, or four
      tablets in the morning and evening (20 mg). Participants will be asked to fill out a drug
      diary indicating when doses of study drug are taken and any side effects they experience.

      Dose will be assigned based on participant platelet count at baseline:

        1. Patients with a platelet count of 200,000 or greater will take 20 mg twice daily (four
           5mg tablets in the morning and four 5mg tablets in the evening);

        2. Patients with a platelet count between150,000 and 200,000 will take 15 mg twice daily
           (three 5 mg tablets in the morning and three 5 mg tablets in the evening).
