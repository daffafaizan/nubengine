      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, Phase II, single-site, 8-week clinical
      trial of aprepitant 125 mg/d or placebo. Participants were 20 outpatients seeking treatment
      for concurrent alcohol and cannabis dependence. All participants received weekly
      protocol-specific counseling. Research assessments occurred weekly through the treatment
      phase of the 8-week study. Post treatment follow-up assessments occurred at Weeks 9 and 12.
