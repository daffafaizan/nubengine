      psychological and general health consequences for the caregiver. These consequences including
      risk for depression, cardiovascular disease, and earlier mortality. Because preliminary work
      has demonstrated that an educational programs for caregivers reduce the negative affect
      associated with caregiving, the investigators wish to determine whether improving mood can
      also modify pathophysiological changes that have been linked to risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease.

      The investigators aims are to determine whether a 6-week Behavioral Activation (BA)
      intervention, followed by 3 booster sessions over a period of 6 months, compared to an
      Information-Support (IS) intervention will be associated with significant improvement in
      indicators of vascular pathology, modification of psychobiological markers that have been
      associated with cardiovascular parameters, and to determine whether improvements in
      indicators of vascular parameters will be mediated by treatment related change in measures of
      distress and markers of cardiovascular disease risk.
