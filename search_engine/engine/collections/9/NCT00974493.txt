      treatment for many serious bacterial infections. It is costly and inconvenient for the
      patient to remain hospitalised for therapy, so outpatient antibiotic therapy (OPAT)
      programmes have been established in many countries to deliver intravenous antibiotics safely
      and conveniently. The majority of patients referred to OPAT programmes have bone and joint
      infections. However, there is no clear evidence that bone and joint infection really require
      long courses of intravenous antibiotics rather than oral antibiotics.

      We will compare the outcome of treatment with intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy for
      patients with bone and joint infection. The choice of antibiotic is complex, and antibiotics
      that are suitable oral choices are often not suitable intravenous choices and vice versa.
      Subjects will therefore be randomized to an oral or intravenous "strategy," rather than to
      individual antibiotics. Outcomes will be determined by pre-established objective criteria for
      treatment failure.

      We have conducted a pilot study in one centre (Oxford), recruiting approximately 200
      patients, and are now expanding to include multi-centre recruitment in the UK, aiming to
      recruit 1050 patients.
