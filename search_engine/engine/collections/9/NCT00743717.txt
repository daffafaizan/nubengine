      success in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Use of a ceramic-polyethylene wear couple in total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) has shown promising laboratory and early clinical results. The use of
      ceramics in this study is intended to address long-term failure of TKA due to osteolysis
      associated with polyethylene wear debris.
