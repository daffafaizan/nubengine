    
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of thoracic epidural analgesia and rectus
      sheath blockade on postoperative pulmonary functions, pain scores, duration of analgesia,
      sedation scores, patients' satisfaction and adverse effects.

      FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio will be measured by a bed side spirometer.

        -  Induction of anesthesia: propofol 1.5-2.5 mg kg-1.

        -  Muscle Relaxants: rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 for induction.

        -  Maintenance: Sevoflurane 0.7-1.5 MAC vaporized in air-oxygen (40% inspired fraction).

      Radial artery catheterization: under complete aseptic conditions 20G cannula will be inserted
      into the radial artery of non-dominant hand after performing modified Allen's test and local
      infiltration of 0.5ml xylocaine 2% .

      Thoracic epidural catheter will be inserted before induction of general anaesthesia under
      aseptic insertion conditions and using loss of resistance to air technique with the patient
      in the sitting position at T9- T11 interspaces.

      The Rectus sheath catheters will be inserted bilaterally using ultrasound (SonoSite M-TurboÂ®,
      Sonosite , USA) guidance as described by Webster after induction of general anaesthesia.
