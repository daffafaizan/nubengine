      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
      intraperitoneal (IP) bortezomib (BTZ) when administered with intraperitoneal carboplatin in
      women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is
      persistent or recurrent and who have failed primary therapy and at least one second-line
      therapy.

      II. To examine the safety of administering BTZ in combination with carboplatin by the IP
      route.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective tumor response rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BTZ and carboplatin when administered
      intraperitoneally once every 21 days.

      III. To characterize the frequency of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) when
      administered as an intraperitoneal infusion in the context of recurrent ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally (IP) and carboplatin IP on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
