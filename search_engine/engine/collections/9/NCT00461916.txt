      in controlled ovarian stimulation [COS] cycles. The use of a single-dose depot long-acting
      GnRHa instead of a daily low dose preparation would be more comfortable for patients,
      however, inducing a profound pituitary desensitization, it increases the number of
      gonadotropin ampoules and the duration of the COS cycle without improving pregnancy rates or
      other clinical outcomes. Thus, some authors recommend a reduction of both dose and/or
      duration of GnRHa administration. Halving the dose of depot triptorelin, for instance, has
      been studied against its full dose administration since 1992 with rather similar clinical
      outcomes. Half-dose depot leuprolide acetate has also resulted in comparable clinical
      outcomes with standard daily injections in long GnRHa protocol. Reducing the daily doses of
      short acting GnRHa has been advocated to demonstrate equivalent results to standard doses. To
      our knowledge, however, the reduced daily doses have not been evaluated against half dose
      depot forms in long GnRHa protocols.

      Thus, we originally compared a half-dose depot triptorelin with reduced daily doses of
      short-acting buserelin in a long protocol for intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo
      transfer [ICSI/ET] cycles.
