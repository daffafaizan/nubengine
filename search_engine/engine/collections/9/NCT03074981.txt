           determine the existing pathogens and direct the antibiotic treatment.

        2. Wound measurements will be taken (Width, length and depth).

        3. Afterwards the wound will be closed with the TopClosure device and the patient will be
           connected to a Negative Wound pressure device Vcare Alpha.

        4. the investigators will change dressings according to schedule. If the wound is clean the
           investigators will change dressings every 3-5 days. If the wound is infected the
           investigators will change dressings every 2-4 days. If the investigators encounter a
           severe infected wound with a lot of pus the investigators will change dressings every
           1-3 days.

        5. the investigators will determine the time to heal when the wound is clean and there is
           no further need for Negative Pressure Wound Treatment (ROI-NPR) up to 10 weeks.
