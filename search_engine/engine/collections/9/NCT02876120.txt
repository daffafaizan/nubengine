      osteoarthritis in Norway has a potential for improvement as the provided care may not
      necessarily reflect evidence-based guideline recommendations. The purpose of the STavanger
      osteoARThritis (START) study is to improve the quality of OA care and increase the
      collaboration between health care professionals in primary health care and across health care
      levels.

      Based on international treatment recommendations for OA care and previous research, a
      tailored implementation strategy targeting high quality, integrated care for people with OA
      in Stavanger Municipality will be developed, implemented and evaluated. The care will mainly
      be provided in the Stavanger primary health care services by physiotherapists (PT) (in
      private practice) and general practitioners (GP), but will also include collaboration with
      orthopaedic surgeons in specialist health care at Stavanger University Hospital.

      The main aim of the present study is to develop, implement and evaluate effects of a tailored
      implementation strategy for the START study in Stavanger Municipality.

      To evaluate the effects of the START implementation strategy, an interrupted time series
      design method will be applied. The study period will be divided into three phases:
      pre-implementation, implementation/transition and post-implementation. Data will be collected
      at 16 time points; 8 before and 8 after the implementation/ transition phase.
