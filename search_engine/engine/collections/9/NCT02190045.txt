      injuries and injury-related deaths in those aged over 65 years. Balance and gait
      abnormalities are major reasons for falls in elderly. Exercise interventions improve gait and
      balance in the elderly. Despite the many proven benefits of exercise, many older adults in
      the US remain sedentary. This study targets at improving balance and gait with use of Wii-Fit
      as an exercise program.

      Specific aims

        1. To establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of an 8-week Wii-Fit program to
           improve measures of balance, and gait in older adults, compared to a cognitive
           remediation program, Brain fitness.

        2. To compare the effect of an 8-week Wii-Fit program to Brain fitness program, on measures
           of biomechanical assessment, adherence, safety, physical activity, fear of fall,
           enjoyment, functional status, cognition and quality of life.

      Design 8-week, randomized, parallel group, active intervention study Methods Patients will be
      recruited via IRB approved flyers posted in various locations of the Little Rock and North
      Little Rock CAVHS campuses and via referrals from the CAVHS providers. Thirty elderly
      Veterans will be randomly assigned to Wii-Fit arm or Brain fitness arm. Both groups will
      participate in the intervention for approximately 45 minutes 3 days a week for 8 weeks.
      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, and approximately week 4 and after completion
      of week 8. Balance and gait will be assessed by Berg Balance Scale. Secondary outcome
      measures include biomechanical testing for gait and balance, Safety, Adherence, measures of
      functional status, cognition, quality of life, fear of falling, physical activity and
      physical activity enjoyment.
