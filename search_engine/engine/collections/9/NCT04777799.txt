      activity is training to strengthen sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). This training could make it
      possible to reduce cortical hyperstimulation associated with certain sleep disorders. Our
      hypothesis is that the application of such a neurofeedback technique in an ecological
      situation at home will improve the subjective quality of their sleep.

      The subject must perform, at home, at least 3 sessions per week with the URGOnight solution
      for about 4 months. Since regularity is important in order to observe effects, subjects are
      followed up by smartphone application at least 3 times over the training period.
