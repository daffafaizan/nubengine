      after the procedure of TAVI, rates of stroke remains high, between 4 and 10% regarding the
      studies and registries. None of the therapeutics have regulatory authorisation for this
      indication. On the other hand, the rates of bleeding events are also high in this old and
      frail population. That is why, considering its pharmacological specificity, investigators
      hypothesize that ticagrelor, used alone, could be non-inferior on safety criteria than the
      combination of lysine acetylsalicylate and clopidogrel. Our study want to evaluate the safety
      profile of Ticagrelor alone (180 mg loading dose before intervention and 90 mg twice daily
      during 30 days after the procedure) compared to the standardized treatment combining lysine
      acetylsalicylate (75 mg before and 75 mg daily after the procedure) and clopidogrel (300mg
      loading dose before and 75 mg daily after the procedure). Patients will be followed during
      one month. Then they will be all placed under the usual antiplatelet treatment (clopidogrel
      and lysine acetylsalicylate for two additional months and then lysine acetylsalicylate alone
      lifelong).
