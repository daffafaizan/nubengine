      systemic sclerosis. These alterations may result in progressive reduction of vessel lumen,
      decreased blood flow, and a state of chronic hypoxia resulting in digital ulcers, digital
      pitting, and, in more severe cases, gangrene and amputation of the extremities. Few studies
      aimed to evaluate the effects of Sildenafil on the microcirculatory blood flow in patients
      with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis (SS). Moreover, no study has
      evaluated the effect of this drug on the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells
      in SS patients. The relatively new technique of laser Doppler imaging (LDI) allows an
      objective measurement of superficial cutaneous microvascular blood flow and constitutes a
      promising approach in the assessment of the digital microvascular vasoreactivity in response
      to cold stimulus or in response to treatment in SSc patients.
