        -  Determine the ability of in vivo purging with alemtuzumab (monoclonal antibody CD52;
           Campath-1H) to produce a stem cell graft without detectable leukemia cells in patients
           with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the ability to successfully mobilize stem cells after in vivo purging with
           monoclonal antibody CD52 in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response to this treatment regimen in these patients at 6 months after
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising alemtuzumab (monoclonal antibody CD52;
      Campath-1H) IV over 2 hours three times a week for 4 weeks.

      Beginning no more than 2 weeks after induction therapy, patients receive mobilization
      chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously (SC) starting on day 2 and continuing until the last day of apheresis.
      Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell apheresis on days 10-14.

      Beginning 2-4 weeks after apheresis, patients receive a preparative regimen comprising
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 and -4 and fractionated total body irradiation
      twice a day over 6-10 hours on days -3 to -1. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until
      blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed at 60 days, 1 year, and then annually thereafter until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
