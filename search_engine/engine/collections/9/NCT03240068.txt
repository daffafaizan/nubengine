      intravenous Ang-(1-7) infusion can reduce systemic inflammation and improve measures of leg
      blood flow in subjects with PAD. The investigators will also measure for changes in blood
      pressure and circulating hormones in response to angiotensin-(1-7) infusion. This is an
      outpatient study that will be conducted in the Clinical Research Center at the Penn State
      Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.

      Subjects with PAD will participate in a screening visit, and if eligible, in two separate
      study visits in which they will receive intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) or saline infusion.
      Each study visit will last approximately 4 hours, with at least one week of washout between
      study visits. During study visits, subjects will be instrumented with two intravenous
      catheters (one for drug infusion and one for blood sampling), arm and finger blood pressure
      cuffs, sticky patches to measure heart rate, a belt around the stomach to measure breathing,
      an ultrasound probe on each leg to measure blood flow, a probe on the ear to measure blood
      oxygen saturation, a probe on each calf muscle to measure oxygen levels, and probes on the
      skin to measure temperature and blood flow. The investigators will obtain baseline measures
      of blood pressure and heart rate and collect blood samples to measure hormones in the blood.
      After baseline measurements, the investigators will infuse angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for 50
      minutes. Finger cuff blood pressure, leg blood flow, and calf muscle oxygen levels will be
      measured continuously during infusions. The investigators will measure blood pressure and
      heart rate and collect blood samples at the end of the infusion period.
