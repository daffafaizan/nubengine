    
      This phase II clinical trial is planned as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3
      year intervention Trial in 70 patients with Classical Wolfram Syndrome aged 5 years and over.
      The primary outcomes of the Trial are considered to be clinically relevant and of sufficient
      magnitude to be beneficial, as a successful Trial outcome will mean that patients will retain
      a clinically useful degree of visual acuity and it will decline at a slower rate than in the
      untreated patients. The MRI Ventral Pons Volume (VPV) change has been shown to correlate with
      changes in the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale.

      Patients will be randomised to balance the individual differences across the treatment and
      placebo groups, therefore reducing the potential for extraneous bias. This will ensure that
      the treatment effect can be established without the need to account for confounding factors.
      The value of a placebo arm adds robustness to the Trial by removing the potential for bias
      from both the investigator and patient perspectives.

      Investigators will be blinded to the results of the assessments. Certain assessments will be
      performed by subspecialists (such as ophthalmologists and neurologists), with the Principal
      Investigator prevented from having access to the results. This subspecialist-led treatment is
      in line with the current multi-disciplinary management of these patients and will not result
      in patients being denied access to effective treatment.

      Patients and investigators will be blinded to treatment. The Trial treatment will be a tablet
      formulation.

      This Trial involves 11 clinic visits and 7 follow up telephone calls to reduce the burden of
      additional travel to the patients.
