      Intramuscular (IM) administration of CYT107 at 3 μg/kg followed, after 48hrs of observation,
      by 10 μg/kg twice a week for 2 weeks or (b) Intramuscular (IM) placebo (normal saline) at the
      same frequency. An interim safety review took place after the first 12 patients. Since the
      CYT107 was well tolerated, the test dose (3 μg/kg) ceased and the initial dose became the
      same as the rest of the doses (10 μg/kg). So, the remaining patients will be randomized to
      receive 5 administrations of (a) CYT107 at 10 μg/kg every 3 to 4 days for 2 weeks or (b)
      Intramuscular (IM) placebo (normal saline) at the same frequency. The aim of the study is to
      test the ability of CYT107 to produce an immune reconstitution of these patients and observe
      possible association with a clinical improvement
