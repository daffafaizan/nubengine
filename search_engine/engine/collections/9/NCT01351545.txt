    
      Principal Investigators:

      The principal investigators (PIs) will be transplant physicians at all participating U.S.
      transplant centers.

      Study Design:

      This study is an access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood
      units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult patients with hematologic malignancies and other
      indications.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of
      â‰¥500/mm3 after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution setting using CBUs that are
      not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed.

      Secondary Objectives:

      In patients receiving a non-licensed CBU:

        -  Assess incidence of transmission of infection

        -  Assess incidence of serious infusion reaction

        -  Determine 1 year overall survival after cord blood transplantation

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and
           grades III to IV

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD

        -  Determine platelet engraftment of >20,000 mcL and >50,000 mcL
