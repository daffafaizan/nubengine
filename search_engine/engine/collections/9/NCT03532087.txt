      HER2-negative breast cancer, which are planned to undergo surgery followed by adjuvant AC-T
      chemotherapy, are randomized between no denosumab, denosumab low dosing and denosumab high
      dosing. Denosumab administration will start one week before surgery and continue until the
      last chemotherapy cycle.
