extrarenal fibromuscular hyperplasia.clinical, radiologic, and pathologic studies on19 patients with lesions in the extrarenal arteries thatresembled fibromuscular hyperplasia are described.in 11 patients fibromuscular hyperplasia was presentin the renal arteries.  patients with involvement of theceliac artery were the only ones who had symptoms ofvisceral ischemia.  fibromuscular hyperplasia of theinternal carotid arteries was observed in 6 patients, 2of whom had symptoms of cerebral ischemia.  nine patientswith fibromuscular hyperplasia of the carotid orrenal arteries had intracranial aneurysms, and in 2others intracranial hemorrhage developed in the absenceof demonstrable aneurysms.  the histologic similaritiesbetween intracranial aneurysms and othertypes of aneurysms that appear in patients with fibromuscularhyperplasia, the frequency of intracranialaneurysms in patients with extracranial fibromuscularhyperplasia, and the similar sex and age incidence suggesta common etiologic origin.
