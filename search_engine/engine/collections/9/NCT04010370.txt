    
      Analytical cross-sectional study with 25 healthy patients of both genders (male and female)
      from 30 to 60 years old, residents of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.

      They will be operated on for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The insulin sensitivity
      will be calculated with the PREDIM, Matsuda, McAuley, Belfiore, Cederholm, Avignon, Gutt,
      Stumvoll, HOMA-IR, ISI, Raynaud, QUICKI, FIRI, Bennett and TyG indexes.

      This protocol is already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent
      it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      The statistical analysis will be presented with measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      mean and standard deviation. The nominal variables in numbers and percentages. The
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed to determine if the variables follow a normal
      distribution. To correlate the formulas used to evaluate the insulin sensitivity with the
      PREDIcted M (PREDIM) technique, the Pearson or Spearman correlation will be used according to
      the distribution.
