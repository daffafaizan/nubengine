      In order to do this, DNA will be extracted from either frozen or paraffin embedded colon
      cancer tissues to sequence PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF. Clinical outcome data will be gathered to
      include metastases and survival to correlate with PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF mutational status.
      Patients with stage II and stage Ill colon cancers will be identified in the University of
      New Mexico Human Tissue Repository and the NIH PLCO prevention trial biorepository.

      Existing banked tissues of stage II and Ill colon cancers will be collected. There will be no
      direct contact with living individuals. Epidemiological factors such as age, race, gender and
      outcome data of metastases and survival will be collected.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To develop and standardize methods for high throughput DNA extraction and analysis from
           colon tumors of patients with stage II and stage III disease harboring PIK3CA exon 9 and
           exon 20 mutations.

        2. To determine the correlation between wild type and PIK3CA, PIK3CA exon 9 and PIK3CA exon
           20 mutations and development of metastatic disease and overall survival in stage II and
           stage III patients with colorectal cancer.
