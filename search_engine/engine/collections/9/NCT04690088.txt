      physicians face them in their daily practice (1-2). There are many guidelines showing the
      dose counting methods of intravenous anesthetics, but none of them are perfectly good for
      morbidity obese patients (3). Early recovery characteristics are important for patients'
      safety and operating room turnover (4).

      Aim: Our aim was to compare fundamental methods for dosing remifentanil during morbid obesity
      surgeries: a manual infusion and a target-controlled infusion (TCI). Throughout study,
      patient's recovery time was tracked and compared between the groups.

      Methods: 31 patients were evaluated who underwent bariatric surgery in Hospital of Lithuanian
      University of Health Sciences. All of them had received sevoflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia.
      Remifentanil infusion was randomly assigned to a manual (control group) or to a TCI (case
      group) method. We had evaluated patients' hemodynamics (arterial blood pressure, heart rate,
      saturation), spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes recovery time, time of extubation, eye
      opening, recovery of orientation and start of the following oral command. Also we had
      registered concentrations of remifentanil in the blood (according to automatic infusion pump)
      while using TCI method.
