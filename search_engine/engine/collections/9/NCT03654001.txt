    
      The project will consist of a 2-by-2 factorial, investigator-initiated, open-label,
      multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, with PROBE design (Prospective Randomized Open
      Trial with Blinded Evaluation of Outcomes), in patients with septic shock, as defined
      according to clinical criteria.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the 4 study groups (Albumin + BAL,
      Albumin + NS, BAL, NS).

      Both the primary endpoints will include events evaluated objectively: 90-day mortality and
      incidence of AKI, as assessed by KDIGO criteria (KDIGO Acute Kidney Injury Work Group, 2012).
