    
      This study will take place at multiple centres across the University of Toronto network.

      The primary outcome of interest will be the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC)
      measured at one year following surgery. The WORC is a disease specific, quality of life
      measurement tool with 21 questions separated into 5 domains: physical symptoms,
      sports/recreation, work, lifestyle, and emotion. Secondary outcomes of interest will be the
      Constant Murley Score (CMS), which relies on subjective as well as objective components of
      scoring, and the EQ-5D-5L which will be used as a general measure of health.

      Psychological well-being will be measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8),
      the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Patient Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) ,
      and the expectations survey from the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management
      System [MODEMS] . Post-operative satisfaction will be measured using the MODEMS satisfaction
      survey.
