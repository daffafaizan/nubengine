    
      This study has an adaptive 2-stage design. Bioequivalence based on encapsulated doxorubicin
      will be tested at the end of Stage 1 . An interim analysis of free doxorubicin will be
      performed at the end of Stage 1 . If needed, the study may continue into Stage 2 with
      additional number of ovarian cancer patients determined based on the interim analysis; and a
      final evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage
      2. Each patient will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences (RT or TR) according to
      a randomization scheme prepared prior to the start of the trial. Serial blood samples for
      determination of free doxorubicin and liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin plasma
      concentrations for PK analysis will be obtained in each cycle.

      The 90% confidence intervals on the GMR（geometric mean ratio） of test to reference products
      of free and liposome encapsulated doxorubicin for PK must be within 80-125% to demonstrate
      bioequivalence.

      Safety data will be summarized and listed. Adverse events will be coded and classified by
      system organ class and preferred term using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. A
      summary of all drug-related adverse events will also be generated. Clinical laboratory data
      will be summarized descriptively and listed by treatment group. The change from pre dose to
      the end of the study will also be summarized. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded
      with the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary and listed. Vital signs and
      electrocardiogram data will be summarized and listed by dose group and visit.
