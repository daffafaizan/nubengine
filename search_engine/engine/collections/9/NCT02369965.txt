    
      This is a 48-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study of the safety and
      efficacy of albuvirtide plus lopinavir-ritonavir in HIV-1 infected adults who are failing
      their first antiretroviral regimen and have HIV-1 RNA levels >= 1000 copies/mL at screening.

      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      albuvirtide + lopinavir-ritonavir or lopinavir-ritonavir + TDF + 3TC. If TDF is used in the
      current regimen or genotypic resistance test shows primary mutation to TDF, zidovudine (AZT)
      or abacavir will be used. Albuvirtide will be given by weekly intravenous infusion and LPV/r
      will be given twice daily. The primary end point is the percentage of participants with HIV-1
      RNA<50 copies/mL at Week 48, the secondary end points include the change of HIV-1 RNA from
      baseline through Week 48, the percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA<400 copies/mL at Week
      48, and the change of CD4 count from baseline through Week 48.
