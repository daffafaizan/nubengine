    
      About 100 patients aged several months to 50 years are treated in the Pediatric Hematology
      Unit, most of those patients receive blood transfusions monthly. The adverse reactions were
      routinely recorded during each transfusion. All the patients were also screened annually for
      the incidence of blood transmitted infections principally HIV and Hepatitis C. All those
      records will be systematically screened and all the immediate or late adverse reactions and
      complications related to blood transfusions will be summarized.

      A second goal of this study will be to control the staff strictness related to the ministry
      of health protocol dealing to blood transfusions.
