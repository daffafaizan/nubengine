      administer a 13-item HIV risk screening tool to all K2 program beneficiaries, and refers
      those who screen positive to facility-based HIV testing. A subset of this 13-item tool is a
      module of four items that had previously been used as a standalone four-question screening
      tool in facilities in Zimbabwe.

      The primary objectives of this study are as follows.

        1. To evaluate the performance of a lay cadre-administered four-item subset of the K2 HIV
           risk screening tool that matches the Zimbabwe evidence-based tool in predicting the HIV
           status of vulnerable children/adolescents represented by two populations: (a) K2 OVC
           beneficiaries and (b) children/adolescents attending health facilities.

        2. To identify additional items in the K2 HIV risk screening tool that could be added to
           the four-question subset to improve the tool's performance.

        3. To assess fidelity to the administration of the OVC HIV screening tool items through
           structured observations of community case workers in the K2 program.

        4. To assess the acceptability of OVC HIV risk screening and testing implemented in the
           community among OVC beneficiaries in the K2 program.

        5. To assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating the OVC HIV screening tool
           with HIV testing among OVC community case workers in the K2 program.
