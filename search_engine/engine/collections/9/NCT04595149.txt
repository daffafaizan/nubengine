      carcinoma receive bintrafusp alfa (B), combined with paclitaxel (P), carboplatin (C), and
      radiation (RT). For safety reasons the first ten patients will be treated in a maximum of
      four selected hospitals. If no unexpected safety signals occur, the study will start in all
      participating centers.

      Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and Carboplatin AUC = 2 will be given by intravenous infusion on days 1,
      8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. External beam radiotherapy will be delivered to a total dose of 50.4
      Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, 5 fractions per week, starting the first day of the first cycle
      of chemotherapy (see below for details on radiation technique).

      Bintrafusp alfa will be given iv every three weeks on day 1, 22, and 43 at a dose of 2400 mg.

      Feasibility of this treatment strategy is the main focus of this study. In this study
      feasibility is defined as ≥80% of patients completing two cycles (of in total three) cycles
      of bintrafusp alpha. In the ART-DECO study, which included a similar patient population, more
      than 80% of patients was able to receive five cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel (i.e. up
      to week 5) (personal communication dr. Hulshof). Therefore, the investigators will regard
      treatment with Bintrafusp alfa during chemoradiation feasible if ≥80% of patients complete
      two cycles of bintrafusp alfa, while with a completion rate ≤62% the treatment will be
      regarded unfeasible.

      The primary end point of this feasibility study is the percentage of patients completing
      bintrafusp alfa treatment. This study requires 41 subjects to decide whether the proportion
      completing at least two cycles of bintrafusp alfa, P, is less than or equal to 0.62 or
      greater than or equal to 0.80. If the number of patients completing two or more cycles of
      Bintrafusp alfa is 31 or more, the hypothesis that P ≤ 0.62 is rejected with a target error
      rate of 0.05 and an actual error rate of 0.048. If the number of patients completing two or
      more cycles of bintrafusp alfa is 30 or less, the hypothesis that P ≥ 0,80 is rejected with a
      target error rate of 0.20 and an actual error rate of 0.182. The test statistic used is the
      one-sided one-sample test for binomial proportion, testing against the fixed reference
      proportion of 0.62. Taking into account 20% drop-out, 52 patients need to be included in the
      study.
