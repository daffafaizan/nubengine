      The role of iron in liver carcinogenesis is supported by human, animal and cellular models
      through direct and indirect mechanisms. The accumulation of iron promotes liver cell
      proliferation and is responsible for direct structural damage or mutations of DNA caused by
      free iron itself or reactive oxygen species generated by its accumulation in the liver.

      The influence of hepatic iron overload (HIO) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      well established in patients with genetic hemochromatosis or HCC developed on non-cirrhotic
      liver. However, the influence of HIO on the risk of occurrence of HCC in other chronic liver
      disease (including alcoholic and viral C) has been controversial. Recently, a prospective
      study including a large population of patients with cirrhosis (n = 301) classified according
      to the aetiology of liver disease (alcohol, n = 162 or hepatitis C virus (HCV)infection, n =
      139) has shown the association between HIO and the occurrence of HCC in patients with
      alcoholic cirrhosis. Thus, the assessment of liver iron in routine clinical practice could
      allow the identification of patients at higher risk of developing HCC and in whom preventive
      measures such as iron depletion by phlebotomy could be undertaken. Based on the model of
      genetic hemochromatosis in which its effectiveness on survival improvement and even
      regression of hepatic injury has been shown, its effectiveness on the prognosis and
      prevention of HCC occurrence in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must now be studied in
      prospective multicentre randomized trials.

      The main objective of the study is to assess in patients with compensated alcoholic cirrhosis
      and HIO, as assessed by MRI, the effect of phlebotomy in order to lower and maintain serum
      ferritin below 50 Âµg / l on the risk of HCC occurrence. The effect of bloodletting will be
      jointly evaluated on 1) episodes of hepatic decompensation, 2) non HCC liver-related
      mortality 3) changes in HIO during follow-up.
