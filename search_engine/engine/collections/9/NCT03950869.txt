      intrusive memories by using a well-established experimental paradigm - the trauma film
      paradigm. In healthy volunteers, intrusion-like symptoms are to be induced with an analogue
      stressor, i.e., aversive film clip footage (trauma film). After viewing this so-called trauma
      film, the expectations of intrusions during the following week are manipulated by assigning
      participants randomly to three different groups. In the first group, negative expectations
      are induced (experimental group 1), the second group is exposed to positive expectations
      (experimental group 2) and a third group does not face any kind of manipulation of their
      expectations (control group). Participants are asked to report occurring intrusions in a
      diary during the following week and are invited to a subsequent cued laboratory inquiry at
      follow-up.
