      patients will receive 4-6 cycles of induction therapy which includes VAD chemotherapy
      (vincristin, adriamycin and dexamethasone) or thalidomide/dexamethasone. After peripheral
      hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and apheresis, patients will receive a standard
      conditioning with melphalan 200mg/m2 followed by thalidomide maintenance therapy at 100-200mg
      orally daily starting from D+60 till disease progression or untolerable toxicity.
