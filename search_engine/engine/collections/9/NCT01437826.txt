      people aged 60 or more: about one in four of them has at least one adenoma. In time, adenoma
      could progress to cancer. Even though only a small rate of adenomas will develop into cancer
      almost 70-80% of colorectal cancer origin from an adenoma and colorectal cancer is one of the
      most frequent malignant tumors in the western world. Several epidemiological studies showed
      that subjects who had low intake and/or low blood levels of selenium were at increased risk
      of developing colorectal cancer.
