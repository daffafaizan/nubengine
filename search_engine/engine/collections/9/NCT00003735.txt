      leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with
      oral topotecan. II. Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (acute lymphocytic leukemia vs acute myeloid
      leukemia). Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of blasts in the blood, M3 bone marrow, or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
