      witnessed in recent years, which renders investigations of cognitive intervention especially
      urgent and vital. Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) is now considered as a potentially
      non-pharmacologic intervention for cognitive decline and has attracted the interest of
      researchers. However, there are few existing studies involving the mechanism of tPBM on brain
      functional networks.

      Sixty healthy older participants will be recruited in this randomized, single-blind
      controlled trial. Each group had thirty participants.Participants in the active tPBM group
      will take active tPBM and those in the sham tPBM group will take sham tPBM. After that, the
      investigators will investigate the changes of working memory, which is the primary outcome.
      Furthermore, based on the neuroimaging technique of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
      (fNIRS), the regulatory mechanism of tPBM in intervening older adults will be revealed from
      the perspective of altered brain functional networks.

      This study will provide evidence for understanding whether the tPBM has the potentially
      therapeutic effect on cognitive function for healthy older adults as a non-drug treatment,
      and further elucidating the potential brain mechanism, which are of great values in solving
      scientific and clinical practice issues.
