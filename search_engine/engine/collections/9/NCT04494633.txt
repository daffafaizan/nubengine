      will receive the intervention. The investigators will recruit and enroll 80 medical students
      who are in pre-clinical years of medical school. The number of participants selected is based
      on a power analysis of the design and experience of low dropout rate with this target
      audience; to reach a medium effect size the investigators plan for a final sample size of 68
      medical students. During the intervention phase of the study, students will 1) Complete the
      simulation experience: 6 to 8 tailored scenarios and resilience-building activities (taking
      around 2 hours over a period of around 4 weeks); and 2) Complete pre-/post- assessments (each
      taking around 1 hour) plus a follow-up survey after 3 months. The investigators will screen
      for and exclude students with severe depression and suicidality. The primary clinical
      endpoint will be burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Secondary endpoints
      will be measured via the following assessments: Medical Student Quality of Life, PHQ2/PHQ9 to
      screen for depression, CD-RISC 2 for resiliency, AUDIT-C/AUDIT for alcohol use disorder and
      two drug question screening for drug use, and CSQ8 for satisfaction plus questions adapted
      from the Game User Experience Satisfaction survey and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory to
      further describe the experience. After 4 weeks, the control and experimental (intervention)
      groups will cross over to the opposite status and control participants will engage in the
      intervention.
