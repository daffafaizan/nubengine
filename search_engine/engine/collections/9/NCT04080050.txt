    
      Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder
      characterized by absent or severely reduced capacity to catabolize circulating LDL particles
      by the hepatic LDL receptor. As a consequence, HoFH subjects present abnormal total plasma
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, resulting in severe atherosclerosis often leading to early onset
      of cardiovascular disease. Early initiation of aggressive treatment for these patients is
      therefore essential. Unfortunately, despite existing therapies, treated LDL-C levels could
      remain well above acceptable levels. Thus, the functional replacement of the defective LDLR
      via AAV-based liver-directed gene therapy, RGX-501, may be a viable approach to treat this
      disease and improve response to current lipid-lowering treatments.

      This is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy
      after a single administration of RGX-501. Eligible participants are those who previously have
      enrolled in a clinical study and received a single intravenous infusion of RGX-501.
