    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicentre, open and controlled study, to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of everolimus combined with cyclosporin for microemulsion and steroids
      according to medical judgement, opposite to the usual therapy which the patient already has
      received (typically: ciclosporin + azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil + steroids according
      to the judgement of the doctor) for patients receiving a cardiac orthotopic transplant since
      at least 12 months. The patients will be randomized in a 2:1 proportion (everolimus:control),
      in order to make it possible for the majority of patients to receive the potentially active
      treatment in a lethal illness for which there is not efficient known treatment up to date.

      The study duration will be 2 years of follow-up for each patient. At the end of this period,
      the patients will be offered the possibility to maintain the immunosuppressive treatment to
      which they have been assigned, and periodic revisions will be made each 3-6 months.

      The two treatment groups are:

      Group I - Everolimus twice a day v.o. + cyclosporin for microemulsion in reduced doses +/-
      steroids.

      Group II - Cyclosporin for microemulsion + azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids
      (the same administration schedule and medication which the patient received earlier).
