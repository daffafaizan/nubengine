      allocated to receive propofol based total intravenous anesthesia (n=111) or desflurane
      (n=111). The quality of recover after surgery using the QoR-15K was assessed by a
      investigator at postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, and 3. The primary outcome is the QoR-15K at
      POD 1 after surgery.
