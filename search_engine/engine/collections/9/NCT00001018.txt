      infections by organisms closely related to the intracellular parasite Cryptosporidium.
      Reliable data are needed to show the effectiveness of letrazuril in treating AIDS-related
      cryptosporidial diarrhea.

      Four groups of eight patients receive escalating doses of oral letrazuril (or placebo). In
      each group, six patients are randomized to receive letrazuril and two patients receive
      matching placebo. In the pharmacokinetics determination phase of the study, patients receive
      a single dose of letrazuril or placebo following a meal. Following a 72-hour blood
      collection, patients enter the blinded, treatment phase of the study and receive letrazuril
      or placebo as a single dose daily, after a meal, for 3 weeks. Patients with persistent
      Cryptosporidium oocysts in their stools at the end of the blinded treatment phase may
      continue with open-label treatment of letrazuril at the same dose for 4 weeks; the dose may
      subsequently be escalated every 4 weeks, to a maximum, if oocysts persist. Patients who have
      Cryptosporidium oocysts eradicated from their stools will discontinue treatment and be
      followed for 3 months. All patients undergo clinical follow-up at 3 and 6 months.
