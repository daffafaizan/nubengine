    
      Primary objectives of this study is to determine the efficacy profiles of rAd-p53 intra-tumor
      injection alone, with concurrent chemotherapy, with concurrent radiotherapy, or combination
      with surgery for treatment of head and neck malignant tumors in advanced stage (stage III or
      IV) including target lesion complete response rate (LCR) and overall target lesion response
      rate (OLR), response duration (RD), and progress-free survival (PFS).

      The secondary objectives of this study is to investigate overall response rate (OPCR) and
      overall complete response rate (OCR), overall survival (OS), ECOG, and safety of rAd-p53
      monotherapy and combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.
