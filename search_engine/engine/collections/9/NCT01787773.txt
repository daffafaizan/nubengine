    
      Verify the effectiveness and safety of the Veniti IVC Filter in accordance with the clinical
      guidelines published by the Society for Interventional Radiology (SIR) .

      The endpoint is clinical success (versus failure) at 6 months after implant or 1 month post
      retrieval, whichever occurs first, based on the definition provided by the SIR guidelines, as
      the absence of:

        1. Procedure failure (assessed at the end of the implant procedure)

        2. Subsequent pulmonary embolus

        3. IVC occlusion

        4. Filter embolization

      Secondary assessments include:

      Estimating the rate of:

        1. Retrieval success

        2. Device and procedure related adverse events

        3. Assessing filter performance rate:
