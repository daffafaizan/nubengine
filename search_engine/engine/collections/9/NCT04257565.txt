      prevalence of 8.5% in 2015 with an expected rise to 11.1% in 2025. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU)
      are a common complication and the leading cause of lower limb amputation worldwide. Treatment
      for DFU include casts, braces, crutches and walkers to remove pressure (offload) from the
      ulcer. These interventions, when not rejected, foster a sedentary lifestyle which negatively
      impacts function and quality of life. Also, crutches and walkers may increase risk of
      ulceration of the sound foot as the arms are often not strong enough to support the body
      weight when stepping.

      The wheeled knee walkers (WKW) is a relatively new walking aid that allows total offloading
      of one foot, requires less physical exertion, and is more stable than crutches or walkers.
      The purpose of this research is to determine if a WKW would improve wound healing, quality of
      life, and physical function while decreasing the risk of sound foot ulceration in people with
      DFU. To explore these objectives we will recruit people with DFU who are under the care of a
      vascular surgeon, perform standardized baseline measures for each objective, provide a WKW to
      half of the participants and then re-evaluate all objectives at 6 and 12 weeks. The results
      will help guide treatment and inform decision making to optimize care. Further, the project
      will establish an interdisciplinary collaborative research program for future projects to
      improve health and advance knowledge.
