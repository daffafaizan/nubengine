      (DLBCL) are not satisfactory especially for those not suitable for transplantation. One of
      main reason is chemotherapy resistance. The investigators conducted this study to evaluate
      the efficacy of Chidamide combined with R-GDP(rituximab/gemcitabine/dexamethasone/cisplatin)
      in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) not
      suitable for transplantation. Chidamide is a novel benzamide type of subtype-selective
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It has been approved by China Food and Drug
      Administration (CFDA) for treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma
      (PTCL) in Chinese population. The investigators' pre-clinical data suggested that this agent
      might be also efficient in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell lymphoma. In this
      open-label, non-randomized, phase II study, the investigators aimed to observe the efficacy
      and safety of chidamide combined with R-GDP in patients with relapsed or refractory Diffuse
      Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) not suitable for transplantation.
