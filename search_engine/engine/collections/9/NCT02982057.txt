      could facilitate the stabilization process into the atherosclerotic plaque with modifications
      of plaque morphology, especially the lipid content which is considered as one of the main
      factor leading to recurrent MACE after an ACS.

      The interaction between the polymer Platform and the vessel wall, the effect of the
      everolimus on neointima growth and cellular response into the media could reduce the
      inflammatory process into the vulnerable plaque could be different Under OMT and BVS
      implantation.
