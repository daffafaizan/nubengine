      of the hamstrings in people who work out?

      Design: Intervention study in humans

      Participants: 40 healthy student volunteers, ranging in age from 18 to 35 years old, who work
      out.

      Intervention: The Wells bench was used to assess the flexibility of the hamstring muscle. In
      this test, a person sits on a mat, with the soles of both feet maintaining contact with a
      box. The top of the box has an indicator marked in centimeters that is used to measure
      flexibility by how far the person can push the indicator without bending the legs. The knees
      of the seated person are extended while the hips are flexed. The subject is then asked to
      take a deep breath, and during exhalation, flex the trunk forward with the upper limbs
      extended.

      The upper limbs are supported by a bench of 23 cm long aligned with a tape measure over the
      bench. During flexion of the trunk, the right hand is placed over the left and the tips of
      the fingers touch the indicator on top, and move it forward as far as possible.
