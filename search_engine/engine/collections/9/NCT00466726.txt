      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of bcr-abl p210-b3a2 breakpoint-derived pentapeptide vaccine
           (CMLVAX100), in terms of peripheral blood bcr-abl/abl ratio reduction, in patients with
           Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the reduction of molecular residual disease at 3 months in patients treated
           with this vaccine.

        -  Determine the reduction of molecular residual disease at 12 months in patients treated
           with maintenance boosts of this vaccine.

        -  Determine the rate of complete molecular response at any time after vaccination.

        -  Determine in vivo and in vitro peptide-specific immune response induced by the vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 2 and bcr-abl
      p210-b3a2 breakpoint-derived pentapeptide vaccine (CMLVAX100) SC on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for 6 courses. Patients then receive CMLVAX100 SC once monthly for 3 months and
      then once every 3 months for 6 months (for a total of 1 year). Patients may receive
      additional CMLVAX100 SC every 6 months for at least 3 years. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 69 patients will be accrued for this study.
