      macular edema were measured by optical coherence tomography. After 3.75mg bevacizumab was
      injected into subconjunctival space of the eyes with diabetic macular edema. The measurements
      of the macular thicknesses were repeated by optical coherence tomography in 15th, 30th, 60th
      day after injections. The macular thickness measurements before and after injection were
      compared.
