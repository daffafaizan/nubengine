    
      The secondary obectives are:

      A. For women who are found to have synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time of
      resection: To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved in synechia at the time of resection.

      B. For women who are found to have synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time of
      resection:To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved in synechia at the time of a follow-up hysteroscopy following resection.

      C. For women who are found to have synechia at the time of resection:To describe the change
      in levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin involved at the time of a
      follow-up hysteroscopy following resection whether or not the patient converts back to "no
      synechia".

      D. For women who are found to have another intracavitary pathology at the time of resection:
      To describe the change in levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved at the time of a follow-up hysteroscopy following resection whether or not the
      patient converts to "synechia".

      E. To estimate the intra-individual variation in the measured factors (initial biopsy levels
      versus levels at time of resection).

      F. To create an intrauterine map of factor levels according to biopy position (riosteal /
      medium / proximal) for patients with synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time
      of resection and then follow-up hysteroscopy.

      G. To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin as a
      function of pregnancy 6 months after resection.

      H. Create a tissue bank associated with the study.
