      Healthy full-time undergraduate students undergoing fall 2009 final academic exams will be
      recruited from the University of Florida. Informed consent will be obtained. All subjects
      will be consented for the main intervention study and a subgroup (n=25/group or 75 total) of
      these subjects will also be consented to provide two stool samples at baseline and two stool
      samples during the week of final exams (approximately week 4 of the intervention). Subjects
      will be stratified based on gender and randomized (n=140/group) to receive 0 g, 2.5 g, or 5.0
      g of the fermentable fiber, galactooligosaccharides, for eight weeks around the time of their
      fall final exams. Subjects will complete daily online questionnaires asking whether they are
      experiencing any cold/flu symptoms. Weekly online questionnaires will collect information
      regarding gastrointestinal symptoms over the past week. The acute psychological stress
      associated with final exams will increase cold/flu symptoms. It is anticipated that students
      consuming the galactooligosaccharides versus the placebo will have more healthy days (i.e.,
      days without cold symptoms) due to fiber induced changes in the beneficial bacteria within
      the colon, which reduces the burden on the immune system.
