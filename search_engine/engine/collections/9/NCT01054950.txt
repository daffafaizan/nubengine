      allergy packet, along with three follow up phone calls from our trained allergy nurse, and
      the control group, will be given the food allergy packet only. We expect the intervention
      group to score higher on the quality of life survey, showing that the support and education
      of our allergy nurse has a positive effect on quality of life of our patients and their
      families.
