      adherence in latent TB patients. Specific objectives of the current study are to: 1) Assess
      the feasibility of the intervention as indicated by participant recruitment and retention
      and; 2) Evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, as indicated by intervention
      adherence, outcome measurement rates, and feedback from participants.

      Data will be used to design a definitive trial which will test the hypothesis that the
      intervention will improve medication adherence, as measured through an increase in treatment
      completion rates, and result in higher self-reported medication adherence, fewer missed
      appointments and doses, and a shorter course of treatment.
