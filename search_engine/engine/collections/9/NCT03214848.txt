      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), specifically intrauterine device (IUD) and
      contraceptive implant, use among women presenting for abortion care is a priority. Despite
      its efficacy and safety, LARC methods remain underutilized in the abortion setting.

      This is a randomized prospective study evaluating the impact of a brief contraceptive
      education intervention with optional referral for financial counseling on post abortion
      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) uptake and contraceptive use at three months post
      abortion.
