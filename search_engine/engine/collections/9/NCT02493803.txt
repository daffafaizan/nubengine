      written informed consent will be obtained. Patients presenting with moderate to severe tooth
      wear will be recruited. Those with a Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) cumulative score
      greater than or equal to 8 but with at least one score of 3 on the occlusal surfaces of the
      lower molars or the incisal edge of the upper central incisor. After randomisation, an
      impression will be taken of the upper and lower teeth using a silicone material. One group
      will receive one-to-one dietary advice (with dietary information sheets) as the intervention
      and the other group will not receive any intervention. The silicone impressions will be
      repeated 6 months later. Impressions will be cast in stone and the occlusal surfaces of the
      upper or lower molars and the buccal surface of the upper central and lateral incisors will
      be scanned to monitor tooth wear progression. The two scans of the involved teeth will be
      superimposed and the level of tooth wear over that time will be calculated.

      The investigators aim to see if giving detailed dietary advice will result in less erosive
      tooth wear.
