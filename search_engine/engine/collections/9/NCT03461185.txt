      growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to treat NSCLC
      harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, a large proportion of patients would
      become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially sensitivity.
      Anti-angiogenesis therapy plus EGFR-TKI has been demonstrated valid and safe in NSCLC
      patients. Apatinib, endostatin, anlotinib belong to anti-angiogenesis drugs and can inhibit
      tumor growth. In this study, we plan to recruit NSCLC patients who are assessed as stable
      disease ( according to RECIST) under treatment of EGFR-TKI. Then, these patients would be
      divided into two groups: single EGFR-TKI or EGFR-TKI plus anti-angiogenesis drugs.
      Progression free survival, overall survival and safety are our evaluation events.
