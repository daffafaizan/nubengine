        -  To correlate changes in VWF, platelet reactivity and blood level of NET after TAVR with
           clinical outcomes

        -  To correlate changes in VWF, platelet reactivity and blood level of NET with
           antithrombotic regimens after TAVR (direct anticoagulants apixaban versus standard of
           care, ie Vitamin K antagonist or antiplatelet therapy).
