    
      Primary: - To assess progression-free survival rate at three months.

      Secondary: - To determine the toxicity and safety of systemic infusion of anti-TGF beta
      antibody at three-week dosing intervals. - To assess time to progression and overall survival
      - to assess response rate using Modified RECIST Criteria for Mesothelioma Additional
      Objectives: - To assess efficacy using serial measurements of serum [and intrapleural, if
      indwelling catheter in place] biomarkers, including serum-mesothelin related peptide
      (SMRP/MesomarkÂ®) and osteopontin. - To assess systemic [and intrapleural if indwelling
      catheter in place] humoral anti-tumor immune responses after repeated anti-TGF beta antibody
      instillation. - To assess systemic [and intrapleural, if indwelling catheter in place] TGF
      beta, and other cytokine levels after repeated anti-TGF beta antibody instillation. - To
      assess biologic response measurements of TGF beta blockade from serum tests and from pleural
      fluid or biopsy tissue if this is available.
