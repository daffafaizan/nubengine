      participants consume either fructose- or glucose-sweetened beverages (25% of energy) with
      meals. Experimental procedures, including 24-hour serial blood sampling, 26-h stable isotoped
      infusions, post-heparin blood collection, gluteal biopsies, metabolic rate monitoring,
      computed tomography scans of the abdomen, and Oral Glucose Tolerance and Disposal Tests, are
      performed during baseline and at the end of a 10-week intervention period at the UC Davis
      School of Medicine/Sacramento Veterans Affairs Medical Center Clinical Research Center
      (CCRC). During the 2-week inpatient baseline period, subjects are served energy balanced
      diets containing 15% of energy as protein, 30% as fat, and 55% as complex carbohydrate.
      Following the baseline period, the subjects reside at home for 8 weeks and consume their
      usual ad libitum diet along with 25% of energy requirements as fructose- or glucose-sweetened
      beverages. Subjects then return to the CCRC for the 2-week inpatient intervention period at
      the end of the study and are served energy-balanced diets containing 15% of energy as
      protein, 30% as fat, 30% as complex carbohydrate and 25% of energy as fructose- or
      glucose-sweetened beverage.
