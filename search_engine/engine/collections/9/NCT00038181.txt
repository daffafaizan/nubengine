    
      1. To determine the efficacy (rate of tumor reduction and PSA decline) of pre-operative
           treatment with thalidomide in patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma.

        2. To determine the safety and toxicity (excessive bleeding, wound healing problems) of
           preoperative therapy with thalidomide in patients with locally advanced prostate
           carcinoma who undergo RRP.

        3. To obtain qualitative measurements of thalidomide's effect in vivo on:

             1. endothelial cells / neo-vascularity /angiogenic growth factors:

                  -  Assessment of neovascularity (MVD)

                  -  Dual fluorescent labeling technique to evaluate apoptosis in CD-31 positive
                     cells (TUNEL)

                  -  bFGF, VEGF, EGF and TGF expression by PCa epithelium and prostatic stroma

                  -  Modulation of endothelial markers (serum: E-selectin and Thrombomodulin)

                  -  Modulation of serum VEGF and urine bFGF levels, and Changes in tumor blood
                     flow

             2. epithelial compartment:

                  -  Apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (TUNEL)

                  -  Proliferation (PCNA)

             3. quality of life
