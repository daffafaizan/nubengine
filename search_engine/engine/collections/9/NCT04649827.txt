      epidemic, which was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus transmission
      was rapidly spread around the globe and the World Health Organization declared it as a public
      health emergency and it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is related to high morbidity and
      mortality rates.

      The total number of infected patients has risen fastly and at the end of February 2020, the
      first case in Brazil was confirmed, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic situation.

      The clinical aspect of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from pneumonia to critically ill cases, including
      clinical treatment, mechanical ventilation, and SARS.

      The acute respiratory failure of critically ill patients with COVID-19 has different aspects,
      including hypoxemia of difficult treatment, associated in some cases with clotting disorders,
      changes in immunity and inflammatory phenomena that pose challenges for the management of
      these patients, whose mortality can be higher than expected.

      The Public Health School in Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil, implemented an action plan that
      provides several actions against COVID-19, including a specialized hospital and crew to treat
      these patients. Knowing the characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and
      their clinical outcomes is extremely important to inform clinical decision-making and to
      guide the strategy to mitigate the epidemic, both within each hospital and ICU and in public
      health management.
