      125mg/m2, Q3week Xeloda 1250mg/m2, 21day/cycle) is feasible and achieves high response rates.

      It is proposed that 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. The target population is
      women with early breast cancer (stage of T2-4N0-3M0) who are eligible for primary systemic
      therapy.

      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the overall response rate. Secondary
      endpoints will include response rates in axillary lymph nodes, safety and tolerability and
      the rate of breast conservation.
