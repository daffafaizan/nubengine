    
      This is a single-centre, cross-sectional observational study in patients >16 years of age
      diagnosed with FD, GD or NPC. The research hypotheses of this study are:

        1. That complement is excessively activated, including at the specifically complement C5
           level, in patients with the lysosomal storage disorders FD, GD and NPC.

        2. That complement activation drives tissue injury in the LSDs via downstream effector
           mechanisms including membrane attach complex (MAC/C5b-9)-mediated cytotoxicity and
           C5aR-mediated inflammation.

      The study aims to show enhanced complement activation, including at the C5 level, in patients
      with FD, GD and NPC compared to healthy controls.

      The research assays for this study include the primary outcome measure of plasma soluble
      C5b-9 (sC6b-9) levels measured using ELISA. This assay measures the degree to which ongoing
      C5 activation Is occurring in vivo based on sensitive detection in plasma of the key
      activation product C5b-9. The assay would be expected to show elevated plasma sC5b-9 levels
      in patients with the glycosphingolipidoses compared to disease-free controls, as was
      previously demonstrated in patient cohorts of atypical haemolytic uraemia syndrome (aHUS) and
      C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additional complement activation products will be assessed as
      secondary endpoints including plasma C3a and C5a levels by ELISA, and intracellular leukocyte
      C5a concentration as a marker of systemic C5a generation and C5aR1 expression.
