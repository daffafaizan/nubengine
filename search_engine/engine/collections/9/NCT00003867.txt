      capecitabine in patients with gastrointestinal or other solid tumors. II. Characterize the
      relationship at the recommended phase II dose between thymidine synthase and thymidine
      phosphorylase expression and tumor response and/or toxic effects in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily
      every twelve hours for 14 days, and IV irinotecan over 30 minutes once every 3 weeks
      beginning on day 1. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of capecitabine and irinotecan is escalated in
      cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
