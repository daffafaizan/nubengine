      of advanced osteoarthritis total knee arthroplasty is still associated with postoperative
      pain and delayed rehabilitation. We therefore decided to evaluate the effects of
      pre-operative methylprednisolone (125mg iv) versus placebo on postoperative outcome in a well
      defined fast-track setup after knee arthroplasty.
