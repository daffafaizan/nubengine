      group (group A - early central line removal) central line will be removed at the time the
      infant reaches 100 ml/kg/d of enteral intake. In the second group (group B - standard central
      line removal) central line will be removed at the time the infant reaches 140 ml/kg/d of
      enteral intake (full enteral intake). Central lines will be removed after 3 well tolerated
      consecutive feedings (assessed by the physician) with no contraindications for central line
      removal present:

        -  necessity of administration of drugs that must be given via central venous access,

        -  necessity of administration of drugs that must be given intravenously along with
           difficulties to secure peripheral venous access,

        -  necessity of prolonged (> 7 days) administration of drugs that must be given
           intravenously,

        -  necessity to continue parenteral nutrition along with difficulties to secure peripheral
           venous access.

      Assessment of feedings tolerance will be at discretion of the physician taking care for the
      infant. After central line removal, infants in group A will continue to receive parenteral
      nutrition via peripheral venous access at the discretion of the physician taking care for the
      infant. The solution used to continue parenteral nutrition via peripheral venous access will
      contain at maximum 2,5% amino acids, 10% glucose and no calcium or phosphate preparations to
      ensure fluid's osmolality will not exceed 900 mOsm/l and the solution will be well tolerated
      when administered via peripheral vein.

      Parenteral nutrition will be prescribed according to the local protocol. Enteral nutrition
      will be initiated during the first days of life and advanced gradually at the discretion of
      the neonatologist.
