      20 and 65 years in developed countries. Swelling of the central retina, or "macular oedema",
      is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy.

      Recent studies have suggested peripheral retinal ischaemia contributes to macula oedema in
      diabetes and retinal vein occlusions. Intravitreal anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF) therapy, such as Aflibercept (Eylea) has shown encouraging results in managing
      Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). There is evidence that regular treatment with anti-VEGF drugs
      reduces DMO and improves vision on average.

      Previous research at this institution has shown that an average of between 7 and 11
      injections are required in the first year to stabilise the disease. However, there is a
      significant burden to patients in terms of frequent visits to the eye specialist, time off
      work and repeated injections into the eye. The purpose of this study is to see whether
      targeted peripheral retinal laser therapy to areas of the retina with impaired blood supply
      can reduce the number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required over 2 years to
      stabilise DMO.
