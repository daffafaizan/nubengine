      are not completely investigated. It is assumed, that sphingolipids and sterols compete for
      intestinal absorption. In addition it is unclear, if a dietary phospholipid supplementation
      may influence the phospholipid concentration in plasma.

      To evaluate the effect of a dietary phospholipid supplementation 15 healthy female subjects
      received over 10 days daily 3 g of milk phospholipids stirred in a dairy product. During the
      following 10 days the subjects were supplemented with daily 6 g milk phospholipid. Finally,
      the subjects received over 10 days 6 g of the milk phospholipid in a dairy product and 2 g of
      plant sterols serving a commercial product.
