      capacity is considered a key measure for the detection of significant coronary disease with
      stenosed epicardial arterial conduit vessels and overall microvascular function, including
      endothelial dysfunction. Twenty nine healthy controls will undergo a baseline cardiovascular
      magnetic resonance (CMR) exam. Afterwards, participants will consume coffee in the presence
      of study personnel. This will consist of 3 espresso shots, which will be consumed within 15
      minutes. Approximately 2h after coffee consumption the CMR exam will be repeated. The goal
      will be to investigate the impact of caffeine on myocardial features. In particular the
      effect on the myocardial oxygenation response to vasodilating and vasoconstricting stimuli.
