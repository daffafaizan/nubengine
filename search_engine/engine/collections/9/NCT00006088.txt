      on day 1 and orally on day 8 vs the reverse order in patients with metastatic or advanced
      solid tumors. II. Determine the intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetics of oral
      vinorelbine. III. Compare the safety profiles of oral vs intravenous vinorelbine in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral
      vinorelbine on day 8. Arm II: Patients receive oral vinorelbine on day 1 and vinorelbine IV
      over 20 minutes on day 8. Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed for 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
