      fracture of the supracondylar (metaphyseal) region of the distal femur will be operatively
      managed by one of two strategies. The first strategy involves fixation of the fracture with a
      reamed, interlocking intramedullary nail (Nail Group). The second treatment strategy involves
      open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a locking periarticular plate
      (Plate Group). The null hypothesis of the study is that there will be no difference in the
      two groups with respect to the primary and secondary outcome measures. To the degree
      possible, patients in the two groups will receive post-operative care according to the same
      standards and protocols.
