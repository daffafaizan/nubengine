    
      18F-X PET will be carried out requiring arterial sampling in 2 patients suffering from ALS
      and 2 normal subjects in order to evaluate the 18F-X quantification.

      Then simplified PET using 18F-X will be carried out in 13 patients and 13 normal subjects.

      Binding potential maps showing specific binding of 18f-X will be generated for each subject.

      Regional binding potential values will be calculated for anatomically defined regions of
      interest after coregistration to and special transformation into the subject's own MRI.
