      prospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then followed forward in time
      for the outcome of the study) randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      multi-center study. Approximately 385 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to treatment or observation group in a ratio of 1:1. The study duration
      from screening up to the study end is up to 27 weeks. Then the patients will be observed
      until the last included patient has completed a 30 month post observational phase. The
      patients in the treatment arm will receive 4 cycles of a therapy. Each cycle lasts for a 35
      days. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests.
