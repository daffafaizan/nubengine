      reports of prevalence range from 8-31% in the general population, the prevalence of bruxism
      in Egyptian children is unknown. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism,
      including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, damage to dental
      restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings) and damage to teeth. However it may cause minimal
      symptoms, and therefore people may not be aware of the condition,so this study is important
      to determine the prevalence of bruxism of preschool Egyptian children
