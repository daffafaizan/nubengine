      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This trial is designed to test the hypothesis that PET
      determined [18F]FMISO uptake will indicate tumor hypoxia in patients with HCC treated with
      trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE). We anticipate that [18F] FMISO PET/CT will advance
      our understanding of the role of hypoxia in HCC prior to treatment and that this knowledge
      will help design newer combination therapeutic trials for better treatment outcomes. [18F]
      FMISO PET/CT provides three parameters, tissue hypoxic volume (HV), maximum tissue to blood
      uptake ratio (T:Bmax) and tumor blood flow. Both pre-and post-therapy images will be examined
      to investigate changes in these parameters during the course of TACE treatment.
