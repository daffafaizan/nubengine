      substantially higher oral supplementation with vitamin D to replenish the micronutrient
      stores and aid to resolve associated maternal and neonatal morbidity due to Vitamin D
      deficiency. The investigators expect that if vitamin D is supplemented to pregnant women,
      their newborn infants would inevitably replenish the micronutrient stores and aid to resolve
      the maternal and neonatal morbidity due to Vitamin D deficiency.This is hospital based double
      blinded trial, study participants divided into three groups which will receive Vitamin D
      supplementation in 400, 2000 and 4000 International Units. The group which will receive 400
      IUs will be treated as control group.
