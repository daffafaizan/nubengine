      well as the effects of therapy on lymphocyte replication should lead to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the immunodeficiency induced by HIV. To examine this
      directly, up to 85 HIV-infected patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive
      up to two 30 minute infusions (at least one month apart) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU; 200
      mg/m(2)), an analogue of thymidine. BrDU is incorporated into DNA and can be measured using
      an anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody. It can be measured in subpopulations of cells to determine
      the rate of replication of those cells. All participants in this study will be reimbursed for
      the inconvenience and discomfort associated with study participation.
