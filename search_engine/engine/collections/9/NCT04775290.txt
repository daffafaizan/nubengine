      proinflammatory markers) with blood sampling on day 1,15 and last of radiotherapy, at 1-3-6
      months after the end of radiotherapy.

      Patients with breast cancer who will undergo radiotherapy will be randomly assigned to the
      yoga group (YG) or the control group (CG).

      Patients in the YG will participate in 2 weekly yoga classes during the 5 weeks of radiation
      therapy. The classes will be coordinated with the treatment program and will be held in the
      vicinity of the radiation therapy center.
