      Study ARCT-021-01 (the Parent Study). Participants will enter this study approximately 3
      months after their final study visit in the Parent Study. Participants that received placebo
      in the Parent Study or who are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at
      screening will receive a single dose of ARCT-021 and will be followed for 365 days.
      Participants that received two injections of ARCT-021 in the Parent Study will not receive
      any further injections of ARCT-021 and will be followed for 281 days.
