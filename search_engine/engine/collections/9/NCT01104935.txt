    
      This study is a randomized, comparative trial of postoperative adjuvant therapies in women
      with HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2)-positive primary breast cancer who
      are ≥70 years of age that will compare trastuzumab (Herceptin®) monotherapy (H group) and
      trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (H+CT group).

      The objectives of this study are as follows.

        1. To verify the clinical positioning of trastuzumab monotherapy and combined trastuzumab
           and chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant therapies for the treatment of HER2-positive
           primary breast cancer patients who are ≥70 years of age.

        2. To evaluate the safety of trastuzumab monotherapy and combined trastuzumab and
           chemotherapy in patients who are ≥70 years of age. In particular, to evaluate cardiac
           disorders that are a characteristic adverse drug reaction of trastuzumab as well as
           geriatric-related concerns including lipid metabolism, cerebral infarction and cognitive
           disorders.

        3. To evaluate overall survival in patients who are ≥70 years of age using trastuzumab
           monotherapy or combined trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

        4. To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL), cost-effectiveness (utility), and
           conduct a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in patients who are ≥70 years of age
           and using trastuzumab monotherapy or combined trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

        5. To establish and expand information networks by the participation of practitioners in
           clinical trials that are involved in general clinical practice and breast cancer.
