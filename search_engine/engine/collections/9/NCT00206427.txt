      an important role in fundamental cell processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and
      survival. These receptor tyrosine kinases, which include HER1 (epidermal growth factor
      receptor, EGFR), HER2 (HER2/neu, c-erbB2), HER3 and HER4 contain an extracellular domain and
      intracellular protein tyrosine kinase core. Aberrant HER1 and HER2 signaling has been
      causally associated with cancer cell proliferation and survival.

      HER1 is expressed or over-expressed in many human solid tumors and plays an important role in
      progression to invasion and metastases.. The association between HER2 overexpression and poor
      prognosis in node-positive and advanced breast cancer has been shown by a number of studies.
      Based on this association between the members of HER1/HER2 family and worse clinical outcome,
      antibodies and small molecules that specifically target these receptor tyrosine kinases were
      developed for their therapeutic efficacy.

      Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal
      antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the HER2
      receptor. Pivotal multicenter efficacy trials in metastatic patients showed improved response
      rates and disease-free survival in patients who received trastuzumab in addition to
      chemotherapy. One of these studies was an open-labeled, multicenter, randomized phase III
      study evaluating the addition of trastuzumab to standard first-line chemotherapy in
      metastatic breast cancer. This study randomized 469 patients with metastatic disease to
      chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab. Results of this study showed survival in patients
      who received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to be almost twice as long as chemotherapy alone
      (7.2 vs. 4.5 months, p<0.0001).

      As dimerization is important in signal transduction, therapies that target more than one
      member of the HER family may have greater anti-tumor effect. Recently, data with trastuzumab
      plus IMC-C224 in human ovarian cancer cells showed greater growth inhibition compared to
      either monoclonal antibody alone. GW572016 is an orally active dual HER1/HER2 kinase
      inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways. This dual inhibition is an attractive
      therapeutic strategy for epithelial cancers, as ligand-induced HER1/HER2 dimerization
      triggers off potent proliferative and survival signals. In vitro studies with GW572016 have
      shown marked activity, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in HER1 and HER2 overexpressing
      cell lines. GW572016 markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of HER1 and HER2, and
      activation of MAP kinase and Akt, the downstream effectors of proliferation and survival,
      respectively. In vitro studies in HER-2 overexpressing cell lines have demonstrated
      synergistic activity when GW572016 is combined with taxanes. Phase I studies with GW572016
      and taxanes have been completed, with results demonstrating that this small molecule
      inhibitor may be safely combined with chemotherapy with no unanticipated side effects.

      As the type I tyrosine kinases are involved in various aspects of cell growth and survival, a
      potent quinazoline and pyrido-[3,4-d]-pyrimidine small molecule (GW572016) against HER1 and
      HER2 was developed which showed potent in vitro inhibition of HER1 and HER2 in tumor cell
      lines. Mouse xenograft models of BT474 and HN5 cell lines also showed growth inhibition in a
      dose-responsive manner. In addition, GW572016 caused a reduction in HER1 and HER2
      autophosphorylation, indicating interference of this signaling pathway. GW572016 not only
      inhibited baseline activation of HER1 and HER2, but also has been shown to interrupt
      downstream activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases and Akt.

      We have completed the first single-agent neoadjuvant trastuzumab study in human breast
      cancer. The specific aims of this study were to firstly, define the clinical efficacy of
      trastuzumab, and secondly, to determine its mechanism of action in human breast cancer
      specimens. From September 1999 to June 2003, 27 patients with HER2 overexpressing locally
      advanced breast cancer with or without gross metastatic disease, were considered for a phase
      II study with neoadjuvant trastuzumab. At presentation, the median tumor size was large at
      8x8 cm2 (range 4x4 cm2 to 25x20 cm2). We did not expect measurable evidence of tumor
      regression with this short treatment duration. However, regression in the product of
      bidimensional tumor measurements with a median decrease of -20.0% (range 0, -60.4%, p=0.0001)
      was observed in primary tumors after only 3 weeks of single agent trastuzumab. Most
      surprisingly, partial response was observed in 26% (7/27). Minor response was seen in 44%
      (12/27), and stable disease in 30% (8/27). No tumors increased in size during this 3-week
      period.

      This is the first neoadjuvant trastuzumab monotherapy study in treatment-naive patients with
      HER2 overexpressing breast cancers. The clinical efficacy with tumor reductions in some
      patients presenting with large initial tumors indicates that the monoclonal antibody can be
      safely administered as a single agent without fear of tumor progression. When the study was
      first started, the uncertainty of the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant single agent
      trastuzumab limited its duration to 3 weeks. It seems likely that the true response rate
      would have been higher if therapy was continued for several months. Based on these data,
      longer treatment durations of HER2 targeted therapy, like with GW572016, given as a single
      agent should be investigated in clinical trials with careful monitoring of patients to assess
      its activity in this setting.

      Aim 1: To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of GW572016 when given as neoadjuvant therapy as
      a single agent in patients with treatment-naive, locally advanced HER2 overexpressing breast
      cancer. We aim to discover the true response rate to inhibiting HER1/2 signal transduction
      with GW572016 in breast cancer patients.

      Aim 2: To determine if GW572016 inhibits HER1 and HER2 signaling in situ.The mechanism of
      therapeutic action of GW572016 is not fully understood.
