    
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in up to 80
      sites in the United States of America (USA) and Canada to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      a fixed dose of SC BMT versus placebo on an as-needed basis under conditions of home use in
      premenopausal women with HSDD (with or without decreased arousal).

      The study will consist of 2 phases: (1) Core Study: 4-week no-treatment qualification period,
      a 4-week single-blind placebo treatment period (baseline), and a 24-week double-blind
      treatment period where participants will self-administer placebo or BMT 1.75 mg SC via an
      autoinjector; and (2) Extension Phase: a 52-week open-label treatment period during which all
      subjects will receive BMT 1.75 mg.

      Primary Objective

      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of bremelanotide (BMT), administered subcutaneously (SC) on an as
      needed basis for the treatment of HSDD (with or without decreased arousal) in premenopausal
      females.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of BMT in premenopausal women in the double-blind Core Study,
           as assessed by subject responses to questionnaires measuring sexual function, treatment
           satisfaction, and distress associated with sexual dysfunction.

        -  To evaluate the safety of BMT in premenopausal women in the double-blind Core Study.

        -  To evaluate the safety of long-term therapy with BMT in the open label Extension Phase.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of long-term therapy with BMT in the open-label Extension
           Phase.
