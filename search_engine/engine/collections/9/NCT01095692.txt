      incontinence. They are randomised within two groups : one group with pelvic organ prolapse
      surgery alone and one group with implantation of TOT together with prolapse surgery for
      prevention of stress urinary incontinence.TOT implantation is performed as described
      previously, while the pelvic organ prolapse surgery could either be of abdominal (open or
      laparoscopic) or vaginal approach. Eighty eight (88) patients will be enrolled at 3 sites
      centers.

      Visit I (J-2 months +/- 1 month) :

      During this visit the following will be performed :

        -  Collection of general medical, obstetric and surgical history of the patients

        -  Collection of incontinence, prolapse and sexual history with the following
           questionnaires :

             -  Standard Questionnaire

             -  PFIQ-7 : Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire

             -  PFDI-20 : Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short version Questionnaire

        -  Clinical examination that includes :

             -  a stress test in lithotomy position before and after reduction of prolapse with
                bladder filled with 250 cc of water. The reduction of prolapse will be performed
                manually and using a vaginal speculum. The results after both types of reduction
                will be recorded separately

             -  a Vaginal examination establishing the oestrogen status of patient's vagina and
                classification of prolapse using Baden Walker halfway method and modified ICS POP-Q
                system

             -  Urodynamic test that includes Uroflowmetry as follows :

             -  urethral pressure profile, maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) and Valsalva
                leak point pressure (VLPP) determination before and after reduction of prolapse
                manually

             -  Filling cystometry without reduction of prolapse Post void residual volume of urine
                will be recorded

             -  Explanation of the research protocol

        -  Total number of days of hospitalization

        -  Immediate complications (e.g perioperative hemorrhage requiring transfusion or not,
           urine retention requiring catheterisation)

        -  Postvoid residual volume of urine for all the patients by bladder scan

      Visit II (J 45 days +/- 15 days) :

      During this visit the following will be performed :

             -  PFIQ-7 : Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire

             -  PFDI-20 : Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short version Questionnaire

        -  Clinical examination including :

             -  Stress test in lithotomy position as of visit I

             -  Vaginal examination

             -  In case of prolapse, the modified ICS POP-Q and Baden Walker halfway method for
                quantification

      Visit III (J 6 months +/- 1 month) :

      During this visit the following will be performed :

             -  PFIQ-7 : Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire

             -  PFDI-20 : Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short version Questionnaire

             -  PISQ-12 : Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire
