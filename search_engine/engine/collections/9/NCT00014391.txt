      with or without palivizumab in patients with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia following
      stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the safety of these treatments in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior ribavirin exposure for this infection (24 hours or more vs
      less than 24 hours) and requirement for ventilator support (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive aerosolized ribavirin via
      face mask or oxygen tent over 2 hours 3 times daily or over 16-18 hours on days 1-10 and
      palivizumab IV 2 hours before ribavirin administration on day 1. Arm II: Patients receive
      aerosolized ribavirin as in arm I and placebo IV 2 hours before ribavirin administration on
      day 1. Patients are followed at 14, 21, and 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2 years.
