      to document the number of steps taken that day to establish an objective measurement of steps
      before the intervention began. In the intervention condition, after the baseline week, during
      weeks 2 to 5, this condition is prompted with an email each evening for four weeks to review
      their schedules for the following day and identify time slots where they could add activity.
      They are given instructions for providing a detailed calendar of appointments and open slots
      for the next day using a simple daily planner. The planning implementation intention
      manipulation involves recording specific information about when, where, and how they will add
      steps to their day. They are provided with maps near their home and work with specific
      information about distances, estimated time to walk between different points, and number of
      steps for specific routes to help them in planning for specific routes.The control condition
      is matched for how much contact they have with the research staff (called and emailed the
      same amount of times) and also wear the Fitbit daily. The only difference from the
      intervention group is that they do not get the daily planning instructions or maps for the
      implementation intention strategy treatment. All activity data from the Fitbit was
      deidentified and aggregated with an online platform called Fitabase.
