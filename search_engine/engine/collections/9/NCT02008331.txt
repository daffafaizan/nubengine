      be responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms and generation of p-cresol, a uremic toxin, that
      has been associated to CKD progression and cardiovascular mortality.

      This double blind randomized placebo controlled pilot study evaluates whether
      Probinul-neutro®, a synbiotic preparation that normalizes intestinal microflora, may lower
      plasma p-cresol concentrations and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in non-dialyzed CKD
      patients.

      Thirty patients on III-IV CKD stages were randomized to receive either Probinul neutro® or
      placebo for four weeks. Total plasma p-cresol concentrations was assessed at baseline, and 15
      and 30 days after treatment start. At the same study times, ease and frequency of defecation,
      upper and lower abdominal pain, stool shape, borborygmi and flatus were quantified by
      subjective assessment questionnaires.
