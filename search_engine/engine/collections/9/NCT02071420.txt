      workstations in combination with an ergonomic intervention and regular motivational emails
      (experimental group) against the ergonomic intervention and regular emails only (active
      control group) on occupational sedentary behavior over 16 weeks.

      Hypothesis: The addition of a seated active workstation will result in significant reductions
      in daily occupational sedentary time compared to the active control group.

      Secondary Aims: To compare the effects of the experimental group against the active control
      group on secondary measures of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, musculoskeletal
      discomfort, cognitive function and work productivity.

      Hypothesis 1: The experimental group will result in reduced cardiometabolic disease risk,
      musculoskeletal discomfort and work limitations compared to the active control group.
