      disorder is marked clinically by nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures and diurnal
      seizures consisting of simple partial seizures consisting of brief unilateral facial clonic
      activity, dysphasia, and drooling. The EEG abnormalities are unique, consisting of generally
      high amplitude, centrotemporal spikes that are activated by sleep. The seizures typically
      begin in the first decade and almost always stop by age 16 years. The seizures are usually
      infrequent although clusters of seizures do occur. When the physician elects to treat, the
      seizures are usually easily controlled. This is a randomized, open label, active controlled,
      multi-center based clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of Topiramate
      comparing with Carbamazepine in Benign rolandic epilepsy. The study hypothesis is that
      topiramate will be more effective in treatment of Benign rolandic epilepsy than
      Carbamazepine, as evaluated by seizure-free rate at 24 weeks and Intellectual Functioning :
      KEDI-WISC (Korean Educational Development Institute Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
      Children-Revised) and is generally well-tolerated.

      Topiramate (target dose) 4mg/kg/day, B.I.D, oral, for 24 weeks, carbamazepine(target dose)
      30mg/kg/day, B.I.D, oral, for 24 weeks.
