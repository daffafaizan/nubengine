      (PK-PD) study of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in pediatric subjects (age 2-17 years) who have had
      a recent kidney transplant, as well as during the stable renal transplant period when on a
      stable oral regimen of MPA. The primary objective of this study is to develop population
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models for mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mycophenolic
      acid glucuronide (MPAG) in order to improve individualized pediatric dosing. Subjects will
      have been receiving CellCept as part of their clinical standard of care. It is anticipated
      that the clinical portion of the study for each patient will be approximately six months post
      renal transplant with four study days: a screening visit pre-transplant, two 10-hour
      inpatient days at 2-3 and 6-9 days post-transplant, and one (up to 10 hour) outpatient visit
      at 3-6 months post-transplant. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements will be
      conducted at various time points (up to 9 hours post dose) on study days 2, 3, and 4. Safety
      data to be collected will include physical examinations, measurement of vital signs, and
      laboratory assessments, as well as data on adverse events and clinical outcomes.
