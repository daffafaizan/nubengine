      case per 2500 births. This pathology is the first diagnosis of abdominal cystic picture on
      the female fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy.Various complications of ovarian cysts
      have been described, such as ovarian torsion, breaking the cyst, hemorrhage intra cystic and
      compression of adjacent viscera. A conservative attitude for uncomplicated cysts is proposed
      in the literature but surgical care and / or puncture can be made to prevent the occurrence
      of complications and thus to protect ovarian tissue.However, no data on puberty and long-term
      ovarian prognosis in this disease is published in the literature. Without this information,
      no support for the recommendation of a prenatal ovarian cyst can be established formally.
