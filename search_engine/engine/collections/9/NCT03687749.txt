      Approximately 20% of women treated for breast cancer with axillary lymph node dissection will
      be diagnosed with lymphedema. Pre- and post-operatively, women are informed about changes
      suggestive of lymphedema and guided about seeking further assessment. The investigators
      presume that if symptoms occur, patients will seek assessment. However, it is unknown whether
      this is true or if those prospectively monitored present earlier for treatment, or whether
      other factors specifically drive patients to seek further assessment. Understanding the early
      experience and presentation of secondary lymphedema will improve patient education and
      detection programs.
