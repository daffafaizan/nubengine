      will collect data on interpretation time, recall rates, cancer detection rates, and interval
      cancer rates in dense breasts(â‰¥ 50% glandular density). If the interpretation time is less
      than 4X a routine read, and the recall rates have dropped < 30% of initial values, we will
      then conduct a study with larger numbers to better evaluate cancer detection rates and
      interval cancer rates.
