      poor psychosocial outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Interpersonal Psychotherapy for
      Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) has been found to be an effective treatment for reducing
      adolescents' depressive symptoms and improving their global and social functioning. The
      purpose of the current study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of IPT-A when it
      is delivered with greater and more structured involvement of the parents in the treatment.

      Participants will receive 15 weeks of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents
      and Parents (IPT-AP). Eight the therapy sessions are conducted with the adolescent
      individually, two are with the parent(s) individually, and five are conducted with the
      adolescent and parent(s) together. At the end of the 15 weeks, participants who have
      demonstrated at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms will participate in three
      booster sessions delivered on a monthly basis. All participants will be assessed at baseline,
      week 5, week 10, week 15 (post-treatment), and 3 months post-treatment to measure depressive
      symptoms, global and social functioning, and attitudes toward treatment.
