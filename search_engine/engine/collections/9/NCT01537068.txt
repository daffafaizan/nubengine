      continued response after open-label treatment at week 24 follow-up. It is important to
      establish the acute (12 week) efficacy of desvenlafaxine in non-major chronic depression.
      Also, given that non-major chronic depression is by definition chronic, it is important to
      demonstrate that benefit persists at follow-up assessment (24 weeks); this is clinically
      important in trying to alleviate the significant psychosocial morbidity associated with this
      disorder.

      The investigators believe this study will have significant value in the treatment of patients
      with non-major chronic depression, and will add significantly to what remains an extremely
      small scientific literature.

      The investigators would also like to study the effects of desvenlafaxine on brain structure
      and function. Learning that a medication reduces symptoms does not teach us how the
      medication achieves this outcome. Participants in this study can have the opportunity to
      participate in MRI scanning that will help to understand the mechanisms by with
      desvenlafaxine is effective. MRI scans are done prior to starting the clinical trial and then
      again after completing the double blind clinical trial.
