      7-Fr sheath is around 12%, compared to the previous studies of the Glidesheath Slender (see
      reference in the citations), the rate of radial artery occlusion was reported less than 5%.
      To prove Slender sheaths are superior to traditional ones, the sample size was estimated
      according to this, the class I error (α) is set as 0.05 on both sides, and the test
      efficiency (β) is set as 80%, then at least 248 patients are needed in each group.

      This study will be a prospective randomized, single-blinded (patient-blinded) study,
      comparing the rate of radial artery occlusion between the 7-Fr Glidesheath Slender (Terumo,
      Japan) and the standard 7-Fr radial sheath (cordis, USA) in patients undergoing complex
      transradial coronary intervention.

      The study will enroll patients who will undergo elective complex percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) via 7-Fr transradial approach at Fuwai Hospital National Center for
      Cardiovascular Diseases.

      A baseline clinical vascular & ultrasound assessment will be performed prior to the procedure
      to document patency of the radial artery.

      Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive the 7-Fr Terumo Glidesheath
      Slender versus the currently used 7-Fr sheath.

      The standard angiogram/ PCI will be performed as per usual practice. Following the PCI,
      clinical vascular assessment as well as an ultrasound will be performed prior to discharge.
