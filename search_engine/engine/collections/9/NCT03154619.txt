      effectiveness of TR 987 gel. It is a two-arm, design: One group will receive twice-weekly
      applications of 0.1% TR 987 in a gel base plus SoC for the first 4 weeks. The other group
      will receive twice-weekly applications of placebo gel base plus SoC for the same period of
      time. After 4 weeks, both groups will receive once weekly applications of their assigned
      treatment for the remaining 8 weeks of the trial. The Standard of Care therapy in this study
