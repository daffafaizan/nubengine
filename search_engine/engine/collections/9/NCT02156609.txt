      provide partial left ventricular circulatory support. The primary objective of this
      prospective, nonrandomized, multi-center, open-label trial is to assess the safety and
      performance of the HeartMate PHP in supporting patients who are hemodynamically unstable, or
      at risk of being hemodynamically unstable, while undergoing percutaneous coronary
      interventions (PCI).
