      had an epidural catheter, urinary catheter, two peripheral venous catheters and indwelling
      catheters in a jugular vein and radial artery. Body temperature was maintained using a Bair
      Hugger system (Arizant Healthcare Inc. Eden Prairie, Minnesota).

      The surgical procedure was performed using a subcostal bilateral incision and Olivier
      retractors to improve exposure. After dissection of the teres hepatis ligament, the liver was
      mobilized. Thereafter, an intra-operative ultrasound was performed to define the position of
      the tumour in relation to vascular and biliary structures. As IPM was not routinely applied,
      a patient was randomized for 15 minted IPM (15IPM) or 30 minutes IPM (30IPM) only after the
      surgeon had decided a complete Pringle manoeuvre would be required. During 15IPM or 30IPM,
      the complete portal triad was clamped using a rubber sling. The time of inflow occlusion was
      adapted to the need according to the randomization protocol. Occasionally, the left or right
      pedicle was ligated after protocolled IPM. Five minutes reperfusion intervals were applied
      during which transection was stopped and cut surfaces were gently compressed to ensure
      hemostasis. A Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA system 200 macrodissector,
      Cavitron Surgical Systems, Stamford, Connecticut) and Argon beam coagulation (Force GSU
      System, Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado) were used for liver transection. A stapler device or
      clamps were used for transection of the hepatic veins. Central venous pressure was maintained
      below 5 centimetre of water (cm H2O) during transection to reduce venous back-bleeding. After
      surgery, the weight of the resection specimen was recorded. Perioperative care was
      protocolled, as described earlier.
