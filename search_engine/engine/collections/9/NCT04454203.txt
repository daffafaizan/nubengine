      going down your leg will improve high blood pressure caused by the tourniquet.

      Depending on whether you enroll in this study, you may receive an injection of local
      anesthetic (numbing medication) or saline (salt water) by your femoral artery (the large
      artery going down your leg). This is to see how this injection impacts your blood pressure
      during surgery as the surgeons use a tourniquet (device that squeezes your leg) to help
      decrease the bleeding during surgery. Oftentimes the tourniquet causes your blood pressure to
      go up, but the numbing medication may help return your blood pressure close to its normal
      level. The rest of your anesthesia care, including other nerve blocks and general anesthetic,
      will be the same as it would be without participating in the study. You will be enrolled in
      this study for 24 hours.
