      (i.e. up to 3 years following the index event) management in patients hospitalized for an
      Acute Coronary Syndrome and pharmacological management patterns in a 'real-life' setting.

      The TOURACO observational study will include not only hospitals with cardiac intervention
      facilities but also regional and community-type hospitals that have limited (if at all)
      cardiac intervention facilities. The treatments prescription will be left to the investigator
      discretion, and will be used in accordance with the local label of each country. Off-label
      medication is not authorized in TOURACO study.
