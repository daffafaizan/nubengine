      and affects patients' activities of daily living. In other words, some patients without
      language or visuospatial dysfunction have severe impairment of activities of daily living,
      which might result from attention deficit. Another recent clinical study showed that
      galantamine is more effective in attention and vigilance of Alzheimer's disease patients than
      donepezil. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will improve attention and frontal
      executive function in Alzheimer's disease patients and is well-tolerated. 8 mg/day for the
      first 4 weeks, 16 mg for the next 8 weeks
