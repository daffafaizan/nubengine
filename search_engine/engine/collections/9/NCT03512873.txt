      consent ,they will be collected the initial lesions photos,the thickness of skin lesions by
      ultrasound and magnetic resonance,and chemical examinations including blood routine
      examination, routine urine test, liver function, renal function.During tranilast (0.1g each
      time, three times a day,6 months) treatment, patients need regular follow-up (1 per month)
      including liver and kidney function, blood glucose level monitoring, and every three months
      to retest lesion thickness.With 3 month as a time point, they were observed for two
      points.After the experiment, the experimental data will be arranged and the data of the
      thickness change of skin lesions will be statistically processed (t test) to determine
      whether it is meaningful.
