      heparin (UFH) or fondaparinux is allowed only within the 36 hours immediately preceding
      randomization. Randomization is performed as soon as the diagnosis of PE (and DVT if
      concomitant suspected symptomatic DVT) is confirmed.

      Allocation to treatment is done centrally by Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and
      stratified by (1) center, (2) intended treatment duration, ie, 3 months or 6 months. At
      randomization, the planned duration of treatment (3 or 6 months) is prespecified by the
      Investigator and determined on the assessment of risk of VTE recurrence. Participants are
      randomized to either idrabiotaparinux + placebo of warfarin, or warfarin + placebo of
      idrabiotaparinux, with an initial treatment of at least 5 days with enoxaparin in both
      treatment groups.

      Participants in the 3-month stratum have an additional 13-week observational period after
      cessation of study treatment. Participants in the 6-month stratum have a 13-week up to
      26-week observational period.
