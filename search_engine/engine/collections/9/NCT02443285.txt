      a contiguous source of infection.

      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and potentially fatal bacterial infection
      in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, occurring in 10 to 30% of patients, with in-hospital
      mortality rates ranging from 20 to 30% .

      It is secondary to impaired humoral and cellular immune responses that result in indirect
      intestinal bacterial translocation into the ascitic fluid .

      SBP is also associated with a poor long-term prognosis for patients, as mortality rates can
      reach 50 to 70% at 1 year .

      Early diagnosis and early optimal treatment of these infections with appropriate antibiotics
      and the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome with albumin are required .

      Current European and most other international guidelines recommend the use of a
      third-generation cephalosporin as the first choice, or amoxicillin-clavulanate acid or
      fluoroquinolones as an alternative choice.

      These recommendations are based mainly on clinical trials that were very often conducted a
      decade or more ago, and on the assumption that E. coli would be involved in nearly half of
      the cases.

      The microbial etiology of SBP remains relatively constant; however, the antibiotic resistance
      rate especially for third-generation cephalosporins (including cefotaxime and ceftazidime),
      ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin increased dramatically.
