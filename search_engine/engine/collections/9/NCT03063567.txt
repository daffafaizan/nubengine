      profile photographs of patients will be taken and facial measurement will be recorded
      including the height and width of the face and nose. Body Mass Index (BMI), Apnea Hypopnea
      Index (AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Score(ESS) will be recorded. Baseline symptoms of mouth
      breathing and nasal congestion will also be assessed. Patients will undergo a quick 5minute
      trial of the interfaces at CPAP setting of 6cm H2O and give feedback of their preferred
      interface and satisfaction of each interface (Visual analogue scale) at the end of the quick
      trial. Patients will then be given a one month trial of each of the 3 interfaces (nasal
      masks, oronasal masks, nasal cushions) in a randomised order. For purpose of standardisation
      to avoid confounders, humidification and auto-titrating CPAP (autoPAP) mode of ventilation
      will be used in all patients. The brand of interfaces and CPAP devices used will also be
      standardised. This standardised CPAP treatment will be provided free of charge to patients
      during the duration of the study (3 months). The patients' subjective perception of each of
      the interface will be assessed with a visual analogue scale to assess level of satisfaction.
      Patients will nominate their preferred interface at the end of the trial. The amount of leak
      and the hours of adherence to CPAP for each type of interface will also be analysed by
      downloading data from the CPAP devices. A multinomial logistic regression analysis will then
      be done to look for facial measurements and factors that will predict the interface that
      patients will be most satisfied with.
