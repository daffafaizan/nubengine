      changes in intestinal and nasopharyngeal microbiome on treated children and untreated
      household contacts. The investigators hypothesize that a short course of antibiotics will
      lead to decreased bacterial diversity shortly after completion of the antibiotic course, and
      higher probability of identification of bacterial resistance genes in rectal and
      nasopharyngeal samples. The investigators hypothesize that a 5-day course of antibiotics
      (azithromycin, amoxicillin, or co-trimoxazole) will lead to significantly decreased
      intestinal and nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity among children aged 6-59 months.

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the effect of treatment with antibiotics on microbiome diversity in
      children aged 6-59 months following a 5-day course of antibiotics.

      Specific Aim 1A. Determine the direct effect of a 5-day course of azithromycin, amoxicillin,
      or co-trimoxazole on intestinal and nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity in children aged 6-59
      months compared to no treatment.

      Specific Aim 1B. Determine the indirect effect of antibiotic treatment of children in a
      household on intestinal and nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity in an untreated child aged
      6-59 months.

      Specific Aim 1C. Assess the association between intestinal bacterial diversity and
      anthropometry in a population-based sample of children.
