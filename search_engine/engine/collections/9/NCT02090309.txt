      emergency department following a motor vehicle accident and will be found eligible will be
      asked to participate in the study. Following an informed consent the recruited patients will
      be randomly divided into a study group or a control group. From all the participants a volume
      of 5 milliliter of peripheral blood will be withdrawn for cortisol concentration
      determination prior to the study intervention. After withdrawing the blood sample patients
      will receive a single bolus of intravenous Hydrocortisone 100 milligram (study group) or
      normal saline (0.9%) at a similar volume to that of the study drug, 5 ml (control group).
      Patients will be otherwise receiving the regular management of a trauma patient. The enrolled
      patients will fill simple, short questionnaires including demographic data, neck disability
      index, (NDI), numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Tampa scale for kinesiophobia (TSK-11), PTSD
      questionnaire (PDA), and will be assessed by the treating physician for the degree of
      whiplash (WAD 0-4).

      The patients will be followed-up by one of the investigators for a period of 6 months. In
      each visit the patient will be assessed again by the above mention tools.

      Sample size: 45 patients in each arm. Blinding and randomization: triple blinding and using a
      randomization software. Statistical assessment will be performed to identify differences of
      developing WAD (whiplash associated disorder) between patients who had an admission low level
      of cortisol compared with those who had a high or normal level, and also between patients who
      received hydrocortisone compared to those who received placebo.
