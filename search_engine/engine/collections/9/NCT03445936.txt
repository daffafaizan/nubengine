      both biological and synthetic mesh in this context is scarce and no randomized controlled
      trials comparing meshes exist.

      The aim of this study is to compare Parietene Macro and Permacol in prevention of incisional
      site hernia after temporary loop-ileostomy reversal after anterior resection and TME for
      rectal cancer.
