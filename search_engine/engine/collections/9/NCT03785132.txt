      surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Median performance error (MDPE), median
      absolute performance error (MDAPE), and wobble of MAP were calculated using preoperative MAP
      as the reference value, and MBPs before, during and after the bypass as measured values.
      Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed using PM parameters
      to predict in-hospital mortality. Survival after cardiac surgery was compared using the Cox
      proportional hazard model. Predictability of PM was assessed using the area under the
      receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
