      infections are often caused by PA. Treatment with antibiotics is used to reduce the presence
      of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given orally, intravenously, or inhaled as a mist.
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether AZLI, an investigational formulation of the
      antibiotic aztreonam, is safe in repeated courses in patients with CF and PA.

      A course of AZLI treatment in this study comprised 28 days, followed by a 28-day period off
      treatment. Participants could receive up to 9 courses of AZLI, with a total time on study of
      up to 18 months. Safety and efficacy results for the 18-month, 9-course period are reported,
      with efficacy results presented on a by-treatment course basis.
