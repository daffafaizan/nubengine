      children and adults. Earlier treatment substantially reduces the likelihood of developing
      complications later in life while concurrently improving quality of life and decreasing
      mortality. Therefore, it is essential to develop safe and effective therapeutic strategies
      for weight loss, particularly in adolescents. Oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic peptide hormone
      that regulates energy balance, is a novel neuroendocrine weight-loss therapeutic in adults
      with obesity because it simultaneously reduces energy intake and increases energy expenditure
      and is well-tolerated. Data are currently lacking regarding effects of OXT administration in
      adolescents with obesity.

      The current study is a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of OXT vs. placebo in
      12-18-year old adolescents with obesity. We hypothesize that OXT administration will decrease
      weight as a consequence of decreased caloric intake and increased energy expenditure, both
      partially mediated by reduced hypothalamic inflammation (such inflammation drives weight gain
      by increasing food intake and reducing energy expenditure). Further, OXT will improve
      metabolic risk markers, such as visceral and intrahepatic fat, systemic inflammation, and
      serum lipids.
