    
      This is a prospective, phase II, randomized, interventional, monocentric study. Data of
      consecutive patients with DME who volunteered to participate in the research at the
      department of ophthalmology of State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) - Brazil between May
      2016 and December 2017 were analysed.

      At the screening visit, all patients underwent complete ophthalmic evaluation, including best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, fundus
      biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography (Visucam NM/ FA Carl Zeiss; Carl Zeiss Meditec,
      California, USA), SD- OCT (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Central
      macular thickness was obtained through 7 horizontal lines ( 30° x 5° area), centered on the
      fovea, with 1536 A scans per line at 240 µm intervals.

      At the baseline study visit, patients were randomized with a 1:1:1 allocation to receive
      dexamethasone solution 4 mg/ml: 0,01 ml (40 µg) ; or 0,03 ml (120 µg); or 0,05 ml (200 µg).
      In follow up visits (1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days after) were performed BCVA, slit-lamp
      biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, fundus biomicroscopy, SD- OCT.
