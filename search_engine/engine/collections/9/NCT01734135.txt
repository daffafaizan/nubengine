    
      Rationale: B type natriuretic peptide is known to be elevated (> 100 pg/ml) in patients with
      heart failure. Furthermore, treatments are available to improve survival and reduce
      hospitalization if the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is < 40%. Accordingly,
      guidelines recommend an LVEF measure for patients with suspected heart failure. Prior work
      has demonstrated that patients with high BNP values do not always have a measure of left
      ventricular ejection.

      Hypothesis: A reminder to patients with BNP and no imaging may prompt providers to order
      appropriate imaging potentially leading to 1) identification of unsuspected depressed
      ejection fraction and 2) more appropriate treatment.
