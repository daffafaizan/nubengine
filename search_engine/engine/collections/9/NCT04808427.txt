      Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors estimated at
      2 to 4 years.

      Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to pose
      little risk to the life or health of the host. Recent patient series suggest that 20% to 30%
      of men undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy
      specimen consistent with an insignificant or "indolent" cancer which poses little threat to
      life or health.

      We propose that participants with low volume and low grade disease can be best served with
      focal ablation of the visible prostate cancer without the side effects of urinary
      incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with radiation therapy or radical surgery.

      Focal Therapy for prostate cancer has gained popularity however prior studies demonstrate a
      failure rate as high as 50% with a laser.

      Objective:

      To determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided ultrasound-induced
      thermal therapy of biopsy-confirmed and MRI visible, prostate tumor(s) using the TULSA
      Thermal Therapy System (Profound Medical)

      Eligibility:

      Subjects with prostate cancer, amenable for ultrasound ablation

      Organ confined clinical T1c or clinical T2a prostate cancer, visible on MRI, and confirmed by
      prostate biopsy

      Adequate organ and marrow function

      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/ml

      Age >=18 years

      Design:

      Study testing feasibility and tolerability of ultrasound ablation of focal prostate cancer.

      It is anticipated that 15 participants will be accrued for this study.
