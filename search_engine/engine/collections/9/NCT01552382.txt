      (circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D) with MACCE (major cardiac or cerebrovascular event) in
      cardiac surgical patients. The occurrence of several postoperative adverse events such as
      myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome, stroke and in-hospital death will be
      assessed from cardiac surgery to discharge. Approximately 4,500 data sets from January 2010
      until the end of 2011 will be analyzed.In all patients, we will also assess the association
      of vitamin D status with the duration of mechanical ventilatory support and intensive care
      unit stay from cardiac surgery to discharge. Moreover, in-hospital stay will be assessed
      according to vitamin D status.
