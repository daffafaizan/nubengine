    
      This study will be a within-subject, random order, double-blind cross-over study with
      standard clinical and neuropsychological ratings. Duration is 13 weeks per subject. Clinical
      assessments including mood ratings will be performed weekly. Instructions and practice on the
      use of the spray will be given under supervision during a 2-week run-in period before
      baseline. Patients can control the dosage of cannabinoids according to their symptoms by
      administering up to a maximum of 48 pump-controlled sprays per day. Patients will be asked to
      abstain from using cannabis (other than the study drug) during the study. Patients will be
      treated for 4 weeks with either the sublingual THC:CBD spray or placebo spray. This will be
      followed by a 2-week washout period before another 4 weeks of treatment with whichever study
      medication was not initially used. Neurocognitive testing will be performed 3 times during
      the study. A mood diary will be completed daily by each patient at home.
