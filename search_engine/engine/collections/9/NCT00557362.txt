      and natamycin. There has been only a single randomized trial of anti-fungal therapy for
      fungal ulcers and no new medications have been approved by the FDA since the 1960s. There are
      studies that indicate that the newer triazoles, such as voriconazole, are more effective in
      vitro against filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus spp., a common cause of fungal
      keratitis1-3. Despite a number of case reports and in vitro studies, there has been no
      systematic attempt to determine whether it is more or less effective clinically than
      natamycin, the only commercially available FDA-approved agent. There is little data available
      for physicians to make an informed, evidence-based decision on choice of antifungal.

      We evaluated whether voriconazole is a superior treatment to natamycin for filamentous fungal
      keratitis in a randomized, masked, controlled trial. This is a therapeutic exploratory study
      to investigate the safety and feasibility of conducting a larger study and to generate
      preliminary data. The primary outcome is visual acuity at 3 months from enrollment. A subset
      of patients will be followed at 4 years from enrollment.
