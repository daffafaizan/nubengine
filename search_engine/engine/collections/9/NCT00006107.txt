        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when administered with concurrent
           boost radiotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
           neck previously treated with induction chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also undergo
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks followed by radiotherapy
      alone twice daily for 2 weeks.

      Upon completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients not achieving complete response to induction
      chemotherapy undergo neck surgical dissection at 4-12 weeks following completion of
      radiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
