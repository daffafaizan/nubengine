      biosensor monitoring (ABM)(WrisTAS) for patients with Alcohol Associated Liver Disease (AALD)
      who intend to stop drinking. All participants will wear the ABM device but participants will
      be randomized to receive either personalized feedback on the data recorded on the device
      (n=30) or enhanced usual care without feedback on device data (n=30). The investigators will
      determine whether ABM plus feedback improves outcomes for AALD patients compared to enhanced
      usual care and hypothesize ABM feedback will reduce alcohol consumption, improve motivation
      and self-efficacy for abstinence and improve engagement in treatment. The investigators will
      also conduct research including qualitative data collected from participants who will provide
      opinions on ABM feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Qualitative methods are especially
      useful for understanding the perceived needs, barriers, and preferences for monitoring
      alcohol use and are especially required for future translation of this technology into
      clinical practice.
