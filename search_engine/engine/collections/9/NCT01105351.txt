      B12 on folate forms in relation to polymorphisms in folate catabolising enzymes in elderly
      people. Our hypothesis is that differences in folate forms after folic acid supplementation
      might be due to polymorphisms in folate catabolising enzymes. Therefore, folic acid might be
      retained by people with certain genotypes.
