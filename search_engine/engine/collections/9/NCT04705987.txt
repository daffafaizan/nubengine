      A secondary objective is to attain a greater clinical stability, in terms of reduction of new
      HF decompensations and need for diuretics, and symptoms improvement. The calculated
      population size is 278 patients. Follow-up visits will be carried out at discharge, 7 days, 4
      weeks and 8 weeks after the hospital discharge. The potential of the study is very high given
      the high prevalence and clinical impact of HF hospitalizations, together with the absence of
      specific treatment for this phase of the disease. Therefore, in case of a positive result,
      this would mean a huge clinical, social and health benefits, as well as being an important
      therapeutic progress.
