      central pharmacodynamic activity of TAK-653 using TMS. The study will enroll approximately 24
      participants to yield 22 participants that complete treatment periods 1, 2, and 3.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 sequences to receive TAK-653 0.5 mg low
      dose or TAK-653 6 mg high dose or Placebo in double-blind treatment periods 1, 2, and 3,
      followed by Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in open-label Treatment period 4.

      All participants will receive one dose of TAK-653 (0.5 or 6 mg), or Placebo or Ketamine on
      Day 1 of each treatment period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 15 weeks. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic. A
      washout period of minimum 10 days will be maintained between the doses in treatment periods 1
      to 3. Follow-up phone call will be made on Day 14.
