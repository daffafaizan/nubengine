      establish a research network as infrastructure for future research. This project includes an
      observational cohort study to assess (1) the feasibility of screening, enrollment rates,
      baseline disease categorization and follow-up of CASH using common data elements at multiple
      sites, (2) the reliability of imaging biomarkers including quantitative susceptibility
      mapping and permeability measures which have been shown to correlate with lesion activity,
      and (3) the rates of recurrent hemorrhage and change in functional status and biomarker
      measurements during prospective follow-up.
