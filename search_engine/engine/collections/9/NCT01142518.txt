      first-choice treatment. In previous clinical studies, the interferon-beta 1a (Rebif) used
      within the scope of this PMS study has demonstrated significant efficacy in all aspects of
      treatment - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, relapse rate, progression of disability of
      MS. The PRISMS-4 study demonstrated that treatment with Rebif reduces the frequency and
      severity of clinical relapses over 4 years and slows the progression of disability.

      In the course of treatment escalation according to the Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensus
      Gruppe (MSTKG) guidelines, MS subjects with correspondingly high disease activity were
      predominantly put on mitoxantrone. The duration of treatment is on principle limited by a
      cumulative lifelong total dose of 140 mg/m2 body surface area, which may not be exceeded due
      to the known cardiologic adverse effects. If the cumulative mitoxantrone maximum dose is
      reached and if the subject is in a stable condition, the question of further treatment
      options presents itself. One possibility is the so-called 'deescalation', that is, the return
      to immunomodulating baseline treatment.

      Currently there is an increasing number of subjects who are in this phase of the disease and
      are eligible for corresponding treatment decisions.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To systematically investigate the safety, benefit and course of Rebif (44 Î¼g x 3
           ),treatment in a larger number of subjects and to subject these data to standardized
           analysis
