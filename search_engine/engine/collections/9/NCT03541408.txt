      factors will be completed. The objective is to see if delirium incidences are significantly
      lower in the group that receives a preventative delirium protocol compared to a control
      group, while not increasing other adverse undesirable side effects. We hypothesize that a
      preventative delirium protocol will reduce the incidence of delirium compared to the control
      group (primary outcome), but this protocol may lead to increased side effects such as PONV,
      poor pain control, and increased awareness (secondary outcomes).
