      malignancies, clinical trials targeting solid cancers have achieved limited efficacy. One
      important reason is due to lack of ideal cancer antigens. NY-ESO-1 is expressed in various
      types of cancers, including neuroblastoma, hepatoma, myeloma, melanoma, esophagus, prostate,
      bladder, breast and ovarian cancers. While, in normal somatic tissues, NY-ESO-1 expression is
      restricted to the germline cells, which lack HLA molecules and cannot present peptides
      derived from NY-ESO-1 for recognition by T cells. Therefore, NY-ESO-1 specific T cells will
      only recognize and kill NY-ESO-1-expressing cancer cells, but not normal cells, thus avoiding
      induction of autoimmune reaction. With these unique features, NY-ESO-1 has been selected as
      an attractive tumor antigen candidate for cancer immunotherapy in various clinical trials.

      In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting
      NY-ESO-1 will be infused back to patients with NY-ESO-1- expressing malignancies after they
      receive a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen. The patients will be monitored after
      infusion of anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR-transduced T cells for adverse events, persistence of
      anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR-transduced T cells and treatment efficacy.

      Primary objectives:

      To determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced
      T cells in patients with HLA-A2+ NY-ESO-1-expressing malignancies.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine if the treatment can result in clinical regression of malignant tumors in the
      patients.

      To determine the in vivo persistency of the anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR-transduced T cells.
