      control patients exposed to an audiovisual "sham" intervention. Investigators will select up
      to 120 hospitalized patients at CSMC admitted during the study period of November 2016 to
      September 2017. The inpatient wards serve patients ranging in age from 18 to over 100,
      allowing us to assess the feasibility of using VR across diverse age groups. Appropriate
      inpatients will be selected at random by Dr. Rosen or other authorized co-investigators or
      study staff, who will obtain relevant clinical variables from the EHR. All patients admitted
      to the hospital will be considered for the study. The location and identity of the inpatient
      will be relayed by their attending physician to a member of the study team, who will deliver
      a randomly selected intervention (either VR or Health and Wellness Channel) to the patient
      the same day (at the patient's discretion). The patient will continue usage as needed for up
      to 20 days of the hospital stay. VR Interventions include both relaxing environment and
      engaging games. The Health and Wellness Channel includes some of the same types of content,
      but it is delivered passively through the in-room television system. Investigators will
      examine changes in pain level, length of stay, medication requests (amount and timing),
      Quality of Life, Functioning, and Patient Satisfaction.
