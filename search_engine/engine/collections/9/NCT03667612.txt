      endothelium in a population of breast cancer where the infiltrate in immune cells is
      precisely likely to play a leading role. This retrospective cohort of 250 to 300 cases
      treated with adjuvant and neoadjuvant will be immunologically characterized using the
      recommendations of Salgado et al., that a multicentric team of pathologists will take
      ownership. This evaluation will be counter-appraised.

      Once our cohort is immunologically characterized, our project will focus on better
      understanding the endothelial mechanisms involved: which cells? immunophenotyping of immunity
      cells. By which vessels? (measurement of densities in blood and lymphatic vessels, density in
      HEV). By what mechanisms? Do the actors identified in vitro within the Inca project have an
      in vivo translation
