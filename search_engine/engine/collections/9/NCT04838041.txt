      imatinib (maximum dose of 400 mg PO once daily) in the combination treatment phase. The
      BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that will be used for this trial is imatinib. All
      eligible patients will begin asciminib in combination with imatinib on cycle 1 day 1 of the
      combination phase. They will continue combination therapy for a total of 12 cycles (minimum
      of 12 months). Each cycle will be ~28 days. At the end of 12 cycles asciminib will be
      discontinued and any patient who has met the criteria for the treatment-free remission (TFR)
      screening phase will enter into the TFR phase. Once in the TFR phase, patients will
      discontinue their imatinib and be monitored off treatment. The primary endpoint of this study
      is the 12-month "second" TFR rate after completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy.
      Patients will remain in the TFR phase of the study for up to three years and will have
      central polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during the first two years. Therefore, the
      total duration of the subject participation trial will be approximately five years (one year
      on combination treatment phase plus three years in the TFR phase plus one year of long-term
      follow-up post TFR or early discontinuation.
