    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase II study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of PTK-ZK in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma
      who do not qualify for surgical resection:

        -  progressive locoregionary disease not to be controlled by surgical measures

        -  distant metastasis other than brain metastasis not eligible for surgical resection or
           radiotherapy All patients will be treated with PTK-ZK 1250mg administered orally once a
           day for treatment cycles of 28 days. In case of unacceptable toxicity the dose can be
           reduced to 1000 mg and further on to 750 mg daily.

      Patients in Arm B additionally receive intravenous DTIC 850mg/mÂ² on day 1 of each cycle.

      After informed consent is given by the patient a biopsy from a metastasis should be taken
      before the first intake of study medication and at the end of cycle 2 to specify markers of
      angiogenesis and MVD (Micro vessel density).
