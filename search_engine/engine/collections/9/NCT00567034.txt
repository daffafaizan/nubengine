      but its (and other SGA's) side effects contribute to the development of obesity and to the
      "Metabolic Syndrome." Both conditions, which are more prevalent even in unmedicated
      schizophrenic patients, are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      The mechanisms of these side effects are likely to be multifactorial and to involve
      peripheral and central factors alike. The present proposal asks a fundamental question: How
      the endogenous opioidergic systems are involved in Zyprexa-induced obesity and in related
      metabolic disturbances. We further hypothesize that if the excess of central opioid activity
      creates metabolic problems for patients, it is reasonable to expect amelioration of the
      symptoms through blockade of opioid receptors. The proposed project is designed to test this
      hypothesis by complimenting clinical psychopharmacology with pain medicine research and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to empirically measure clinical outcomes of
      Zyprexa pharmacotherapy augmentation with the opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone. Our
      objectives and hypotheses are as follows: to determine the effects of naltrexone on weight
      gain, metabolic (e.g., cholesterol, lipids, insulin, leptin and glucose levels),
      anthropometric and nutritional characteristics in Zyprexa treated schizophrenic patients, to
      examine the effects of naltrexone on subjective pain ratings, and to investigate the safety
      and tolerability of naltrexone in Zyprexa-treated schizophrenic patients.
