      software as a navigation aid in surgery. The surgical technique for the intervention group
      corresponds to the established standard method. It is identical to the control intervention
      except for the step where pedicle screws or rod implants are instrumented.

      The surgeon wears the hardware component during the entire surgery. He proceeds
      conventionally up to the point where navigation of pedicle screws and rod implants with is
      required.
