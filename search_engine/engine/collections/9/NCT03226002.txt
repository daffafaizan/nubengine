      years of age undergoing maxillofascial, oral and double chin surgery to determine which
      nostril is more suitable for nasotracheal intubation with nasotracheal Airtraq. In addition
      is the 90Â° anti-clockwise rotation of the tip of the tube helpful to insert the tube into the
      trachea. Patients were randomized into right and the left nostril groups. After standard
      anesthesia induction with propofol and fentanyl, rocuronium was used for muscle relaxation.
      Primary aim of this prospective study was to compare the glottis visualization time,
      intubation time and total intubation times. The Cormack-Lehane grades, the need for
      optimization, tube adjustment maneuvers, hemodynamic data, occurrence of epistaxis of the
      patients were recorded during the process.
