      for one week. Phase A is designed to assess for safety and tolerability. In Phase B of this
      research study, we will compare the L-CL to placebo. Patients will be randomized to one of 2
      groups. Subjects in Group 1 will receive the contact lens with latanoprost in it (latanoprost
      contact lens, or "L-CL") and placebo eye drops. Subjects in Group 2 will receive a standard,
      commercial contact lens (or "C-CL) that contains no latanoprost but will be given latanoprost
      eye drops. The placebo contact lens (C-CL) is highly similar to the latanoprost-eluting
      contact lens but contains no latanoprost. The placebo eye drops look just like latanoprost
      eye drops but contain no latanoprost.
