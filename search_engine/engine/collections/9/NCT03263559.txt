    
      This study is designed as a Phase II multi-center trial to determine the feasibility of
      achieving a high rate of event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years post transplant using
      pre-conditioning hydroxyurea (HU) with a conditioning regimen that consists of a combination
      of Thymoglobulin/Cyclophosphamide/Fludarabine/Thiotepa with post-grafting high-dose
      cyclophosphamide in patients with severe SCD who have HLA-haploidentical donors. EFS is
      defined as survival without a qualifying event. This is a single arm study in which
      participants will be enrolled into one of two strata. The first stratum will be restricted to
      children who have stroke and 40 children will be enrolled in this stratum. The second stratum
      will consist of adult patients with severe sickle cell disease and 40 participants will be
      enrolled in this stratum.
