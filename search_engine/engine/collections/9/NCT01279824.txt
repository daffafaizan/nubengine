      sub-acute rehabilitation facility. Subjects will be clinically screened for dysphagia, and
      randomized into three groups, NMES, sham NMES or usual care -behavioral swallowing therapy
      arm. Following randomization, all subjects will undergo a video-x-ray (modified barium
      swallow) of swallowing to confirm the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide
      objective data about the nature and degree of dysphagia. All patients will be treated for one
      hour per day for 3 weeks, and their progress and outcome will be recorded. Participants will
      be independently evaluated by a blinded assessor at baseline, post treatment and at 3 months
      following treatment. The primary outcome will be improvement in clinical swallowing ability,
      oral intake level, and body weight. The results will add to the preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of this form of swallowing treatment for patients following stroke.
