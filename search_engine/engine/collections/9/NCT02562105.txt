      ventilation is frustrating. The needed life support measures drain much of health resources
      and add a significant burden on the patient's family. Many factors have been responsible for
      the high mortality rates among hematologic cancer patients admitted to intensive care unit.
      Among of these factors, the invasive treatments that are frequently employed in today's
      intensive care unit. These procedures give chance for development of severe infection and
      multiple organ failure which are common events in immune-compromised patients (e.g.
      neutropenia) and in those exposed to chemotherapy. The most common form of organ failure in
      those patients is acute respiratory failure which is a major predictor of mortality in that
      population. The prognosis of such failure may vary depending on its causes and severity, co
      morbidity, associated acute organ failure and characters of the underlying malignancy. After
      the recent advances in the field of intensive care and shedding light on the benefits of the
      noninvasive ventilation in immune-compromised patients, the overall survival rate of cancer
      patients admitted to intensive care unit are improving.
