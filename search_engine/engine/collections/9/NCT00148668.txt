      surgeon can locate the site of the tumor. During clip placement, tissue biopsy will be taken
      of the tumor. One to two weeks after the first dose of herceptin another biopsy will be
      performed.

      Patients will be placed into one of 2 arms.

        -  Arm 1 receives 12 weeks of herceptin and navelbine. Arm 2 receives 4 cycles of
           taxotere/carboplatin/herceptin.

        -  Arm 2 participants will also receive neulasta (growth factor support) on day 2 of each
           cycle.

      Phase A of Arm 1 is one dose of herceptin followed by an MRI of the affected breast and a
      second biopsy 1-2 weeks following this dose. Phase B of Arm 1 begins on week 3 and ends on
      week 14 and involves weekly injections of herceptin and navelbine. Surgery will take place a
      minimum of 3 weeks after the patients last dose of herceptin and navelbine.

      Phase A of Arm 2 is one dose of herceptin followed by an MRI of the affected breast and
      second biopsy 1-2 weeks following this dose. Phase B of Arm 2 begins on week 3 and ends on
      week 14 and involves herceptin weekly, taxotere and carboplatin every 3 weeks. Surgery will
      take place a minimum of 3 weeks after the patients last dose of herceptin, taxotere and
      carboplatin.

      Blood tests will be performed every 3 weeks during pre-operative treatment and every 6 months
      after surgery.
