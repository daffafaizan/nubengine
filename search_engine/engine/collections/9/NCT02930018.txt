    
      Trial Objectives:

      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of the neuroprotectant, Nerinetide, in
      reducing global disability in subjects with major acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with a small
      established infarct core and with good collateral circulation selected for rapid endovascular
      revascularization.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of Nerinetide in:

        -  Reducing functional dependence

        -  Improving neurological outcome

        -  Improving activities of daily living

        -  Reducing mortality rate The leading safety objectives are to determine the effect of
           administering a dose of 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous (IV)
           infusion of Nerinetide to subject with acute stroke who are selected for endovascular
           revascularization on serious adverse events (SAEs) and 90-day mortality.

      Trial Design:

      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, single-dose design. Subjects harboring an acute ischemic stroke and who are selected
      for endovascular revascularization in accordance with local institutional practices and who
      harbor a small established infarct core and with good collateral circulation will be given a
      single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of Nerinetide (NA-1) or
      placebo as soon as they are deemed to have met the enrollment criteria and with the intention
      of starting administration within 30 minutes of randomization. The randomization will be by
      stochastic minimization to balance baseline factors.
