      difficulties, in the absence of intellectual disability, neurological or psychiatric
      disorder, uncorrected sensory disturbance (sight, hearing) or an educational deficiency.

      Dyslexia appears in the child from the earliest stages of learning in the form of a
      difficulty in mastering the learning of reading. This disorder is manifested by a generally
      hesitant reading, slowed down, full of errors, requiring a lot of effort for the child and
      may impact his reading comprehension. The dyslexia-related deficiency is of variable
      intensity depending on the individual; it may be accompanied by calculus disorders
      (dyscalculia), oral language (dysphasia), motor coordination (dyspraxia) or attention
      disorders with or without hyperactivity. In nearly 40% of cases, a child affected by Dys
      disorders presents several learning disorders.

      To date, the causes of dyslexia are not yet clearly established. The wide variety of symptoms
      and disorders associated with dyslexia does not facilitate the identification of precise
      neurobiological / psycho cognitive mechanisms. There are therefore several theories:
      phonological, visual, temporal, cerebellar or proprioceptive auditory processing.

      Recently, following work published in 2017, an anatomical cause based on Maxwell's spots
      could also be a cause of dyslexia.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new medical device to compensate this probable
      anatomical cause.
