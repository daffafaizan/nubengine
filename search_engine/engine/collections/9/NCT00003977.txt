        -  Evaluate alternating vaccination with lipidated human papillomavirus 16 E7 peptide
           (HPV-16 E7) and autologous dendritic cells pulsed with immunogenic HPV-16 E7 in terms of
           toxicity, immunologic reactivity, and therapeutic efficacy in patients with recurrent or
           persistent cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dendritic cell-human papillomavirus 16 E7 (HPV-16
      E7) peptide vaccine.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for activation to
      dendritic cells on days 0 and 28. Patients receive lipidated HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine
      subcutaneously on days 1 and 14 and dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 7 and 21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or complete or partial response may
      receive one additional treatment course, beginning 6 weeks after the end of the first course.

      Cohorts of 3-9 patients receive escalating doses of dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine.
      The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      A parallel cohort of patients receives dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 7 and 14, but does not receive lipidated HPV-16 E7 peptide.

      Patients are followed at one week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 27 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 15
      patients per year.
