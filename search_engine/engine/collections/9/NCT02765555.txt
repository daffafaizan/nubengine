    
      Twelve subjects with stable schizophrenia will be enrolled. The expected duration of
      participation is 88 days which includes at least a 2 days screening and an 85 day treatment
      period (15 -day inpatient stay in the clinical unit and an additional 70-day outpatient
      period, including the Day 85 end of study follow up or early termination visit. Visits will
      occur approximately weekly during the outpatient period.

      Neurological and clinical symptom assessments (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS],
      Clinical Global Impressions-Schizophrenic Specific [CGI-SCH], Simpson-Angus Scale [SAS],
      Barnes Akathisia Scale [BAS], and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]) will be
      conducted at screening, on the day of admission to the clinical unit (Day -1), and at each
      post-dose visit throughout the study including the follow-up visit. Scale results will be
      reviewed by the Principal Investigator. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for
      Tardive Dyskinesia will be performed at screening and at each post-dose visit throughout the
      study including the end of study follow-up visit. CYP-2D6 genotyping will be conducted at
      screening. Tolerability will be measured using SAS, which will be conducted as described
      above.

      Blood samples to assess the PK parameters will be taken from pre-dose until approximately 84
      days post-dose.

      End of study procedures will be conducted on follow-up Day 85 (84 days post-dose) or early
      termination (ET) to assess any adverse events (AEs) that were ongoing at the last visit, any
      new AEs that have developed, and for measurement of safety parameters.
