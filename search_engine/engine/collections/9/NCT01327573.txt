      kidney transplant recipients who have developed de novo DSA, have deteriorating graft
      function, yet have no established treatment alternative.

      This is a randomized, open-label, pilot intervention trial. Post transplant patients with
      deteriorating renal function (defined as 20% reduction in GFR) will be screened for the
      development of DSA and biopsied for the presence of C4d deposition. All patients with DSA and
      those meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo protocol renal biopsy and will be
      assessed for C4d deposition. Participants will be randomized to treatment with eculizumab
      plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC only. Randomization will be stratified by C4d status
      (C4d+/C4d-) with 10 subjects (7 eculizumab, 3 SOC only) in each stratum.

      Eculizumab is an antibody that has been developed to inhibit the complement protein C5.
      Eculizumab will be delivered via IV according to the following schedule:

        -  Eculizumab Induction 600mg IV every 7 days for 4 doses

        -  Eculizumab 900mg IV 7 days later

        -  Eculizumab Maintenance 900mg IV every 14 days for total of 26 weeks
