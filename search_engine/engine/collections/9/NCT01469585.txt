      28 days without a seven day placebo week to avoid hormonal withdrawal bleeding.
      Unfortunately, with continuous administration, timed, regular bleeding can be replace by
      irregular, unscheduled bleeding, which often leads to dissatisfaction, discontinuation and
      the possibility of unplanned pregnancy.

      Matrix Metalloproteinases, a group of zinc-dependant proteases, are hypothesized to play a
      role in endometrial degradation. The purpose of this study is to describe the expression of
      Matrix Metalloproteinases in endometrial biopsy specimens collected 1) prior to initiating
      oral contraceptives 2) while taking cyclic oral contraceptive 3) while taking continuous oral
      contraceptives and 4) while taking continuous oral contraceptives along with
      sub-antimicrobial doxycycline.
