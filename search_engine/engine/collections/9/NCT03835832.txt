      HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre and Taksin Hospital. Research
      team/investigator/nurse/professional health care workers will assess whether the reading of
      TST test between the participants and the nurses are the same or not. The investigator and
      team believe that the readings of the TST tests between the participants and the nurses will
      be the same. If the investigator and team hypothesis is correct, then this will lessen the
      workload of the nurses and reduce the number of times the participants have to come to the
      clinic to see the nurses and the doctors. This is a pilot study to test this innovative
      method to teach the participants to read the TST results by themselves. If this technique is
      successful, then the investigator and team can expand the method to other hospitals in
      Thailand as well as in the region.
