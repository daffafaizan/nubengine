      modification of treatment by determination of tumor progression vs. treatment related effects
      (pseudo-progression, radiation necrosis). Earlier treatment response assessment could reduce
      cost, improve clinical trial efficiency and allow better assessment of prognosis. The
      development of PET/MRI offers the possibility of combining the functional imaging of PET with
      the exquisite soft tissue contrast and physiologic imaging capabilities of MRI. Combining
      FLT-PET imaging with MRI may allow better evaluation of new and unclear lesions in brain
      metastatic disease. The goal of this study is to explore FLT-PET imaging combined with
      dynamic MR imaging techniques for the identification of tumor response markers in metastatic
      brain tumors.
