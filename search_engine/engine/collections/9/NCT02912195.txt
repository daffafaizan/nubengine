    
      Objective: The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the analgesic efficacy of
      intravenous lidocaine versus morphine for the treatment of severe pain in the emergency
      department (ED).

      Study design: Open-label, randomized, controlled pilot trial. Participants: Investigators and
      research assistants will recruit patients ≥18 years old with severe pain (NRS ≥7) and an
      anticipated stay in the emergency department ≥1 hour. A sample size calculation was performed
      and 32 patients will be enrolled.

      Intervention: After a trained research assistant obtains written informed consent, eligible
      participants will be randomized to the intravenous lidocaine or morphine arms of the study.
      In the intravenous lidocaine arm, patients will receive IV lidocaine (75 mg if <50kg, 100 mg
      if 50 - 100 kg, and 150 mg if >100 kg) over 10 minutes in a 100 mL normal saline minibag
      followed by a 50 minute IV lidocaine drip (75 mg if <50kg, 100 mg if 50 - 100 kg, and 150 mg
      if >100 kg). In the morphine arm, the ED provider will choose an appropriate dose of morphine
      for the patient. At 20 and 40 minutes, the participants will be asked "Would you like
      additional pain medication?". Participants responding in the affirmative will receive
      morphine 4 mg IV.

      Data collection: The trained research assistant will collect data on the patients' pain
      scores, side effects, and rescue morphine.

      Statistical analysis: Investigators will perform descriptive statistics and compare pain
      scores and pain relief at each time point with unpaired t-tests.
