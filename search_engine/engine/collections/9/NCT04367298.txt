      A mixed-method research will be carried out. Three different study design will be used:

      Phase 1. Prospective longitudinal study in 2 steps:

        -  A first step, of 18 months, in which a first intervention of audits and seminars in
           health professionals will be carried out, focused on an effective and efficient registry
           of hospital falls in older people. This first phase is crucial to identify temporal
           patterns of falls in relation to specific intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors among
           hospitalized older people; as well as the levels of fatigue/sleepiness, attention and
           cognitive functionality of the health professionals who attend to an in-hospital fall.

        -  A second step, of application of a multidimensional prevention program for 15 months
           focused on organizational, educational and behavioral elements; applied to admitted
           older people and health professionals.

      Phase 2. Retrospective study of the fall records found in the institutional databases of the
      study centers, in the period between January 2018 - September 2020. This period covers the
      first (January 2018 - May 2019) and the second phase (June 2019 - September 2020) of the
      project, previously indicated.

      Phase 3. Descriptive exploratory study with a qualitative approach, focus groups made up of
      health professionals: doctors, nurses and nursing assistants who provide and have provided
      their professional services in the field of study, in the periods in which the studies have
      been carried out. longitudinal and retrospective previously mentioned.
