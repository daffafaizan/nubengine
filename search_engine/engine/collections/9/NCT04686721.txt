      the actual incidence of tracheal stenosis in patients with COVID-19 that underwent prolonged
      intubation or tracheal stenosis.

      Information regarding anamnestic data, demographics, smoking or alcohol habits, comorbidity,
      previous history of prolonged ventilation or tracheostomy, and data about intensive care unit
      stay and treatment will be collected before discharging patients from hospital.

      All patients enrolled will perform an initial evaluation with a chest CT scan without
      contrast-enhancing at 2 months from hospital discharge along with pulmonary function test. If
      tracheal stenosis is detected, treatment according to currently available guidelines will be
      performed.

      Patients with no signs of clinical, functional and radiological evidence of tracheal stenosis
      will perform a 3 and 6 months clinical follow-up from initial evaluation.

      A chest CT scan with pulmonary function test will be administered if symptoms of tracheal
      stenosis arise during clinical follow-up. If necessary, treatment according to currently
      available guidelines will be performed.

      Patients will be followed-up for 8 months after hospital discharge.
