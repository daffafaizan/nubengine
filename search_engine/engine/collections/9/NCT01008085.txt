      of the changing anatomy after an AMI has occurred (thrombus dissolution, resolution of spasm)
      with the traditional balloon-expandable stent treatment. A self-expanding stent might lead to
      better stent strut apposition as it follows the contours of the vessel wall due to its
      self-expanding properties. This might result into better long term clinical outcomes like
      lower thrombosis rates.
