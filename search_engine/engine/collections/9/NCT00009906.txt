      I. Compare the overall and progression-free survival of patients with CD117-expressing
      metastatic or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with two different doses of
      imatinib mesylate.

      II. Compare the confirmed, unconfirmed, complete, and partial response rates in patients
      treated with these regimens.

      III. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients in arm I with progressive disease may cross over to arm II and receive treatment in
      the absence of further disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
