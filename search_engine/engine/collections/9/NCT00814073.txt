    
      This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3
      study, conducted in 15 countries, evaluating the efficacy and safety of masitinib (6
      mg/kg/day administered orally in two daily intakes over 24-weeks with a double-blind
      extension period possible) for the treatment of indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering
      mastocytosis or cutaneous mastocytosis, in patients with mast cells mediator release symptoms
      that are refractory to conventional symptomatic treatment.

      A study protocol amendment restricted enrolment to patients with severe indolent and
      smoldering systemic mastocytosis. The objective of this phase 3 study was therefore to
      evaluate masitinib efficacy and safety in severe systemic mastocytosis patients, with or
      without D816V mutation of c-Kit. The primary objective of the phase 3 study was to detect a
      statistically significant difference between masitinib (plus optimal concomitant symptomatic
      treatments) and placebo (plus optimal concomitant symptomatic treatments) in cumulative
      response on four severe symptoms, referred to also as handicaps.
