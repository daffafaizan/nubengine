      between 17% and 95% and is associated with increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. The
      etiology of AKI after LT is multifactorial. Among these factors, renal ischemia-reperfusion
      injury (IRI) caused by perioperative renal hypoperfusion is considered as one of the most
      important independent risk factors and recent reports have indicated that IRI is associated
      with an inflammatory cascade. Dexmedetomidine which is a highly selective agonist of
      Î±2-adrenergic receptors has known have anti-inflammatory effect and has been shown to
      ameliorate IRI in several organs. However, the impact of Dexmedetomidine on AKI after LT is
      not determined yet. Therefore, this study aims to observe the renal protective effects of
      Dexmedetomidine after LT.
