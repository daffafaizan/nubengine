      methods prior to obtaining written informed consent. Once written informed consent is
      obtained, subjects will continue with planned routine care upper endoscopy. During the first
      study visit an upper endoscopy will be performed. At this visit, research specimens will be
      obtained for mutational load (ML) analysis and gastroenterologist (GI) pathologist diagnosis
      for the presence of adenocarcinoma or degrees of dysplasia. ML will be correlated to the
      pathology diagnosis on this research biopsy. Subjects will then undergo EET per routine
      standard of care at the treating institution until CEIM achieved. Subjects will be followed
      (data collection only) during treatment period until CEIM is achieved. After subjects reach
      CEIM, four additional research biopsies will be collected, from the midpoint of previous BE
      site.
