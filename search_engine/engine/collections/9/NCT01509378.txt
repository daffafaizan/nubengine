      overdrive pacing or shock, reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death. The device is
      programmed to detect episodes of arrhythmias, classify them according to the threat to
      patient, and deliver therapies to stop the arrhythmias.

      The actual focus of ICD programming has been the application of fast-pacing therapies (ATP or
      antitachy pacing) as first therapy before applying a shock as last resort to terminate an
      episode. Some studies have shown the high success rate of this method in decreasing the
      number of shock delivered to patients. Furthermore significant improvement has been done to
      improve the sensitivity and specificity of the detection and discrimination algorithm.

      This study will focus on the latest generation of device and their performance will be
      reviewed and analyzed by an Adjudication Board.
