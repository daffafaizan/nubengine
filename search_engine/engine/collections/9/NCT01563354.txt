    
      This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm, phase II study with a
      single-stage design in each arm. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness and
      safety of Everolimus or Pasireotide LAR alone or in combination in adult patients with
      advanced (unresectable or metastatic) neuroendocrine carcinoma (typical and atypical) of the
      lung and thymus. It was expected that a total of 120 patients with 40 patients in each arm
      were to be enrolled into this study. Patients were seen weekly for one month and monthly
      thereafter. Radiological and biochemical response assessments were performed every 3 months.

      Patients with disease control (stable disease or better) in the combination arm or
      monotherapy with pasireotide LAR and everolimus who had not experienced unacceptable toxicity
      were permitted to continue treatment in the extension phase of the study and were seen every
      3 months. Patients could remain in the extension phase as long as they continued to have
      clinical benefit and had not fulfilled any of the study discontinuation criteria. All
      patients had a safety follow-up visit 56 days after last treatment dose.
