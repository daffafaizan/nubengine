    
      After signing the informed consent potential patients will undergo a screening medical
      history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

      The study will consist of two parts:

        -  Part A: IFN-γ 1b monotherapy

        -  Part B: IFN-γ 1b combination therapy with Adefovir dipivoxil or Adefovir dipivoxil
           monotherapy

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially into to one of three treatment groups. In Part A, ten
      patients will be enrolled and will receive IFN-γ 1b 200μg, administered every day by
      subcutaneous injection for 4 weeks. If HBV DNA is reduced by ≥ 1 log10 copies/ mL in ≥ 30% of
      patients the protocol will proceed to Part B.

      In Part B, twenty patients will be enrolled into two cohorts (total of 10 for each cohort)
      and treated for four weeks. The two cohorts will be administered:

        -  IFN-γ 1b 200μg, administered every day combination therapy with Adefovir dipivoxil (10mg
           QD) or

        -  Adefovir dipivoxil (10mg QD) alone

      On the initial study visit, patients will be given instruction on self injection of IFN-γ 1b
      (if applicable). Patients will be monitored for safety, tolerability, HBV DNA, clinical
      chemistries including a standard panel of liver tests and hematologies throughout the study
      and for the two week post-treatment observation period.
