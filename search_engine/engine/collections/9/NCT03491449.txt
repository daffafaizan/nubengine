      and secondary prevention in patients with stroke. The current strategy for the hypertensive
      treatment of patients during the acute phase of ischemic stroke within the first 72 hours
      remains a highly debated and unclear issue, with no consensus on the range or appropriate
      blood pressure ranges to be handled (13).

      Team study working hypothesis focuses on the study of blood pressure (for 72 hours), through
      its intensive control (recording and adjustment every four hours), in the acute phase of
      ischemic stroke. Specifically, it is based on the monitoring and maintenance of systolic
      blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg in patients with acute ischemic stroke; And this can
      lead to a better functional prognosis, measured at 90 days, compared with the functional
      prognosis of patients treated according to the recommendations of the current Clinical
      Guidelines, which propose to act on systolic blood pressure only when it exceeds 185 mm Hg
      (13,22).

      Although the intense decrease in blood pressure during the acute phase of stroke has the
      potential risk of decreasing cerebral perfusion in the area of ischemic penumbra, in recent
      observational studies (19), a worse functional prognosis has not been found in those patients
      With systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg.

      There is no previous evidence from other intervention studies related to blood pressure
      control and a benefit to patients with acute ischemic stroke. Comparison using a randomized
      clinical trial of a group of patients with blood pressure control following current
      guidelines with a group of patients with systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg
      may allow a simple, rapidly applicable therapeutic alternative to Clinical practice, low cost
      and extrapolable to a wider population, such as patients with stroke of any etiology.
