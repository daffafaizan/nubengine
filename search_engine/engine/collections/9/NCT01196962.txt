      hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs). However, this procedure may lead to serious and
      sometimes life-threatening complications, including mechanical, infectious, or thrombotic
      complications. The choice of insertion site can influence the incidence and type of such
      complications. The most frequently used sites for CVC insertion are the internal jugular and
      the subclavian vein. However, in an individual patient, criteria for choosing one approach
      over the other remain unclear.
