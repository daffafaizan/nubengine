      and radiotherapy in patients with intermediate or advanced-stage prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive oral
      bicalutamide once daily or oral flutamide three times daily for at least 1 month followed by
      leuprolide or goserelin subcutaneously once monthly for four months. Beginning after the
      fourth administration of leuprolide or goserelin, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week
      for 7-8 weeks. Beginning one month before radiotherapy and continuing until 1 month after
      radiotherapy, patients receive SU5416 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats
      weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-12
      patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 12 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4-6 weeks for 4 months and
      then every 8-12 weeks for 8 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
