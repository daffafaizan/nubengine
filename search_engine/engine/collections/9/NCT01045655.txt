      multi-component intervention for antenatal depression. MOMCare has the potential to overcome
      patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women
      in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal
      psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. Specific Aim 1: To evaluate
      the impact of MOMCare on treatment engagement and retention. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the
      impact of MOMCare on maternal clinical symptoms and functional outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To
      conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for a health care and welfare agency
      perspective that includes a) tracking the medical costs of health service use in MOMCare and
      usual care patients; b) monitoring the use of infant preventative health services in both
      groups; and c) tracking the percentage of women on Medicaid and the percentage working in
      both groups.

      The intervention will be assessed through a practical randomized controlled trial in which we
      have recruited 168 pregnant women with major depression and/or dysthymia who were on Medicaid
      and/or received Maternal Support Services (MSS) in selected public health centers in Seattle
      - King County (PHSKC). Patients who were eligible and consented to study enrollment were
      randomly assigned to either usual care (UC) or MOMCare. Baseline and four follow-up
      assessments (3 - 18 months post-baseline) are scheduled for study participants in both
      groups. The MOMCare intervention includes a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy or
      collaborative management of antidepressant medication. Treatment response will be monitored,
      and the treatment will be adjusted as necessary (adding treatments, increasing dosages).
