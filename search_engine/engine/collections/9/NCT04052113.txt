      pattern, treatment outcome, efficacy will be collected from medical records in Stage IV
      urotherial (UC) patients. Archived patient's formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary
      tumor samples will be collected from each site and conduct programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
      (PD-L1) assay and next generation sequencer (NGS) assay for tumor mutation burden (TMB).
      Based on these data, prevalence of PD-L1, TMB and overall survival (OS), progression free
      survival (PFS) from start of 1st line treatment in stage IV will be assessed.

      In this study, 150 patients will be enrolled from approximately 30 sites in Japan. The
      patients should have received at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy and never receive immune
      oncology drug as 1st line treatment in stage IV. The patients will be enrolled continuously
      from the 1st patient who is enrolled in this study until target number of patients in each
      site.
