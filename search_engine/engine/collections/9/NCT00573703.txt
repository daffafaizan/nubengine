    
      Women with predominant and genuine stress urinary incontinence will be enrolled and
      randomized in two groups (groups A and B). Patients of group A will be treated with
      laparoscopic Burch colposuspension, whereas patients of group B will be treated with TOT
      procedure.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, hormonal, urodynamic, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the
      surgical outcomes, the clinical subjective and objective efficacy data, and the adverse
      experiences will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
