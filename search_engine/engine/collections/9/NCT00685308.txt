      to 99% that causes a recent ischemic neurologic event.

      The Winspan stenting following undersized Gateway balloon angioplasty will be performed at
      experienced centers (at least 10 cases' experiences of using the Wingspan system to treat the
      patients with intracranial stenosis for each center).

      The primary endpoint of the study, independently evaluated by neurologists, is any stroke or
      death within 30 days, plus ischemic stroke in the stented artery territory between 31 day and
      1 year.
