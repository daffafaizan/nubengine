    
      THERMOEDEME is a comparative, controlled, randomized, multicenter and simple blinded
      (investigator) trial.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of spa therapy in phlebology with a therapeutic
      education program in daily life of patients suffering lymphoedema post breast cancer
      treatments.

      According to the protocol submitted to authorities in the absence of evidence data on the
      subject, the protocol plans to verify the frequency of success (improvement of LMS27 by 7
      points) after inclusion and follow-up at 6 months of the first 30 patients in order to
      reassess the number of subjects required, if the initial hypothesis were too far from
      reality.

      The replacement of the missing values will be done for each dimension, for the patients who
      answered more than half of the questions, by the average of their answers to the other
      questions of the dimension.
