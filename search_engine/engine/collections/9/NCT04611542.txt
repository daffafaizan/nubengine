      centers in Oregon. Recruitment for the 30 fathers for the evaluation testing will be
      coordinated in collaboration with substance use treatment center staff members who will
      contact potentially eligible fathers to give a brief description of the project and ask for
      permission for Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies (ORBIS) staff to contact
      them to provide further information about the study. Fathers that do not give permission for
      treatment center staff will not be contacted by ORBIS, though they can contact ORBIS directly
      using the contact information in a brochure that they will receive from treatment centers.
      Once treatment center staff receive permission from a father for ORBIS to contact them,
      project staff will call to further explain the details of the project, confirm eligibility
      requirements and discuss confidentiality. If the father expresses interest in participating,
      we will send him an information packet and schedule an interview (or a visit if we feel that
      is necessary to ensure that he understands the project and what we are asking of him).

      A total of 30 individual fathers that are eligible and consent to participate will be
      enrolled in the study. Over a 5-week period (1 week for pretest assessments, 3 weeks for
      training and skills practice, 1 week for posttest assessments) fathers will participate in
      using the Fathering In Recovery (FIR) program. To address promise of efficacy, the primary
      approach for the evaluation of the phase I prototype will be by assessing improvements on
      pre-intervention to post-intervention outcomes including, parenting knowledge, parenting
      efficacy, parenting skill, and pre-post reductions in substance use. Fathers will receive a
      total of $200 for participation in the study.
