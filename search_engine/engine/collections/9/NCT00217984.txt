      tobacco cessation intervention for alcohol-dependent smokers in early recovery.

      Methods. A total of 162 alcohol-dependent smokers were randomized to either intensive
      intervention for smoking cessation or usual care. The intensive intervention consisted of 16
      sessions of individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and combination nicotine replacement
      therapy that lasted 26 weeks. Usual care involved referral to a free-standing smoking
      cessation program that provided smoking cessation counseling of varying duration and
      guideline-concordant medications. The primary cessation outcome was verified 7-day point
      prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 12, 26, 38, and 52 weeks.

      Results. At 12 and 26 weeks, the verified 7-day point-prevalence quit rate was significantly
      higher for the intensive intervention group than for the usual care group (both p = .03).
      However, the quit rates for the two treatment groups were not significantly different at 38
      or 52 weeks. Verified 30-day alcohol abstinence rates were not significantly different for
      the two treatment groups at any of the follow-up assessments.

      Conclusions. The intensive smoking cessation intervention yielded a higher short-term smoking
      quit rate without jeopardizing sobriety. A chronic care model might facilitate maintenance of
      smoking cessation during the first year of alcohol treatment and perhaps for longer periods
      of time. It is hoped that studies such as this will inform the development of more effective
      interventions for concurrent alcohol and tobacco use disorders.
