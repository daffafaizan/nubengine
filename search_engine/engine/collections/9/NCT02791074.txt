      reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) may be diagnosed based on impaired LVEF (<50%). However,
      diagnosis of HF with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is mainly based on the presence of
      signs and symptoms.

      Central to diagnosis of HF is estimation of intra-cardiac pressure, which can only be
      obtained from invasive catheterization.

      This proposed study aim to:

        1. Determine intra-LV pressure-time profile non-invasively using recently developed echo
           Doppler VFM analysis and applanation tonometry and myocardial elastic properties, in HF
           subjects (both HFNEF and HFREF) compared to normal volunteers.

        2. Correlate calculated intra-LV pressure parameters with NT ProBNP levels.
