      orthogonal functional skills, personal care, cognitive, perceptual and social skills in
      children with cerebral palsy and these kids spend most of their time in a sitting
      position.There are goniometer, inclinometer, flexicurve, spinal mouse, and modified head
      posture spinal curvature Ä±nstrument tools for posture analysis in the sitting
      position.However, none of these measurement tools have been validated for validity and
      reliability studies of head and trunk posture measurement in the sitting position in children
      with CP. Methods such as magnetic resonance (MR) and x-ray used in posture evaluation provide
      clear images of reference points and are the gold standard in the literature. However, they
      are not preferred much because they are expensive and contain radiation.Photographic posture
      analysis can be considered as a measurement method such as posture analysis methods using the
      gravity line. It is a digital, more objective measurement method that measures linear
      distances and angles using anatomical reference points using specially designed software.
      Clinical use of photographic posture analysis is recommended in the literature, as it is an
      accurate and objective method, preventing radiation exposure.The purpose of this study; to
      evaluate the reliability of photographic posture analysis in the sitting position in children
      with CP and to examine the relationship between the results of photographic posture analysis
      with the motor performances and trunk control of children with CP.
