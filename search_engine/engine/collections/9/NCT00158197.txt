      psychosocial treatment, (2) continuous contingency management which consists of 16 weeks of
      psychosocial treatment with a contingency management procedure in effect during the first
      twelve weeks in which vouchers are made available after each provision of a
      methamphetamine-negative urine test, (3) intermittent predictable contingency management
      which consists of 16 weeks of psychosocial treatment with a contingency management procedure
      in effect during the first twelve weeks in which vouchers are available after the provision
      of every three consecutive methamphetamine-negative urine samples, and (4) intermittent
      unpredictable contingency management which consists of 16 weeks of psychosocial treatment
      with a contingency management procedure in effect during the first twelve weeks in which
      vouchers are available on one day each week (randomly selected after the first week) for the
      provision of methamphetamine-negative urine samples provided all urine samples since delivery
      of the last reinforcer were also methamphetamine negative.
