      Peritoneal Lavage System to treat patients with STEMI using therapeutic hypothermia. Patients
      will undergo cooling, maintenance and rewarming and applicable data will be gathered on
      device performance and patient safety. Patient temperature and vital signs will be monitored
      in addition to various laboratory values. Adverse event reporting will take place at multiple
      time intervals and follow-up will continue out to 6-months.
