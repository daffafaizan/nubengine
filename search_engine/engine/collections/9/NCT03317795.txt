      fibroids report that symptoms affect their quality of life and impede physical activity, and
      24% report that fibroid symptoms prevent them from reaching their true potential at work.
      Heavy menstrual bleeding, the most common symptom of uterine fibroids, affects approximately
      1.4 million women per year.

      Medical therapy is the first line treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding, but further studies
      need to be done to prove the effectiveness of these treatments.

      The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of non-estrogenic medical therapy in
      women with a range of fibroid sizes, locations, and number.

      Two effective medical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding have limited data in women with
      fibroids. The Levonorgestrel intrauterine system was FDA approved for the treatment of heavy
      menstrual bleeding in 2009 and is highly effective for decreasing menstrual bleeding,
      treating anemia and improving quality of life. Moreover, it can be used continuously for 5
      years. Tranexamic Acid is widely used outside the U.S. and was also FDA approved for heavy
      menstrual bleeding in 2009. Tranexamic Acid reduces menstrual blood loss in 40% of women and
      improves quality of life. In women with fibroids, Tranexamic Acid has been shown to decrease
      heavy menstrual bleeding and cause necrosis of the fibroids, especially larger fibroids,
      which should improve its efficacy for women with fibroids.

      This randomized controlled trial will assess the comparative effectiveness of Levonorgestrel
      intrauterine system to Tranexamic Acid for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in women
      with uterine fibroids
