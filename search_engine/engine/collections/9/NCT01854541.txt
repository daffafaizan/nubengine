    
      In a retrospective cohort of radiotherapy patients, time stamps of various steps in the
      radiotherapy process (diagnosis, multi-disciplinary board, referral, intake, simulation,
      treatment planning, quality control, first fraction of radiotherapy) will be collected. These
      will be combined with patient, tumor and patient-process (e.g. referring physician, treating
      physician, busy-at-the-time, referring hospital) related features. Based on these a
      predictive model will be learned that can estimate the probability at various stages of the
      process that the patient waits too long. Visual management will be developed that can
      visualize the predicted waiting time.

      Process interventions aimed at reducing waiting times will be tested prospectively.
