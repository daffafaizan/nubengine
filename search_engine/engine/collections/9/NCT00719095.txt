      project aims to develop an effective outpatient treatment for prescription opioid (PO) abuse
      that combines an intensive behavioral therapy with a pharmacotherapy regimen of buprenorphine
      detoxification and naltrexone maintenance. Aim 1) Conduct a randomized, three-parallel-groups
      clinical trial (Study 1) to determine a buprenorphine dose-tapering schedule that prevents
      the poor retention and relapse that undermine many opioid detoxification regimens. Aim 2)
      Conduct a randomized, three-parallel-groups clinical trial (Study 2) to determine a duration
      of naltrexone therapy that sustains opioid abstinence following the buprenorphine
      detoxification.
