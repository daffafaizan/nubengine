      clinical and subjective symptoms in infants with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The influence on the
      immunologic status and the intestinal microflora, inflammation and permeability will also be
      investigated.

      Sixty two infants (6 to 24 months of age) suffering from AD will be randomised in 3 groups
      receiving either Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (1x10^10 Colony forming units),
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07(1x10^10 Colony forming units) or placebo every day for 8 weeks.

      At the beginning and at the end of the study the following analyses will be made:

        1. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index to describe the extent and severity of the
           eczema, and to describe the subjective symptoms.

        2. Blood samples will be drawn to examine:

             -  Immunoglobulin E (IgE), total and specific for egg and milk.

             -  Eosinophil Cation Protein (ECP)

             -  Interleukin-10 (Il-10), Interleukin-12 (Il-12) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)

        3. Fecal samples will be collected to examine:

             -  Calprotectin (intestinal inflammation)

             -  Bacterial Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) will be extracted in order to perform
                Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
