      meditation in the management of visceral pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. We will
      enroll a total of 14 subjects with chronic pancreatitis. After enrollment, subjects will be
      randomized to active stimulation plus mediation (7 subjects) or sham stimulation plus
      meditation (7 subjects). Subjects will undergo 5 days of active tDCS stimulation plus
      meditation or sham tDCS plus meditation. Sessions will last approximately 30 min - 1 hour.
      EEG activity will be measured in the first, last and follow-up visits. After each stimulation
      session, we will assess for adverse effects using the tDCS adverse effects questionnaire. We
      will also have the subject fill out a pain/medication diary during the 5 days of treatment.
      All study procedures will be completed at BIDMC.
