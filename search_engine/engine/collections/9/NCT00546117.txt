      ears. Earlier studies have found pepsin or pepsinogen, a component of stomach fluid, in the
      middle ear fluid of many children with chronic middle ear fluid. Anti-reflux medicines called
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI) reduce the acidity of the contents of the stomach and the
      activity of pepsin or pepsinogen. We are studying the effectiveness of a PPI called
      lansoprazole (Prevacidâ„¢) in reducing fluid in the ears. If lansoprazole is able to reduce the
      fluid in the middle ear, this tells us that the reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus and
      into the ear canal may be causing middle ear fluid.
