      to the cranberry capsule or placebo. Participants will be instructed to consume the assigned
      supplement for the next 12 months. A calendar will be provided to record compliance and
      recurrent UTI. Participants will also record any side effects. They will be phoned each month
      to encourage participation and adherence. At 8 weeks and 6 months, they will be asked to
      return to the clinic to complete a midline questionnaire which will ask about any recurrent
      UTIs experienced. More supplements will be provided at their 6-month visit. At 12 months,
      participants will return to the clinic to complete an endline questionnaire. They will return
      any leftover supplements, calendar and side effect diary. If participants withdraw from the
      study, they will still be encouraged to return at 12 months to complete the survey to allow
      for intent-to-treat analysis.
