      chest tube insertion, up to 50% of patients treated conservatively may experience recurrence
      in subsequent months or years.

      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is a minimally-invasive surgical approach to treat
      spontaneous pneumothorax and reduce the risk of recurrence. Compared to open thoracotomy,
      VATS may facilitate a faster recovery and lead to earlier home discharge.

      Totally-intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil is a useful anesthetic
      technique for VATS, as the drugs are rapidly eliminated after the end of the procedure,
      leading to fast recovery from anesthesia.

      One drawback of ultra-short-acting opioid remifentanil is residual hyperalgesia after the end
      of the infusion, particularly after VATS, which is associated with relatively short but
      intense pain after surgery.

      Intravenous morphine, administered just before the end of anesthesia, is the typical choice
      for pain relief after TIVA. However, this drug may require repeated titration and may be
      associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting, itchiness or drowsiness in the early
      postoperative period.

      Oxycodone, another opioid, is available in an oral controlled-release (CR) formulation which
      grants relatively constant plasma levels of the drug after 1 h of administration.

      The investigators hypothesize that administration of CR oxycodone 20 mg 1 hour before surgery
      may lead to better recovery parameters in the post-anesthesia care unit, thus granting
      earlier discharge to the surgical ward.
