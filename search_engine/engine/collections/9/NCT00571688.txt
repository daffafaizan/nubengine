      disorders. In fact, long-term stabilization is more the exception than the rule, and the
      majority of patients experience frequent relapses of illness. Studies have shown that both
      bipolar I and II patients spend about half of their weeks in a significant symptomatic state.
      Relapses and persistent illness result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and disability.

      Symptomatic recurrences happen as a result of breakthrough symptoms during active treatment
      and intermittent non-adherence. Therefore, enhanced control of symptoms, coupled with ensured
      adherence, is very likely to improve the long-term outcome of this difficult-to-treat
      condition.

      Risperidone has been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms of acute mania or mixed
      state in two registration monotherapy and one combination treatment study with lithium or
      valproate, as well as several smaller trials. However, longer-term treatment studies are
      relatively lacking. As well, although Risperdal Consta(TM) has been shown to be of benefit in
      prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia, relatively little longer-term data in
      bipolar disorder is available. Nonetheless, both risperidone and Risperdal Consta (TM) are
      likely to be highly efficacious for the maintenance prevention of relapse in bipolar
      disorder. Moreover, Risperdal Consta(TM) helps to ensure longer-term treatment effectiveness,
      both by better adherence and improved control of symptoms. The present study is intended to
      determine whether Risperdal Consta(TM) injections, added to ongoing pharmacotherapy, will
      improve outcome relative to treatment as usual.
