      frequently inflammatory, immune response after initiation of antiretroviral (ART) therapy.
      The immunopathogenesis of IRIS remains elusive partially due to a lack of tissue sampling and
      a lack of detailed screening, including imaging, for subclinical opportunistic infections in
      many studies. Most pathogenesis studies to date have been performed in peripheral blood with
      a few notable exceptions of cryptococcal IRIS studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      samples were obtained and evaluated.

      This is a 2-arm natural history study intended to evaluate the incidence, predictors and
      pathogenic mechanisms of IRIS in HIV-1 infected adults (age >18 years). An ART naive arm will
      enroll 140 patients who are ART-na(SqrRoot) ve with CD4+ T cell counts <100 cells/mm^3. These
      participants will initiate ART according to the clinical standard of care. Any opportunistic
      infections (OIs) or AIDS-defining illnesses identified prior to, during screening or at any
      point during the study, will also be treated according to standard of care. The IRIS arm will
      enroll 60 participants who are ART-treated and meet criteria suspicious for IRIS, with any
      CD4+ T cell count. The ART naive arm will be followed for 48 weeks, with an optional
      extension up to week 96. The IRIS arm will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment if the
      IRIS event is confirmed, also with an optional extension up to week 96. In both arms,
      subjects must have adequate venous access and will undergo collection of whole blood by
      phlebotomy, leukapheresis, lymph node biopsy, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET/CT) at designated study visits.
