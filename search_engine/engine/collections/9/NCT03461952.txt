      that have a mutation in POLE and/or POLD1. Nivolumab alone or in conjunction with ipilimumab
      is predicted to be effective against tumors with POLE and/or POLD1 mutations as these genetic
      changes cause increased rates of mutations in the DNA of tumor cells. These high mutation
      rates have been associated with response to immunotherapy agents such as nivolumab and
      ipilimumab.
