      Effective weight reduction will improve manifestations of PCOS and risk factors for
      developing type 2 diabetes and coronary heart diseases. We compare the effect of two
      isocaloric low calorie diets (LCD), - one powder-based shake-diet and a fiber rich diet on
      the above mentioned parameters. In addition we want to compare the weight-maintenance effect
      the next 44 weeks of two different follow-up programs: A usual care- and a lifestyle-program.
