      tailored theory-based behavioral risk reduction intervention for men and women who are
      receiving sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnostic and treatment services from STI
      treatment providers in South Africa. As many as one in five South Africans is HIV positive
      and there are an estimated 1,500 new HIV infections in South Africa each day. The
      experimental intervention in this study was developed by South African and US investigators
      and pilot tested in South Africa. The intervention is grounded in the experience of South
      African health service provider, empirical research on AIDS-related stigmas, and elements of
      a social cognitive theory of health behavior change. The intervention consists of a single
      60-minute risk reduction counseling session delivered within the context of STI services.
      Participants will be STI clinic patients over age 18 that have been treated for a previous
      STI. Participants will be baseline assessed and randomized to receive either (a) the 60 min
      theory-based and culturally tailored risk reduction intervention or (b) a time and contact
      matched standard of care HIV and health education session. Participants will be followed for
      12 months post intervention. Assessments will be conducted using computer assisted interviews
      (ACASI). The randomized trial will determine the efficacy of the risk reduction intervention
      for South African men and women receiving STI clinic services. Outcome analyses will include
      differences between conditions on new STI diagnoses over 12 months. We will also test the
      mediating effects of attitudes and beliefs on intervention outcomes. Results of this research
      will therefore test a clinic-based HIV prevention intervention model that is urgently needed
      in South Africa.
