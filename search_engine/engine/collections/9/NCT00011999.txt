        -  Determine the feasibility of adjuvant paclitaxel followed by radiotherapy with
           concurrent paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients undergoing gross complete resection of
           high-risk stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the patterns of failure in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive adjuvant therapy beginning 7-14 days after gross total surgical
      resection. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning on
      approximately day 22, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5.5-6.5
      weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by cisplatin IV over 1-3
      hours on days 43, 50, and 57. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 11 months.
