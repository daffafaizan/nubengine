      Various non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have been successfully tested in
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) is a new,
      portable and inexpensive non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique that has shown
      security, biological effects, and therapeutical effects in some pathologies. Some studies
      have studied its effect in pain central processing, our aim is to study its effect on FMS.
      The safety that tSMS has demonstrated in several clinical trials opens doors to future
      clinical trials that will extend its clinical utility.

      Objectives:

      To investigate the effect of tSMS on pain in patients with FMS, using subjective and
      objective assessment measures. Identify dose response to the treatment to limit the
      parameters required to achieve effectiveness with the technique.
