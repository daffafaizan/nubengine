      visual acuities in the distance and the near. However, the intermediate vision is of
      increasing relevance for everyday's life. Several multifocal intraocular lenses have been
      developed to improvement intermediate vision. Nonetheless, those systems still possess
      adverse photic effects and do not garantuee spectacle independence. Therefore, the
      combination of a lower-addition bifocal intraocular lense in the distance-dominant eye with a
      higher-addition bifocal intraocular lense in the fellow-eye might be a promising approach to
      address these drawbacks of current binocular and trifocal intraocular lenses.
