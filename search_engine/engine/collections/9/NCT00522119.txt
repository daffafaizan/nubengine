      caused by many factors, including stress, diet, diabetes, kidney disease, or obesity. In many
      people, there is no identifiable cause for their high blood pressure. If high blood pressure
      goes untreated, it can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, or stroke. Previous studies
      have shown that variations in three genes in chromosome 1-ATP1B1, RGS5, and SELE-cause some
      people to be more susceptible to developing high blood pressure. All three of these genes are
      involved in the development of proteins that play a role in regulating blood pressure, but it
      is not known exactly how variations in these genes affect blood pressure levels. This study
      will examine previously collected genetic samples from participants in two studies, the
      GenNet study and the Heredity and Phenotype Interaction (HAPI) Heart study. Study researchers
      will analyze the samples to identify and characterize variations in the ATP1B1, RGS5, and
      SELE genes. Results from this study may lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment
      options for people with high blood pressure.
