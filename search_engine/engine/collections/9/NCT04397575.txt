    
      Since December 2019, China and then the rest of the world have been affected by the rapid
      development of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus
      2). The disease caused by this coronavirus (COVID-19), which is transmitted by air via
      droplets, is potentially responsible for a severe respiratory syndrome but also for a
      multivisceral deficiency that can lead to death.

      In less than 3 months, the COVID-19 epidemic has already affected more than 440,000 persons
      and has been responsible for more than 20,000 deaths worldwide.

      Cancer patients are generally more susceptible to infections than people without cancer due
      to immunosuppression caused by their tumor disease and/or conventional anti-cancer treatments
      used such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, several targeted therapies, radiotherapy or recent
      surgery. These patients may therefore be at particular risk for COVID-19.

      This is suggested by the very first analysis on the subject, which reports data from the
      Chinese prospective database of 2007 patients with proven COVID-19 infection in 575 hospitals
      in 31 Chinese provinces. After exclusion of 417 cases without sufficient available clinical
      data, 1590 cases of patients infected with COVID-19 were analysed, of which 18 (1%) had a
      personal history of cancer. This prevalence was higher than that of COVID-19 in the general
      Chinese population since the beginning of the epidemic (0.29%). Lung cancer (n=5, 28%) and
      colorectal cancer (n=5, 28%) were the 2 most common cancers. Four (25%) of the 16 patients
      for whom treatment was known had received chemotherapy or had surgery in the month prior to
      COVID-19 infection, while the majority (n=12, 75%) were patients in remission or cured of
      their cancer after primary surgery. Compared to patients without cancer, patients with cancer
      were older (63 years vs. 48 years) and had a more frequent history of smoking (22% vs. 7%).
      Most importantly, patients with cancer had more severe forms of COVID-19 than patients
      without cancer (7/18 or 39% vs. 124/1572 or 8%, p=0.0003). Patients who had chemotherapy or
      surgery in the month preceding the diagnosis of COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk
      of the severe form (3/4 or 75% vs. 6/14 or 43%), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis
      after adjustment on other risk factors such as age, smoking and other comorbidities, with a
      relative risk of 5.34 (95% CI: 1.80-16.18;p=0.0026). Finally, patients with cancer
      deteriorated more rapidly than patients without cancer (13 days vs. 43 days, p<0.0001). The
      authors of this publication conclude with 3 measures to be proposed to patients undergoing
      cancer follow-up: 1/ consider postponing adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery in the case of
      localized and stable cancer, 2/ reinforce protective measures for these patients, and 3/
      monitor very closely and treat these patients more intensively when they have a COVID-19.

      However, the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe forms of COVID-19 in cancer
      patients suggested by this first study remains to be demonstrated given its limitations,
      already highlighted by other authors. Indeed, the number of patients is small and the
      population of cancer patients is very heterogeneous, with in particular 12 patients out of 16
      who had recovered from initial cancer treatments (therefore without immunosuppression), half
      of whom had a disease course of more than 4 years.

      Nevertheless, a second Chinese study has just recently been published, reporting COVID-19
      data among 1524 cancer patients admitted between December 30, 2019 and February 17, 2020 in
      the Department of Radiotherapy and Medical Oncology of the University Hospital of Wuhan, the
      source city of the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the rate of CoV-2 SARS infection was lower
      than that reported in the first study, it was still 0.79% (n=12), which is much higher than
      the rate of COVID-19 diagnosed in Wuhan City during the same period (0.37%, 41 152/11 081
      000). Again, lung cancer was the main tumor location observed in 7 patients (58%), of which 5
      (42%) were undergoing chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. Three deaths (25%) were reported.
      Patients over 60 years of age with lung cancer had a higher incidence of COVID-19 (4.3% vs.
      1.8%). Thus, it appears that the risk of COVID-19 is actually increased in cancer patients,
      although again, less than half of the patients with lung cancer had a higher incidence of
      COVID-19.

      Moreover, two more recent studies performed in patients treated in Hubei Province of China
      and in New-York city found that patients with cancer had significantly increased risk of
      death compared to non-cancer COVID-19 patients, especially patients with metastatic cancer
      and those who had recent surgery.

      Therefore, many questions remain to date on the level of risk and the severity of COVID-19 in
      patients with active cancer, in particular those under anti-cancer treatment and in patients
      recently operated for localized cancer.
