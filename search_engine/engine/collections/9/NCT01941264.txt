      on community-based case management of malaria by monthly testing of pregnant women using a
      rapid diagnostic test (RDT). They will also be taught the benefit of pregnant women visiting
      the antenatal clinics (ANC) and that women should receive intermittent preventive treatment
      with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at the ANC according to WHO guidelines.

      The CHWs will try to identify all pregnant women in their villages and encourage them to
      visit the ANC as early as possible in their pregnancy. The CHW will check after one week if
      the ANC was visited. For women who do not attend the ANC, the CHW will further encourage and
      discuss reasons for non-attendance. Subsequently the CHW will visit the woman's house every
      month to test for malaria with a RDT.The CHW will give a full course of AL to any woman with
      a positive RDT. The CHW will also collect a blood slide and a blood spot on filter paper for
      later analysis in the laboratory. The CHWs will return to women who were treated for malaria
      to check uptake and compliance by using a short questionnaire and checking the empty
      packaging of the treatment at the end of the course.

      In control communities, CHW will not be trained to do RDTs and give AL to pregnant women. The
      only data collection will occur during ANC visits.

      All women are asked to deliver in collaborating health centres. Peripheral blood will be
      tested for hemoglobin, malaria infection and resistance against SP. A placenta biopsy will be
      collected and all babies will be weighed and examined.
