        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of voriconazole vs itraconazole for the prevention
           of fungal infections in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to donor type (related
      vs unrelated). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT),
           patients receive voriconazole IV twice daily on days 1-14 and then orally* twice daily
           on days 15-100.

        -  Arm II: Beginning after AHSCT, patients receive itraconazole IV twice daily on days 1-2,
           once daily on days 3-14, and then orally* twice daily on days 15-100.

      NOTE: *Patients unable to tolerate oral medication may continue IV medication beyond day 14.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or an invasive
      fungal infection. Patients requiring corticosteroid therapy for graft-versus-host disease
      continue to receive voriconazole or itraconazole beyond day 100.

      Patients are followed until day 180 post-transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
