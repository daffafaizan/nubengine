      bone metastases. However, there is a paucity of prospective data studying the use of SBRT for
      bone metastases originating from low alpha-beta tumors, with systematic reporting of changes
      in pain scores and analgesia use over time. The vast majority data looking at SBRT in bone
      lesions focuses on local control and survival, rather than more tangible outcomes in a
      palliative population including symptomatic control, durability of response, and patient
      reported quality of life; a component that is understudied in this group despite its
      tremendous value. Furthermore, SBRT for bone metastases has yet to become common practice
      given the limited evidence for its efficacy and uncertainty in regards to toxicity.

      The current study proposes an investigation of the potential benefits of SBRT for symptomatic
      bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma,
      melanoma, and sarcoma. The investigators look to conduct a prospective cohort study that is
      adequately powered to analyse efficacy in alleviating pain from bone lesions and compare this
      to well-established rates in literature for conventionally fractionated palliative RT.
      Furthermore, this study will assess the tolerability of this modality, toxicity rates, and
      effect on quality of life. If the results show that SBRT has a significant benefit on this
      population, the goal would be to pursue a larger randomized trial to confirm the findings.
