    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the confirmed hematologic response rate of the combination of bortezomib,
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Organ response rate of the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone combination.

      II. Severity and frequency of adverse events associated with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and
      dexamethasone treatment in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

      III. Time to progression.

      IV. Survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral cyclophosphamide and
      oral dexamethasone once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.
