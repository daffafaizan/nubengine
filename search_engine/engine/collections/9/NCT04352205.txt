    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and acute kidney
      injury (AKI) who have renal function recovery following 2 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment with
      a daratumumab-based induction regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate at the end of 2 and 4 cycles of therapy. II. Adverse event profile
      of the combination in patients with AKI. III. Pharmacokinetic parameters of maximum
      concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), time to maximum concentration (tmax),
      clearance, and half life (t1/2) of daratumumab in combination treatment in the AKI
      population.

      IV. Global assessment of renal function at cycle initiation including creatinine clearance
      (CrCl).

      V. Timeline of changes in pharmacodynamic markers of light chains, urine paraprotein, and
      serum paraprotein measures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) weekly of cycles 1-3 and on day 1 only of
      cycle 4, bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone IV or
      orally (PO) on days 1-4 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-4 and PO on days 8 and 15 of all
      cycles. Beginning cycle 2, patients may also receive lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-14 or
      thalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
