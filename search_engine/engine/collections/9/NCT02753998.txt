      2 experimental arms.

      12 centers will participate in France, targeting to enrol 150 patients in total. Each patient
      will undergo angiography at the beginning of the intervention in order to confirm the
      presence of only one stenosis, to assess the degree of stenosis and to evaluate the vascular
      diameter.

      All patients will first undergo angioplasty using standard balloons. thereafter, depending on
      randomization arm, an additional angioplasty will be performed during 1 minute with a
      paclitaxel impregnated balloon (active arm) or with a placebo balloon (placebo arm).

      The duration of inclusion is planned for 18 months.

      Each patient will have a 12-month follow-up.
