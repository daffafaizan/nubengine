      extraordinary high antioxidant capacity compared to other plants. Furthermore it has been
      shown to reduce the plasma blood glucose and lipid profile significantly in an animal model.
      However, no study has been reported on its effectiveness in human. Therefore, we plan to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of C. caudatus
      on glycemic status, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers, lipid profile in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. Besides, metabolomics approach will be carried out to compare the
      metabolite changes between diabetic C. caudatus treated and control patients.

      Methods: A single-center randomized, controlled, two-arm parallel design clinical trial will
      be carried out in Malaysia. This study enrol 92 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
      Diabetic patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to two groups,
      which are C. caudatus treatment group and control group. Both groups will be compared on the
      primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The serum and urine
      metabolome of both groups will be examined using proton NMR spectroscopy.

      Discussion: The study will provide insights into the potential beneficial effect of C.
      caudatus in type 2 diabetic patients. In addition, the therapeutic effect of C. caudatus
      towards type 2 diabetes will reflect as a change of metabolite profile in urine and serum.
