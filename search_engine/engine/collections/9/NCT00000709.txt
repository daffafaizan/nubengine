      characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits, in a disorder known as AIDS
      dementia complex. Clinical experience suggests that its course is often progressive, going
      from initial symptoms to moderate or severe dementia within several months. Accumulating
      evidence now suggests that direct brain infection by the HIV virus is the likely cause of the
      AIDS dementia complex. Case reports suggest that therapy with AZT, which has been shown to be
      a strong inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro, may alleviate the AIDS dementia complex. This
      study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.

      All patients receive AZT for 24 weeks. Patients are seen weekly for the first 4 weeks, every
      other week for the next 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks until the completion of the study for
      neuropsychological evaluation. This evaluation includes lumbar puncture, and either
      computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
