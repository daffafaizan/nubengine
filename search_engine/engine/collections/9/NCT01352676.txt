      decision rule for obtaining a Flank Pain Protocol (FPP) CT scan in suspected renal colic.

      The investigators will integrate the derived clinical decision rule from the ongoing
      retrospective analysis with gestalt clinician pre-test probability, point of care ultrasound,
      and plain radiography (when appropriate) to prospectively and observationally test the rule
      at two distinct clinical settings. CT results and 90-day follow-up will be used to determine
      predefined outcomes.

      Study Hypothesis: Prospective observational testing of a clinical decision rule, combined
      with point of care ultrasound and plain radiography when appropriate, will categorize >85% of
      patients who will require intervention, validating a decision rule to avoid unnecessary CT.

      This amendment comes from recent evidence and work at our institution to develop an
      "ultra-low dose" CT scan protocol (ULDCT) with an effective radiation dose close to that of a
      plain film of the abdomen (KUB), or near 1mSv (compared to 8.5mSv in current practice). While
      we expect the ULDCT to be better than a KUB at localizing and characterizing kidney stones,
      what is unknown is how the loss in resolution with an ultra-low dose CT protocol might affect
      this localization and characterization of stones relative to a regular dose CT (current
      protocol), as well as the ability to find alternate diagnoses. Incorporating this additional
      imaging study in a subgroup of patients during the observational phase will allow us to
      determine test characteristics of the ULDCT that will allow incorporation into the
      prospective phase. This will hopefully provide excellent evidence about how to implement an
      ultra-low dose CT scan in practice, ultimately leading to a dramatic reduction in radiation
      exposure for a large number of patients at Yale and other sites.

      Future Direction: Ultimately the investigators intend to implement the validated decision
      rule at both study sites to evaluate further the feasibility, physician acceptance and
      comparative effectiveness of our rule. Using standard dissemination techniques and
      integration of the rule into the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system at our
      institutions the investigators will determine the actual reduction in the number of FPP CT
      scans ordered, clinical outcomes based on 90-day follow up, survey of physician acceptance of
      the rule as well as an comparative effective analysis. The investigators will submit an
      application at a later date nearing the end of our projected enrollment for this study.
