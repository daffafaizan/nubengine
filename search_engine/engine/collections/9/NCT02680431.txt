      benign cutaneous neurofibromas and malignant tumors. Timely detection of malignant
      transformation in NF1 tumors is of great clinical importance. Also methods to easily monitor
      individual's overall tumor burden would be useful. Blood plasma is collected from NF1
      patients and age- and gender-matched controls. The samples are stored at -80 C until
      analysis. Free circulating plasma DNA is extracted and quantified using commercial reagents.
      Also a previously described chemical detection method to observe overall changes in plasma
      composition is utilized. The analysis results are compared between NF1 patients and healthy
      controls, and also correlated with NF1 tumor burden and diagnosis of malignancy during
      five-year follow-up.
