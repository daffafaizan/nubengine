    
      This study has been designed as two sequential randomized trials to test two separate
      expanded choice set interventions, with the second randomization enrollment being contingent
      on results from the first. All enrolled subjects will be asked if they would like to complete
      an advance directive and will have been randomized to receive either an expanded answer
      choice set or a standard answer choice, as described in detail elsewhere. Only those subjects
      who express a desire to complete an advance directive from both arms will then be randomized
      again in a stratified fashion to receive either a standard advance directive or one with an
      expanded choice set for the decisions regarding life-sustaining therapy, as described in
      detail elsewhere.
