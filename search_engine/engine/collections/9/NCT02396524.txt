      encourage men to lead a healthier lifestyle through a sport-related medium. FFIT is a
      gender-sensitized, weight loss and healthy living program developed for delivery to
      overweight and obese men through professional football clubs. Published results from FFIT
      show that the program was able to actively recruit and engage men and for the men who
      participated, sustained weight loss and positive lifestyle change was observed (Hunt et al.,
      2014).

      This study will use a two-arm, pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The
      investigators will conduct the study in conjunction with two Ontario Junior A Hockey Clubs.
      Following assessment of eligibility and baseline measurements, men will be individually
      randomized (1:1; stratified by club) to either the intervention group (receiving the Hockey
      FIT program) or to the comparison group (usual care wait-list control). The comparison group
      will be offered to start the Hockey FIT program after a 12-week delay. All men (both
      intervention and comparison groups) will receive publicly available healthy eating and
      physical activity materials at baseline. Measurements will be taken at baseline and 12 weeks
      (both groups) and again at 12 months (intervention group only).

      The results of this study will be used to inform a fully-powered RCT where the primary
      objective will be to determine whether, compared to the usual care wait-list control group,
      the Hockey FIT group will lose weight (at least 5% weight loss from baseline) at 12 months.
