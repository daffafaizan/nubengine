      of three potential doses/schedules of oral seliciclib in patients with newly diagnosed,
      persistent, or recurrent Cushing disease. Up to 29 subjects will be treated with up to 800
      mg/day oral seliciclib for 4 days each week for 4 weeks and enrolled in sequential cohorts
      based on efficacy outcomes. The study will also evaluate effects of seliciclib on quality of
      life and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing disease.
