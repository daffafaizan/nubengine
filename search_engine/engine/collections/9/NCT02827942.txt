      Patients who have never undergone the H. pylori eradication therapy are randomly assigned to
      the dual therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg bid and amoxicillin 500 mg tid for 1 week or the
      triple therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg bid, amoxicillin 750 mg bid and clarithromycin 200 mg
      bid for 1 week.

      Patients who have ever failed in the eradication of H. pylori by the triple therapy
      containing clarithromycin are randomly assigned to the dual therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg bid
      and amoxicillin 500 mg tid for 1 week or the triple therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg bid,
      amoxicillin 750 mg bid and metronidazole 250 mg bid for 1 week.

      Success or failure of eradication was determined by the 13C-urea breath test performed at 1
      month after the therapy.
