      control ventilation (ACV) rather than pressure support ventilation (PSV). To determine if any
      differences in the duration of weaning reflected differences in the work of breathing, the
      rate of asynchrony or the level of respiratory muscle strength.

      Patients and methods: Thirty-six infants, median gestational age 29 (range 24 to 39) weeks,
      were randomized to weaning by either ACV or PSV. The duration of weaning was recorded. At
      baseline (study entry), 24 hours after entering the study and immediately prior to
      extubation, the work of breathing was assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure
      time product (PTPdi), thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA) was assessed using respiratory
      inductance plethysmography and respiratory muscle strength measured by recording the maximal
      inspiratory pressure produced during an airway occlusion during crying (Pimax). Immediately
      prior to extubation, the level of active expiration was also assessed.
