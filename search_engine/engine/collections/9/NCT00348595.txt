      with approximately 232,090 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2005. Unfortunately, despite
      local treatment, many men will demonstrate evidence of PSA recurrence. At the present time,
      there is no standard treatment fo these patients. The management of patients with PSA
      recurrence remains greatly controversial. Androgen deprivation is frequently employed in
      patients with evidence of rising PSA levels despite the fact that the effects on quantity and
      quality of life of androgen deprivation therapy at this stage, remains un-established.
      Toxicity of androgen deprivation therapy is a major factor to be considered in the decision
      process of employing the modality of treatment in patients with no symptoms associated with
      this disease. Because patients with biochemical relapse are mostly asymptomatic and typically
      have long survivals and disease free survivals, mush of the focus of new drug development has
      been with the use of non-cytotoxic compounds. This study is intended to provide preliminary
      evidence of a biological effect in a dose response manner assessing the effects of Revlimid
      (CC-5013) on PSA.
