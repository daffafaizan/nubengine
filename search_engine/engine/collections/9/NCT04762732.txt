      flap (ALT) is associated with significant morbidity. Incisional negative pressure wound
      therapy (NPWT) may decrease complications in high-risk incisions. Successful use of NPWT has
      been reported in the treatment of ALT flap donor site wounds in a retrospective observational
      study, but no prospective study of NPWT application in the ALT flap donor site has been
      reported. This study aims to assessed the incidence of complications at ALT flap donor site
      with an incisional NPWT device, PREVENAâ„¢. A prospective, controlled, pair-matched study has
      been designed to compare the effectiveness, complication rate, and scar quality of ALT flap
      donor site between using incisional NPWT and conventional bolster dressing.
