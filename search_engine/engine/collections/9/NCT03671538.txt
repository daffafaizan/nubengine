      safety of Anlotinb combined With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients
      of Advanced Gene Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A:

      Patients were instructed to take 500mg/m2 pemetrexed as a 10-minute intravenous infusion and
      Cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and12mg Anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of
      a 21-day cycle.If there was no evidence of disease progression following a maximum of 4-6
      cycles of anlotinib plus chemotherapy, patients continued to receive single-agent anlotinib
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 62 patients will be
      enrolled to ensure complete treatments for primary endpoint analysis.
