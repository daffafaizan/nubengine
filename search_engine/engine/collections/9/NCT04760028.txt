      always been the focus of anesthesiologists.In recent decades, researchers have discovered
      that it is possible to monitor the effects of anesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG),
      so the information has come to be used to guide anesthesia management.The indicators derived
      from electroencephalogram (EEG) that can be used to judge the depth of anesthesia during
      general anesthesia, such as spectral edge frequency, burst inhibition rate, median power
      frequency, etc., were successively born. Thereafter, commercial instruments for monitoring
      the depth of anesthesia, such as EEG dual-frequency index, entropy module, Narcotrend index,
      etc., were also widely used in clinical practice.Although the anesthesia measurements or
      instrument has many advantages, but the use of these indicators are not considering the
      factors of age, and have been well documented for general anesthesia electroencephalography
      (eeg) of different ages is different, this means that in different age groups using the same
      monitoring indicators will lead to the judgment of anesthesia depth is larger
      error.Therefore, age should be considered in the process of monitoring the depth of clinical
      anesthesia, and appropriate indexes should be selected according to different ages to monitor
      the depth of anesthesia.However, it has not been thoroughly studied which indexes can be used
      to monitor the depth of anesthesia in each age group and how to conduct reasonable
      monitoring.Therefore, it is necessary to explore the monitoring indexes of depth of
      anesthesia in different age groups and the most appropriate monitoring program.

      The purpose of this study was to validate EEG indicators that can monitor the depth of
      anesthesia at different ages, including basic EEG power spectrum parameters and processed
      parameters, and to explore whether there is an optimal protocol for monitoring the depth of
      anesthesia at different ages.In order to facilitate the clinical selection of patients of
      different age groups to monitor the depth of anesthesia, the factor of age is considered so
      as to take individual monitoring.Finally, it can accurately judge the depth of anesthesia and
      accurately use the anesthetic drugs.
