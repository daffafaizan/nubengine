      physician-delivered ACT-based intervention for emotional eaters with overweight/obesity
      against standard care at a network of weight loss clinics. Psychology clinical PhD students
      trained physicians in the delivery of the brief manualized intervention and were available
      for regular consults. The intervention consisted of eight, 5-10 minute sessions that could be
      easily incorporated into the physician's current practice. Over the duration of the ACT
      intervention, physicians met individually with patients to teach them various techniques to
      address and improve mindfulness, acceptance, and values clarification and commitment, all of
      which emotional eaters have been found to struggle with (Forman & Butryn, 2014). The proven
      habit formation technique of if-then planning (Gollwitzer, 1993) was used throughout these
      sessions in order to train emotional eaters to habitually use ACT techniques and to change
      the maladaptive habit of eating in response to negative emotions.
