      intervention in the form of targeted, practical, action-oriented education to primary care
      physicians and nurses on safety and effectiveness of and how to use evidence-based smoking
      cessation treatment for those with psychiatric illness, termed academic detailing (AD), alone
      or in combination with practical support offered to the primary care physician / primary care
      team and the smoker with SMI in the form of a community health worker (CHW) will improve
      recommendation and utilization of standard of care smoking cessation treatments to and by
      those with SMI and, if so, whether the intervention improves smoking cessation rates for
      adults with SMI who smoke.

      To do so, the investigators will randomize primary care clinics that serve approximately 1300
      adult smokers with SMI who receive psychiatric rehabilitation services, Community Based
      Flexible Support (CBFS) or Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)), from the two largest
      providers of these services in the Boston area to either receive AD for their prescribers or
      not in a cluster randomized design. Half of the smokers with SMI in the study who receive
      primary care at the clinics assigned to the AD intervention to providers will be randomly
      assigned to be offered CHW support in addition to their ongoing psychiatric rehabilitation
      (CBFS or ACT) services.

      This study will also utilize mixed methods research to identify and define barriers and
      facilitators to implementation of components of the integrated care intervention in primary
      care clinical settings using an interactive convergent mixed-methods design. The aim of this
      portion of the study is to better understand the factors that impact the integration of
      Integrated Care and evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation for those with SMI in
      primary care settings. Qualitative interviews will be conducted for enrolled participants,
      CHWs, primary care physician, and stakeholders.
