      failure after hepatectomy may lead to increased postoperative mortality.Therefore, it is very
      important to make preoperative surgical decisions, evaluate the safety of the operation and
      identify which patients are likely to suffer from liver failure.Imaging omics is a newly
      emerging research method in recent years, which has great potential in cancer diagnosis and
      treatment, and can monitor treatment and predict the prognosis of patients, so as to better
      realize accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases.The artificial intelligence platform
      developed by IBM Watson for Watson tumor treatment decisions can provide treatment decisions
      and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions based on the key clinical
      data of liver cancer patients.
