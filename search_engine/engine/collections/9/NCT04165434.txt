      power and cardiorespiratory fitness on muscle condition, balance, load distribution in the
      lower limbs and aerobic capacity in patients with unilateral transtibial amputation (UTA).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six individuals with prosthesis over 3-months were selected.
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 17) denominated UTA who
      performed the evaluation and training recommended by the prosthesis (bodybuilding vs. aerobic
      interval-training on the exercise cycle ergometer). Group 2 (n = 9) denominated untrained
      unilateral transtibial (UUT) amputees who after the evaluation were not included for the
      recommended training. All patients were evaluated at the baseline time of randomization and
      eight weeks after. The evaluation consisted of anamnesis (inclusion criteria), clinical and
      functional evaluation, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, isokinetic knee testing, static and
      dynamic posturography. The age of the group was 28.5 ± 7.1 years old, BMI 25 ± 4.8 kg.m-2,
      amputation time 22 ± 27.5 months, 83% were men and 57% with amputation on the left side, 11%
      used antidepressants and 11% antihypertensive medicine.
