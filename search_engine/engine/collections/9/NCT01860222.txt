      and 1,000,000 new cases annually. It is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the
      third most common cause of cancer-related death,especially in East-Asia countries.SR remains
      the first therapeutic option for a cure but is suitable only for 9%-27% of patients.The
      presence of significant background cirrhosis often precludes liver resection for HCC.Even
      though these HCC patients undergo SR，the incidence of posthepatectomy liver failure(PHLF) and
      death would be high，especially to HCC patients complicating CSPH，whose corresponding risk of
      PHLF and persistent PHLF were 59.02%and 14.75%respectively in our past study. It is extremely
      urgent to search a safe and effective means in this subgroup of HCC patients.PLAT, a recently
      developed local ablative technique, has attracted the greatest interest and popularity
      because of its effectiveness and safety,with a 3-year survival rate of 62-77%,a low treatment
      complication rate of 8-9% and a low treatment mortality rate of 0-0.5%.However, there is
      still debate on whether PLAT or SR is the most suitable therapy for HCC.To our
      knowledge,there have been no study on the therapy of HCC complicating CSPH.
