    
      Prospectively collected matched sample types, including fingerstick (capillary blood), serum,
      plasma, and whole venous blood were obtained from subjects at three clinical trial sites
      within the United States. Informed consent was used to enroll subjects at low risk for HIV
      (N=120 subjects) and from subjects pre-diagnosed as HIV positive (N=299 subjects).

      The fingerstick samples were tested with Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay at the collection
      site, while the remaining matched sample types, (serum, plasma, and whole venous blood) were
      sent to a clinical lab to be tested on the Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay. Results of the
      Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay on each of 4 matched sample were compared to the serum
      result on the Bio-Rad GS HIV 1/HIV 2 PLUS O EIA, Bio-Rad HIV-1 Western blot, and the Bio-Rad
      Multispot HIV 1/HIV-2 Rapid Test (reference methods).

      Retrospective specimens from repositories or specimens purchased from commercial vendors were
      also included in the study. In addition to the Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay, the GS HIV
      1/HIV 2 PLUS O EIA, Bio-Rad HIV-1 Western blot, and the Bio-Rad Multispot HIV 1/HIV-2 Rapid
      Test were utilized as reference methods. Historical data, when available, was also used. All
      samples were identified with a unique study number and included the following
      populations/panels:

        1. HIV-1/HIV-2 False Reactive Samples (N=100)

        2. Unrelated Medical Conditions (N=40).

        3. Normal Pediatric Patients (N=10)

        4. HIV-1 Positive Pediatric Patients (N=40)

        5. HIV-1 Non B Group M Subtypes (N=136)

        6. HIV-1 Group O Antibody Positive (N=15)

        7. Known HIV-2 Positive Population (N=200)

        8. HIV Performance Panels

             1. Anti-HIV-1/2 Combo Performance Panel: PRZ208 (N=15)

             2. HIV-1 Low Titer Panel: PRB109 (N=20)

             3. HIV-1 Incidence / Prevalence Panel: PRB601 (N=15)

             4. HIV-1 Seroconversion Panels (26 Panels, N=230)

        9. CEPHIA Evaluation Panel (N=2500)
