      200 mcg QD and Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol 80 BID versus Beconase AQ Nasal Spray 168 mcg BID
      and QVAR Inhalation Aerosol 40 mcg BID versus Placebo Nasal Spray QD and Placebo Inhalation
      Aerosol BID on short term growth in pediatric subjects with mild asthma and allergic
      rhinitis. During the course of the study, subjects will be seen on a weekly basis and lower
      leg length will be measured using knemometry. Knemometry is a non invasive technique for
      measuring short-term lower leg growth in children and is currently the method of choice in
      growth studies of short duration. During the run-in and wash-out periods, subjects will not
      be treated with any medications or placebos. During the active treatment periods, subjects
      will be treated with Omnaris Nasal Spray 200 mcg QD and Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol 80 BID or
      Beconase AQ Nasal Spray 168 mcg BID and QVAR Inhalation Aerosol 40 mcg BID, or Placebo Nasal
      Spray QD and Placebo Inhalation Aerosol BID. Eligible subjects will be randomized into the
      study which will contain one run-in period (Period 1), 3 active treatment periods (Periods 2,
      4 and 6) and 2 washout periods (Periods 3 and 5). Each period will be of 3 weeks duration and
      the entire study duration will be 18 weeks. Subjects will be seen on a weekly basis for 18
      weeks and at each visit, lower leg length will be measured using knemometry.
