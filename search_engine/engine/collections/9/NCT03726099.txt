      effective approach to reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer. However, eradication
      rates of first-line therapy decreased over years due to the rapidly increasing antibiotic
      resistance of H. pylori worldwide. An ideal rescue therapeutic regimen to cure refractory
      H.pylori infection is currently warranted. Few published paper evaluated the efficacy of
      14-day furazolidone containing concomitant therapy in the third line treatment. This study
      aims to propose a new concomitant therapy for the patients with two or more treatment
      failure, and then evaluates whether adverse effects are tolerable. .
