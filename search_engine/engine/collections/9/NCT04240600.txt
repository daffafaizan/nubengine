      decreases the oncology therapy clinical response, functional ability and quality of life.
      Chemotherapy is used in these patients, some of them inhibit angiogenesis and act in an
      important way in physiological processes of muscle anabolism. The vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR) play a crucial role in both normal and malignant
      angiogenesis. Activation of the VEGF pathway leads to endothelial cell activation,
      proliferation and survival.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of the use of a high protein, high
      energy enteral with omega 3 formula (Supportan DKN) against a standard enteral formula
      (FresubinÂ® Original DRINK) on body composition, days of hospital stay, quality of life,
      associated muscular strength with levels of VEGF in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      during induction chemotherapy.

      An open clinical trial was designed, in which a group of patients will receive, as part of
      their nutritional requirements a hyperproteic hyperenergetic enteral formula versus standard
      formula during the 21 days of the first cycle of antineoplastic treatment. We will measure
      body composition, muscle strength and serum concentrations of VEGFR in both groups to be able
      to compare its effect.
