        -  To compare between forward head position and hand use of mobile phone on conduction
           velocity of upper limb nerves

        -  To investigate the F responses of upper limbs nerves.

        -  To investigate the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of median nerves

      BACKGROUND:

      Forward head position may affect the cervical nerve root so it can also affect nerve
      conduction velocity due to continues stretch on nerves, also the over use of smart phone by
      hand may be affected the hand nerves, so this study determine which one of them has more
      influence than the other.

      If the forward head position has the worst effect on the upper limb nerves investigators must
      avoid the incorrect position of the head to avoid stretch and compression of the nerves.

      HYPOTHESES:

      There are no statistical difference between forward head position and hand use of mobile
      phone on conduction velocity of the nerves of upper limb.

      SUBJECTS:

      Normal one hundred fifty non-athketic adolescents of both genders will participate in this
      study. Their age ranges from 14-18 years.

      METHODS FOR ASSESSMENT

        1. Electromyography (EMG) will be used to measure nerve conduction velocity, F-wave, motor
           action potential

        2. Soft collar will used to fixed the craniovertebral angle during used mobile phone
           Universal goniometer

        3. Goniometer pro iPhone application
