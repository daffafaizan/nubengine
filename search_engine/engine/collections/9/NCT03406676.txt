      low peripheral vascular resistance. The molecular basis for this feature is the increased
      production of NO. Methylene blue can increase peripheral resistance, the mechanism is:
      methylene blue is an oxidoreductase inhibitor, can inhibit the increased production of NO in
      the vascular endothelium, thereby increasing peripheral vascular resistance.
