      health organization, MDD affects more than 300 million people of all ages in the world.
      Treatments of MDD include pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy. Pharmacological
      treatments, mostly serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, have a delayed onset of action,
      require long-term treatment and have partial efficacy. In fact, only one third of patients
      respond to the first antidepressant treatment and two-third after multiple trials. So, there
      is a need for new treatment strategy.

      Light therapy is a well established non pharmacological treatment of seasonal affective
      disorder, a clinical subtype of affective disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of MDD
      occurring with a seasonal pattern. Patients are exposed to artificial light for a variable
      duration and intensity. Although the precise mechanism of bright light therapy remains
      unknown, it is thought to act through the eyes by activating the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the
      principal circadian pacemaker.
