      immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. These
      medications carry substantial side effects. In addition, these medicines often do not
      completely control damage to the kidney from the recipients' immune system, ultimately
      causing the kidney to fail.

      Medeor Therapeutics is developing a novel cell-based therapy as personalized cellular
      immunotherapies to improve outcomes in organ transplant recipients.

      The purpose of the current Phase 2/3 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of
      MDR-102 for the induction of immune quiescence in a prospective, randomized, open-label,
      multi-center clinical trial. MDR-102 is intended to induce mixed lymphohematopoietic
      chimerism and donor specific immune quiescence in order to preserve transplant kidney
      function, avert transplant kidney rejection, and reduce the cumulative and serious side
      effects associated with immunosuppression drugs.
