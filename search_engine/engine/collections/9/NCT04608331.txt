      hypoxia, hypercapnia, and sleep structure disorders; the latter include prolonged sleep
      latency, shortened sleep duration, frequent wake-up, and disordered circadian rhythm. During
      the postoperative period, surgical stress, pain and the residual effects of
      sedatives/analgesics can aggravate the sleep disorder and physiological changes in OSA
      patients. The resulting consequence is increased incidence of postoperative complications.

      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy can improve the oxygenation of OSA patients by forming
      a certain positive pressure in the nasopharyngeal cavity. Previous studies showed that HFNC
      therapy can reduce respiratory events, improve oxygenation in patients with moderate to
      severe OSA.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and
      anti-anxiety properties. Unlike other sedative agents, dexmedetomidine exerts its sedative
      effects through an endogenous sleep-promoting pathway, producing a state like non-rapid eye
      movement sleep without disturbing respiration. Our previous studies shows that
      dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can improve sleep quality and pain relief in patients
      after surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that, for patients at high-risk of OSA who are recovering from
      major non-cardiac surgery and receiving HFNC therapy, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia
      can improve sleep quality and postoperative recovery. The purpose of this pilot randomized
      controlled trial is to investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia on
      the sleep quality in high-risk OSA patients after major non-cardiac surgery.
