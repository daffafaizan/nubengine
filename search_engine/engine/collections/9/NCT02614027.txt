    
      Cross-sectional evaluation of two groups of patients:

        -  patients receiving currently available drugs, in order to determine the changes in fat
           accumulation by successive dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) determinations

        -  patients with previous lipodystrophy syndrome, as evaluated by questionnaire (HOPS) and
           total body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), in order to determine the prevalence of
           hypertension, low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, glucose disturbance
           (insulin resistance or diabetes), fat accumulation (waist circumference) and
           hypertriglyceridemia.

      The prevalence of Metabolic syndrome will be evaluated according to the different definitions
      (IDF, NCEP-ATP III, WHO).
