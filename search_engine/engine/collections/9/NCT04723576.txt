      workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure high-quality care for patients, by
      establishing the effectiveness of a tailored Stress First Aid (SFA) intervention, compared to
      usual care (UC). The RAND Corporation will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial
      (cRCT) with three cohorts containing matched pairs in approximately 40 diverse sites
      (hospitals and clinics) to evaluate whether SFA for HCWs improves mental and physical
      well-being compared to UC. Sequential roll-out of the intervention to three cohorts will
      allow investigators to quickly incorporate lessons learned and stakeholder feedback from each
      iteration into subsequent trainings, and share actionable findings given the urgency due to
      the pandemic. The end result will be an SFA toolkit tailored for HCWs that can be implemented
      and scaleable across multiple settings. The proposed SFA intervention addresses an important
      and compelling clinical care delivery challenge during COVID-19 by improving the mental
      well-being of HCWs, who will benefit directly and be better equipped to provide higher
      quality, more sustained, and more patient-centered care to patients. The specific aims of the
      project are to: (1) test the comparative effectiveness of SFA versus UC on mental and
      physical well-being (quantitative); (2) understand and document any UC activities to support
      HCW well-being prior to implementing SFA across sites; and (3) assess the experiences of HCWs
      and sites with SFA (acceptability, likelihood of uptake, lessons learned) and impact on HCW
      well-being (qualitative).
