      the operating field can impact on the cerebral venous drainage due to the effects of internal
      jugular venous outflow of blood and may increase intracranial pressure. The kinking of the
      internal jugular vein due to excessive neck flexion and rotation in park bench or flexion in
      the prone position may lead to kinking or twisting of the vein. This has been hypothesized as
      the major cause of disturbed venous drainage during surgery and in postoperative patients may
      lead to neck swelling, brachial plexus injury, macroglossia (swollen tongue), delayed airway
      obstruction and increases in intracranial pressure.

      Optimal brain perfusion is best in the neutral position of the head, but surgery cannot
      always be performed with this. Thus, we look to measure the internal jugular venous flow at
      different positions as there have been little studies looking at this important contributing
      factor.
