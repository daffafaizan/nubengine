    
      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy

        -  nephrotic syndrome

        -  normal renal function (serum creatinine [Screat] < 1.5 mg/dl)

        -  elevated urinary beta2-microglobulin and IgG

      Immunosuppressive therapy consisting of:

        -  cyclophosphamide 1.5 mg/kg/day for 12 months

        -  prednisone orally, 0.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 6 months

        -  i.v. methylprednisolone 1000 mg on days 1,2,3, 60,61,62, 120,121,122

      Study Groups:

        -  early: immediate start of immunosuppressive therapy at the time patient is identified as
           high-risk

        -  late: start of therapy after deterioration of renal function (increase of Screat > 25%
           and Screat > 1.5 mg/dl)

      Main Outcome Parameters:

        -  serum creatinine

        -  remission of proteinuria

        -  period of nephrotic proteinuria

        -  major side effects: hospitalisations, infections
