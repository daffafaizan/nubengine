    
      This explorative longitudinal prospective observational study is to explore different aspects
      of vessel wall characteristics as detected by magnet resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and
      positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) in patients with large vessel giant
      cell Arteriitis (LV-GCA) for their usefulness as predictive factor for future giant cell
      arteritis (GCA) relapse. It analyses parameters in PET/CT and MRI in patients with GCA at
      treatment stop which correlate with GCA relapse within the first 6 months after treatment
      stop.

      Patients included in the established local GCA database (BARK) will be screened for
      eligibility. Aortal imaging is performed during routine care according to established
      guidelines at diagnosis and during Follow Up at least every two years and before treatment
      stop.
