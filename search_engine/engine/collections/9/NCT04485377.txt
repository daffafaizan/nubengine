      young children (ages 0-5) eligible for the EITC (confirmed with screening questions regarding
      age, family size, marital status, and income) who either: 1) have utilized the program, or 2)
      have not utilized the program (do not file taxes or filed taxes but have not filed for EITC
      benefits). For the first group, the investigators will probe the value of the EITC benefits
      for their families, what experiences they had filing their taxes and receiving the benefit,
      how they spent the EITC benefits, and their thoughts about alternative approaches for benefit
      delivery that would better support their families. For the second group, the investigators
      aim to understand what they have heard of the program, why they may not have taken advantage
      of the benefits, and their recommendations for making the program more accessible. The
      investigators will also explore how EITC take-up varies by demographic variables, such as
      county of residence, income, and race/ethnicity, as well as children's and parents'
      characteristics, and enrollment in other programs designed to support low-income families
      with young children. The investigators will also ask questions about families' experiences
      with COVID-19 and related mitigation strategies (e.g. school closures, etc). As described in
      greater detail below, all data collection activities will be conducted in partnership with
      agencies such as WIC and Head Start, and through partnerships with the University of
      California Cooperative Extension program and other similar agencies.
