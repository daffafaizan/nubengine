      and posttransplant response of lung recipients to determine if short- and long-term graft
      outcome can be predicted and to allow for potential intervention. We have assembled a panel
      of assays that will test various functions of the immune response and investigate immune
      mechanisms involved in acute and chronic rejection (CR). Our overall hypothesis is that
      measurment of pre- and posttransplant immune response to donor HLA antigens/peptides can
      predict graft outcome. Our goal is to determine if immune parameters [ELISpot], intracellular
      T regulatory cells and ATP synthesis can identify lung recipients at high risk for developing
      AR and sub-clinical rejection. Sub-aim: To determine the correlation of cytokine genotypes
      with ELISpot results and T regulatory cell level and activity for recipients at high risk for
      developing acute rejection in comparison to a normal subject cohort. A second hypothesis is
      that recipients who experience an AR episode and remain responsive to donor antigen and those
      who show increased reactivity to donor HLA peptides are at high risk for developing CR. Our
      goal is to determine if the immune parameters (CFSE responder frequencies and response to
      donor peptides are assayed by CFSE, ELISpot, T regulatory cell level, and ATP synthesis) can
      identify lung recipients at high risk for developing CR and distinguish these immune
      parameters from a normal subject cohort. If successful, we will provide clinicians with the
      information necessary for individualization of immunosuppression intervention aimed at
      improving short and long-term graft outcome.
