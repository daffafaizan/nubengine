    
      This is a phase I-II, randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial, currently ongoing in
      eleven Spanish hospitals, to evaluate the safety and feasibility, as well as clinical
      efficacy evidence, of a bioengineered human anterior corneal substitute in adults with severe
      trophic corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatment, or with sequelae of previous
      ulcers. In the initial phase of the trial (n=5), patients were sequentially recruited, with a
      safety period of 45 days, receiving the bioengineered corneal graft. In the second phase of
      the trial (currently ongoing), subjects are block randomised (2:1) to receive either the
      corneal graft (n=10), or amniotic membrane (n=5), as the control treatment. Adverse events,
      implant status, infection signs and induced neovascularization are evaluated as determinants
      of safety and feasibility of the bioengineered graft (main outcomes). Study endpoints are
      measured along a follow-up period of 24 months, including 27 post-implant assessment visits
      according to a decreasing frequency. Intention to treat, and per protocol, and safety
      analysis will be performed.
