      that lutein and zeaxanthin potentially protect against chronic diseases, including
      age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, coronary heart disease and stroke. Plasma
      concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are closely associated with their antioxidant
      properties and with their protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS).

      Choline is recognized as an essential nutrient for health because of its many functions in
      growth and development, as well as neurological function and formation of membrane
      phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin.

      Therefore the objective of this study is to demonstrate that inclusion of eggs in a
      plant-based diet will potentiate the benefits of this healthy diet by increasing plasma
      concentrations of lutein, zexanthin and choline presents in egg yolks and theoretically
      increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of these components. This would be
      potentially more important in those individuals with metabolic syndrome, which is the target
      population of this intervention.
