immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  isolation and purificationof antigen for intradermal skin tests.an antigen for intradermal skin tests wasextracted from the homogenate of dirofilariaimmitis with a phosphate buffer atph 7.2 and purified by sephadex g-100 gelfiltration, cm-cellulose chromatography anddeae sephadex a-50 column chromatography.the finally purified antigen, fscd1,was a protein with a small amount ofcarbohydrate (2.5%) and gave a relativelybroad band by electrophoresis on cellogelfilm.  the aminoacids detected by high-voltagepaper-electrophoresis of the acidhydrolyzate of the antigen were lysine, arginine,glycine, alanine, glutamic andaspartic acids, and valine.  wheals and anerythema appeared within 15 min. of theinjection of the antigen 0.05 , on proved filariasispatients.  cross reactions wereexamined in patients with p. westermani,s. japonicum, hookworm, a. lubricoidesor e. vermicularis, but only weak skin reactionswere noticed in all cases.  theprotein nature of the antigen was further provedby the fact that proteolytic enzymesdestroyed the antigenic activity to a considerableextent.
