      recruited from Chang Gung Medical Foundation, Keelung Branch after they have provided
      informed consent. These subjects will be randomized into the trained (n=40) and the control
      groups (n=40). The trained subjects will be trained on a bicycle ergometer at about 60-70%of
      heart rate reserve for 35-55 minutes (that will include 10-min warm-up, 15-35-min main
      exercise, and 10-min cool-down) per day, 3 days per week for 12 weeks. The control subjects
      will maintain their normal living pattern. Subjects' physical fitness, oxygen transport and
      utilization of exercising skeletal muscles, cardiovascular functions and hemodynamics, blood
      cell parameters, RBC deformity and aggregation, plasma biomarkers of myocardial damage, and
      thrombotic factors/reactions will be measured at pre-training stage and following the 8th and
      12th week of the training program. Experimental results were analyzed by descriptive
      statistics (percentage, mean, and standard deviation), independent t-test, two-way ANOVA, and
      two-way ANCOVA. Previous researches were mainly focus on systolic heart failure, less on
      diastolic heart failure. We study the above parameter to realize the physiological response
      to exercise of these patients and discover the appropriate exercise intensity for
      prescription.
