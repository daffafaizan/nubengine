      PRF is often used technique to alleviate chronic radicular neuropathic pain, although good
      clinical results are observed the precise (central ) working mechanism is still unknown. This
      study aims to find the central working mechanism.

      The investigator postulate the existence of central -cerebral effect of PRF on the DRG
      (dorsal root ganglion). If the investigator can detect the effect using fMRI and demonstrate
      the objective unequivocal proof that PRF on the DRG works than the investigator will be able
      to promote this technique for further use in the chronic pain states.
