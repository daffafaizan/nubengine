    
      The study will be conducted in two parts and will include an open label phase of a single
      dose of IC14 (Part A) and a randomized phase of multiple doses of IC14 and placebo (Part B).
      Up to 52 patients will be enrolled in both parts of the study.

      Part A will consist of 12 patients given one of three doses of IC14 as a single dose
      open-label . Each patient must complete 14 days before the enrollment of subsequent patients.
      Part A subjects will be hospitalized for 4 days. During and at the end of 4-day admission to
      the clinical research unit, and on Study Days 5, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 32, Part A patients will
      have their health status assessed. The last subject in Part A must complete 32 days of
      participation before Part B of the trial is opened.

      Part B consists of 40 patients randomized equally to one of 4 dosing regimens which will
      include a single dose or multiple doses of IC14 or placebo given at different dosing
      frequencies. In Part B, Cohort 1 and 2 subjects (single dose) will be inpatient for 4 days
      and Cohort 3 and 4 subjects (four daily doses) will be inpatient for 5 days. During and at
      the end of the admission to the clinical research unit, and on Study Days 5, 6, 7, 14, 21 and
      32, Part B patients will have their health status assessed.
