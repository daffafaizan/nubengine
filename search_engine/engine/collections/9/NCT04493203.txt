      to anti-PD1 therapy. Axitinib has already been safely combined with anti-PD1 therapy and was
      overall well-tolerated. With nivolumab plus axitinib taken together, based on previously
      published work and data from our laboratories, it is hypothesized that axitinib can
      metabolically remodel the TME to render it more sensitive to ICB, specifically by reducing
      intra-tumoral hypoxia, increasing T cell infiltration, and increasing polyfunctional T cells.
      It will determined if treatment with nivolumab plus axitinib will prolong both
      progression-free and overall survival.
