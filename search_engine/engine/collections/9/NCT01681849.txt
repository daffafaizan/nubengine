      brain function in women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse.
      Participants underwent baseline assessment with of PTSD symptoms measured with the Clinician
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and brain function during exposure to traumatic scripts of
      childhood abuse. Participants then were treated in a randomized double-blind fashion with
      paroxetine or placebo for three months, followed by a repeat of these assessments.

      Specific Aims of this proposal were therefore to:

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine on PTSD symptoms

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine on brain function in conjunction with exposure to
           traumatic scripts using positron emission tomography (PET) with O-15 water
