      frequent. These types of resection problems occur because of wound complications caused by
      large perineal defects. Indeed, perineal wound complications, perineal abscess, wound
      dehiscences, chronic fistulas and sinuses lengthen the hospital stays. Futhermore, the
      standardization of the surgery since the late 2000s and the extralevator technique lead a
      larger defect and increase i perineal complications.

      Several strategies are used to decrease the complication rate. Closure by direct
      approximation of the pelvic muscles leads to a rate of major complication up to 57% depending
      on the series. Musculocutaneous flaps help to reduce this rate (16- 65%) but they generate
      their own morbidity, require experience and increase the costs of care. Finally, the use of
      biologic meshes since the beginning of 2010 seems to have improve the healing process.
      However, results are still variable and the only randomized study comparing direct closure
      and mesh closure showed no significant results at one year. Another ongoing randomized trial
      is comparing gluteus maximus flap to mesh closure and focusing on physical performances.

      This increase in post-operative complications and their consequences causes an increase in
      costs. In addition, they affect the patients' quality of life and lead to a loss of
      productivity. From an oncological point of view, perineal scarring problems can cause a delay
      in the adjuvant therapeutic sequence. Few studies have highlighted the efficiency of perineal
      wound complications, using cost-effectiveness analyses. In order to clarify the best strategy
      comparing primary and mesh closure in term of cost effectiveness on perineal healing after
      ELAPE, we designed this randomized controlled trial.
