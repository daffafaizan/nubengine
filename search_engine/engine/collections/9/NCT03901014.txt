      carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD, <50 grams carbohydrate/day) for two weeks. Participants
      will undergo an oral stable isotope tracer study during each diet to measure de novo
      synthesis of fatty acid, cholesterol, ketone bodies, and for measurement of apolipoprotein B
      and triglyceride kinetics.
