      other clean surgical procedures. Considering the large numbers of patients who undergo
      breast-related procedures per year and the increasing use of immediate breast reconstruction
      with placement of tissue expanders or immediate implant reconstruction, a surgical site
      infection involving the implant can result in its removal and a failed reconstruction.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine if chlorhexidine disk application and irrigation
      of the drainage bulb with dilute Dakin's solution (buffered sodium hypochlorite
      solution)after tissue expander breast reconstruction or immediate implant reconstruction,
      effectively decreases rates of bacterial colonization in drain fluid compared to standard
      care.

      Methods:

      Patients undergoing bilateral immediate reconstruction with tissue expander placement will
      have one surgical site treated with standard drain care and the other treated with a drain
      antisepsis regimen. Drain antisepsis intervention will consist of two measures: 1) placement
      of a chlorhexidine sponge dressing at the drain exit site, and 2) twice daily irrigation of
      the drainage bulb with dilute Dakin's solution (buffered hypochlorite).

      All patients will undergo semiquantitative cultures of the drain bulb at one week
      postoperatively. This culture will be repeated at the time of drain removal, with
      simultaneous cultures of the fluid in the bulb as well as an internal segment of each removed
      drainage tube. All patients will be evaluated for clinical signs of infection and for any
      adverse reactions to the drain antisepsis at the follow-up visits.
