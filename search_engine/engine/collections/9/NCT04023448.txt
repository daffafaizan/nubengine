      surgery is as high as 70%, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. LARS may
      be related to the injury of anal internal sphincter, anal sensory nerve injury, defecation
      reflex pathway injury, changes in anorectal Angle and rectum sigmoid Angle, changes in new
      rectal sensory function and compliance, and changes in dynamics,etc. After AR surgery, the
      rectum loses its good compliance and the storage capacity is reduced, which is one of the
      important reasons for the increased frequency and urgency of defecation.Therefore, on the
      basis of traditional colon-rectum (or anal canal) end-to-end anastomosis, "J" shaped pouch
      anastomosis, end-to-end anastomosis, coloplasty and other special anastomosis methods were
      performed. Meanwhile, for the lack of objective evaluation index, the results were not
      credible. The LARS score was first published in 2012,and has been validated, evaluated, or
      used as an outcome measure in more than 30 published scientific papers. Further
      more,laparoscopic surgery is widely used in gastrointestinal surgery. Herein, current
      randomized controlled trial comparing coloplasty with straight colorectal anastomosis in LARS
      in order to guide clinical practise was conducted.
