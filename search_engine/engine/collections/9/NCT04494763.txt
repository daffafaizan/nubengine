    
      (a) Aim and Objectives:

      Aim: To study the effect of beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleed in
      infants and children with biliary atresia.

      Primary objective: Bleeding free survival over 18 months FU

      Secondary objectives:

      (i) Progression, persistence or regression of esophageal and gastric varices, and portal
      hypertensive gastropathy over 3, 6, 12 and 18 months FU

      (ii) Overall survival at 18 months FU

      (b) Methodology: This will be an open label randomized controlled study where infants and
      children with biliary atresia from 6 months to 5 years fulfilling inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled to receive propanolol or placebo for a duration of 18 months or
      till the occurrence of variceal bleed.

      i. Study design: Open label randomized controlled study with stratified randomization.

      ii. Intervention: Beta-blocker (Propanolol) versus placebo.

      iii. Study period: 1.5 years

      iv. Study population: Infants and children from 6 months to 5 years of age with Biliary
      atresia fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      (c) Expected outcome of the project: Beta-blockers reduce the incidence of variceal bleed in
      infants and children with biliary atresia.
