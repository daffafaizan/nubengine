      with AIS confirmed through early brain imaging has been constituted.

      Regular contacts with the families and their local physician have been maintained since
      enrollment. In 2010, families were asked through postal mail to participate in the 7 years
      assessment (AVCnn7ans). Those who accepted were contacted by phone by the coordinators of the
      study during the months preceding the child's seventh birthday and invited to attend a
      presentation in person of the current project. This evaluation took place face-to-face for a
      whole day in a medical setting close to the family residence. The evaluation team included a
      neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and either a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric
      physical and rehabilitation medicine practitioner.
