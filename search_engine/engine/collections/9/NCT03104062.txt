      who are including individuals with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) treated with
      fibrinolytic and openly randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel within 24 hours of the onset
      of symptoms. Patients will be submitted to coronary angiography within 4 (± 2) days of the
      onset of symptoms, and those who, at the end of coronary angiography, present residual
      obstruction in the culprit vessel of less than 50% and have TIMI 3 flow, regardless of have
      undergone percutaneous coronary intervention will be included.

      Following, on day 2 (± 1) days after coronary angiography (therefore 6 ± 3 days from the
      onset of symptoms), they will be submitted to microcirculation perfusion evaluation by means
      of MPSI (myocardial perfusion score index) obtained by MCE (Microbubble contrasted
      echocardiography) - blood collection for evaluation of Platelet aggregability will be
      performed immediately prior to the start of MCE. Finally, in order to evaluate left
      ventricular remodeling, patients will undergo a new Echocardiography within 90 (± 10) days
      after discharge.
