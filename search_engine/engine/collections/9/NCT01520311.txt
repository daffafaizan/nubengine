      certain inclusion criteria, including GSV duplex-sonography results and consent. They will be
      enrolled based on their clinically indicated requirement for coronary artery bypass grafting
      with use of their saphenous vein graft. The study will be prospective, randomized repeated
      measure controlled trial based on the patient's ability to receive both control and eSVS Mesh
      treatment. Graft patency, MACCE at 6 and 24 months after meshed and non meshed GSV graft
      implantation will be measured and the findings and qualification of GSV in preoperative
      duplex sonography will be compared with intraoperative findings while GSV harvesting in order
      to evaluate the safety of the eSVS mesh and the role of preoperative GSV duplex sonography.
