    
      Due to the great global impact of amblyopia, there is a medical and social need and, at the
      same time, a clear market niche for the design and development of new clinically validated
      treatments aimed at improving the efficacy ratios of conventional treatments such as patching
      or penalization.

      In this context, the ultimate goal of the NEIVATECH project is to evaluate the safety and
      clinical efficacy of a system that integrates Virtual Reality hardware and software
      technologies for visual training in amblyopic children by combining perceptual learning and
      dichoptic stimuli with a gamification approach.
