      plus 3TC or d4T plus ddI based on investigator and patient preference. Patients are
      stratified based on the number of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
      treatments that are changed at entry and on screening HIV-1 RNA (obtained within 30 days of
      entry) as follows: switched 1 NRTI and 10,000-50,000 copies/ml vs switched 1 NRTI and greater
      than 50,000 copies/ml vs switched 2 NRTIs and 10,000-50,000 copies/ml vs switched 2 NRTIs and
      greater than 50,000 copies/ml. Patients are randomized within each of these strata to 1 of
      the following treatment arms:

      Arm 1: MKC-442 placebo plus nelfinavir. Arm 2: MKC-442 plus nelfinavir. Arm 3: MKC-442 plus
      nelfinavir (higher dose). Treatment is administered for 48 weeks. Patients who are considered
      virologic successes at Week 48 may continue to receive MKC-442 at the discretion of the
      investigator.
