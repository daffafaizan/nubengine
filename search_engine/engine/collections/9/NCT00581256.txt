    
      1. Primary Objective 1.1 To compare the extent of new myocardial perfusion defects
           following breast cancer radiotherapy using the best standard 3-D radiotherapy technique,
           partially wide tangent fields, versus the best optimized technique.

        2. Secondary Objectives 2.1 To compare changes in ejection fraction and alterations in
           cardiac wall motion with treatment by technique 2.2 To compare changes in lung perfusion
           defects and pulmonary function tests (DLCO, FEV1, and FVC) by technique 2.3 To compare
           rates of pericarditis and pneumonitis by technique

      Cardiac Endpoints: Myocardial SPECT-CT perfusion defects, ejection fraction, alterations in
      cardiac wall motion, per SPECT-CT (adenosine stress and rest (if necessary)) scan.

      Pulmonary Endpoints: Lung SPECT-CT perfusion defects per SPECT-CT scan, and changes in
      pulmonary function tests: DLCO, FEV1, FVC Clinical Endpoints: pericarditis and pneumonitis.
