      repressing an anti-allograft immune responses after kidney transplantation. This study aims
      to address two major challenges in kidney transplantation: 1. to guide physicians when
      immunosuppressive drugs are weaned, and 2. to identify patients who are at risk or in the
      process of developing antibody-mediated rejection. In this study, blood will be collected
      from kidney transplant patients during different timepoints, prior to and after their
      transplant. Knowledge gained from study findings will be used to develop therapeutic
      strategies to prevent antibody-mediated rejection, which is a major cause of long-term graft
      loss in kidney transplant patients.
