      inspiratory muscles strength, health status, and functional capacity are observed. Muscle
      strength is evaluated using Micro RPM (Respiratory Pressure Meter) Carefusion®. Health status
      is evaluated using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), while functional capacity
      is evaluated by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).

      Patients were recruited by consecutive sampling. This study was granted ethical approval from
      the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia
      Subjects exercised using inspiratory muscle trainer (Philips Respironic®) for 8 weeks.
      Inspiratory muscles strength (Maximal Inspiratory Pressure, MIP) and 6MWT were done at the
      beginning for basic data and were re-evaluated during the second, fourth, sixth and eighth
      week (last week). Questionnaire (SGRQ) was done at the initial and end of research.

      Training dose with IMT was determined by inspiratory muscle strength result and adjusted in
      every evaluation visit. The subject was expected to do exercise twice daily for 15 minutes
      each session with 30-70% intensity from determined MIP score. Exercise is monitored and noted
      in a logbook.
