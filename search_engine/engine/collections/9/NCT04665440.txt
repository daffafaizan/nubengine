      saliva of neonates with gestational age ranging from 32 to 34 completed weeks and in the
      saliva of their mothers. The measurements are taken before and after sensorial stimuli
      including mother voice exposure +/- tactile distraction for 10 minutes. The two interventions
      are performed between day 5 and day 12 after birth and 24 to 48 hours apart. Each child is
      randomised in a group depending on order of the two interventions.

      Investigators hypothesize that an increase in the oxytocin/cortisol ratio will be occurred in
      neonates after hearing their mothers and that simultaneous tactile stimulation will mitigate
      that effect.

      Concomitantly, the neonate's vital signs and his facial expressions are recorded during
      interventions. The mothers anxiety level is assessed PSS-NICU questionnaire given before the
      first and after the second intervention.
