        -  Compare the rates of overnight hospitalization due to toxicity (e.g., blood transfusion,
           antibiotic use, and to obtain relief of treatment-related symptoms) of patients with
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin vs gemcitabine and
           carboplatin.

        -  Compare the need for hospitalization for chemotherapy administration in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tumor response rate of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the relief of tumor-related symptoms in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect on Karnofsky performance status in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      (IIIA vs IIIB [dry] vs IIIB [wet] or IV) and performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours
           on days 1 and 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin
           IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months and then every 3-4 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
