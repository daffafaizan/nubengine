      to mineral particles, metals, and dust. The impact on health is considerable in terms of
      prevalence, morbidity and healthcare costs. Pathologists rarely report the presence of a
      possible mineral or metal-related etiology in a specimen by lack of available and convenient
      technology. Therefore, several respiratory diseases are considered idiopathic.

      Interstitial lung disease (ILD), also known as diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) is a
      group of lung diseases affecting the interstitium (the tissue and space around the air sacs
      of the lungs). In France, 15.000 new cases of ILD are diagnosed each year. ILD may be
      classified according to the cause. Idiopathic ILD are ILD of unknown causes. The most
      frequent idiopathic ILD are sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).These two
      diseases are the core topic of the present study since they may relate to important mineral
      or metal exposure.

      The overall goal of this MEDICO-LIBS study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a
      laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)-based instrument to image(ie, identify, localize
      and possibly quantify) metals within selected human specimens with ILDs.
