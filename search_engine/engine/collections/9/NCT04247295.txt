      fractures are prone to slipping. As a result, patients may end up with surgical treatment
      which would otherwise not be needed if the plaster were to hold the fracture position
      adequately. If one was shown to be better compared to the other, then all hospitals could
      start to use a more effective treatment.

      With traditional casting, some of the details of the fracture are missed due to the shadowing
      on the x-ray. The woodcast aims to reduce this shadowing, allowing a more detailed image of
      the fracture and hopefully a better outcome. Problems may arise with the plaster cast, at one
      or two week scans, in which the cast may need to be removed for imaging, this could lead to
      displacement of the fracture effecting the outcome. Woodcast would potentially not need to be
      removed or is easily removed due to the fact that it is not a complete cast and so would
      hopefully improve the outcomes for the patient.
