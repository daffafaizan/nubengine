    
      This protocol is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, outpatient study to compare the IOP
      lowering ability and safety profile of the SOLX Gold Shunt to the selected, commercially
      available aqueous shunt product (i.e., Control shunt Model FP7 Ahmed™ Glaucoma Valve Flexible
      Plate™) for a period of up to one year. Extended follow up is scheduled for a period not to
      exceed two years, should this be necessary for regulatory purposes. Follow-up beyond one year
      will be expected unless other patients with SOLX Gold Shunt implants in earlier phase studies
      outside the US clearly show no significant adverse effects associated with the long-term use
      of the device for follow-up periods exceeding one year, and this information is deemed
      adequate to reduce the required follow-up period under this protocol to a shorter period,
      such as 6 months for the last-to-enter patients at the time of filing for 510(k) marketing
      clearance review with the FDA.
