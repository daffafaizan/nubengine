      factors. Thus the prevalence rates for urinary stones change from 1% to 20%. 1,2 Genetic
      polymorphism also causes nephrolithiasis. The most known polymorphic genes are the
      calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and matrix gla protein (MGP),
      plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU). 3,4 Furthermore, the concordance rate of the stone
      disease in monozygotic twins is substantially higher than in dizygotic ones (32.4% vs. 17.3%)
      demonstrating that genetic factors play a vital role in the formation of nephrolithiasis. 5
      Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) has been shown to be a new androgen receptor
      regulator. HIPK2 and androgen were demonstrated to mediate kidney tubular epithelial cell
      injury and apoptosis.

      Informations on HIPK2 polymorphism about renal stone formation are newfound and inconclusive.
      Therefore, in this study, authors aimed to investigate whether HIPK2 polymorphism is
      associated with renal stone formation in Turkish population or not.
