      performing daily tasks independently; therefore, measurements of these forces end up being
      useful markers to evaluate the performance and the physical development of the child. It was
      developed a peripheral containing three devices and instrumented for analyzing the force
      applied during execution of the cylindrical grip movement, pinch pulp-side and pinch
      pulp-pulp in different situations of the daily life of the volunteer. The data acquisition
      interface was developed in a software for data recording. For the peripheral functionality
      tests, thirty volunteers of both genders were selected. They were also students of the Sports
      Secretary, with no motor abnormalities, between seven and ten years old.
