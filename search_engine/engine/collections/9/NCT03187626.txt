      Base-of-thumb osteoarthritis induces pain and hand-specific limitations in activities. For
      short and midterm effects, therapeutic options usually include splinting, exercise therapy
      and intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids or hyaluronic acid. However, evidence of
      efficacy of intra-articular therapies in base-of-thumb osteoarthritis and international
      guidelines are inconsistent. Recently, the use of intra-articular botulinum toxin A as a pain
      killer has raised intense interest. The exact mechanisms of pain modulation by botulinum
      toxin A in osteoarthritis are unclear. It has been suggested that botulinum toxin A could
      directly reduce peripheral sensitization and indirectly reduce central sensitization. Indeed,
      recent studies suggest an inhibitory role of botulinum toxin A on the release of mediators
      involved in nociception, such as P substance, calcitonin gene-related peptide and glutamate.
      Open and randomized controlled trials of botulinum toxin A in knee osteoarthritis support
      short to mid-term positive clinical effects on pain. However, no study has reported results
      for base-of-thumb osteoarthritis
