      investigational drug Patupilone, a tubulin-inhibitor.

      The purpose of the trial is to prolong PFS in this patient population. Patupilone is already
      used in clinical trials of other tumor entities such as ovarian cancer, breast and lung
      cancer. Side effects are expected to be manageable.
