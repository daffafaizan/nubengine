    
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized trial to investigate whether a strategy of
      ongoing, long-term oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 15 mg daily is superior to a
      strategy of antiplatelet therapy, ASA 75-160 mg, alone in preventing cerebral embolic events
      in moderately high risk patients following successful catheter ablation for atrial
      fibrillation..

      At least one year post-successful catheter ablation for AF or left atrial flutter/tachycardia
      without evidence of any clinically apparent arrhythmia recurrence based on at least one 24
      hour Holter and ECG within 6 months after the last ablation procedure and at least one 24
      hour Holter and ECG between 6 and 12 months post-ablation or beyond. Patient must have no
      atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia > 30 seconds detected on a minimum
      48 hour Holter monitor within two months prior to enrollment.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to ASA 75-160 mg daily or rivaroxaban 15 mg
      daily. Patients will be seen at 6 months, one year and every year thereafter for a minimum of
      3 years. Blood chemistry tests, ECG, holters and patient quality of life questionnaires will
      be done annually.

      Cerebral MRI scanning at baseline and at three years will be done for assessment of silent
      cerebral infarction. MRI imaging will be performed using a specific protocol.

      A pre-specified subset of patients will undergo insertion of a implantable loop recorder
      (ILR) capable of automated AF detection.
