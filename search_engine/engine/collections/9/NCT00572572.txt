      Subjects will be stratified prior to randomization based on previous administration of
      chemotherapy.

      Subjects will randomize to aprepitant or placebo with their first study cycle of chemotherapy
      and then cross over to opposite treatment with the second study cycle.

      Cisplatin-based regimen for germ cell tumors containing 20mg/m2/day IV days 1 through 5,
      first day of chemotherapy administration is day 1. Permitted treatment regimens:

      Regimen 1 (BEP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) IV on
      days 1 to 5 Bleomycin 30 U/IV on days 1, 8, 15

      Regimen 2 (EP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) IV on days
      1 to 5

      Regimen 3 (VIP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Ifosfamide (1200 mg/m2/day) IV on
      days 1 to 5 (with mesna uroprophylaxis at 100% ifosfamide dosing) Etoposide (75 mg/m2/day) IV
      on days 1 to 5

      Regimen 4 (VeIP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Ifosfamide (1200 mg/m2/day) IV on
      days 1 to 5 (with mesna uroprophylaxis at 100% ifosfamide dosing) Vinblastine (0.11
      mg/kg/day) IV on days 1 and 2

      Regimen 5 (EC) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Epirubicin (90 mg/m2/day) IV on day
      1

      Patients are treated on study for two cycles. At the completion of protocol therapy patients
      will receive additional chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating investigator.

      If a patient requires discontinuation of one medication or more on a regimen, the patient
      must be discontinued from the study.
