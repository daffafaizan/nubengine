      neurological insult and unpredictable variations in outcomes exist even among healthy preterm
      infants. The variations in preterm infants' outcomes have led to the supposition that the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment may negatively impact the health and
      development of these infants and significant research has been devoted to examination of
      light, noise, and caregiving interventions. Consequently, many NICUs have implemented
      neuroprotective strategies to reduce over simulation, promote sleep and facilitate brain
      development in high-risk infants including the grouping of care activities around a single
      caregiving event described as "clustering" or "bundling care". Yet, the number and type of
      caregiving activities that are included in bundled care and the timeframe between bundled
      care events has not been systematically studied. The inclusion and exclusion of certain care
      activities in any individual care event is often dictated by the infant's treatment plan or
      needs, but some activities like diapering may be optional. Understanding the impact of when
      to include optional, yet stress provoking interventions, will allow us to minimize overall
      environmental stress in hospitalized very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. Therefore, given
      the lack of data around bundled care, the investigators aim to explore through a randomized
      controlled design the impact of bundling diaper care activities on overall health of VLBW
      preterm infants. The investigators will include a focus on skin health because it is
      important to understand the benefits of decreased infant stress and any potential skin health
      trade-offs associated with longer versus shorter time between diapering care. Findings from
      this study will allow us to better understand the relationship between neonatal skin health
      while providing developmentally appropriate bundled care.
