inhibition by actinomycin d of bone resorptioninduced by parathyroid hormone or vitamin a.actinomycin d inhibits cell proliferation incontrol cultures of embryonic rat boneand prevents the stimulation of bone resorptionby parathyroid horome (pth) or vit.a.  with a dose of 0.004 /ml. of actinomycind, pth effects are only partially inhibitedand this inhibition can be overcomeby increasing the dose of pth.  thesefindings suggest that these agents act competitively.
