      radiotherapy (IMRT) will be used for external irradiation, with a dose of 45-50.4Gy /25-28
      fractions. Combined three-dimensional intracavitary/interstitial (IC/IS) brachytherapy was
      applied. The preferred dose fraction plan is 6Gy*5 fractions, or 7Gy*4 fractions. Whether to
      adopt supplement radiotherapy can be decided by the tumor regression. Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 is
      recommended as the first choice for concurrent chemotherapy, and TP or TC can also be
      considered. Single-drug weekly therapy should be completed for at least 3 cycles, and
      combined 3-week regimen should be completed for at least 1 cycle.

      Experimental group: from three days before radiotherapy to one week after radiotherapy, Kang
      Fu Pen (recombinant human superoxide dismutase) retention enema, 50ml/ time, once every other
      day. When rectal mucosa II degree reactions (NCI-CTCAE 5.0) occur, it is changed to 1
      day/time until 1 week after mucosal remission.

      Control group: 3 days before radiotherapy to the end of radiotherapy, no drug retention enema
      was used.
