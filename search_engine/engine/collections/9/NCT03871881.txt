      neurodevelopmental outcome in adulthood. The study investigates if brain maturation and
      development, and the neurocognitive outcome is compromised in patients with atrial or
      ventricular septal defects more than 20 years after diagnosis and treatment. Data on brain
      morphology, brain tissue architecture, and resting-state function will be obtained by 3.0
      Tesla MRI. Data on neurocognitive outcome will be obtained by a customized wide
      neuropsychological test battery. This study will clarify the extent of these patients'
      neurodevelopmental challenges and guide evaluate targeted interventions to alleviate
      potentially long-term effects.
