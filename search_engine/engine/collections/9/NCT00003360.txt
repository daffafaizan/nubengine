      humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) in patients with advanced colorectal
      cancer. II. Describe pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 131I-huAb A33 by external
      imaging in these patients. III. Determine the effect of human antihuman antibody response on
      pharmacokinetics and targeting of 131I-huAb A33 in this patient population. IV. Determine
      whether the dose planning methodology used here can adequately and safely be applied to
      routine radioimmunotherapy planning.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131 humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) by
      IV infusion over 20 minutes every 6-8 days for up to 8 weeks (depending on dosage). Patients
      receive a minimum of 6 weeks of treatments. In the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, patients are retreated no sooner than 6 weeks after the previous
      course. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 131I-huAb A33 to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 6 weeks after the
      last treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-24 patients accrued into this study over 16 months.
