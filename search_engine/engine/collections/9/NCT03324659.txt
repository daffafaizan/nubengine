      chronic pain, but the mechanisms are not clear.

      Combining treatments could produce analgesic effects that are additive, synergistic, or
      counteractive to each other. Here, the investigators examine the effects of a 4-week
      intervention in patients with chronic low back pain. Patients are assigned to a
      meditation/exercise group or a control group. The investigators will measure pain and
      disability using a variety of tools including surveys (disability, anxiety, mindfulness, and
      pain), pain VAS scales, and quantitative sensory testing.
