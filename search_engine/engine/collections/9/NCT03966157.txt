      nasoenteric tube placement. Patients will be randomized into two groups: control arm and
      device arm.

      Control arm includes patients that will have nasoenteric tubes secured with standard
      protocol, adhesive tape. Device arm includes patients that will have nasoenteric tubes
      secured with Standard AMT Bridle. The nasal bridles will be placed by the endoscopist. Upper
      endoscopy will not be affected. Placement of nasal bridle will take 1-2 minutes after
      endoscopic procedure completed. No addition sedation, medication or exposure necessary.

      Patients will be randomized by sealed envelope randomization. Clinicians are given randomly
      generated treatment allocations within sealed opaque envelopes. Once a patient has consented
      to enter the study trial an envelope is opened and the patient is then offered the allocated
      treatment regimen. Patients will be consented by a member of the research team prior to
      endoscopy. Randomization will be singly blinded only to the the patient prior to endoscopy.
      Endoscopist will not be blinded as they will be placing the securement device and in order to
      reduce selection bias.

      In the event of tube dislodgment, the patient will receive same treatment.

      Follow-up of patients will occur via chart review until the time of discharge, at 6 months
      and at 12 months after feeding tube placement via chart review. Data collected with include
      repeat EGD, length of endoscopy, length of hospital stay, and mortality. The number of
      endoscopies and repeated nasoenteric tubes placed will be tracked at six and twelve months.
