      and mortality as well as healthcare cost. Despite the increasing burden of disease, there are
      no clinical trials evaluating antibiotic therapy in pleural space infections. Hence, British
      and American guidelines are only able to provide weak and vague recommendations regarding
      duration, type or route (intravenous or oral) of antibiotic therapy. Our goal is to determine
      whether oral (PO) therapy is non-inferior to intravenous (IV) therapy thereby decreasing
      risks of IV catheter related infections, vein thrombosis and health care costs. Similar
      studies have been successfully conducted in the setting of bone/joint infections and
      endocarditis and showed non-inferiority of oral antibiotics. However, in order to help ensure
      that the randomized trial is of good quality, it is important to assess the feasibility of
      such a trial by first conducting a pilot study. The goal of this pilot trial is to assess the
      feasibility of the proposed study design.
