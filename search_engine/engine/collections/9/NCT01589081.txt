      induced changes on anterior pituitary (ACTH, LH, and Prolactin) and adrenal hormones (DHEA
      and cortisol). We also plan to study norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), because
      nicotine stimulates rapid release of NE and E in preclinical and clinical studies. The study
      will examine the acute effects of progesterone on the effects of IV nicotine on the HPG axis.
      Progesterone's influence on the acute effects of nicotine on the gonadal steroid hormones
      (estradiol, testosterone, progesterone) are unknown. The effects of progesterone on nicotine
      induced changes on gonadal steroid hormones and the reciprocal feedback regulation by LH will
      also be examined. The temporal covariance of progesterone influenced hormonal changes with
      serum nicotine levels and nicotine-induced changes in subjective states and cardiovascular
      measures will be analyzed. Finally, the covariance between the effects of progesterone on
      nicotine-induced changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal
      concordance with increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels will be determined.
