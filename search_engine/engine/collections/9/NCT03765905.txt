      from the untreated biochemical tube for serum SCUBE1 SCUBE2 SCUBE3. The blood samples will be
      centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes and the serum fraction will be obtained and the serum
      will be stored at -80 Â° C to be stored until the day of the tube operation. Serum SCUBE1,
      SCUBE2 SCUBE3 levels will be measured using ELISA kits. ,
