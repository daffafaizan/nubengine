      treatment and control group. The treatment group receives the SanaCutan Basiscreme for twice
      daily skin application until the age of 6 months (main phase; half of them until the age of
      12 months (main + follow-up phase)), whereas the control group should avoid skin care
      products. Guardians of both groups are requested to document all applied skin care products
      in a diary. In regular visits at the study sites, a blinded physician investigates the skin
      of the children. In case of an atopic dermatitis (= atopic dermatitis has to be diagnosed in
      at least two visits with an interval of at least four weeks), the severity will be examined
      (SCORAD) and the treatment with SanaCutan Basiscreme will be terminated. All children will be
      followed up until the age of 6 months (end of main phase). This is the time when a blood test
      will be conducted to determine sensitization against food and inhalant allergens and total
      IgE. If children do not develop an atopic dermatitis in the main phase, the study continues
      until they receive the diagnosis (up to a maximum of 12 months, end of follow-up phase).
