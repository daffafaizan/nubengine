      girls. The contemporaneous obesity epidemic has led to speculation that obesity may be
      driving early puberty. However, questions remain about the validity of reports of early
      puberty among obese girls due to the difficulty in distinguishing fatty tissue from breast
      tissue in this population. The physiological basis for early puberty among obese girls is
      also unknown. The current proposal aims to investigate pubertal development in pre-menarchal
      obese compared with normal weight girls using more robust methods such as breast
      morphological staging via ultrasonography and intensive reproductive axis phenotyping. Study
      procedures include blood draws, DXA (for body composition), hand x-ray (for bone age), breast
      and transabdominal (pelvic) ultrasounds, and anthropometrics.
