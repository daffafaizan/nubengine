      documented that the administration of L reuteri DSM 17938 at a dose of 10(8) colony forming
      units (CFU) compared with placebo had no effect on the overall incidence of nosocomial
      diarrhea (Wanke & Szajewska, J Pediatr 2012). Whether higher doses of L reuteri DSM 17938
      have such effects needs to be substantiated in further randomized trials.
