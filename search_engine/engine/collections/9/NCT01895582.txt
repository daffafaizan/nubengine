      instead of TST, but there accuracy in those old patients are not known: as immune responses
      are impaired in elderly and some of them have already met M tuberculosis before active
      antibiotherapy exists.The aim of this study is to evaluate characteristics of the two
      commercials tests IGRA T-spot-TB® and Quantiferon-TB-gold- in tube® and TST in old patients
      with or without active Tuberculosis.

      Principal outcome:

      - 3 tests performance for active TB diagnosis in patients older than 75 years-old

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  concordance between IGRAs.

        -  non-concordant results analysis

        -  concordance of IGRAs results with time of TB-infection

        -  biobank

      Methodology :Diagnostic test performance study
