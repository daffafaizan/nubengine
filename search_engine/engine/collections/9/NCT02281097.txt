    
      Background Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome characterized by disabling
      symptoms of inadequate cerebral perfusion on assuming the upright posture, including
      light-headedness, fatigue, palpitations, altered mentation, headache, nausea, presyncope, and
      occasionally syncope.

      POTS is characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate and exaggerated increase in
      plasma catecholamine levels on standing in the absence of a blood pressure fall. These
      disabling symptoms persist for more than six months.

      Objective The objective of this study is to study the effect of vagal stimulation on heart
      rate modulation during supine and upright posture as a treatment modality for patients with
      POTS.
