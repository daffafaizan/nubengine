      palpation) ranging from 3% to 7% among the general population. With the widespread use of
      ultrasound (US), clinically unapparent thyroid nodule prevalence has dramatically increased
      with estimates at 20% to 76% in the general population. Moreover, 20% to 48% of patients with
      a single palpable thyroid nodule are found to have additional nodules when investigated by
      US.

      Laser ablation therapy offer potential for the thermal destruction of soft tissue structures.
      The ability to deliver large doses of energy via small flexible fiberoptics makes laser
      therapy ideally suited for percutaneous treatment of unwanted tissue masses.

      In this study we propose to treat symptomatic soft tissue thyroid masses in the head and neck
      region using a new FDA-cleard laser ablation system to safely and effectively debulk the
      tissue and therefore improve symptoms. Real time US monitoring will be performed of the
      ablation front to ensure complete treatment of the target lesion. All ablated regions will be
      followed by US with Doppler to document changes in size and vascularity. Local effects on
      thyroid function for thyroid mass treatment will be measured on follow-up.
