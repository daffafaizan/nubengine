      psychotherapy, and/or a combination of the two. To meet entry criteria for this study, you
      must have already tried these methods and they did not help your symptoms. DBS is considered
      experimental for the treatment of TS and would not be done as normal clinical care.

      Participation in this study will require extensive pre-surgical screening to determine
      eligibility for DBS surgery, a DBS surgical procedure, and regular follow-ups. Subjects will
      be seen monthly post surgery for 6 months. After 6 months, data will be assessed and RBS may
      be offered as a stimulation setting. If so, the stimulator settings will be changed from
      chronic to responsive. If not, the subject will continue to receive chronic DBS stimulation.
      Subsequent visits will be scheduled every 6 months until a total of 24 months of study
      participation.

      At the end of the initial 24-month study period, subjects will have the choice of 1)
      continuing active stimulation at the current setting, 2) continuing stimulation but searching
      for a new setting, 3) discontinuing stimulation (turning the device off), 4) having the
      device removed. If the subject continues to receive active stimulation, they will be followed
      by the PI and seen at yearly intervals until the DBS system is commercially available, FDA
      approved for the treatment of TS, or unavailable for patient use.
