      home tele-monitoring system and 2) a flexible diuretic regimen among high risk heart failure
      patients in the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). The first intervention consists
      of the use of a home monitoring tool utilizing a tablet interface. The device facilitates
      collection of heart failure patient self-care information, including weight, blood pressure,
      heart rate and heart failure symptoms. This information is collected and stored on a secured
      server provided by the vendor, and can be viewed by the physician and nursing team. The
      second intervention is a flexible diuretic regimen strategy. This intervention will be
      applied in an independent randomized fashion. The flexible regimen will be prescribed by the
      patient's physician. The two interventions will be applied to heart failure patients treated
      at the University of Michigan. A total of 400 patients will be enrolled into the study.
