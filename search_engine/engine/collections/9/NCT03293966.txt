      information system on the prevalence of dispensing difficulties reported by pharmacies when
      hospitalized patients leave the city. This information system will be based on the care
      coordination card implemented by a secure computer link allowing the use of information on
      treatments prescribed at the end of hospitalization. Patient management is not changed by
      this protocol. Only the information of the pharmacist, which is the object of the study, is
      increased.
