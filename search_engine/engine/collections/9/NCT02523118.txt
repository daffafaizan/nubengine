    
      This is a longitudinal observational study in which individuals (males and females 3 years of
      age and greater) with EoE, EG, EGE and EC will be followed over the course of time to see if
      standard questionnaires can give us an idea of how well the person is doing.

      Participants undergoing standard of care (normal, routine care) endoscopies and/or
      colonoscopies will have biopsies (small pieces of tissue from the GI tract normally collected
      during these procedures) collected and used for the research study. Participants will also
      complete questionnaires related to their symptoms and quality of life. Participants will be
      followed over the course of time and asked to complete the questionnaires at various time
      points throughout the study.
