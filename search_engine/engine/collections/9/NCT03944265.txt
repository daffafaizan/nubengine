    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Use the information on genomic tumor diagnostics, provider treatment recommendations, and
      patient and provider feedback on the treatment decision making process, which will be used to
      develop materials and methods to adapt an existing decision counseling program (DCP) for use
      with patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) as a standard
      component of clinical care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pilot test the adapted DCP in a subset of patients to determine the feasibility of
      delivering the DCP session.

      II. Assess DCP effects on patient treatment knowledge and decisional conflict. III. Assess
      treatment choice.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Use physician input to develop draft treatment education materials and use patient
      input to adapt an online decision counseling application for use in helping patients clarify
      treatment preference.

      PHASE II: Patients complete a treatment decision counseling session/interview about genetic
      testing and supportive/palliative care with a qualified member of the research team in-person
      or via telephone. Health care providers receive a 1-page summary of session results for use
      in treatment shared decision making at the next office visit.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 30 and 60 days.
