      reluctant to begin and adhere to insulin therapy for a variety of reasons. Introducing
      insulin therapy is particularly problematic during a hospitalization or a brief routine
      outpatient visit given time and resource constraints. Teaching people to administer an
      insulin injection requires time and ongoing support. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate
      an educational phone application designed to support patients with T2DM by reinforcing skills
      and self-management behaviors needed for insulin administration. Patients with T2DM who are
      starting insulin or need updated instruction on insulin will be invited to participate in
      this study to examine the effect of the phone app on psychological barriers to insulin as
      well as patient and provider satisfaction with and usability of the phone app in both
      outpatient and hospital settings.
