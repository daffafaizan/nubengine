      ASCT followed by consolidative therapy with pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      and to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone following
      ASCT. The immunological analysis of cells and cytokines pre and post-therapy will be
      determined from patient bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood samples as exploratory
      objectives. The overall composition of the gut microbiome will also be determined in patient
      stool samples.

      Patients will be followed by response, EFS/PFS/OS and safety endpoints on an every 3 week
      basis. Bone marrow aspirate specimens will be obtained at screening and at completing of the
      study and peripheral blood specimens will be obtained on a monthly basis to evaluate in
      correlative studies.
