    
      TRACK-HD was a multi-centre, multi-national, prospective, observational study of pre-manifest
      and early Huntington's disease (HD) with a control group of volunteers not carrying the HD
      mutation. The goal of the project was to contribute essential methodology that will form the
      basis for clinical trials in pre-manifest and early HD. TRACK-HD complemented existing
      observational studies (e.g., Predict-HD, PHAROS, COHORT), sharing some features, but also
      having areas of unique emphasis.

      The UBC site recruited 90 subjects including 30 control subjects, 30 asymptomatic
      pre-manifest HD gene carriers and 30 subjects with early symptoms of HD (stage 1 or 2). All
      subjects were assessed using the TRACK-HD battery at baseline, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years.
      Following the fourth visit (3 year assessment), the TRACK-HD study will be completed, and the
      30 subjects with early symptoms of HD will be invited to enroll in the MITIGATE-HD Study.

      The MITIGATE-HD study is a single center Phase IIb,out-patient,randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of memantine treatment in subjects with Huntington disease (HD). The
      study will evaluate Memantine 10 mg two times daily (BID) administered orally (PO) for six
      months (24 weeks) compared with matching placebo BID. Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed by recording of adverse events and by monitoring of vital signs, physical
      examinations, and suicidality risk scores.

      The TRACK-HD assessment battery will be administered to all subjects after six months of
      study drug administration. The effects of memantine will be evaluated both against placebo as
      well as compared to the previous 3 years of observational data from the TRACK-HD Study.
