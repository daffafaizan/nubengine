      small population of locally residing tissue specific "stem cells" Stem cells from adult bone
      marrow represent an ideal stem cell source based on their ease of collection. In order to
      begin to explore the potential of adult bone marrow for the correction of genetic diseases
      that affect the blood such as sickle cell disease, we propose in vitro and in vivo mouse
      studies to examine the regulation of normal differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
      collected from adult volunteers. In order to obtain adult hematopoietic stem cells in large
      numbers for in vitro and in vivo studies, volunteers will undergo mobilization with G-CSF for
      5 consecutive days followed by large volume apheresis on the 5th day of G-CSF injection. The
      harvested product will be immunomagnetically purified for the primitive progenitor population
      and viably cryopreserved in multiple aliquots.
