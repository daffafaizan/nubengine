    
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing 6 months of participation in one of two
      active treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis or supportive therapy in
      symptomatic Veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are still
      symptomatic. Assessments of clinical status and social functioning were obtained at baseline,
      end of treatment, and 6 month follow-up. We hypothesized that participation in the
      cognitive-behavioral therapy would lead to greater reductions in symptoms and distress about
      symptoms, and more improvements in social functioning.
