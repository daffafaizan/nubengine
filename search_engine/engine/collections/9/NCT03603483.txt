      work, decreased left ventricular mass regression, and has also been linked with high
      mortality. Therefore, Aortic root posterior enlargement by autologous fixed pericardium to
      insert an Aortic valve prosthesis with size suitable to patient body surface area to avoid
      the previous worse outcome of patient prosthesis mismatch. In this study the investigators
      will try to identify the benefits of Aortic Root Enlargement in management of Small Aortic
      Annulus in Patients with severe valvular aortic stenosis
