      7-15% with regimens that involve 0-2 hours of bed rest, somewhat more frequent after
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than coronary angiography (CAG). There seems to be
      no reduction in the complications of the CAG or PCI by maintaining the bed rest for more than
      2 hours after the procedure. Angio-Seal seems most effective of current closure devices.
      There is less discomfort associated with early compared with late mobilization. Protamine
      reverse heparin's effect without the side effects of that regime.

      There lacks a larger randomized study of the safety of mobilizing patients immediately after
      CAG and after PCI.
