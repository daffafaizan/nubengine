      movements (dyskinesias) caused by the gold standard treatment, Levodopa. The severity of
      these movements can range from subtle to extremely debilitating and may or may not interfere
      with normal activities such as putting on a coat or brushing ones teeth. Currently, one of
      the very few treatments for these unwanted and involuntary movements is Amantadine. New
      options to treat dyskinesia would be clinically very valuable. In a previous study, we
      developed an objective measuring device to quantify dyskinesia.

      All PD participants will receive all three of the drug treatment intervention (placebo,
      Amantadine 300 mg, Amantadine 300 mg plus Topiramate 150 mg). After 2 weeks of one drug
      treatment, the participants will complete an overnight visit at the OCTRI Inpatient unit.
      During the next day, participants will complete a mental task while standing on a force plate
      for one minute every half hour until the end of the study. A levodopa IV infusion will occur
      from 0900 to 1100. The subjects will be split into 'high' and 'low' dose groups. Those who
      take <50 mg/hour of oral levodopa or levodopa equivalents will be considered 'low' dose
      subjects and will receive 1 mg/kg/hr of IV Levodopa during the study visits (1, 2, and 3).
      Those who administer > 50 mg/hr of oral levodopa to themselves normally will be considered
      'high' dose subjects and will received 1.5 mg/kg/hr levodopa. Both groups will receive the
      infusion for two hours from 0900 - 1100. The study drug will be taken orally at 0800.
