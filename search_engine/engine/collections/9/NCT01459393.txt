      prevalence and malignant potential for squamous cell carcinoma, which makes essential its
      treatment. Today there are several possible therapies, where cryotherapy is usually applied
      in our practice. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)is another method also widespread for keratosis
      which involves the administration of a topical precursor drug which produces endogenous
      photosensitising substances activated by specific light, selectively destroying the diseased
      tissue. This study aims to evaluate the use the drug formulation for photodynamic therapy
      5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) associated with dimethyl sulfoxide, comparing its efficacy with
      conventional cryotherapy, and also pain and cosmetic results. This project enrolled 137
      outpatients from the Department of Cutaneous Oncology of Barretos Cancer Hospital - Pio XII
      Foundation, with symmetrical and comparable keratosis in their upper limbs. With the same
      patient as controls, side arm and therapy to be used were randomized: cryotherapy or
      photodynamic therapy. For cryotherapy was utilized bottles of liquid nitrogen (Cry-ac,
      500ml); and for photodynamic therapy was utilized incoherent red light lamp with a total
      dosis of 37J/cmÂ² . There was one or two sessions of each therapy , at 0 and 3 months; and
      three assessments for evaluation were done at 0, 3 and 6 months of onset. The evaluations on
      efficacy were in terms of area regression, and classified as complete response or no
      response. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale, and numerical scale. Cosmesis was
      evaluated with the presence or not, objectively, of hyper, hypopigmentation or scar
      retraction. Finally, patient's preference regarding utilized therapeutics was noted by the
      researcher.
