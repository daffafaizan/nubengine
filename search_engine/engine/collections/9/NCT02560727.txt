      ways were involved with upper digestive tract, middle digestive tract and lower digestive
      tract. FMT via colonoscope is the most common approach, participants have to endure the
      discomfortable of bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and FMT by colonoscopy was recommended
      for repeat FMT treatment in short period. Traditional enema infuses bacteria solution into
      rectal and sigmoid colon but cannot spread to whole colon.No technique by placing a tube
      through anus into cecum for whole colon administration, which could be maintained for repeat
      FMTs.To solve these problems, investigators designed a new technique called transendoscopic
      enteral tubing (TET).the TET tube was fixed at cecum by clips under endoscopy. This study
      aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TET for FMT via colonic approach.
