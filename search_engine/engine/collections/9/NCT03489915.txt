    
      Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular disorder. Clinically, CRVO
      presents with variable visual loss; fundus may show retinal hemorrhages, dilated tortuous
      retinal veins, cotton-wool spots, macular edIn view of the devastating complications
      associated with the severe form of CRVO, number of classifications were described. All of
      classifications take into account the area of retinal capillary nonperfusion and development
      of neovascular complications.

      CRVO can be divided into 2 clinical types, ischemic and nonischemic. In addition, a number of
      patients may have an intermediate presentation with variable clinical course. On initial
      presentation, it may be difficult to classify a given patient, since CRVO may change with
      time.

      A number of clinical and ancillary investigative factors are taken into account for
      classifying CRVO:

      Nonischemic CRVO is milder form of disease. It may present with good vision, few retinal
      hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots, no relative afferent pupillary defect, and good perfusion
      to the retina. Nonischemic CRVO may resolve fully with good visual outcome or may progress to
      the ischemic type.

      Ischemic CRVO is the severe form of the disease. CRVO may present initially as the ischemic
      type, or it may progress from nonischemic. Usually, ischemic CRVO presents with severe visual
      loss, extensive retinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots, presence of relative afferent
      pupillary defect, poor perfusion to retina, and presence of severe electroretinographic
      changes. In addition, patients may end up with neovascular glaucoma and a painful blind eye.
