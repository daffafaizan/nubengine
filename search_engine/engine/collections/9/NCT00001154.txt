      apolipoproteins on plasma lipoproteins. Paired kinetic studies using dual-labeled iodinated
      lipoproteins and apolipoproteins are performed in healthy volunteer controls with normal
      lipids and subjects with dyslipidemia under controlled metabolic conditions. Studies are
      designed to formulate metabolic pathways in patients with undefined genetic disorders of
      lipid metabolism as well as in healthy volunteers to provide original insights into normal
      and pathologic metabolic pathways. All kinetic data is computer analyzed to provide
      quantitative data and facilitate direct comparison of multiple studies.
