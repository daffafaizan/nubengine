    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel-group study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single-dose intra-articular (IA)
      administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Approximately 180 patients will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment groups
      (three dose levels of UBX0101 and Placebo; approximately 45 patients per group), all
      administered by IA route at Week 0. The four treatment groups will be enrolled concurrently.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of IA administration of UBX0101
      on the change from baseline to Week 12 of pain in the target knee.
