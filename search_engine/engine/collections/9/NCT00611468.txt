    
      The primary objectives of this trial include:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of intravenous topotecan when given in
           combination with oral erlotinib.

        -  To define the dosage-limiting toxicities (DLT) of this combination.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of intravenous topotecan with and
           without erlotinib

      The secondary objectives include:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the topotecan and erlotinib combination

        -  To evaluate for any correlations between the presence of CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms and
           topotecan / erlotinib disposition and to measure the frequency of MDR1 and BCRP in
           peripheral blood samples and correlate these results with topotecan pharmacokinetics

        -  To measure the frequency of UGT genotypes in peripheral blood samples

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate using the RECIST criteria.
