      treatment for stable incapacitating claudication and critical ischaemia in patients with
      superficial femoral artery occlusion. Preliminary results of a thrupass endoprosthesis in the
      treatment of femoral lesions are promising. Less morbidity and better cost-effectiveness are
      suggested to be achieved in treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia with endovascular
      treatment comparing to surgical treatment.

      A randomised multicentre trial aims to enrol a pilot group of 60 + 60 patients to be followed
      for 3 years. Patients are treated either with Viabahn thrupass endoprosthesis (Gore corp.) or
      with 6 mm PTFE-prosthesis bypass graft surgery. Primary patency at three years is the primary
      end point and secondary patency, functional success, costs and quality of life are the
      secondary end points.
