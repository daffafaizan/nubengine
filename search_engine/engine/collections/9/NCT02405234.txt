      enrolled at 15 active centers. In addition a subset of 24 RA patients will be enrolled and
      analyzed separately. The trial is designed as a randomized, non-inferiority study comparing
      results of the CMRH to results of the MRH.

      This will be a multi-site study with all patients either receiving the CMRH or the MRH.
      Sequential enrollment of all patients meeting inclusion criteria and agreeing to be in the
      study will be enrolled. The patients will sign an informed consent agreeing to accept either
      the investigational or control device. In addition, the surgeon will not know which device
      the patient is to receive until the day of surgery in an attempt to further reduce bias. The
      surgeon will open an envelope at the time of surgery to determine if a CMRH or MRH will be
      implanted.

      Additional efforts to eliminate bias in the study will include a final radiographic analysis
      by an independent observer experienced in reporting on orthopedic devices. The independent
      reviewer will grade the surgical implant and determine radiographic success/failure for each
      patient.

      Implants will be assigned to patients at the clinical sites in a block randomization fashion.
      The randomization will be site specific. At a given site, each consecutive block of six
      enrolled patients to be treated will receive random assignments of CMRH or MRH at a 2:1. The
      randomization schedule is generated by computer (NQuery) and is produced in blocks of 6,
      where 4 are study devices and 2 are control devices.
