      for EGFRmut and immunohistochemically for thymidylate synthetase (TS) expression. Employing
      the H-Score with a cut-off of 150, EGFR-wt patients will be stratified into a TS low (Stratum
      A) and TS high (Stratum B) group. This procedure is aiming to provide two equally sized
      strata.

      After stratification according to the TS expression level patients will be treated with a
      combination of Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab.

      Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Bevacizumab will be administered for a maximum of 4 cycles. Patients
      with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) will continue on
      maintenance therapy of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

        -  Duration of treatment/patient: up to 1,5 years

        -  Follow Up: at least 6 month

        -  Planned number of patients: 146 treated patients
