      slow disease progression and lack of sensitive outcome measures. The investigators have
      previously shown that biomarkers from skin identified in a CMT1A rat model can be translated
      to CMT1A patients. Primary goal is to identify circulating biomarkers correlating with
      disease severity and progression. 210 young, adolescent and adult patients affected by
      genetically confirmed CMT1A, will be evaluated with different clinical outcome measures,
      assessing impairment, disability and quality of life: Patients will be re-evaluated at 12
      (n=147) and 24 months (n=103) with the same measures to assess disease progression. A number
      of candidate markers correlating with disease severity have been identified in blood samples
      from the rat model of CMT1A. At 0-12-24 months a blood sample will be drawn from affected
      CMT1A patients. The investigators will purify total mRNA from blood samples, and validate the
      10 strongest regulated markers identified in the rat model via qRTPCR in blood of CMT1A
      patients. Protein biomarkers will also be analysed. Marker expression at baseline and at
      follow up will be correlated with clinical severity and progression. In this translational
      project (rat/human) the investogators expect to develop more responsive outcome measures and
      circulating biomarkers to improve assessment of intervention efficacy in forthcoming
      therapeutic trials.
