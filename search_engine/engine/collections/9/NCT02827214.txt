    
      208 subjects (i.e., 137 per surgical group; 71 per conservative group) with TL burst
      fractures AOSpine classification type A3 or A4 without neurological deficit as defined in the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and with or without suspected Posterior Ligament Complex (PLC)
      injury (M1) from T10 to L2, will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort study.
      Patients may have an associated B injury, but must have an A3 or A4. Patients will be
      monitored prospectively for patient reported, clinical and radiologic outcomes, over a period
      of 2 years post-treatment. Specifically a patient diary will measure the Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), and employment information (indirect costs questionnaire) every second week
      until 6 months post-treatment. Diary will continue every second month until 2 years
      post-treatment. All interventions/examinations are considered as standard of care.
