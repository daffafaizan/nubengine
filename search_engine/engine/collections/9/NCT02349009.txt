    
      1:1 active treatment: placebo, blinded trial, evaluating the effect of a 4-week treatment
      period with topical C-82 on skin expression of two gene biomarker surrogates (THBS1 and COMP)
      for the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS). Study subjects will be randomized to apply the
      study medication daily for 4 weeks to either the right or left forearm. All subjects will
      apply placebo (i.e., a topical gel without C-82) to the contralateral forearm. Both physician
      and subject will be blinded to treatment arm assignment. Skin biopsies will be taken from the
      mid-forearm of both arms at baseline and after four weeks of study drug to test for biomarker
      gene expression; instructions and supplies will be provided to each site. Safety assessments
      will extend to 4 weeks after the final dose of study drug/placebo.
