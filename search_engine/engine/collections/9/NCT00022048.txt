        -  Determine the hematologic responses, including changes in hemoglobin levels, neutrophil
           counts, platelet counts, and percentage of bone marrow blasts, in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndrome treated with bevacizumab.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerance in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine bone marrow cytogenetic responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine bone marrow microvessel density in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to International
      Prognostic Scoring System risk status (low (low or intermediate-1) vs high (intermediate-2 or
      high)).

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4-6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
