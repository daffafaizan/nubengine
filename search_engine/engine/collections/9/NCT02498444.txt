      parts:

        1. reactivity testing with inhaled treprostinil in the cardiac catheterization lab for
           pre-Fontan patients undergoing routine catheterization in anticipation of the Fontan
           operation;

        2. perioperative use of subcutaneous treprostinil starting immediately pre-op until
           postoperative day #7 to improve immediate postoperative hemodynamics and ultimately
           reduce overall length of hospital stay.

      The investigators hope to learn how pulmonary vasodilator therapy affects and/or improves
      post- operative hemodynamics following the Fontan operation. This knowledge would be very
      important in the care of single ventricle patients following the Fontan operation if there is
      improvement of immediate outcomes and reduction of hospital length of stay. On a broader
      scale, if the use of treprostinil in perioperative Fontan patients can achieve the same
      results other centers achieve with the use of a fenestration this may have wide scale
      implications in the nationwide treatment of Fontan patients.
