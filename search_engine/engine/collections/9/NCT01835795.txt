      conditions, however no randomized controlled trial are available about its use for chronic
      low back pain with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).

      HYPOTHESIS: Radial extracorporeal shockwave treatment (rESWT) improves pain intensity and
      functional disability compared with placebo in patients with chronic low back pain due to
      MPS.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial METHODS: A prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be carried out on 40 patients who has moderate to
      severe pain (VAS > 4) for more than 6 months, despite 6 weeks of conservative treatment with
      antidepressants associated with rehabilitation. Six interventions of rESWT (3-4 bar; 1000
      impulses per trigger point (TP) or 2500 impulses per muscle) will be compared with placebo.
      The outcome measures were pain visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index,
      Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the
      temperature of the treated area will be evaluated with Thermography. The assessments will be
      apply before treatment, after conservative treatment, 6 and 12 weeks after rESWT.
