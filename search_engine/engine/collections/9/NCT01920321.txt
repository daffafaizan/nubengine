        5. 6 minute walking distance (6MWD)> 140 meters.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Active ischemic heart disease, significant arrhythmia. ejection fraction (EF) <40%.

        2. COPD that cause carbon bioxide(CO2) retention above 50 mm Hg and / or oxygen saturation
           at rest below 88%.

        3. Pulmonary hypertension> 45 mmHg, according to the Echo Test.

        4. . Cancer treatment with chemotherapy / radiation or expected life expectancy of less

      Methods: . A. Patient preparation and sedation as in diagnostic bronchoscopy. Sedation will
      be based on midzoln + demerol. The patients will be treated prior the treatment with
      Inhalation with salbutamol ans ipratropium bromide. Flexible bronchoscope with outer diameter
      5 mm is introduced to the targated upper lobe, and placed in wedged position. This is
      followed by installion of 0.9% natriu, chloride(NaCl) at a temperature of 55ºC exit
      temperature 50ºC) in portions of 40 ml to 200 ml (in bronchoalveolar lavage up to 300 ml is
      acceptable. The patient is placed in horizontal position, and continuous ECG blood pressure.
      Oxygen saturation are monitored. This monitoring will be continue at least 2 hours after
      treatment. A chest x-ray is followed and the patient remain in the department for overnight.

      Tracking: Minimum of 6 months - Outpatient follow up include in addition to physical
      examination extended pulmonary function test and after 3-6 months. low radiation chest CT.
