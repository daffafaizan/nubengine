      growing due to enlarged indications. This fact causes an exponential increase in scheduled
      in-hospital follow-ups. For this reason, all the companies that produce PM and ICD have
      released systems that allow remote monitoring and follow-up of cardiac devices (both PM and
      ICD) and U.S. guidelines have already been changed, in order to suggest remote follow-up of
      these devices at appropriated intervals.

      Nevertheless, informations on actions taken during scheduled in-hospital follow-up are
      incomplete.

      ATHENS study has been designed to answer to 3 questions:

        1. How often, during a scheduled in hospital follow-up physicians "change" something ?
           (device programming; drug therapy; scheduled device replacement ...)

        2. The "rate of change" is different is the follow-up is required pby the general
           practitioner who normally takes care of the patients or by the patient itself?

        3. Change are more frequent during PM or during ICD follow-up or during cardiac
           resynchronization therapy devices?
