    
      The primary objective is to investigate the regenerative capacity of direct intra-myocardial
      injection of 100 mio. allogeneic CSCC_ASCs in patients with reduced left ventricular Ejection
      Fraction (EF) (â‰¤45%) and heart failure in a double-blind placebo-controlled design.

      A total of 81 patients with will be enrolled in the study and treated in a 2:1 randomization
      with either CSCC_ASC or placebo (saline).

      The primary endpoint is change in left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV) at 6 months
      follow-up.
