      therapy is HBsAg loss or HBsAg seroconversion, indicating a complete remission of CHB. In
      patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, sustained HBeAg seroconversion is also a desirable end
      point. Current therapies include pegylated interferon (PegIFN) finite and nucleos(t)ide
      analogues (NUCs) longterm therapy. However, only 30-40% of patients may achieve HBeAg
      seroconversion on PegIFN monotherapy, whereas 15-20% of patients on entecavir (ETV).
      Recently, accumulating evidence had shown that optimization of switching or combining PegIFN
      in patients on long-term ETV therapy may increase rate of HBeAg seroconversion and even lead
      to the complete eradication of HBV. However, these two regimens has not been tested
      adequately in patients with low HBsAg/HBeAg titers on long-term ETV therapy.

      This is a multicenter, prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      sequential combination or switch therapy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a in chronic hepatitis
      B patients with low HBsAg and HBeAg titers after long-term entecavir therapy, and compared to
      those who continued on ETV therapy.
