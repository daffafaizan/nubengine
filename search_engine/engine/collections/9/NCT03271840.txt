      of PCD, the investigators propose to establish a provincial PCD registry in Alberta. This
      registry will be securely linked to the currently existing International Registry for PCD and
      will allow more researchers to use the information to do research on PCD.

      The investigators will collect demographic data: current age, sex, age, diagnostic findings
      and symptoms at diagnosis; in addition, clinical data about PCD which are recorded during the
      past and future clinical visits and encounters (e.g. lung function, weight, height,
      infections, treatments, and complications) will also be collected.
