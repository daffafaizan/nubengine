      the peer-reviewed medical literature. There are published trials utilizing similar machines
      which provided evidence in support of the FDA granted indications for use spinal
      decompression and of the DRX9000™. Axiom Worldwide has determined it will be of benefit to
      the continuing medical care of patients and a furthering of the scientific knowledge of the
      treatment of LBP to complete such a prospective evaluation using a standardized treatment
      protocol. This study will therefore attempt to establish and validate the safety and efficacy
      of this computerized spinal decompression system in the treatment of LBP and sciatica.
