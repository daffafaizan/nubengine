      which is estimated to affect more than 200 million people worldwide.(1) CLI classified as
      Rutherford category (RC) 4-6, includes ischemic rest pain and tissue loss.(2) The first line
      revascularization strategy for patients with CLI is endovascular percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA).(3) The treatment of femoropopliteal lesions displays a huge anatomic
      challenge as this segment serves various biomechanical functions, Which makes endovascular
      treatment is challenging.(4) Plain balloon (PB) angioplasty for femoropopliteal artery
      disease has a high rate of procedural success and an acceptable safety profile, in spite of
      initially encouraging technical success after femoropopliteal (PTA), postprocedural
      restenosis remains the major challenge(5) Excessive extracellular matrix material synthesized
      by activated smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the media of the arteries leads to Neointimal
      hyperplasia and restenosis.(6) Restenosis resulting in loss of primary patency, late lumen
      loss (LLL), occlusion and/or the need for target lesion revascularization (TLR).(7)
      Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) inhibit the neointimal hyperplasia, the biological mechanism of
      restenosis formation, by application of cytostatic agents in a local therapeutic
      concentration.(8) The antiproliferative paclitaxel (PTX) seems to be the most effective
      therapeutic agent for DCBs due to local retention in the arterial wall.(9)
