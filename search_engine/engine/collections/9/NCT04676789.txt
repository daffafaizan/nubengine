    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of sintilimab and pegaspargase in combination with pegaspargase for the initial
      treatment of previously untreated patients with limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma.All eligible
      patients will be firstly treated with sintilimab combined with pegaspargase administered
      every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. If the patient achieves complete remission（CR）, standard
      radiotherapy will be performed, otherwise, they will receive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy（CCRT）(radiation 50 Gy and two cycles of sintilimab and pegaspargase every 3
      weeks). After radiotherapy or CCRT, patients achieving CR with positive plasma EBV-DNA or
      partial response will continue with sintilimab maintenance up to 2 years.
