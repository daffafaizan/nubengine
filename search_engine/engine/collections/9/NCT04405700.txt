    
      In part 1 of this study, we will use a mixed prospective and cross-sectional cohort study
      design to implement a PV program at two health facilities affiliated with the Academic Model
      Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in western Kenya. We will analyze these data to
      examine any associations between ART and (a) pregnancy and (b) infant/birth outcomes. In part
      2, we will create standardized protocols and data exchange standards within IeDEA to enable
      the merging and analysis of multiregional IeDEA PV data. This will include establishing a
      Data Coordinating Center based at Indiana University (IU) to serve as a hub for collecting,
      disseminating and archiving data from the study in Kenya as well as data collected through a
      similar, ongoing study at health facilities in South Africa affiliated with IeDEA. This study
      will establish a multiregional PV infrastructure within IeDEA that can be further scaled
      within the broader IeDEA network.
