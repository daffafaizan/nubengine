      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention for this particular problem.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying a drug called ivabradine. The
      investigators are exploring whether ivabradine can be used to reduce heart rate, increase
      exercise duration, and improve quality of life in survivors of lymphoma who received
      radiation to their chest as a part of their cancer treatment.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivabradine for this specific
      disease, but it has approved the drug as an oral medication to lower heart rate in heart
      failure patients.

      Survivors of lymphoma who were treated with neck and/or chest radiation can have an elevated
      resting heart rate and an abnormal rate of decline in their heart rate after exercise, also
      known as cardiac autonomic dysfunction. These abnormalities can limit exercise duration and
      worsen quality of life in some radiation treated survivors of lymphoma
