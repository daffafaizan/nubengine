    
      Specific objectives

        -  To develop, validate, and improve normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models
           for a wide variety of acute and late radiation-induced side effects relevant for head
           and neck cancer patients (step 1);

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models to better inform patients on the risks on acute
           and late toxicity;

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models for the definition of dose constraints for
           radiotherapy treatment planning in current practice;

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models for the development and investigation of the
           potential benefit of new and emerging radiation delivery technique, such as swallowing
           sparing intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton radiotherapy.

        -  To compare the outcome of new radiation delivery techniques that are clinically
           introduced with the current standard in terms of radiation-induced toxicity,
           patient-rated symptoms and quality of life and in terms of locoregional tumour control
           and overall survival
