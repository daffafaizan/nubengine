      and vascular targeting agents in a number of clinical trials with increasing clinical
      application. CTP can be examined with a variety of commercially available CE-certified CT
      scanners and imaging post-processing is possible with commercially available CE-certified
      software from different vendors, too. In several studies, anti-angiogenic effects have been
      detected with CTP but further evidence for its clinical validation has to be proven in
      clinical trials.

      Changes in tumor vasculature measured by CTP will be correlated to the clinical efficacy
      parameters progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, thus identifying a
      group of patients who profit most from the anti-angiogenic treatment.
