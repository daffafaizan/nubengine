      interventions to help families build healthy habits early in life for obesity prevention.
      Low-income preschoolers have a disproportionately high rate of childhood obesity, and their
      families face complex barriers to healthy behavior change. This proposed pilot study will
      examine the feasibility of delivering the Promoting Routines of Exploration and Play during
      Mealtime (Mealtime PREP) intervention in a sample of low-income families with young children
      (ages 2-5). Our parent-mediated intervention is designed to promote healthy dietary variety
      using routine family meals, positive reinforcement, social modeling, and food exploration and
      play. By harnessing the behavior change capacity of behavioral activation to alter daily
      mealtimes incrementally, parents are empowered to overcome barriers to healthy habit
      formation. Each family will participate in a six-week intervention that is delivered by
      occupational therapy clinicians in the home environment. Each session will last approximately
      one hour and include individualized parent-training and a parent-led mealtime with direct
      feedback from the clinician. We planned to screen up to 100 potential parent and child
      participants, with a plan to deliver intervention to 20 child participants.
