    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Periop-OSMT as measured by the percentage
      of patients and support persons/family caregivers (FCGs) who agree to participate; complete
      >= 80% of the intervention; and report satisfaction with the intervention (through structured
      exit interviews).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the patterns and trajectories for patient outcomes pre- and post-intervention,
      including patient activation, self-efficacy, ostomy-related knowledge, health related quality
      of life (HRQOL), medical care utilization, and financial burden.

      II. Examine patterns and trajectories for support person/FCG outcomes pre- and
      post-intervention, including quality of life (QOL).

      III. Using qualitative methods, evaluate the acceptability of the intervention as reported by
      participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and/or support persons/family caregivers complete Periop-OSMT session in-person or
      via telephone over 20-40 minutes before surgery and before hospital discharge, and group
      telehealth session over 1.5-2 hours at weeks 1-3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 post discharge.

      After completion of study intervention, participants are followed up for 6 months.
