    
      20 healthy participants will randomly be allocated to receive CGRP infusion followed by
      glibenclamide or placebo on two different days.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the vascular effect of CGRP after glibenclamide
      administration.

      Repeated measurements covering the arteria radialis (RA), superficiel temporal artery (STA)
      and middle cerebral artery (MCA) before and after glibenclamide/placebo administration and
      CGRP infusion.
