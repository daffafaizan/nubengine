      Protein's impact on skeletal health remains unclear. It is well accepted that increasing
      dietary protein results in greater excretion of calcium through urine. The excreted calcium
      is thought to come in part from bone, which would suggest a negative effect on bone health.
      However, recent studies have found that higher protein intake is, in fact, associated with
      higher bone mineral density and lower rates of bone loss. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if a daily protein supplement will improve bone health and hormonal measures of
      bone metabolism among healthy older men and women who consume low-to-normal levels of dietary
      protein.

      This study will last 18 months. For the duration of the study, participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either a 40-gram protein supplement or placebo daily. There will be a
      total of nine study visits that will occur at screening, study entry, Month 1.5, and every
      three months thereafter. Dietary records, nutritional counseling, glucose finger stick tests,
      and questionnaires related to falls, physical activity, habits, and study satisfaction will
      occur at all study visits. Blood and urine collection, functional testing, and bone mineral
      density (BMD) testing will occur at selected visits. At Months 0 and 18, half of the
      participants will undergo a quantitative computed tomography (CT) scan to determine bone
      mineral density.
