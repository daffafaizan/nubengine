      studied techniques for correction of the hallux valgus. It is widely reported its capacity to
      reduce the angle of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint.

      Minimally invasive scarf (MIS) technique has been designed to decrease the soft tissue damage
      and postoperative pain. This procedure does not require ischemia, being able to do under
      local anesthesia and sedation. This technique is more suitable for outpatient surgery.

      There is a lack of studies comparing both techniques, and our purpose is to do a prospective
      comparative study among the two approaches of the scarf osteotomy: open vs MIS.
