      nearly 8,000 US deaths per year. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) increases risk for
      melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer assigned indoor tanning (IT; use of
      tanning beds or booths), as a class 1 carcinogen joining arsenic, asbestos, and mustard gas.
      Unfortunately, interventions educating tanners about the risks have not been very effective.
      Many tanners are more motivated by the immediate consequences of tanning than the delayed
      consequence of possibly getting cancer. Research shows the primary motivation for indoor
      tanning is to improve physical appearance, but a secondary motivation is stress reduction.
      Behavioral economics theory suggests that the rate of a behavior depends on 1) the
      reinforcing value of that behavior relative to alternatives, 2) the cost of engaging in the
      behavior relative to alternatives, and 3) the availability of the behavior relative to
      alternatives. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether exposure to healthy
      alternatives changes the behavior of indoor tanners. The investigators will randomize tanners
      to conditions differing in physical appearance and stress reduction alternatives to determine
      whether they can get their motivational needs met in healthier ways.
