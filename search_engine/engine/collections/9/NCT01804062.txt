      standard pulse oximetry sensors.

      The study consists of measuring parameters related to respiration in healthy volunteers by
      means of the Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System with RR V2.0 (Nightingale). The
      prototype Nightingale device and multiparameter reference devices will be attached to the
      subject via sensors, nasal cannulas and ECG leads and the information from all devices will
      be captured continuously for up to 40 minutes to allow for at least 30 minutes of artifact
      free data 30 minutes.
