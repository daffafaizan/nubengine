      physician behavior, such as improved Emergency Department (ED) throughput, and decreased ED
      and Emergency Department Observation Unit (EDOU) length of stay. Metrics such as decreased
      admissions are also very important to hospital administrators so our results will have impact
      outside the ED as well. At the end of this study we will demonstrate that a carefully planned
      and data-driven approach to the outpatient treatment of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is safe,
      improves operational metrics, and reduces cost.
