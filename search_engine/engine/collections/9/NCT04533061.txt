      infection is particularly serious in the elderly and those with chronic cardiopulmonary
      conditions. Solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may be at
      particularly high risk for serious influenza infection. Lung transplant patients may have an
      even higher risk because of their underlying pathophysiology.

      Influenza prophylaxis is extremely important in the care of the transplant patient. Annual
      influenza immunization is recommended because protection is short-lived and the vaccine
      composition changes. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention is largely
      unproven. Not surprisingly, studies have shown that lung transplant patients have lower
      antibody responses than healthy individuals do. To this end, this study tests the hypothesis
      that the influenza vaccine-induced T cell responses will be similar in lung transplant
      patients and healthy individuals.

      Blood will be drawn prior to and 2-4 weeks after immunization and used to measure antibody
      responses by hemagglutination inhibition assay.

      Samples will be collected in Jan-April each season to study Trans-vivo Delayed Type
      Hypersensitivity (TVDTH) response.
