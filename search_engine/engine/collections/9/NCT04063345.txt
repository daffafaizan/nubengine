      coronary intervention (PCI) during elective as well as emergent clinical scenario. Recent
      small number randomized studies, large scale registries as well as meta-analysis have
      consistently demonstrated advantages of IVUS-guidance over angiography-guide alone with
      respect to the lower incident of death, myocardial infarction and target vessel
      revascularization.

      There are sparse data available on the clinical impact of IVUS-guided PCI in the setting of
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its use remains a matter of controversy as shown by
      previous studies. This study is to examine the impact of IVUS guidance on clinical outcomes
      in the patient with Acute ST Segment Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).
