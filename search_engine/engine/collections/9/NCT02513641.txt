      our laboratory has provided the first evidence that intermittent, nightly exposure to
      moderate hypoxia is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity in healthy obese patients
      and, therefore, lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Benefits included reduced
      fasting glucose levels and improved whole-body (skeletal muscle) and hepatic insulin
      sensitivity. Whether such intermittent hypoxia improves glucose metabolism in people with
      type 2 diabetes is unknown.
