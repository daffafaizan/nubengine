    
      This study consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a multi-session cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT) group intervention that aims to improve HIV outcomes by increasing
      adaptive, effective coping responses to stigma from intersectional identities related to
      ethnicity, immigration status, sexual minority identity, HIV status, and PrEP use among
      Latinx sexual minority men (SMM). We will test intervention effects on regular HIV testing
      and use of prevention strategies. The intervention was developed in partnership with
      community stakeholders at Bienestar Human Services, Inc., a Latinx-focused organization in
      Los Angeles County (LAC), CA. The intervention is flexible for use in community-based
      organizations, such as in ongoing support groups.

      The Specific Aims are:

      Aim 1. To conduct a randomized controlled trial of a culturally congruent cognitive behavior
      therapy group intervention for immigrant Latinx sexual minority men, to test intervention
      effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake.

      Aim 2. To examine mechanisms of intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake,
      including more effective coping (e.g., reduced internalized stigma).

      Aim 3. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention.
