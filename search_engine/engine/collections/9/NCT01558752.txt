      component and femoral bone remodeling of two different designs: CORAIL impaction broach
      titanium stem compared to a modular titanium femoral stem (Tri-lock). The investigators
      expect the CORAIL femoral stem group to show significantly less bone loss on the femoral side
      as compared to the Tri-lock group. The primary outcome is percent change in bone mineral
      density (BMD) (g/cm2) from baseline (10-14 days post-op) to the two year post-operative
      interval, as measured radiographically in zones 1 and 7.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups prior to surgery. Each patient
      will be evaluated at their regularly scheduled 10-14 days, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month visits
      following surgery.

      Bilateral DXA bone mineral density tests will be performed at 10-14 days following surgery
      (baseline assessment) and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively.

      Urine and serum samples (measures of bone turnover) will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months
      post-operatively after an overnight fast.

      The Harris Hip Score will be completed at each post-operative visit except the immediate
      (10-14 days), when risk of dislocation precludes a determination of range of motion. At the
      3, 6, 12 and 24 month post-operative visits, the patient will complete the SF-36 Item Health
      Survey, WOMAC and UCLA activity scale.
