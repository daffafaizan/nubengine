      pharmacy over the number of units of anti- infective drugs prescribed

      C- To determine the ratio of the number of premature discontinuations of anti -infective
      treatments over the number of lines of anti -infective treatments prescribed

      D- Evaluate the ratio of the number of units actually taken by the patient (based on a
      self-declaration) over the number of units of anti- infective drugs prescribed

      E- To measure the comprehension concerning anti- infective treatments after returning home
      (based on a quiz)

      F- To determine the risk factors for non- adherence to anti- infective therapy based on the
      characteristics of the study population

      G- Assess patient satisfaction concerning a pharmaceutical consultation at hospital discharge
      (questionnaire)

      H- Assess the impact of a pharmaceutical consultation on primary non-adherence (criteria 1
