    
      This is a multicenter study of ibrutinib (first-in-class, potent, covalently-binding
      inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK]) in female participants with B cell malignancy.
      The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days), 7-day Pretreatment Phase
      (Days 1 to 7), Treatment Phase including PK assessment period (Days 8 to 26) and a Follow-up
      Phase (Day 27 to end of Cycle 6). The study procedures includes electrocardiogram (ECG),
      vital signs, blood samples withdrawal to evaluate PK and safety. The Antitumor activity will
      be assessed by means of computed tomography (CT) imaging and positron emission tomography
      (PET) scans. No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested. This is an estimation study
      designed to determine if an increase or decrease in exposure to OC or probe drugs occurs in
      the presence of ibrutinib.
