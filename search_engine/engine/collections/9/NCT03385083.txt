      telehealth follow ups, on the treatment of chronic low back pain subjects. Subjects with low
      back pain will present for evaluation to the NYIT Academic Health Care Center. Once serious
      complications have been ruled out and a diagnosis of chronic low back pain has been made,
      subjects will be informed about this proposed study and asked if they would like to
      participate. Voluntary subjects will then be consented by designated investigators. The
      subjects will then be randomized into either the activity tracker and telemedicine follow up
      group or the control group.

      Once enrolled, all subjects will complete the study as outlined in the procedures. It will
      involve the use of several validated assessment tools. Following the initial visit, subjects
      in both groups will return in 6 weeks for reassessment. Subjects in the experimental group
      will additionally be given an activity tracker and have 2 telemedicine visits at 2 and 4
      weeks.
