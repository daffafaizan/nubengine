      represent an ideal population in which to define the sequence of events that lead to b-cell
      dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. The researchers hypothesize that obese AA with DKA will prove
      particularly susceptible to beta-cells dysfunction due to sustained elevations of plasma
      glucose (glucose toxicity) and/or free fatty acid levels (lipotoxicity). This study will test
      beta-cell response by administering a glucose infusion to diabetic African Americans with a
      history of DKA, diabetic African Americans without a history of DKA, and non-diabetic African
      Americans.
