      ablation of great saphenous veins. The aim of the study is to test whether the anatomical
      success rate of Steam Ablation is not inferior to that of Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in
      treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency and compare the treatment safety, patient
      reported outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses between EVLA and Steam Ablation.
