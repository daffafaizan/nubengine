      (5mg/1ml/amp), the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected
      or if patient asks for termination. With endoscope apparatus, the gastric mucous is irrigated
      with acetylcysteine solution and the pH value of gastric juice will be measured with the pH
      test strips before irrigation and after irrigation. The investigators dispense medicaments
      containing three kinds of antibiotics powder (Amoxicillin 3 gm„ÄÅMetronidazole 2 gm and
      Clarithromycin 1 gm) on the surface of gastric mucosa and duodenal mucosa of duodenal bulb as
      evenly as possible. After the intraluminal therapy, patients will rest for 30 to 60 minutes
      and go home if the effect of sedation subsided. Patients can take meal if no abdominal
      discomfort. Patients will receive tests for serum Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G, liver
      function and renal function 3 to 7 days after the intraluminal therapy. C13-Urea breath test
      (UBT) will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the intraluminal
      therapy. Stool H. pylori Antigen will be used to assess the short term recurrence of H.
      pylori 4-6 months after successful intraluminal therapy . Patients fail to achieve
      intraluminal eradication of H. pylori will be randomly assigned to the oral antibiotics
      rescue therapies with standard triple therapy for either 7 days (Group A) or 14 days (Group
      B). C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the rescue triple
      therapy. Overall eradication rates after the first line intraluminal therapy and the oral
      antibiotics rescue therapies will be evaluated.
