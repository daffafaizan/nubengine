    
      The objective of this Phase III, prospective randomized trial is to determine whether
      TheraSphere provides a meaningful benefit in survival in comparison with the standard of care
      (sorafenib) in participants with good hepatic function and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

      This is an open-label prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial that
      will evaluate the use of TheraSphere compared to standard-of-care sorafenib alone.
