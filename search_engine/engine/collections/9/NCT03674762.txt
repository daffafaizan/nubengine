      were placed randomly with a split mouth design, in 20 partially edentulous patients.
      Radiographic and clinical examinations were carried out at the implant placement (Baseline,
      BSL), at the delivery of prosthetic restorations (T0), and at each year of the follow-up
      period (T1, T2, T3). Plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and
      gingival recession (REC) were recorded. Radiographic marginal bone levels (MBL) were assessed
      at the mesial (MI) and distal (DI) aspect of implant sites. In addition, the influence of
      keratinized tissue thickness (KTT) on MBL was investigated.
