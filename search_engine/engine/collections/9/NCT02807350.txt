      non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or spectacles with plano lenses) are to
      determine:

        -  The long-term on-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score.

        -  The off-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score (following
           weaning and 3 months off treatment).

      The recently completed IXT3 pilot study (NCT02223650) addressed the question of whether
      overminus lens therapy has an initial short-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing
      overminus spectacles. There have been no rigorous studies that address the following
      important questions related to overminus lens therapy:

        -  Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing
           overminus spectacles (over many months or years)?

        -  Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT when overminus
           spectacles are discontinued?

      In November 2019, a protocol amendment discontinued overminus lens treatment and extended the
      study for an additional 18 months after the 18-month randomized trial has ended. The
      objective of the extension study is to compare long-term refractive error between subjects
      originally treated with either overminus spectacles or non-overminus spectacles as part of
      the 18-month randomized trial; treatment is at investigator discretion.
