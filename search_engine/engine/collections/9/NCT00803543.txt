      often occur in areas in and around the mouth and genital tract. HSV Type 1 (HSV-1) usually
      causes "cold sores" or fever blisters and HSV Type 2 (HSV-2) usually causes lesions in the
      genital or rectal areas. However, HSV-1 can sometimes cause genital herpes and HSV-2 can
      cause oral lesions (acquired from oral-genital sex). Herpes Simplex is transmitted by contact
      with someone who is shedding virus in either the mouth or genital tract, usually by kissing
      or sexual intercourse. While contact with an active sore can cause transmission, so can
      contact with saliva or genital secretions that are infected, even when the person does not
      have an obvious sore. This is called asymptomatic shedding of HSV. Once acquired, the virus
      has the ability to remain inactive in the nervous system in the area of the mouth or genital
      region.

      Persons with both HIV and HSV-2 often have shedding of both viruses. We know that persons
      with HSV-2 tend to have increased amounts of HIV in their blood as well. Recently, research
      studies have found that taking medicine daily to prevent asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding can
      reduce the amount of HIV found in the blood and in genital secretions. This study seeks to
      determine how common herpes is among persons with HIV who do not know they have it and if
      valacyclovir (FDA approved drug) reduces outbreaks of herpes, the amount of HIV in the blood,
      and the amount of HSV in bodily secretions.
