    
      National prospective registry study with data from the Danish ventral hernia Database (DVHD)
      and the National Patient Register (LPR) in patients undergoing open to umbilical or
      epigastric hernia repair during the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2010.

      Apart from operator-registered perioperative data from DVHD, operations can be characterized
      with different types of sutures, choice of mesh and other relevant information, with possible
      impact on long-term outcome after surgery, including recurrence.

      There will be used frequency analyzes and Kaplan Meyer statistics, supplemented by
      multivariate Cox regression analysis, as well as non-parametric statistics.

      Eligibility criteria: OPen mesh or sutured repair for small umbilical hernias from 1th of
      January 2007 to 31th of December 2010.

      Outcome measures: Reoperation as a surrogate for recurrence.
