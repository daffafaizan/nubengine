      ESWT in combination with PRP for the management of resistant plantar fasciitis. We endeavor
      to determine if the pilot evidence supports a large, randomized study; and to conduct a power
      analysis for the follow-on study. The proposed pilot study will be a prospective
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing pain and functionality at the 3 week, 6
      week, 12 week and 6 month marks between extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) with
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection versus extracorporeal shock wave therapy with placebo
      injection of normal saline.
