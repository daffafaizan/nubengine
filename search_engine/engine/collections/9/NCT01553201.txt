      chronic pelvic pain have muscle spasm of their pelvic muscles. Muscle spasm may be a
      significant part of pain in women with endometriosis and other types of chronic pelvic pain.
      Botulinum toxin injection is widely used to treat conditions associated with excessive muscle
      activity and spasm. Studies of botulinum toxin injected into pelvic muscles of women with
      pelvic pain have shown a decrease pain and spasm, but too few women have been studied to
      conclude its effectiveness. We expect to show that botulinum toxin injection in women with
      pelvic pain will relieve some of their pelvic pain.

      Eligible subjects will be otherwise healthy women who have chronic pelvic pain and a history
      of endometriosis. Subjects will be randomized to either botulinum toxin injection or placebo
      (salt water) injection. After one month, we will evaluate the presence of the pain and all
      women will be offered botulinum toxin injection. We will also evaluate the need for
      reinjection.
