      for cholelithiasis who also had some of the following risk factors that increase the
      occurrence of SSI or TSH: BMI > 30 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, age > 65 years and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease. A circular prosthesis with an omega-3 coating was placed in
      patients in group A, and a prosthesis without omega-3 in its composition was placed in
      patients in group B. The main variables evaluated were the occurrence of SSI and TSH.
