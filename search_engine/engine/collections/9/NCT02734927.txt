      several colours into successive blocks. Each block included a series of eight letters. Each
      colour required a specific task given by a fixed rule (contextual control) but for some
      colour, the rule changes sometimes (episodic control). Participants are informed that payoffs
      vary according to their own performance. A frame indicates essay with bonus reward. Moreover
      a dashed frame indicates a low-bonus reward and a solid frame means a high-bonus reward. Thus
      different blocks are designed: low-incentive block and high incentive block.

      This reward increased from standard to bonus motivation in high-incentive block (contextual
      motivation) and from low to high according to the type of blocks (episodic motivation)
      Reaction time may be higher in bonus reward Patients with schizophrenia are not sensitive to
      contextual motivation, and therefore patients should behave differently than control in
      contextual motivation.
