      improved by shortening intervals of CHOP chemotherapy with the prophylactic use of G-CSF. The
      primary endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS), and the planned accrual was 450. Until
      December, 2002, 323 patients with advanced aggressive NHL were randomized to standard CHOP
      arm (CHOP x 8, every three weeks) and biweekly CHOP arm (CHOP x 8, every two weeks).
