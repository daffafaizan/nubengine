      treated for a minimum of 24 weeks in the absence of clear evidence of progressive disease.
      Participants who have any response will be permitted to continue treatment until relapse or
      progression of disease that is not sensitive to protocol defined dose escalation.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine Overall Response Rate (ORR) of
      5AZA-alt-DEC. The combined response endpoint will include complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR), and hematologic improvement (HI), with HI criteria specifically as defined by
      IWG criteria

      The secondary endpoints of this study include:

        -  Cumulative incidence of response for both CR and overall response

        -  Duration of response (DOR)

        -  Safety evaluation by tabulation of adverse events of grade 3 and higher

      Correlative endpoints include:

        -  Correlation of DNMT1 depletion with clinical response criteria

        -  Correlation of clinical response with disease biological phenotype measured by
           morphology and cytogenetics

        -  Exploratory measurements of pyrimidine metabolism pre-treatment and on-therapy
