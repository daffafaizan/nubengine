           (NAC) as a standard of care in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

        -  Although standard NAC regimen is controversial due to rare of head to head study between
           each regimens, cisplatin based multidrug combination regimens such as MVAC, GP, and dose
           dense MVAC (ddMVAC) with G-CSF supports are regarded as a backbone treatment on the
           basis of the results from previous studies.

        -  Application of NAC is still relatively slow adoption in real practice. These slow
           adoption result from intuitive concerns such as significant toxicity of multidrug
           combination chemotherapy represented by MVAC and delayed application of radical surgical
           treatment in non-responder

        -  The ddMVAC with G-CSF support regimen showed an improved efficacy compared with GP
           regimen, and tolerable compared with standard MVAC using application of routine G-CSF
           support and high intensity of cisplatin.

        -  In case of clinically lymph node evolvement (cN+) is not for strict NAC, but patient
           with cN+ UC have been treated induction chemotherapy of similar NAC regimens and
           surgical treatment. So, this study included MIBC plus cN+ UC as locally advanced UC.

        -  In Korea, there is a low adoption of NAC, additionally rare of ddMVAC with G-CFS in
           locally advanced UC. It is supposed concerns related with toxicity of ddMVAC. Although
           the concern is likely not true considering the previous result of the Western, there has
           not been studied ddMVAC as NAC in Asian including Korean.

        -  The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of four cycles of
           ddMVAC with G-CSF support in patients with locally advanced UC.
