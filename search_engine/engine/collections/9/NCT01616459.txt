    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity of the two formulations of GSK
      Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2830929A (11-valent vaccine or 11Pn vaccine) and 2830930A
      (12-valent vaccine or 12Pn vaccine), when administered as 3-dose primary vaccination during
      the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose in the second year of life, when
      compared to immune responses to the licensed vaccines Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™, and to
      assess the reactogenicity and safety of these two same investigational formulations when
      administered according to this schedule. To comply with the routine infant immunisation
      program, the licensed GSK Biologicals DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa™) vaccine will be
      co-administered in infants with the pneumococcal study vaccines.
