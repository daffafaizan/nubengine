      markers of AKI in the context of COVID-19 will be studied. These results will allow to
      propose more appropriate strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and timely management of
      patients with severe pneumonia due to COVID-19 and AKI. Knowing the viral load in urine and
      its evolution in patients with and without AKI will allow us to explore associations between
      the presence of the virus at the local level and the presence of kidney damage. Likewise, the
      presence of viral load in urine and its possible relationship with the local activation of
      the complement system, together with the detection of biomarkers of kidney damage, like NGAL,
      TIMP-2, IGFBP7, and IL-6, will allow us to better understand the pathophysiology of these
      alterations in the context of COVID-19; additionally, some patients received tocilizumab, an
      IL-6 inhibitor as a compassionate measure, which may reduce urinary levels of interleukins
      and other inflammatory markers.

      Finally, the study of possible differences in the metabolome in urine in patients with and
      without acute kidney injury could favor the discovery of new markers to identify patients
      with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptible to the development of AKI.

      Determine the evolution of NGAL, TIMP-2, IGFBP7, IL-6, viral load and metabolomic basal, and
      the days 3 , 5 and 7 after recruitment
