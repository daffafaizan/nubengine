      an open-air crib.

      The three electrodes of the ECG are attached at the standard positions and connected to the
      BSM-6501K patient monitor (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and vital signs are recorded and
      extracted.

      The data from the radar is connected to a computer through a USB interface, and signal
      processing has been automatically performed by a software algorithm described by our previous
      study. A Fourier transform decomposes a signal with respect to time into a frequency
      component.

      Vital sign is recorded continuously, and digital outputs are extracted from periods when no
      large noise or fluctuation occurs in both methods. While vital sign acquisition is
      significantly interfered with moving extensively, being in nursing care, repetitive
      myoclonus, hiccupping, flopping, or crying, the IR-UWB radar system stops the measurements
      and deletes the motion-contaminated observations automatically by itself. To investigate the
      artifact and interference by body movement during measurement, the level of movement is
      integrated based on the change of distance of the body from the radar. The radar transmits
      dozens of these signals (frames) to the computer every second, and the frame would not be
      changed if there was no movement within the range of the radar. However, if there is any
      movement, the difference of two frames (previous - current) is calculated.
