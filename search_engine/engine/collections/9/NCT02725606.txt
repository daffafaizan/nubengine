      tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of single subcutaneous injections of GW003
      in the breast cancer patients.GW003 is recombinant human serum albumin/human
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(I)fusion protein .It is a long-acting
      G-CSF(Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor). In this study, participants will be
      administered a single dose of GW003. Every subject will only accept one dose. In addition to
      tolerability and safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy and
      immunogenicity of GW003 will be evaluated as well.
