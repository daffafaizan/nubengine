      embedded into the provision of stroke rehabilitation. Barriers to implementation include time
      and resource. The feasibility of using the Bridges Stroke Self-Management Programme within an
      Early Supported Discharge Service and delivery by Rehabilitation Assistants is unknown.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate key trial parameters to inform the protocol of a future
      definitive trial into the effectiveness of Bridges delivered by rehabilitation assistants
      within an Early Supported Discharge Service.
