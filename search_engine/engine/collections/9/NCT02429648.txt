      several strategies to improve the outcomes of persistent/permanent AF ablation. At the
      Cleveland Clinic one of the commonly used strategies is Direct Current Cardioversion (DCC).
      Depending on physician preference, patients may be ablated in atrial fibrillation then Direct
      current cardioverted; or Direct current cardioverted and ablated in sinus rhythm. Neither
      approach has been shown to be superior. As both approaches are currently being performed
      based on physician preference, the investigators propose to study and compare both approaches
      in a randomized fashion for evidence based practice.

      The purpose of this study is to compare which standard of care strategy is superior in
      patients with persistent/permanent Atrial Fibrillation undergoing ablation, direct current
      cardioversion prior to empirical pulmonary vein isolation; or ablation in atrial fibrillation
      then direct current cardioversion if the patient remains in atrial fibrillation
