      the signed informed consent and will be divided in two groups depending on the type of the
      surgical technique. Either full sternotomy (FS) or minimal invasive sternotomy (MIS) will be
      performed, both with the use of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB).One week before and one week
      after the surgery patients will undergo mini mental test and measurement of visually evoked
      cerebral blood flow velocity response (VEFR).Levels of S100B, interleukin (IL) 1, IL 6, IL 8,
      IL 10 and microparticles will be determined before induction of anesthesia,as well as 6 h, 24
      h, 48 h and 7 days after CPB.Each patient will have invasive and non invasive monitoring that
      will include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), bispectral index (BIS) and TCD during
      surgery.MES will be detected using TCD at the following time-points: beginning of surgery,
      after sternotomy, during aortic cannulation, during CPB, during de-airing, opening of the
      clamp on the aorta and after CBP removal before chest closure.All of this data will be
      documented as well as the demographic characteristics of patients, their preoperative medical
      status, and intraoperative data (duration of surgery, duration of CPB, hemodynamic
      parameters, inotropic/vasoactive support,blood and blood components); duration of mechanical
      ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), duration of ICU stay, 30-day mortality and
      morbidity, as well as postoperative complications.
