    
      Aim 1: Test the association using Odds Ratios between seven individual biomarkers (cathepsin
      D, α-enolase and β-2-microglobulin [B2M], anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-histone,
      anti-transglutaminase) with pSS and build an initial panel and evaluate its sensitivity and
      specificity for diagnosis of SS at the time of interim analysis using the first 210 recruited
      subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: Individual biomarkers are significantly associated with SS. Hypothesis 2: The
      panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of SS.

      Aim 2: Test the panel on the second 210 recruited subjects, refine and evaluate the panel
      sensitivity and specificity on entire 420 subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: The panel built from Aim 1 has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for
      diagnosis of SS.

      Hypothesis 2: The refined panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of
      SS.
