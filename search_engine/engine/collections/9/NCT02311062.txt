      between-participant conditions, ECC, UNS and C, were tested. Once considered eligible for the
      study, all participants were familiarized with the testing procedures. Participants attended
      the laboratory for a pre-training test session, where body mass, height and muscle functional
      parameters were recorded. Two days after their pre-test, participants including in ECC or UNS
      started a 6 weeks (18 sessions) training program while the control group did not perform any
      type of resistance training.

      Nevertheless, during the 6 weeks intervention period all three groups continued with their
      normal recreationally physical activity consisting in 2 to 3 sessions per week of soccer
      training or friendly matches. Two days after the end of the intervention period muscle
      function was re-tested.
