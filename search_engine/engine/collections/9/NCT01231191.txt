    
      Primary Specific Aim: To determine if adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous
      acetaminphen to usual and customary analgesics during ambulatory surgery impacts the
      proportion of patients remaining opioid-free in the post-anesthesia recovery room.

      Hypothesis: Adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous acetaminophen to usual and customary
      analgesics during ambulatory surgery increases the proportion of patients remaining
      opioid-free in the post-anesthesia recovery room.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To determine if adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous
      acetaminophen to usual and customary analgesics during amublatory surgery impacts the
      required doses of additional perioperative analgesics.

      Hypothesis: Adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous acetaminophen to usual and customary
      analgesics during ambulatory surgery decreases the required doses of additional analgesics in
      both the operating room and post-anesthesia recovery room.
