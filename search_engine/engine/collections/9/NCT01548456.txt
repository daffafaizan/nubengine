      (MOI) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All adult patients with diaphyseal femur fractures meeting
      the eligibility criteria will be invited to enroll. Study subjects will be treated at the
      discretion of the surgeons at MOI. This could include an intramedullary nail, a plate,
      external fixation, or skeletal traction. Potential confounders recorded will be age, gender,
      body mass index, comorbidities, fracture pattern, open versus closed injury, time from injury
      to presentation, time from presentation to surgery, and associated injuries. The primary
      outcome considered will be reoperation for any reason. Secondary outcomes will be clinical
      union, defined as full-painless weight bearing on the injured extremity, radiographic union,
      return to work, and health-related quality-of-life. Follow up will be scheduled at 2 weeks, 6
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery and will include both clinical and
      radiographic evaluation.
