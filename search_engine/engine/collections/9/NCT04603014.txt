      catheter using 10% Dextrose infusate is feasible and provides effective volume management and
      sodium removal in prevalent HD patients.

      Overview: This is a prospective, interventional pilot study from the London Health Sciences
      Centre (LHSC) prevalent HD population. Study patients will undergo the surgical implantation
      of a Tenckhoff peritoneal dialysis catheter before study start. After the successful
      insertion of the Tenckhoff catheter, study patients will enter a run-in phase, where their
      residual renal function, volume, hemodynamic and cardiac status during HD will be assessed.
      During the following weeks (intervention weeks 1, 2, 3), study patients will receive
      in-center iPUF intervention, consisting of peritoneal infusate instillation of a 10% dextrose
      solution via a Tenckhoff catheter, immediately after the first two HD sessions of the week
      (Monday, Wednesday); the infusate will be dwelling in the study patient's peritoneal cavity
      for 2 hours, at the end of which the solution will be drained and the patient sent home.
      Study patients will be monitored during infusate administration and for the first four hours
      thereafter. The study intervention will be discontinued at the beginning of week 5
      (Wash-out); during week 5 and the first HD session of week 6, study patients will be
      monitored to observe potential residual effects of the iPUF intervention.
