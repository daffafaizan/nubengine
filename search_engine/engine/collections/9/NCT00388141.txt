    
      Background: The unborn infant's brain is growing from the fifth month of fetal life which
      makes preterm babies sensitive to environmental influence. Therefore, to prevent
      developmental brain injury is an essential goal for neonatal nurses.

      Purpose: The study investigates whether systematic use of Newborn Individualized
      Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP®) improves the neurological development of
      preterm babies and the parental competence of mothers.

      Design: This study compares postnatal care of preterm babies in two neonatal units.

      Participants: Preterm infants born before 32 weeks' gestational age and their mothers.

      Instruments:

        -  Preterm babies' behaviour in intervention and control groups is observed every 7-12 days
           using scoring sheets.

        -  Questionnaires focusing on maternal self esteem when the baby is 4 weeks and again at 3
           and 18 months and 5 years.

      Expected outcomes:

        -  Infants: less time with treatment using CPAP and oxygen, growth, time of discharge and
           pattern of motor behaviour.

        -  Mothers: self reported experiences of self esteem.

      Analysis: t-test Expected implications: In a health promotion perspective the systematic
      NIDCAP program hopefully will constitute a more competent mother, knowledgeable in child care
      and parental management. The intervention NIDCAP®-care infant group is expected to increase
      in growth compared to the control group, their motor system will be more mature, and there
      will be an earlier discharge, all factors contributing positively to health economy.
