the natural history of autoimmunedisease in nzb micea comparison with the pattern of humanautoimmune manifestationsall mice of the nzb/bl strain spon-taneously develop serological andpathological evidence of autoimmune dis-ease during adult life.  the nzb/bl strainwas developed by dr. marianne bielschow-sky in dunedin, new zealand, by inbreed-ing from an outbred colony of mixed coatcolor.  several inbred strains--nzb, nzc,nzo, nzw, nzy, and others, have beenevolved in dunedin from the original col-ony.  evidence for autoimmune disease inthe nzb strain was first reported bybielschowsky, helyer, and howie whofound evidence of an autoimmune hemo-lytic anemia.  the dunedin group used thepresence of agglutinins for ficin-treated redcells as the index of the disease.
