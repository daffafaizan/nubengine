      developed by Takeda Global Research & Development as a treatment for type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) prolongs the action of 2 important
      incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      peptide (GIP). These hormones are responsible for increasing insulin synthesis, regulating
      Î²-cell proliferation, inhibiting gastric emptying, and inhibiting glucagon secretion.

      To date, alogliptin has not been studied in participants less than 18 years of age. As with
      adults, there is growing evidence of an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus in children and adolescents.

      This study is designed to determine the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles
      of alogliptin in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These profiles will
      be compared with those of similarly matched adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and safety endpoints will be analyzed.
