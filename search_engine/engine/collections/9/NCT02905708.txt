      devices currently used which consists of a forced air warming device. This will be applied in
      the form of a gown in the pre-operative area. The device is called the Bair Paws. (Subjects
      will either continue with this or have a separate forced air warming device applied in the
      operating room called a Bair Hugger.) This device is non experimental and is FDA approved and
      used within the hospital to keep patients warm. They will then have their temperature taken
      and documented by the staff at various prescribed times.

      The second group will receive the warming devices being studied which consist of a jacket,
      pants, gloves and socks with integrated air-activated chemical heat packs. The garment is
      applied at least twenty minutes prior to surgery. The same warming device will be maintained
      in place throughout the surgery and the period of post-anesthesia.

      Intraoperative period: The participants temperature will be monitored and documented at
      prescribed times.

      Postoperative period: The participants will have temperature monitored in the post anesthesia
      care area. Your part in this study will last until you are admitted to your room after
      surgery or you change into your own clothes prior to discharge.
