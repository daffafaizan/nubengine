      treatments or not is the key to smoothly. Arm vein intermittently gripping arm movements, can
      promote the increased diameter of arteriovenous fistula, which enhance the maturity of
      fistula, the effect of lack of empirical research. Objective: this study, randomized
      controlled study, investigate systematic random arm vein pressure and arm movements to
      arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients improve the maturity rate and effectiveness of
      the diameter. Methods: a prospective comparative study randomly assigned. This study plan for
      each patient has received a wrist artery and vein access tracks before and after 3 months of
      operation, according to randomly divided into three groups, the first group of patients after
      accepted guidance for systematic and intermittent arm movements; the second group of patients
      receiving the guidance system of intermittent arm vein compression and arm movements; a third
      group as a control group. Discussion: the plan is expected to include 150 patients, receive
      instruction after the randomly with/without systemic venous pressure, with/without systemic
      movement. The plan design under the patient safety assessment of the effectiveness of these
      two activities the primary end point and secondary end points. This study offers clinicians
      advise patients, how to effectively improve the patients ' arteriovenous access matured speed
      and diameter. Keywords: Arteriovenous shunt, compression bandages, exercise therapy, renal
      dialysis
