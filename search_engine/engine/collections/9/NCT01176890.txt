      peptidase IV so only 10-15% enters the systemic circulation. This has led to the hypothesis
      that GLP-1 interact locally with afferent sensory nerve fibers. We investigated the role of
      intact vagal innervations on the effect of GLP-1 on the food intake, gastric emptying (GE)
      and appetite.
