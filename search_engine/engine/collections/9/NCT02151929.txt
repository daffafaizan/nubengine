      revascularization in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The everolimus
      eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) has shown efficacy and safety in stable patient
      but not in acute coronary syndromes. The study tested the feasibility and safety of BVS in
      patient treated with primary PCI (pPCI) Methods. Consecutive STEMI patients admitted within
      12 hours of symptom onset and undergoing primary angioplasty and stent implantation at a
      tertiary center with 24-hour primary PCI capability will be randomly assigned to everolimus
      eluting stent (EES) or BVS. Primary endpoints are procedural and clinical success. The MACE
      (cardiac death, non fatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR)) and
      definite or probable ST will be evaluated at six months.
