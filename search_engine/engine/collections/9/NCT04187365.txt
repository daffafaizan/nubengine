    
      The purpose of the study is to compare clinical outcomes of women with bladder distension
      injuries due to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) who have varying duration of
      catheterization for initial treatment of postpartum urinary retention.

      Hypotheses

        1. Longer duration of therapeutic catheterization will be associated with resolution of
           postpartum voiding dysfunction in women who sustain severe bladder distension injuries
           due to postpartum urinary retention.

           Definition of resolution of postpartum voiding dysfunction:

           A. A post void residual volume of less than half of initial instilled volume on the
           first retrograde voiding trial, AND B. No need for re-treatment for urinary retention
           within 1 week

        2. The incidence of postpartum urinary retention (PUR) will vary by route of delivery, with
           operative vaginal delivery having the highest incidence.

        3. Risk factors for PUR will be related to intrapartum and delivery conditions
