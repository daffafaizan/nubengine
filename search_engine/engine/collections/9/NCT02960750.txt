      transport (3401184). This sedentary pattern that has been detrimentally associated with
      obesity and cardiovascular disease markers (4604082). However, replacing as little as 10
      minutes of sedentary time with the same amount of light or moderate physical activity is
      associated with substantial health benefits (i.e. reduction of the metabolic syndrome)
      (26635358).

      Because eighty percent of adults in developed countries spend one third of their working day
      doing sedentary, desk-based tasks (24603203) -representing a high exposure to this
      established health risk- displacing occupational sitting with physical activity may be a
      feasible option for improving office employeesÂ´ health and therefore public health
      (26984326).

      In this context, there is a need to develop and evaluate translational research, based on
      theoretically-derived strategies, that can be successfully embedded into workplaces
      (26984326).
