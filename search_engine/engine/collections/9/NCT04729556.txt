    
      A prospective, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted to initially
      evaluate safety of sericin-chitosan cream in comparison with a commercially available cream
      containing dimethicone for pressure sore treatment in healthy volunteers. The results of this
      study provided preliminary safety profile of sericin-chitosan cream before conducting the
      further clinical trial in specific population (pateints with early-stage pressure sore).
