    
      Rationale:

      COPD is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreversible airway obstruction.
      Chronic inflammation lead to degradation of extracellular matrix and hereby destruction of
      lung parenchyma. Tetracyclines are known for their anti-inflammatory properties in diseases
      such as rheumatoid arthritis.

      Objective:

      To assess the effect of doxycycline on markers of neutrophilic inflammation and proteolytic
      activity in induced sputum of stable GOLD II and III COPD patients.

      Study population:

      Thirty patients with stable GOLD II COPD.

      Intervention:

      Placebo versus doxycycline in randomised design.
