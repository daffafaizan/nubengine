      mismatched transplant strategies have been remarkable for a low transplant related mortality
      rate, but a still formidable risk of GVHD and graft rejection. In this trial, we have
      incorporated a combination ex-vivo T-cell depletion strategy to prevent GVHD with vigorous in
      vivo depletion of host (and to a lesser extent donor) T-cells to prevent graft rejection.

      Patients will receive non-myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide, thymoglobulin,
      fludarabine, and thymic irradiation, followed by a T-cell depleted PBSC infusion.
      Cyclosporine will be given for GVHD prophylaxis, and tapered beginning on day 35. Data from
      our mouse model and previous clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach can induce
      mixed chimerism without GVHD, with the potential for conversion of mixed chimerism to full
      donor hematopoiesis following donor leukocyte infusions.
