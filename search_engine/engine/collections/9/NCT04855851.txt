      integration of psychological factors, such as cognitions and beliefs about pain,
      fear-avoidance behaviors or catastrophism within the integrative perception of the concept .
      This has led to the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at the reconceptualization of
      pain through a treatment method called Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE), having shown
      evidence in the treatment of pain, disability, catastrophism and physical performance.

      But despite current advances in pain neuroscience, there are still pain syndromes, such as
      fibromyalgia, that are the subject of debate and controversy. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome that
      causes generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and physical disability.
      It is the main cause of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain, with a prevalence of 1-5%
      of the world population. Scientific research has provided new insight for the diagnosis of
      fibromyalgia patients, who are characterized by a central sensitization process.

      Objectives:

      To assess the effectiveness of Pain Neuroscience Education and Strength Training to decrease
      pain and disability; and increasing quality of life and functionality in patients with
      Fibromyalgia.
