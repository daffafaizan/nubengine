      study evaluating the role of mobile technology to improve diabetes care in adults with type 1
      diabetes (REMOTE-T1D). We hypothesize that the use of mobile technology (iBGStar® technology
      [iPhone® plus the BGStar®]) will result in improvement in Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO),
      and Treatment Satisfactions with a possible reductions of glucose excursions, A1c, and severe
      hypoglycemia as compared to routine clinical care using traditional glucose meter
      SMBG-Accu-chek®. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of these technologies in a
      clinical setting with a hope to improve outcomes and health care cost savings.

      The study will enroll 100 patients from the Barbara Davis Center Adult clinic over the age of
      18 years who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intervention group using mobile
      technology (iBG Star) vs. continued routine clinical care (control) using SMBG-Accu-chek
      meter. All subjects will be followed for study visits with similar frequency at baseline,
      1-week, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) using a
      DexCom SEVEN Plus® system in a blinded mode for 7 days at baseline (wk0), 1mo, 3mo, and 6mo.

      Laboratory analysis for A1c will be performed at baseline, 1-month 3-months, and 6-months.
      Routine blood tests will be performed in all subjects at baseline, 3months, and 6-months.
      Blinded CGM data will be analyzed for mean blood glucose values, time spent in hyperglycemic
      (>240, >300mg/dl) and hypoglycemic (<50, <70, <80 mg/dl) ranges and various indices of
      glycemic variability.
