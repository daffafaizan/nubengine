    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the incidence of graft acceptance in patients with hematological disorders
           treated with combined immunosuppression before and after HLA-haploidentical
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -6 to
           -1, busulfan IV on days -6 to -5, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -4 to -1.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo transplantation of donor hematopoietic stem cells on
           day 0. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 3 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
           beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive cyclosporine IV beginning on day -2 and continuing
           for 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil 4 times a day on days 4-84.
