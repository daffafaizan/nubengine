      encephalopathy and its consequences.

      For this purpose we will:

        1. Provide extensive cognitive testing. These results provide the basis for categorization
           of patients surviving septic encephalopathy and delirious patients.

        2. First, the investigators will examine if the differences in cognitive function is
           reflected in the ability of the brain to generate high-frequency electrical oscillations
           that accompany and underlie perception, attention, cognition, memory formation and
           retrieval. It will be performed by carrying out continuous EEG (cEEG) and by examination
           of steady-state evoked cognitive EEG responses.

        3. Second, the investigations will examine MRI, structural and diffusion tensor imaging
           sequences. Hippocampal, thalamic, amygdala, lentiform nucleus and cingulate cortex
           volumes will be determined bilaterally and will be compared between individuals with
           healthy brain aging and patients that survived delirium.

        4. Third, the investigators will assess plasma markers of free radical production.
