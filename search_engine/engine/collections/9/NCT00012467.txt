    
      Patients are randomized into 1 of 3 parallel groups for a 3-arm, 2-stage, double-blind and
      dose-ranging study for 14 weeks. In Stage 1, patients are hospitalized for 14 days of acute
      therapy. Patients receive rIFN-gamma 1b or placebo sc 3 times per week, intravenous (IV) AMB
      daily, and with or without oral 5-FC every 6 hours. Patients who have the ability to take
      oral medications, who do not have any significant clinical deterioration during the previous
      14 days, and who meet the eligibility criteria can progress to Stage 2. In Stage 2 patients
      receive 84 days of consolidation therapy (56 days with study drug and 28 days of follow-up).
      On an outpatient basis, patients receive either placebo or 1 of 2 doses of rIFN-gamma 1b sc 3
      times per week, and oral fluconazole daily or oral itraconazole 2 times a day.
