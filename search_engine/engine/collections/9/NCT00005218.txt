      Angina pectoris is often considered a manifestation of coronary artery atherosclerosis that
      is associated with an increased mortality risk. Overall, coronary heart disease is the
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States Blacks. In an attempt to
      standardize the diagnosis of angina pectoris in epidemiologic studies, Rose developed a
      questionnaire for cardiovascular field surveys which has primarily been used in United States
      and other white populations. However, in 1988, there were no valid epidemiological tools for
      the assessment of angina pectoris in Blacks. The development of a cardiovascular survey
      instrument capable of assessing angina pectoris in Black populations was identified by the
      Association of Black Cardiologists as an urgent epidemiologic need. Also, such a survey
      instrument could ultimately enhance knowledge and treatment of cardiovascular disease among
      Blacks.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
