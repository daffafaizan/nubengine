      I. To assess the diagnostic benefit of the VELscope (direct visual fluorescence) inspection
      in oral examination.

      II. Efficacy of the VELscope in identifying dysplastic (premalignant) and malignant oral
      mucosal lesions and in discriminating these lesions from common benign tissue changes.

      III. Accuracy of clinical judgment versus VELscope findings. IV. Ability of the VELscope to
      identify lesions or extent of lesions beyond what is clinically apparent.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo conventional oral examination (COE) followed by direct visual fluorescence
      examination (DVFE). Patients with tissue abnormalities found by COE or DVFE undergo scalpel
      biopsy within 2 weeks.
