    
      This is a multicenter, collaborative, randomized, open-label study designed to explore the
      effects of administration of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) [2 g (2 g PO QD) or 4 g (2 g
      PO BID) for 8 weeks] on vascular endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD), in patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor
      and have concurrent hypertriglyceridemia.

      Considering the potential bias by factors that affect FMD between treatment groups,
      stratified allocation will be performed with fasting triglyceride (TG) level as a factor.
