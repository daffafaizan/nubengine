      and accounts for roughly 40,000 deaths each year. Despite the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      therapies, little progress has been made in the the last three decades, and the search for
      more efficacious treatment continues.In patients with a good performance status the
      combination of effective systemic therapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and high dose local
      radiotherapy may improve disease outcomes. This is a prospective, single arm study in
      patients in newly diagnosed, previously untreated pancreatic cancer who are planned to
      undergo surgical resection The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of
      a neoadjuvant approach incorporating gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and Hypofractionated image
      guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (HIGRT) prior to surgical resection. Eligible
      subjects will recieve standard neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel dosing is as
      follows:Nab-Paclitaxel (125mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles Gemcitabine
      (1000mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles followed by HIGRT and surgical resection.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy may be given post surgery at the discretion of the treating medical
      oncologist.
