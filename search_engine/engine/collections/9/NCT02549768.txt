      remove most of the tumors of the sellar region. Sometimes the intervention produces
      dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and although most are transient, the risk
      associated with post-operative hypocortisolism determines its evaluation early in the
      postoperative period and the possibility of steroidal supplementation posteriorly. It is
      described that dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant drug in this type of surgery being
      useful in reduction of total consumption of opioids and anesthetic gases, maintain
      hemodynamic stability and less time to recovery from anesthesia. Due to its sympatholytic
      effect, dexmedetomidine has been found to alter the intraoperative common neuroendocrine
      response generating lower levels of cortisol in the postoperative period than patients in
      which is not used.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate corticosteroid axis response (cortisol and
      adrenocorticotropic hormone) in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery under anesthesia
      with dexmedetomidine. A single-center randomized double-blind clinical trial will be
      conducted that will compare two groups of patients, one of which will be given
      dexmedetomidine (Dex group) and another group who will receive a placebo (control group). In
      addition the incidence of perioperative complications (nausea, vomiting, diabetes insipidus),
      intraoperative hemodynamics and patient comfort. The investigators expect that the normal
      stress response to surgery measured by cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone in the
      postoperative period will be reduced in the dexmedetomidine arm. This effect should be
      transient and attributed to use of dexmedetomidine and not to surgery.
