      Primary

        -  Determine whether a modified version of a self-administered stress management training
           intervention, previously found to be of benefit in chemotherapy patients, is effective
           in improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress (anxiety and
           depression) in patients with cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the efficacy of this intervention on improving quality of life and decreasing
           psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in male vs female patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive self-administered stress management training (SSMT) in 3 stress
           management techniques (progressive muscle relaxation training and guided imagery,
           abdominal breathing, and coping skills) adapted specifically for use during
           radiotherapy. Patients initially receive a 5-minute standardized presentation regarding
           the nature and purpose of SSMT. Patients then receive information and instruction
           regarding the three stress management techniques comprising a videotape, audiotape, and
           brochure. Patients also receive their institution's usual psychosocial care.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive their institution's usual psychosocial care only. Quality of
           life, anxiety, and depression are assessed at baseline and then at 1, 2, and 3 weeks.
           Intervention helpfulness is assessed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 327 patients (approximately 163 per treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study within 2 years.
