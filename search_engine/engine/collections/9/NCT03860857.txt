      structure and function, as well as cognition in non-demented older adults. The goal is to
      develop a more complete understanding of the factors that lead to cognitive decline in the
      elderly and progression to AD. The investigators will enroll 200 cognitively intact adults
      between the ages of 60-85 years old from the UCI Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or
      directly from the local community. Study procedures will include: 1) PET amyloid scans with
      Amyvidâ„¢ radiotracer (florbetapir-F18) and PET tau scans with [18F]MK6240 radiotracer; 2)
      High-resolution structural, functional, and diffusion MRI; and 3) Cognitive examinations. The
      investigators will track cognitive outcomes through longitudinal monitoring. Amyloid imaging
      will only be conducted once in the study at baseline, and MRI and tau PET imaging will be at
      baseline and Year 1. The investigators aim to identify the best combination of tests for
      predicting longitudinal cognitive/clinical decline. The proposed study will significantly
      inform the understanding of cognitive decline in the aging brain and allow investigators to
      better define preclinical AD and make recommendations for future intervention trials.
