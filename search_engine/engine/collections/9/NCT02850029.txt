      aminoglycoside administration varies widely among countries. The aim of this multicenter
      observational study is to provide up-to-date and comprehensive descriptive data on current
      aminoglycoside (tobramycin, amikacin or gentamicin) use in a large cohort of critically ill
      patients in different countries. The benefits expected from this study are a better
      understanding of worldwide aminoglycoside prescription variability in critically ill patients
      and to determine the risk factors of inadequate aminoglycoside dosing regimens.
