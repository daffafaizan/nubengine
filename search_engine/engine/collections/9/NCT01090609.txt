      reasons:

        1. reduced acute complications, such as acute and subacute occlusion, as well as the need
           of urgent myocardial revascularization;

        2. reduced coronary restenosis. STRESS and BENESTENT 1 pivotal clinical trials7,9 laid the
           foundations for approval and confirmation of the efficacy of coronary stents. These
           studies showed a reduction in the binary angiographic restenosis rates from 42.1% to
           31.6% (p<0.05) and from 32% to 22% (p=0.02), respectively. The efficacy of coronary
           stents is due to the fact that these devices reduce the acute elastic recoil and late
           negative remodeling of coronary arteries because of their capacity to maintain the
           vessel adequately open without reducing vessel diameter.

      CronusÂ® stent is fabricated in cobalt-chromium. This alloy is currently used cardiovascular
      stents and permanent implants in orthopedic (hips, knees), dental and maxillofacial
      surgeries. Guidant and Medtronic have conducted clinical evaluations of stents fabricated
      with a similar cobalt-chromium alloy and demonstrated safety and efficacy of the
      investigational devices. Both stents are currently available in the European market.
