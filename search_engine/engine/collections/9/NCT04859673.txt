      interfere with functional improvement, the patient's quality of life, and it may impede the
      process of rehabilitation. Further understanding of rotator cuff tendon impairment and other
      shoulder soft tissue structural abnormalities in stroke patients may help clinicians in
      assigning more complete therapeutic plans to hemiplegic patients. The radial extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy has promising results in patients with musculoskeletal problems and in
      those with various causes of HSP, including spasticity, rotator cuff problems, adhesive
      capsulitis, and complex regional pain syndrome .The purposes of this study are to examine
      sonographic structural changes pre and post the radial extracorporeal shock wave intervention
      in hemiplegic shoulder pain, as well as to explore the relationships between sonographic
      structural changes and hemiplegic shoulder pain. This study will be a benefit in the physical
      therapy field and may guide rehabilitation programs of physical therapy towards better
      results through decreasing time needed to perform activity of daily living, decreasing
      dependency and making patient an active member in society.
