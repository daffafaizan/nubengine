      Center. It is designed to study the effects of the move into the CRC on the amount of
      activity an individual performs daily in terms of units measured by a waist mounted pedometer
      (horizontal and vertical steps).

      The hypotheses are:

        1. There will be an increase in amount of activity in CRC compared with CC (horizontal
           distance traveled, up/down activity including stairs and chairs).

        2. There will be an increase in walk velocity after move into CRC. This implies an
           increased level of aerobic capacity.

      There will be an increase in the musculoskeletal symptoms, especially in the lower
      extremities and low back after move to the CRC. This implies there will be overuse of lower
      extremities because of increased activity.
