      not using NPWT in post-operative wound management following a complex spinal surgery. The
      allocation of patients (no NPWT device versus applying an NPWT device) will be determined by
      computer-generated randomization. The following data will be collected to determine impact on
      the outcome of wound management (i.e., infection and wound dehiscence): age, gender, body
      mass index (BMI), dorsal fat, estimated blood loss during the surgical procedure, length of
      surgery, length of hospital stay, highest peri-operative glucose, medical comorbidities, and
      history of infection.
