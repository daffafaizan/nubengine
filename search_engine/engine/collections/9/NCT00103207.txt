    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or stage IIIB or IV
           bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or adenocarcinoma of the lung with BAC features treated
           with cetuximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival and time to progression in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate expression of total and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor
           (EGFR), total and phosphorylated AKT3, and total and phosphorylated MAPKinase with
           response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine whether the presence of polymorphisms or mutations in the EGFR gene influences
           response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients were accrued for this study.
