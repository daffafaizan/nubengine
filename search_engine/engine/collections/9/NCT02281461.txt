      policy statement, "Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of
      new-born male circumcision outweigh the risks; furthermore, the benefits of newborn male
      circumcision justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits
      from male circumcision were identified for the prevention of urinary tract infections,
      acquisition of HIV, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer.
      Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or
      sexual satisfaction. It is imperative that those providing circumcision are adequately
      trained and that both sterile techniques and effective pain management are used. Significant
      acute complications are rare."

      The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the PrePex device
      among healthy early infant and children males scheduled for voluntary circumcision. The study
      consisted of 2 phases:

      Phase I included infants age 5-33 days Phase II included children age 4-10 years.

      The study examined the feasibility of performing PrePex circumcision on early infants and
      children male population.
