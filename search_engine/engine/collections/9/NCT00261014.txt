      of oral anticoagulant therapy remains high (5-27% per year). The risk of recurrent VTE,
      however, is not likely high enough to justify indefinite anticoagulation in all patients with
      a first idiopathic VTE due to the rate of major bleeding with oral anticoagulants (2-6% per
      year), the inconvenience and cost of oral anticoagulant therapy, monitoring of oral
      anticoagulant therapy (e.g. prescription costs, time off work to go for lab tests, parking
      etc) and the lifestyle limitations of oral anticoagulant therapy (avoidance of certain
      physical activities, dietary restrictions, avoidance of pregnancy). Further, as some have
      argued, perhaps all that anticoagulant therapy achieves is to delay recurrent VTE and, as a
      recent editorial suggested, a tailored approached is required to determine sub-groups who
      require lifelong anticoagulation. A means to stratify patients with idiopathic VTE to
      identify a group at low risk of recurrent VTE who could safely discontinue oral
      anticoagulants subsequent to six months of therapy would be a significant advance in the care
      of these patients.
