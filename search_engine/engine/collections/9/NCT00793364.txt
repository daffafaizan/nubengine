    
      Design: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study Number of participants: 150 (3
      groups with 50 subjects each). Intervention: One group will be assigned to stanol ester
      spread (2 g/day) based on olive oil, another on spread with olive oil containing placebo
      stanol ester (in identical containers with the stanol ester spread). In the third group, a
      structured effort will be made to improve adherence to Mediterranean diet by at least 2
      points in a 10-level scale. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet will be improved by a
      dietician with detailed explanation of the composition of the diet, preparation of several
      week specific programs according to dietary preferences of the specific subject. Dietician
      interviews with a 5 day questionnaire on consumed foods will establish the degree of
      adherence to Mediterranean diet.

      Duration: 16 weeks (4 weeks of lifestyle advice and 12 weeks of treatment).
