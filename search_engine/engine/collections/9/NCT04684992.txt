      (GEBT) can be successfully administered via a telehealth platform. Telehealth administration
      of GEBT is where a trained Cairn employee uses a video link to remotely supervise the
      completion of the test request form, collection of breath samples, cooking and consumption of
      the test meal and return of breath samples by the patient to Cairn.
