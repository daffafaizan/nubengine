      meats), palmitic (found in meats, dairy and some plant oils) and stearic acid's metabolic
      product, oleic (found in olive and corn oil) - will be used to displace each other in a
      standardized diet and fed to mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women using a
      randomized-controlled crossover design. A critical issue remains unresolved - the relative
      comparability among . The findings from this research study will enable us to understand the
      mechanism and potential health effect of different types of fats. Each of the diet phases
      will be 5 weeks in length with a 2-4 week break between phases. All food and drink will be
      provided to study volunteers. Blood pressure and body weight will be monitored once per week
      and adjustments made, if necessary, to maintain a stable weight. During the 5th week of each
      diet phase, volunteers will come to the center on 3 consecutive days to provide fasting blood
      samples and a non-fasting blood sample.
