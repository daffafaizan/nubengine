      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with ensartinib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor ALK
      or ROS1 fusions or that harbor ALK missense mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with ensartinib
      with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor ALK or ROS1 fusions or that harbor ALK missense mutations.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of ensartinib in children with relapsed or
      refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of ensartinib in children with
      relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to ensartinib and specifically,
      whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions (including the crizotinib
      resistant F1174L ALK variant) will demonstrate differential response to ensartinib treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ensartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
