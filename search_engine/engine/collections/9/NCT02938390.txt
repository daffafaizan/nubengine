      risk-reducing surgery and surgical treatment for breast cancer. The oncologic safety has been
      well established in multiple studies in appropriately selected individuals. Additionally,
      rates of wound complications and risk factors for wound problems are well documented. The
      intercostal perforating vessels (IPV) have been demonstrated to provide a significant
      proportion of the blood supply to the nipple-areolar complex1-3. Thus, preservation of these
      vessels is essential to reducing ischemic necrosis of the nipple-areolar complex. We propose
      that localization of these vessels utilizing intra-operative ultrasound (US) will reduce
      ischemic necrosis complications of NSM.

      Objectives

        -  Demonstrate that US is an effective means of localizing the IPV intraoperatively.

        -  Evaluate the frequency of IPV preservation with the use of US.

        -  Measure rate and severity of ischemic necrosis when US is utilized to preserve IPV.

        -  Compare observed rate with historical controls.
