      However, the incidence of entecavir resistance increases over 50% at 5th year in
      lamivudine-refractory CHB patients. Considering cross resistance profile, adefovir is a good
      option for managing entecavir resistance. However adefovir monotherapy may lead to adefovir
      resistance, because entecavir resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) retain lamivudine resistance.
      Previously, combination of adefovir and lamivudine was reported to be effective in a patient
      with entecavir resistance, but only as a case report form. No further data are available on
      this combination therapy in a sufficient number of patients. It is thought that adefovir and
      lamivudine combination therapy reduce the risk of adefovir resistance, thereby continued
      combination treatment will result in suppression of HBV DNA to be undetectable in patients
      with entecavir resistance.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of adefovir and lamivudine combination
      therapy in CHB patients with entecavir resistance.
