      them were able to measure the two main functions of these muscles: rising and force of
      compression. Vaginal palpation is frequently used in clinical evaluation routine and
      especially the modified Oxford score, but some articles question the Oxford scale sensitivity
      and its correlation with objective force contraction measurements.

      Methods: 45 patients with urinary incontinence treated at the Uroginecology Ambulatory
      Service of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre were included. The patients had been
      submitted to vaginal palpation using the Oxford score, assessed by a skilled physical
      therapist, and to the compression force measurement by means of an air filled ballonet
      connected to a pressure transducer. The two evaluations had been carried in the same day.
