      be randomized to receive either proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (lanzoprazole 30 mg) or placebo
      for one month. At base line they will be investigated to rule out arrhythmia by documenting
      normal heart rate (less than 110 beat per minute) or ECG showing normal sinus rhythm or mild
      sinus tachycardia (Less than 110 per minute) during symptoms. Obvious causes such as anxiety
      due to a stressful event or organic causes such anemia or thyroid disorders should be also
      ruled out.

      Patient who agree to participate in the study will be asked to sign an informed consent. A
      baseline questionnaire with symptoms will be filled. They will then be randomized for
      treatment with either PPI or placebo once at night time. After 10 days of treatment they will
      be contacted and questioned regarding their symptoms. The two groups will be compared to see
      if there is any improvement of symptoms with treatment.
