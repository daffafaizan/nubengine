    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study assessing the efficacy of three potentially
      regenerative treatments for degenerative conditions of the joints of the lower back (facet,
      sacroiliac), upper extremities (e.g., shoulder), and lower extremities (e.g., hip, knee).
      These treatments are:

        1. A single injection of Applied Biologics' FloGraftTM.

        2. A single injection of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells.

        3. A single injection of platelet rich plasma.

      Subjects will be assessed prior to treatment for their level of pain, quality of life, and
      pain medication usage. Subjects will be followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24
      weeks after treatment. At each of these follow up visits, pain, quality of life, and pain
      medication usage will be assessed.

      The investigators hypothesize that all three treatment groups will experience reduced pain,
      improved quality of life, and reduced pain medication usage at follow up.
