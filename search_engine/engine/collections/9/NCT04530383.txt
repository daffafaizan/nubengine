    
      Up to 36 patients with CFRD on highly effective CFTR modulator therapy who meet criteria and
      agree to participation in the study will be placed on metformin 500 mg twice daily (low) and
      1000 mg twice daily (normal) in a randomized order (simple randomization). There will be a
      dose-escalation with each dosing regimen starting with 500mg twice daily, followed by 1000mg
      in the AM and 500 mg in the PM and finally followed by 1000 mg twice daily (in those in the
      normal dose portion of the crossover trial). Participants will continue each dosing regimen
      of metformin for 14 weeks with a washout period of 2 weeks between dose changes.
