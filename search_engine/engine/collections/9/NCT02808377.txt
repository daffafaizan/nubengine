      very problematic. About one in ten women in the developed world will require surgery for
      prolapse in their lifetime. The results of surgery are not perfect and some of women will
      develop prolapse again or not be satisfied with the result.

      In this study a soft silicone support (SPOP) is inserted into the vagina straight after
      prolapse surgery. Women who have agreed to the study will be randomly chosen to have the SPOP
      at the time of surgery. There will be 120 patients in the study; so 60 women will have the
      SPOP inserted.

      The investigators think that SPOP will support the vagina as it heals, improving the results
      of surgery. There are already some studies of the SPOP with other surgeries that show
      improved results. The SPOP is inserted while the patient is sleeping and is removed four
      weeks after surgery. It is attached with two dissolving stiches to the vagina. After four
      weeks is will be removed in the out patient clinic without any discomfort. It is not usually
      painful or uncomfortable at any time.

      The actual surgery the women have will not be any different had they not been in the study.
      All the women in the study will have the normal assessment prior to their operation, and will
      fill out some questionnaires about their symptoms too. All women involved in the study will
      come back the clinic to be seen after six months, one year and two years from the date of the
      surgery. This is regardless of whether they had the SPOP or not. When the women return they
      will be examined and complete the questionnaires again each visit.

      The results of the study will be reported and published.
