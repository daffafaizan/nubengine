      bowel resection and anastomosis could delay the disease recurrence remains unkown. In this
      studyï¼Œ CD patients after surgery will be divided into two groups: one group is treated with 3
      months' EEN and then turn to normal diet after 3 months; the other group is given with normal
      diet all through. All patients will be adminstrated with oral azathioprine after surgery.
      Then, the rates of 1 year postoperative endoscopic recurrence will be compared between
      groups.
