      patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Treatment cycle (14 days) will consist of
      cirmtuzumab administered intravenously on a bi-weekly (every two weeks) schedule for a total
      of 4 doses. Eight dose cohorts (of 3 to 6 patients in size) plus an expansion cohort of 6
      patients are planned. In the first 4 dose cohorts, there is intra-patient dose escalation to
      monitor for acute toxicities, such as tumor lysis syndrome.

      A cycle may be repeated every 14 days if the patient has at least stable disease by clinical
      examination (or interim response assessment) and has again met hematologic, renal, and
      hepatic laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section, and is without ongoing
      Grade 3 non-hematologic or Grade 4 hematologic toxicities attributable to cirmtuzumab. The
      total duration of study drug administration is 4 cycles. Each cycle consists of clinical and
      laboratory evaluation on Day 1 and safety assessments on Days 3 and 8.
