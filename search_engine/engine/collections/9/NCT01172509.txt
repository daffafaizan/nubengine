      of placebo x 2 (0 mg), 3, 10, and 25 mg of R-baclofen followed by plasma levels at 0, 30, 60,
      90, and 140 minutes after each dose; and TMS testing at 0, 30, 60, 90 (cTBS application at 90
      minute time point), 95, and then periodically every 5-10 minutes until the MEPs return to
      baseline. There will be a total of 7 visits. Patients will come in for a screening visit,
      then scheduled to return for 1 baseline visit (cTBS without drug) and 5 crossover visits. At
      each crossover visit a venous line will be placed for blood sampling and a single dose of
      study drug at one of the five dose levels will be given orally at time 0. There will be a
      one-week washout between each of the crossover arms (R-baclofen has a mean Tmax of
      approximately 80 minutes and a terminal half life of 4.9 hour).
