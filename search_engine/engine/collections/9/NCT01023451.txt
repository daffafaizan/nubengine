      patients with sickle cell disease. Doppler echocardiography is a recommended noninvasive
      screening tool for sickle cell disease patients with pulmonary hypertension. Brain
      natriuretic peptide levels have been found to be a possible serum screening marker. This
      research will offer the opportunity to determine if there is any possible relationship
      between magnitude of BNP concentration and degree of TRV, if it can be used as a screening
      test in SCD pediatric patients with PHT and form the basis for a future multicenter study
