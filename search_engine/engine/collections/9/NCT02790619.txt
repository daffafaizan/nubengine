      not get quick results and find it frustrating. Thus, the number of people benefiting from
      meditation would increase if there were a method of making it easier to perform. Moreover,
      establishing the actual brain mechanisms involved in the benefits of meditation would
      potentially open up synergistic treatments and approaches.

      The investigators will investigate the use of a new, non-invasive brain stimulation method
      called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to augment a state of mindfulness. tDCS
      is a safe, inexpensive, non-invasive brain stimulation modality that has the capability of
      focally increasing or decreasing cortical activity. Anodal stimulation produces positive DC
      stimulation and is associated with increased cortical activity, whereas Cathodal stimulation
      produces a negative DC stimulation and is associated with decreased cortical activity.
      Cortical activity changes occur both during and after stimulation in a dose response fashion
      (higher current density and longer duration of stimulation produces larger and longer lasting
      effects).

      The investigators will be investigating the use of tDCS to augment mindfulness meditation in
      a double-blind, crossover, randomized, sham-controlled trial.
