    
      This is phase 1 trial of LTLD with MR-HIFU induced heating in children and young adults with
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors.

      Part A of the trial will be a traditional dose escalation study to determine the pediatric
      MTD/RP2D of LTLD combined with MR-HIFU ablation which allows for release of doxorubicin in
      the ablation zone and peri-ablation margins.

      Part B of the trial will combine LTLD at the MTD/RP2D with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia
      (MHT) in an expanded cohort.
