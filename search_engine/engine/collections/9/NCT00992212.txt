      Total duration of the study is eight weeks, which include two weeks for enrolment and 6 weeks
      for study participation. Vaccinations were to be administered on day 1 and day 22. Blood
      samples were collected at day 1 (baseline, before the first vaccination), at day 22 (before
      the second vaccination), at day 29 (one week after the second vaccination) and at day 43
      (three weeks after the second vaccination). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination Inhibition
      (HI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays. Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the first
      and second vaccination.
