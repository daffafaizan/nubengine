      resolution of a previous UTI.Recurrent UTI (rUTI) is defined as 3 or more microbiologically
      confirmed UTI within 12 months. rUTI is an economic problem for healthcare services. rUTI is
      also detrimental to the quality of life (QoL) of women who suffer the disease. 61% of women
      who suffer rUTI report symptoms of depression and an associated decrease in their reported
      QoL scores. QoL was found to improve significantly with successful treatment.

      E-coli is the most common bacteria causing UTI and 10% are thought to be antibiotic
      resistant. Consequently, new treatment strategies are required.

      The Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) layer is thought to be instrumental as a defence mechanism
      against uro-pathogens.

      GAG's are polysaccharides forming a gel like substance on the apical surface of the bladder
      wall and act as a barrier to uro-pathogens. There is now strong evidence that a reduction in
      the impermeability of the GAG layer is linked to rUTI. Urethral dilatation is an alternative
      treatment to GAG replacement in the management of rUTI. It is a treatment option more widely
      adopted by Urologists, although there is a paucity of data to support its use.

      Currently there is no standardised strategy for the management of women with rUTI. Treatments
      vary between GAG layer replacement (intravessical therapy with hyaluronic acid and
      chondroitin sulphate) or a cystoscopy and urethral dilatation. Evidence for each regime
      varies greatly and is of poor quality. This is a randomised study comparing GAG layer
      replacement with cystoscopy and urethral dilatation.
