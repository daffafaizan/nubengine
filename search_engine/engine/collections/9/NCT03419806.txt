    
      IPO-001 is a prospective, randomized, 3-period cross-over, open-label multicentre trial
      comparing intravenous and subcutaneous Infudopa with intestinal Duodopa. The patients will be
      identified and recruited at neurology clinics at university hospital clinical sites in
      Sweden, and travel from their living location to a clinical phase I site with full Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) standard at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg for the
      three treatment visits.

      At the phase I study clinic, patients will receive Duodopa at optimal dosage for 16 hours at
      one of the treatment visits, i.v. Infudopa at a concentration estimated to yield
      corresponding serum levels of levodopa for the same duration at another treatment visit, and
      they will again receive the corresponding amount of levodopa but in the form of s.c. Infudopa
      at a third visit. The study will hence have a cross-over design with a minimum of three days
      on Duodopa between the different treatment visits, where the order of treatments will be
      non-blinded but randomized.

      Blood samples will be drawn according to a set schedule during the treatment visits, and
      subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study, with focus on the local
      tolerability at the injection sites of i.v. and s.c. administration.
