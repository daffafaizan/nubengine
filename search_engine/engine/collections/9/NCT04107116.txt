      hematologic malignancies were enrolled in the intervention. Outcomes were compared outcomes
      to patients in the year prior (control arm). The primary outcome was change in symptoms using
      the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at
      baseline, 6- and 12-months post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes were between-group comparison
      of survival, 12-month healthcare use and costs.
