      dosing regimen: 6 mmol twice daily for 1 week followed by dose escalation to 6 mmol thrice
      daily for 1 week). Although a primary goal of the study was to assess the safety of KNO3 and
      within-group changes in various end points in KNO3-treated subjects, a small number of
      placebo-treated (PB, n=3) subjects were included only to assess for any potential training
      effect on repeated exercise and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) measurements.
      Potassium chloride, given in equivalent doses, was used as the PB to account for differences
      in blood pressure or flow that could be attributed to potassium.

      The study was initially designed to be single-blinded to allow the principal investigator to
      be aware of arm allocation because of potential concerns for methemoglobinemia with drug
      administration. One investigator, who was the primary investigator responsible for
      supervising all visits and measurements during the study, remained blinded to treatment
      allocation throughout the entirety of the study. All physiological and imaging data were
      analyzed in a double-blind manner.
