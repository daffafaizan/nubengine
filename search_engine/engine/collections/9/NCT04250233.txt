      respiratory rate continuously, as opposed to the intermittent nursing RR counts once per
      hour. Using this device, we may capture changes in respiratory rate that are not noticed by
      the nurse during the once per hour count. The device counts respiration (respiratory rate)
      using a sticker placed by on the neck to detect vibrations made by respiration. This
      overcomes the specific limitation of capnography that requires wearing the nasal cannula.

      Prospective, observational study with IRB approval. Women who undergo elective cesarean
      delivery under neuraxial block receive neuraxial opioids for postoperative analgesia.

      Potential study recruits will be approached prior to the cesarean delivery anesthesia
      assessment. Suitable women will be informed that neuraxial morphine is the gold-standard
      analgesia, however many women suffer nausea, vomiting and pruritus (itching) and may prefer
      an alternative analgesic or a lower dose of morphine. All women will receive intrathecal
      fentanyl as an adjuvant to the bupivacaine anesthesia. This fentanyl may also cause pruritus
      however this is limited to the 2-hour duration of the effect of the fentanyl.

      Women will be offered standard neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery (heavy bupivacaine
      10 mg; fentanyl 20 mic; and low dose intrathecal morphine mic). Alternatively, women will be
      offered an alternative anesthesia option: 1) heavy bupivacaine 10 mg; fentanyl 20 mic with an
      ultra-low dose, 50 mic of morphine, or 2) heavy bupivacaine 10 mg; fentanyl 20 mic without
      intrathecal morphine + postoperative bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB) or erector
      spinus block (ESP). The choice of block will depend on the patient and anesthesiologist's
      decision.
