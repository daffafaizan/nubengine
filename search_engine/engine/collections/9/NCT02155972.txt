      disorder; new treatments are needed to help control this illness. Studies indicate that
      probiotics in the stomach improves mood and reduces anxiety symptoms lending further support
      to the notion that probiotic bacteria positively influence emotional states. We propose to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of mood stabilizer and Align, a probiotic as
      compared to mood stabilizer monotherapy.

      The primary goal of this feasibility study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      Align as an add on to accepted monotherapy treatment in BD. Secondary Objective:1)To evaluate
      the effectiveness of the combination of mood stabilizer + Align compared to mood stabilizer
      monotherapy in treatment of BD. 2) to determine if Align +mood stabilizer combination will
      reduce anxiety symptoms.

      An 8-week randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept study assessing the
      combination a mood stabilizer + Align in the treatment of patients with an bipolar depressive
      episode. The study has two treatment arms: mood stabilizer + placebo and mood stabilizer +
      Align. Participants will be assessed & administered study scales at screening, baseline &
      weeks 2,4,6 and 8. the dose for mood stabilizer will be in accordance with clinical practice
      guidelines and Align - 1 capsule/day.
