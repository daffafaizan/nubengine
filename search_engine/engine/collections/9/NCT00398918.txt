      tiagabine did not decrease ethanol consumption in rodents (Schmitt et al., 2002; Rimondini et
      al., 2002). In a study with alcohol preferring mice topiramate reduced alcohol consumption in
      a two bottle choice prolonged access model of drinking (Gabriel and Cunningham, 2005). In a
      study done at our laboratory both topiramate and zonisamide were found to have similar
      effects on reducing the consumption of ethanol in Wistar rat (Knapp et al., 2004). More
      recently we found that zonisamide administration decreased alcohol consumption in a limited
      access model in the C57BL/B6 mouse. These results suggest that zonisamide might be useful as
      a medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

      Topiramate and zonisamide have some structural similarities with a sulfamate or
      methane-sulfonamide containing chain respectively attached to cyclic structure. These
      structural similarities may explain some of their pharmacological similarities including
      blockade of voltage sensitive sodium channels and low potency inhibition of carbonic
      anhydrase (Taverna et al., 1999; Dodgson et al., 2000; Schaf et al., 1987; Masudaet al.,
      1993). Both topiramate and zonisamide promote weight loss (McElroy et al., 2003; McElroy et
      al., 2004; Gadde et al., 2003). This effect may be a result of neuromodulation of the
      regulation of alcohol and food shared by these drugs.
