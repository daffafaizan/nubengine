      overweight or obese subjects. Walking is a solution to overcome physical inactivity, due to
      its low impact in which the person can control the intensity, duration and effort in order to
      reduce the risk of injury.

      Monitoring the AF through the number of steps / day offers the possibility of standardizing
      the evaluation and monitoring. Although the goal of 10,000 steps a day may not be appropriate
      at various levels of age and physical condition, it is considered a reasonable and motivating
      goal for healthy adults and previous studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in weight
      loss programs.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of the implementation of a monitoring
      system, goal to achieve, on physical activity in overweight and obese adults. Both groups,
      control and intervention, have a prescription of 10,000 steps a day to reach, but only the
      intervention group will have a control system, messages of encouragement and follow-up.

      Participants (n=120) will be recruited through outpatient from private clinics in Cádiz,
      Andalucía, Spain, as well as through community presentations. Overweight or obese and
      sedentary adult will be randomly assigned into two groups.

      For 6 months, all of the adults shall follow the same diet with an identical distribution of
      macronutrients. There will be a weekly check up of weight, fat, body water and muscle mass
      for all of them. The status of the number of steps in Accupedo is also checked every week
