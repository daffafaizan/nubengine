      testing and tracking of preventive dental office visits. Eight hundred (800) total
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the Usual Care or Experimental Groups. Two
      hundred participants will be assigned to the Usual Care Group and 600 will be assigned to the
      Experimental Group. It is anticipated that approximately 17% (~100) of the Experimental Group
      subjects will refuse to enroll in the study, leaving a final total of approximately 500
      subject in this group. Within the Experimental Group, 125 subjects positive for the IL-1
      genetic test (PerioPredictÂ® Genetic Risk Test, Interleukin Genetics, Inc., Waltham, MA) will
      be identified and ~375 will test negative for the IL-1 genetic test.

      The Sponsor will enter the subject's dental office registration number into a master
      spreadsheet and randomly assign every fourth patient to the Usual Care Group and all others
      will be assigned into the Experimental Group. Information about the study and informed
      consent will be made available by the dental office for the specific groups, either by
      directing to a website location with videos and ICFs, or alternatively by by dental office
      showing informational videos on provided tablet and gathering signed hardcopy ICFs at
      schedule first visit.
