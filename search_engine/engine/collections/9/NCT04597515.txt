      with this surgery remains the ransom scar, wide at the periareolar level, vertical at the
      subareolar level and in the submammary groove. In addition, this intervention remains subject
      to the vagaries of hypertrophic or even keloid scarring, especially in young women.

      The current research project is based on the hypothesis that the same technique could be used
      in the context of a reduction of breast enlargement on a smaller surface allowing the
      determination of a perimammary "halo" of scar retraction. The project consists in removing a
      breast disc at the base, thus causing a sagging skin cut of 2 to 3 cm but this time,
      circular.

      The expected result is to achieve a reduction in breast enlargement with no visible scar,
      using Da Vinci Xi robot.
