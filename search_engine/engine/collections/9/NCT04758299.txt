      SARS-CoV-2 home test kit results and whether they report plans to take CDC [Centers for
      Disease Control]-recommended actions to protect themselves and others given their test
      results and two critical aspects of their clinical context: symptoms, recent close exposures.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either information from the FDA authorized Ellume
      home test kit (the first kit authorized for over the counter use) for what actions to take
      for a negative or positive COVID-19 test (usual care) or a decision science-based design of
      similar length (intervention).

      Participants will be randomized to receive either information from the FDA authorized Ellume
      home test kit for what actions to take for a negative or positive COVID-19 test (usual care)
      or a decision science-based design of similar length (intervention). They will be given time
      to read the documents and the opportunity to download a full "instructions for use" document
      (the FDA authorized for the ELLUME test kit). They will then be randomized to one of four
      conditions, asking them to imagine a clinical context: a person with no symptoms and no close
      COVID-19 contact, no symptoms and close contact,
