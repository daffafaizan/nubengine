      that performing a high transverse skin incision on obese patients leads to better
      visualization and less wound infection but there are few studies comparing it directly to low
      transverse skin incision.

      Retrospective chart review of obese patient's who have had a cesarean section at St Mary's
      hospital by either a low or high transverse skin incision between January 1, 2009 - July 31,
      2014. We will review charts up to 6 week postpartum.

      Pregnancies will be identified through identifing those who have cesarean sections. They will
      be narrowed down by those who have BMI of > 30. Maternal prenatal records, postnatal records
      and delivery records will be reviewed.
