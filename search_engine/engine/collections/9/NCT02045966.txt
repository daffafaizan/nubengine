      Primary purpose: Other: study is being conducted to investigate the potential drug-drug
      interactions (DDIs) when the Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 FDC formulation is
      coadministered with a cocktail of cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates (Caffeine,
      Metoprolol, Montelukast, Flurbiprofen, Omeprazole, and Midazolam) and transporter probe
      substrates (Digoxin and Pravastatin) in healthy subjects. It is also intended to characterize
      the PK of Daclatasvir (DCV), Asunaprevir (ASV), BMS-791325, and its major metabolite,
      BMS-794712, at steady state.
