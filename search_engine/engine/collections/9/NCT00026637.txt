    
      This randomized clinical trial will be conducted to compare the drug sertraline to cognitive
      behavioral therapy on symptoms of depression, antiepileptic medication compliance, seizure
      frequency, and quality of life outcomes in persons with depression and a seizure disorder or
      epilepsy. Approximately 140 persons will be enrolled in this study over a period of five
      years. Individual participation will last approximately 16 weeks. Study participants will be
      chosen randomly to receive either the study medication (sertraline) or cognitive behavior
      therapy for 16 weeks. Sertraline is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
      Subjects who receive cognitive behavior therapy will be provided with a one-hour individual
      session with a licensed clinical psychologist each week for 15 weeks. All study participants
      will attend scheduled clinic visits every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.
