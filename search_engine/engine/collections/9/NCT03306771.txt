      and carotid artery stenosis. The investigators hypothesize that metabolic/Bariatric surgery
      improves the stenosis in the carotid artery.

      This is a prospective comparative study on the candidates for metabolic/Bariatric surgery in
      the bariatric center, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel. The investigators will compare the
      candidate for metabolic surgery with metabolic syndrome risk factors to the ones without
      metabolic syndrome risk factors.

      The assessment of the carotid artery will be done by Ultrasound Doppler before surgery and 6,
      12 and 24 month post surgery.
