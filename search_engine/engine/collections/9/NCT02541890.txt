      of the sick-listed persons, the companies they work for, and society as a whole. Hence, the
      need for documented effective vocational rehabilitation programs is pressing. Vocational
      rehabilitation services described in the scientific literature have been specific to one
      single or a specific group of medical conditions (e.g.low back pain). In contrast, most
      people on sick leave have several health complaints, and many of the factors influencing sick
      leave are shared regardless of disorder (e.g. social surroundings, workplace environment),
      calling for rehabilitation programs that can be employed for both musculoskeletal, unspecific
      and common mental disorders. Research indicates that interventions on the work place might
      facilitate return to work. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the effect of a
      work place intervention during a multicomponent return-to-work rehabilitation program on
      return-to-work.
