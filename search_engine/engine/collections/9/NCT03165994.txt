      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of combining APX005M with standard-of-care
      chemoradiation (external beam radiation in daily fractions, with concurrent weekly low-dose
      carboplatin/paclitaxel) in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable esophageal
      and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of this novel combination, as measured by the pathologic complete
      response (pCR) rate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive APX005M intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes during weeks 1, 4, and 7,
      radiation therapy once daily (QD) for 5 days per week during weeks 3-8, and paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes once weekly (days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29)
      during weeks 3-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo surgery 4 - 10 weeks after last dose of APX005M.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
