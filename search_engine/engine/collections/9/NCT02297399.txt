    
      Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing an ambulatory colonoscopy at the participating sites
      will be randomized to 2 different methods of colon cleansing before the procedure.

      Both will be based on the oral ingestion of a fluid solution (half of it on the evening
      before the procedure is planned and the rest on the morning of the same day), and the main
      difference between them will be the volume of fluid that will be ingested in each case.

      Analogic visual scales and standardized questionnaires on various aspects that may influence
      the degree of satisfaction about the preparation will be answered by the participants and
      collected before the colonoscopy. The endoscopist, blinded to the preparation method, will
      grade the adequacy of the preparation. Adverse events will be recorded up to 1 month after
      the procedure
