      there is a correlation between impaired telomere homeostasis, senescence genomic instability
      and intra-uterine programming in placentas and in fetuses exposed to suboptimal intrauterine
      conditions such as hypoxia or hyperglycemia. Improved understanding of the mechanisms that
      produce the genomic changes in IUGR placentas and their influence on later risks of
      developing the metabolic syndrome should provide basis for future research that might lead
      into improved outcome of IUGR fetuses.
