      demographic/pharmacogenetic as compared to usual warfarin dosing algorithm in predicting
      warfarin maintenance dose. In patients with atrial fibrillation starting anticoagulation, the
      loading dose of warfarin in the tested group is calculated on the basis of VKORC1 genotype
      and patient's body weight.The second day warfarin maintenance dose is calculated on the basis
      of surface area and CYP2C9, CYP4F2 e VKORC1 genotype. In the usual care group the maintenance
      dose at day 5 is calculated on the basis of a published algorithm (Pengo V, Am J Cardiol
      2001). INR is checked on day 0, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15 and 19. Primary end-point of the trial is the
      number of INR outside the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. Secondary end-points are the
      number of changes in dose prescription, the difference between predicted and actual warfarin
      maintenance dose and thrombotic and bleeding events.
