      throughout of the world. The disease is characterized by the predominant deposition of
      polymer Gal-deﬁcient IgA1 immune complex（pGd-IgA1-IC）in the glomeruli which leads to the
      proliferation of mesangial cells. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to be useful in the
      treatment of IgAN in Chinese patients, but the price is expensive together with some adverse
      events. Tripterygium Wilfordii HOOK. f. is a traditional chinese medicine and is useful in
      the treatment of CKD, the purpose of this study is to determine whether Multi-glycoside of
      Tripterygium Wilfordii HOOK. f. is effective and safe in the treatment of IgA nephropathy
