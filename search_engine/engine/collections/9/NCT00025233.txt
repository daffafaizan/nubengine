      I. Determine the cytostatic antitumor activity of bevacizumab, in terms of 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with persistent or recurrent squamous cell
      carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Estimate
      the distribution of PFS and overall survival for patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the frequency of clinical response (partial and complete) in patients treated
      with this drug.

      V. Determine the role of age and initial performance status as prognostic factors in patients
      treated with this drug.

      VI. Determine whether biological and imaging markers are associated with clinical efficacy of
      this drug, such as 6-month PFS, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-38
      months.
