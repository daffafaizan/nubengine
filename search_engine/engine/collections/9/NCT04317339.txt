      by diastolic dysfunction.The incidence of HFpEF is increasing in recent years. Standard
      treatment of heart failure does not improve the prognosis of HFPEF patients. Zhigancao Tang
      was used to improve the symptoms of chronic heart failure in China.This
      randomized,double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial will objectively and standardly
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zhigancao Tang granule.After 12 weeks of treatment,
      122 HFpEF patients with deficiency of Qi and Yin were observed and evaluated in terms of
      heart function, clinical symptoms,exercise tolerance and quality of life.
