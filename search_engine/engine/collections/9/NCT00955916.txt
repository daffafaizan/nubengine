      cells are increased, blocking normal blood cell production), different types of chemotherapy
      are used for treatment. Patients responded to all the chemotherapies in similar ways, but
      most of the responses did not last long if further stem cell transplantation was not done.
      Gleevec is believed to work by interfering with the abnormal protein by blocking it from
      telling the body to keep making more white blood cells that are abnormal.

      The CLAG regimen is the standard chemotherapy used for relapsed AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).
      This study will add Gleevec® to the regimen for a period of 14 days. Gleevec® is approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
      and some types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its use in combination with CLAG
      regimen is considered experimental for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia/CML blast
      crisis.
