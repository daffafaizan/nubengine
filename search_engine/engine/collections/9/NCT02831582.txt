      I. To determine the efficacy of the complementary therapy omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 PUFA)
      supplementation in preventing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias (AIIAs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively define the population most at risk for developing AIIAs by the
      identification and validation of genetic risk predictors and to develop a single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)/gene profile predictive of treatment intervention response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      Group I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) once daily (QD) for
      6 months.

      Group II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed up periodically.
