      emerging evidence that choral singing benefits people with PD across a range of modalities.
      Despite the increasing popularity of "Parkinson's choirs", rigorous study of these benefits
      is lacking. There is a large body of evidence that intense vocal training improves speech and
      communication for people with PD. However, the intense training places high demands on
      clinical and patient resources and, due to its individualized approach, lacks the potential
      psycho-social benefits of a group intervention.

      It is hypothesized singing training program will increase vocal loudness, range of
      articulation, and prosodic variation during speech. Additionally, given existing evidence for
      neuroplastic transference of voice-related interventions to swallowing function, laryngeal
      components of swallowing function will also improve post-intervention. Finally, investigators
      expect to see improvements in patient-reported QOL measures corresponding with improved
      speech and laryngeal function and/or as the result of group interaction.

      All participants will complete a standardized battery of assessment pre- and post- treatment
      including acoustic and aerodynamic assessment of voice, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of
      speech and swallowing, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing. The outcome of this
      work will be a rigorous understanding of how choral singing therapy can positively impact the
      voice, swallowing function, and quality of life for patients with PD.
