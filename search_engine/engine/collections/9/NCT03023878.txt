    
      The safety profile of blinatumomab after frontline rituximab (R)-chemotherapy, consisting of
      either R-CHOP (14 or 21) (rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) or
      R-DA-EPOCH (rituximab and dose adjusted-etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
      and doxorubicin), or R-CHOEP (rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
      prednisone, and etoposide), will be determined. The study will consist of a screening period
      of up to 14 days, a standard of care (SOC) R-chemotherapy run-in period of approximately 21
      weeks, a 12 to 16 week blinatumomab treatment period, a 30-day safety follow-up visit, and a
      long-term follow-up period that begins after the safety follow-up visit is completed until 1
      year from the first dose blinatumomab.
