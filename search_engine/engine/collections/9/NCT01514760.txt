      self-management recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program asthma
      guidelines; guidelines-based asthma care has not yet fully translated to the community
      despite the fact that National Asthma Education and Prevention Program released the first set
      of national guidelines nearly 2 decades ago. Previous reports have proven that patients with
      an Asthma Action Plan have better outcomes including fewer acute healthcare utilization
      visits, fewer days missed from school, and improved symptoms scores compared to patients
      without an Asthma Action Plan. Recently, mobile-based phone applications and music file (MPEG
      layer 3)(MP3) players have been utilized in the management of chronic diseases such as asthma
      and diabetes to provide medication reminders and to provide alternatives to paper dairies for
      logging symptoms or other health-related data such as peak flow readings or blood glucose
      readings. We propose to design an application that will fully meet the recommended
      individualized Asthma Action Plan treatment plan as recommended by national guidelines and
      will also provide participants with medication reminders, education tips, and data
      logging/tracking capabilities.
