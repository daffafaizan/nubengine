      the key therapy tools for MTD is laryngeal extrinsic muscle massage along with voice and
      respiratory exercises. Access to these specialized services is difficult due to limited
      expertise and travel distance. The goal of this study is to demonstrate a reduction in
      symptoms and improvement in vocal function by applying an external vibration device to key
      sites (e.g. jaw, neck, skull base) commonly identified as a source of abnormal muscle tension
      and injury in certain voice disorders, specifically MTD. If the study shows a demonstrable
      benefit, patients would be trained to self administer the treatment along with a home program
      of therapy exercises. This novel therapy would improve delivery of care and allow speech
      therapy services to be more widely accessible with reduced number of therapy sessions
      required. The potential long term effects would be to decrease wait times to access these
      specialized services and lessen the need for return visits due to symptom recurrence.

      The second part of this study is to investigate the effect of external vibration on the voice
      quality in CTSs. Certain desirable acoustic qualities in a singers' voice are only accessible
      when the larynx and its extrinsic muscles are in a relaxed state. Muscle misuse and vocal
      strain are common problems in performers, which can result in conditions that require surgery
      and speech therapy, and may lead to a loss of income. Similar to vocal warm up exercises
      which contribute to the prevention of vocal injury, external vibration is expected to improve
      muscle perfusion in an acute setting and may have a direct effect on vocal fold cover
      viscosity.
