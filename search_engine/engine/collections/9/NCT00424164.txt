      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib ditosylate and tamoxifen citrate in patients
           with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any relationship between drug exposure and adverse events or biological
           modifications of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate on days 1-28 of course 1. In all
           subsequent courses, patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate and oral lapatinib
           ditosylate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate on days 1-14 of course 1. In all
           subsequent courses, patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate and oral tamoxifen
           citrate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both treatment arms, blood is collected periodically during courses 1 and 2 for
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
