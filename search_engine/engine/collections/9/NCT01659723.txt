      improvement of the technique, with improved efficacy and tolerance, adverse effects are still
      rather common. The urinary bladder and rectum are the major organs most commonly affected by
      radiotherapy to the pelvis area.

      One of the most significant causes of the symptoms of radio therapy is inflammation and
      degeneration of blood vessels in the radiated tissue. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves
      administration of oxygen at greater than normal atmospheric pressures. A well-documented
      effect of HBOT is the stimulation of angiogenesis. HBOT is an established treatment for
      degeneration of blood vessels in the jaw bone as a result of radiotherapy and several
      publications have shown good efficacy also when soft tissue is affected.

      If the method of treatment with HBOT means a reduction of the radiotherapy side effect it is
      thus an obvious importance for the individual patient. There is also significant potential
      savings for the healthcare and society.
