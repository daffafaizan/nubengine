      * Maintain and expand a database of cytogenetic information on leukemia patients.

      Other objectives as funding permits:

        -  Determine the frequency and prognostic significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in bone
           marrow or peripheral blood cells in patients with leukemia prior to treatment and at
           various times during treatment undergoing treatment on a companion clinical trial.

        -  Correlate the presence of cytogenetic features with clinical, pathophysiological,
           cellular, and molecular characteristics in these patients.

        -  Provide quality control for all Southwest Oncology Group cytogenetic data.

      OUTLINE: Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples from patients on specific treatment
      protocols for leukemia are analyzed for cytogenetic abnormalities. Samples from patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are analyzed for trisomy 12 by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization and conventional cytogenetics.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,500 patients (1,200 with first-line acute myeloid leukemia
      [AML], 500 with first-line acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 200 with relapsed AML, 125
      with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], 100 with accelerated phase or blastic
      phase CML, 250 with hairy cell leukemia, and 125 with relapsed ALL or CLL) will be accrued
      for this study within 5 years.
