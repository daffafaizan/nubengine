      I. Assess both individual and environmental factors that guide decisions and behaviors to
      engage or not engage in colonoscopy screenings for African Americans in the two communities.

      II. Using a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach, develop and pilot a
      peer-led, narrative-based colorectal cancer behavioral intervention for increasing
      colonoscopy screening behaviors in African Americans.

      III. Examine the efficacy of a narrative communication-style group intervention compared to a
      didactic intervention to influence African Americans' engagement in colorectal cancer
      screening, including examining the degree to which the community interventions impact
      cognitive and affective decision making factors about health care seeking.

      IV. Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change
      to better understand colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and health care seeking behaviors.

      OUTLINE: Program locations are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants view videos with information about CRC and screening delivered by
      personal narrative.

      ARM II: Participants view videos with information about CRC and screening delivered by
      informative fact-based message.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
