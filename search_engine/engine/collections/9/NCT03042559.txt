    
      The purpose of this graduate student research study was to compare the effect of ProtonicsTM
      knee brace vs. sports cord on knee pain and function in patients with PFPS.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial.

      Setting: Loma Linda University.

      Participants: Subjects with patellofemoral pain will participate in the study.

      Intervention: Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, the ProtonicsTM
      knee brace or the sport cord to complete a series of resistance exercises over the course of
      4 weeks.

      Main Outcome Measures: Both groups will be evaluated according to the following clinical
      outcomes: Anterior pelvic tilt (APT), hip internal/external rotation, and iliotibial band
      flexibility. The following functional outcomes were also assessed: Global Rating of Change
      (GROC) scale, the Kujala score, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and the lateral step-down
      test.
