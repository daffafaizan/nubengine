    
      Safety and Efficacy will be demonstrated by the rate of Target vessel failure (TVF), defined
      as cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) [Q wave or non-Q wave], or
      clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR) by percutaneous or surgical methods
      within 270 days of the post-stent placement procedure.

      Additionally, Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)at 30, 180 and 270 days defined as a
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI) (Q wave and non-Q wave), emergent
      bypass surgery, or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) [percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)]will be documented.
