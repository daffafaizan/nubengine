    
      The primary objectives of this pilot study in 30 patients are:

        1. To determine the effect of rifampin-containing tuberculostatic treatment on the
           pharmacokinetic profile of emtricitabine+tenofovir+efavirenz, when co-formulated in one
           tablet, in HIV-infected patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Tanzania.

        2. To determine the effect of the emtricitabine+tenofovir+efavirenz regimen on the
           pharmacokinetics of tuberculostatics in the same population.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To determine the safety of co-administration of emtricitabine+tenofovir+efavirenz with
           treatment for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis.

        2. To determine the short-term (24 weeks) virological efficacy on HIV of an
           emtricitabine+tenofovir+efavirenz regimen in patients with smear-positive pulmonary
           tuberculosis.

        3. To determine the short-term bacteriological efficacy on smear-positive tuberculosis of
           the co-administration of a standard regimen for tuberculosis and an
           emtricitabine+tenofovir+efavirenz regimen.
