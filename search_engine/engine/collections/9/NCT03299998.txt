      enrolled. Patients were separated into 2 groups: patients receiving maxillary-mandibulary
      nerve block and those no receiving it. The primary endpoint was the morphine consumption
      within 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary endpoints were the intra-operative remifentanil
      consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting at 24 hours, morphine consumption
      in recovery room, length of stay in hospital.
