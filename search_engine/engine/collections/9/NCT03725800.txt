    
      This is a multicenter prospective observational study that will collect data on >1000 alive
      patients who have undergone PCI between 1 and 1.5 years prior at 9 hospitals from October
      2018. Adult patients (aged â‰¥18 years) undergoing PCI and prescribed mono-antiplatelet agents
      (such as aspirin, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate-heavy magnesium carbonate-aspirin, and
      clopidogrel) are eligible for enrollment. In phase 1, patients will be investigated in a
      cross-sectional manner for the withdrawal rate of dual antiplatelet agents within 1 year
      after stent implantation. In phase 2, patients will be followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months for
      AI-GIS and other outcomes. The primary endpoint is AI-GIS (according to the Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Rating Scale score) or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes will include
      bleeding, antiplatelet replacement/discontinuation, health economic cost, utilization ratio
      of gastrointestinal-protective drugs, and MACE.
