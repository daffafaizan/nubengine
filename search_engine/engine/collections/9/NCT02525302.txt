    
      As a follow-on study to the initial clinical studies of HT-100 in DMD (Protocols HALO-DMD-01
      and HALO-DMD-02), this open-label study is designed to provide data on continuous long-term
      dosing. Subjects will be entered into the study without cessation of dosing, in a staggered
      fashion, into the same cohort assignment they had in the predecessor studies. Up to 30
      subjects who have completed dosing in HALO-DMD-02 will be offered the opportunity to continue
      on the same dose regimen until market approval of HT-100 or termination of the study by the
      Sponsor. Reasons for termination could include, among others, safety concerns or lack of
      efficacy, based on analysis of combined data from all HT-100 studies. Safety data from
      subjects approaching the end the HALO-DMD-02 participation will be individually reviewed by
      the Medical Monitor and the subject's physician (Principal Investigator [PI]). If the Medical
      Monitor and the PI agree there are no clinically significant safety signals (absence of
      clinically significant laboratory or clinical abnormalities to date), the subject will be
      considered eligible and offered continuation of dosing. To avoid an interruption in dosing,
      subjects will immediately be screened for participation and enrolled upon completing the
      predecessor trial, HALO-DMD-02. Participation is in this study HALO-DMD-03 is optional.
      Safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) monitoring will continue throughout the subject's study
      participation. Dose reduction/modification might occur or individual subjects' participation
      in the trial may be discontinued if any Adverse Events (AEs) suggest that HT-100 is not
      sufficiently well tolerated.
