      United States, with over 530,000 procedures performed annually1. Pain control after T&A is
      essential for improving recovery and enhancing quality of life. At CCHMC, our current
      protocol in patients over the age of three is to treat pain with scheduled Tylenol, ibuprofen
      and steroids, as well as opioids (oxycodone) as a "rescue" medication for uncontrolled pain.
      Despite this regimented approach, pain control is often suboptimal, and numerous doses of
      opioids are often required. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist that
      may have a role in decreasing post T&A pain2. The primary objective of the present study is
      to evaluate the effect of montelukast on post-T&A pain by measuring the amount of opioid pain
      medication required postoperatively in patients receiving montelukast preoperatively compared
      to those receiving placebo. The secondary objective will evaluate post-surgical outcomes and
      include group comparisons of post T&A pain scores and number of Emergency department visits
      and/or phone calls for perioperative pain related complaints.

      Hypothesis #1 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the amount of opioid pain mediation
      required in the first 24 hours postoperatively compared to those in the control group.

      Hypothesis #2 Preoperative montelukast will decrease pain scores in the first 24 hours after
      surgery in patients undergoing T&A compared to those in the control group.

      Hypothesis#3 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the number of postoperative contacts
      (Emergency department visits and phone calls) by parents for pain related concerns in the
      first 3-4 weeks after surgery.
