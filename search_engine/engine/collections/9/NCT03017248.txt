      often accomplished by parenteral opioids analgesics. However, the use of opioids alone for
      pain control is often associated with inadequate analgesia and increased adverse events.

      Low-dose ketamine has been shown to improve pain perception and produce an opioid-sparing
      effect when given perioperatively.

      Its use in the ED may probably play a role in maximizing analgesia.
