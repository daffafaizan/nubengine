      (atmospheres absolute) HBOT versus maintenance medication and counseling. One hundred adult
      subjects (50 at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans and 50 at
      Oklahoma State University School of Medicine) with mTBI/PPCS who have been symptomatic
      continuously for at least six months from one or more mild traumatic brain injuries will be
      enrolled and randomized to either 40 HBOTs or no treatment. After the 8-week treatment period
      the no treatment group will be crossed over to receive 40 HBOTs.
