    
      Objective: This study aims to identify whether repetitive dual-site transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) can modulate the functional connectivity between the parietal and
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortices.

      Study population: The study involves 26 healthy volunteers.

      Design: This controlled study comprises 3 main visits for each subject: (1) a baseline,
      evaluation visit during which fMRI will be acquired during a visual short memory task along
      with diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI; (2) a visit during which resting state fMRI
      (rsfMRI) will be acquired, followed by paired-associative stimulation (PAS) with pulses
      delivered over the parietal and then over the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, in order to
      induce a temporary plastic change in the interaction between the parietal and prefrontal
      cortices; the PAS will be followed by another rsfMRI and task fMRI; (3) a visit identical to
      #2 during which the PAS will be delivered with pulses in reverse order of previous visit.

      Outcome measures: The effects of PAS will be quantified with rsfMRI and a short working
      memory task, considered as a proxy for complex motor and cognitive control.

        -  The primary outcome will be to investigate the resting state functional connectivity
           changes induced by each PAS intervention

        -  The secondary outcome #1 will be to evaluate the difference in visual angle error
           between sessions 2 and 3 in a working memory task during which the subjects will be
           asked to remember the position of a bar presented on the screen at different time
           intervals before the inquiry.

        -  The secondary outcome #2 will be to build an fMRI-DTI analysis pipeline for generation
           of TMS targets individually customized for each subject and a given task.
