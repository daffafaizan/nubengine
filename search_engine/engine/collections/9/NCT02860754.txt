      clinics of the Royal-Victoria and Montreal General Hospitals of McGill University Health
      Centre. All patients with planned noncardiac surgery under general or regional anesthesia
      will be considered for inclusion.

      Eligible consenting patients will undergo the 6MWT during their preoperative clinical visit,
      typically occurring within a few weeks before surgery. This test will be performed by a
      trained health care worker. Patients will walk back and forth along a 20 m corridor, while
      attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes. Patients will be allowed to rest
      on the chairs while performing the test if necessary. Patients will be encouraged to resume
      walking as soon as patients feel physically able. The total covered distance in 6 minutes
      will be measured to the nearest meter.

      The RCRI score will be calculated for each study participant.
