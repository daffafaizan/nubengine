    
      Exp 1: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will consider whether differences in brain areas
      engaged during memory encoding contribute to age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory
      consolidation for a word-pair learning task.

      Exp 2: The investigators will examine the rate of memory decay between encoding and sleep
      using two probes of declarative memory (word-pair learning and visuo-spatial learning).

      Exp 3: The investigators will provide additional opportunity for encoding of the word-pair
      and visuo-spatial learning tasks.

      Exp 4: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will examine neural engagement during encoding
      and performance following intervals of sleep and wake.

      Exp 5: The investigators will examine the rate of decay of motor sequence learning.

      Exp 6: The investigators will examine whether enhanced training ('overtraining') improves
      sleep-dependent memory consolidation for older adults.
