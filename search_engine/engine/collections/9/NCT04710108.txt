      effects of different types of message modalities (video vs. comic book). The study was
      conducted online with Mexican American women aged 18-29 years old. Messages focused on sugary
      beverage consumption and the main outcomes are individual intention to adopt health behaviors
      which will be measured by the increased degree of individual knowledge, attitudes, subjective
      norms, self-efficacy, and intention to reduce SSB consumption, as well as social level
      behavior changes that will be measured by the improved magnitude of public health literacy,
      SSB media literacy, and empowerment. Secondary outcomes of interest include the evaluations
      on the dimension of message themselves include participants' direct reaction to messages and
      their perceived effectiveness of messages, which will be measured by transportation of
      messages, identification of characters, emotional response of scenes, perceived effectiveness
      of messages, engagement with messages, and willingness to disseminate messages.
