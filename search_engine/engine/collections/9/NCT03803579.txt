      international and no Profit. Anticoagulation clinics, affiliated or not to the Italian FCSA,
      will be asked to take an active part in the study, provided they have the facilities for
      blood sampling and processing.

      4000 consecutive NVAF outpatients, 1000 for each single drug, starting anticoagulation with
      one of the four DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) will be enrolled at the
      moment of the first prescription. Patients will receive the type and dosage of DOAC on the
      base of clinical characteristics at the discretion of the attending physician, as the normal
      clinical practice, and the study will not influence the decision of the type and dosage of
      DOAC.

      The primary study objective is to evaluate the possible relationship between DOAC
      anticoagulant levels at the trough, measured at steady state (within the first 2-4 weeks of
      treatment) and occurrence of bleeding and thromboembolic events during the subsequent one
      year follow up
