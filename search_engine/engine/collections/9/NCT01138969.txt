      prevention of ulcer recurrence for clopidogrel users. We plan to enroll 300 clopidogrel users
      without baseline gastroduodenal ulcer at initial endoscopy. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either (1) esomeprazole (20 mg qd) plus clopidogrel or (2) clopidogrel
      treatment alone for 6 months. The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment groups will be
      compared.
