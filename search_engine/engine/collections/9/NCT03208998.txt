      replication , but Peg-IFN-α also play an important role in immune regulation . In hepatitis B
      infection, NKs are the main effector cells in early antiviral innate immune
      response.Peg-IFN-α recommended as the first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve
      HBeAg seroconversion and even HBsAg disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which may
      be related to the functional activation of pDCs in the case of hepatitis and the function
      enhancement of NKs during Peg-IFN-α therapy. This study was aimed at investigating the
      changes of NKs frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during
      Peg-IFN-αand nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.Meanwhile, investigators want to explore whether
      the decline of HBsAg and HBeAg resulted in recovery of NKs function, or recovery of NKs
      function led to the decrease of HBsAg and HBeAg. Several studies demonstrated that HBsAg and
      HBeAg could damage NKs function, and the loss of HBsAg and HBeAg led to recovery of NKs
      function.
