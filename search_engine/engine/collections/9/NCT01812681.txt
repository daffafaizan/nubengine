      of newborn. Experimental and observational studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency may
      be associated with an increased risk for non-bone diseases and/or abnormal development for
      the other systems of fetus. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between
      cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentrations and the subsequent risk of
      morbidities including RDS, PDA, NEC, BPD AND ROP in preterm infants.
