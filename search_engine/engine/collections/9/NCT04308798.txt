      perioperative and post-operative prevention are importance for reduce surgical site infection
      The prevention of surgical-site infections (SSIs) is an integral component of nosocomial
      infection control and a major priority in orthopedic surgery.

      Surgical wound contamination must be prevented to avoid patient colonisation by
      microorganisms during surgery.

      Surgical glove changing perioperative can reduce contamination and perforation rate
      Orthopedic surgery had found contamination rate about 20-28 % Joint replacement procedure
      found contamination rate about 38-67% of all orthopedic surgery 12% of gloves are
      contaminated after draping and 24% once patient installation is complete.

      Research question : Does changing surgical glove during total knee arthroplasty can reduce
      contamination rate on surgical glove?

      Population : Patient who schedule for primary total knee arthroplasty in Srinagarind hospital

      Inclusion criteria :Patient who schedule for primary total knee arthroplasty in Srinagarind
      hospital

      Exclusion criteria :

      Patient factor Patient who had previous open knee surgery Patient who have remote infection
      at period of surgery for total knee arthroplasty Patient who have lower extremity infection
      same side at total knee arthroplasty prior 48 hrs Surgical glove factor gross perforation
      Glove changing not include in criteria for study group

      Primary outcome :

      -Comparison contamination rate of surgical glove in treatment group and control group

      Secondary outcome :

      -Contamination rate in draping method period and surgical procedure prior to cementation
      period in total knee arthroplasty

      Study design: a randomized controlled trial

      Treatment group glove changing after draping and before cementation glove changing before
      cementation Control group

      -no glove change

      Pre-operative protocal

        -  iv. Cefazolin 1 hour prior to incision

        -  skin preparation by Betadine scrub

        -  Draping including entire limb from thigh to foot

        -  pre-operative hand wash by Betadine scrub for at least 2 minutes Perioperative protocal

        -  Operating room include horizontal laminar flow

        -  Use Ansell GAMMEX latex powdered surgical glove for all glove include in this study
           Post-operative protocal

        -  antibiotic prophylaxis for 24 hours post-op

      The five fingertips of each hand were placed on blood agar immediately before each set of
      gloves were removed Culture plates were subsequently incubated at 37Â°C for 48 hours. A single
      microbiologist reported the results of the culture. The number of colonies counted as the
      number of colony-forming units (CFU) per dish and types of organisms were recorded

      identified all bacterial isolates by using Gram stain coagulase oxidase catalase tests. The
      degree of contamination was divided into three grades

        1. no contamination if there was no growth

        2. low contamination where between one and five colonies

        3. heavily contaminated if there were more than five colonies
