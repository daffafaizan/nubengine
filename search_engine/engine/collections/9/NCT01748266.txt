      elective cardiac surgery with CPB were included in this prospective observational study.
      Patients were studied during the first 48 postoperative hours. Microcirculation of the thenar
      eminence was analyzed by NIRS technology, through the StO2 and the resaturation slope after
      an ischemic challenge. Organ dysfunction was assessed with the SOFA score.
