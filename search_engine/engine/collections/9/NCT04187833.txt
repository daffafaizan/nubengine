    
      This is a phase II, single arm, multi-institutional, open label trial in a sample size of 37
      primary or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients progressed on prior
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 or BRCA-ness.

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus
      talazoparib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2 or other DNA
      damage repair mutations (defined as BRCA-ness)

      Secondary objectives and their endpoints include progression free survival (PFS) defined as
      time from first dose of treatment until disease progression, treatment related adverse
      events, anti-tumor activity , and immune-related progression free survival (irPFS).
