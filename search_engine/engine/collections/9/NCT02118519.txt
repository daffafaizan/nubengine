      inclusion and exclusion criteria, divided into two equal groups based upon receiving
      autologous MSCs alone, or MSCs supported by platelet lysate through percutaneous injection.

      The patients are followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injected knee.

      The investigators hypothesize that the two groups will give satisfactory clinical outcomes,
      but the investigators are looking forward to assessing the best product that will activate
      chondrogenesis and heal cartilaginous injury.
