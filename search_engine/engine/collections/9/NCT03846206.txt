      mortality, cardiovascular diseases, and breast cancer in HIV uninfected individuals. It is
      likely that changes in the microbiome could play a role in this effect. The goal of the study
      is to evaluate if a change to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts and olive oil
      decreases bacterial translocation and immune activation by a change in the microbiome in
      successfully treated HIV-1 infected patients with CD4> 500cells/ml. One hundred and two
      patients who will be randomized to continues usual diet or to a Mediterranean diet
      supplemented with 50 g / day of olive oil and 15g / day of nuts for three months. Throughout
      the study a specialized dietician will monitor the patients. Blood samples will be collected
      to assess parameters of bacterial translocation, inflammation and immune activation. To
      assess compliances with diet, urine samples will be collected too, and stool samples to study
      changes in gut microbiota. All the samples will be collected at the beginning and 90 days
      after the inclusion in the study.
