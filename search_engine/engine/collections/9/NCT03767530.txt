      10 to 20% of the general population. Of these, 3.7% to 70% of cases are due to meibomian
      gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is a chronic diffuse disease characterized by terminal duct
      obstruction and/or qualitative/quantitative changes in gland secretion. This causes a
      disruption in the tear film, ocular irritation symptom, inflammation, and ocular surface
      symptoms. The gold standard for the treatment of meibomian dysfunction is the use of warm
      compresses and eyelid massage 2 times a day. These have variable results and consequently
      patient's adherence to treatment is low. An alternative treatment is the use of thermal
      therapy devices such as Lipiflow, MiBo Thermoflo, and Blephasteam. The objective of this
      study is to determine if the thermal device MiBo Thermoflo is more effective than warm
      compresses and eyelid massage in the treatment of dry eye secondary to MGD. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Mibo group will receive 3 sessions of thermal
      therapy at 2 weeks interval and the control group warm compresses and eyelid massage 2 times
      per day. All subjects will have follow up of 24 weeks and we will compare results for both
      groups at the end of the study. During the protocol patients in both groups will continue
      with their standard treatment for dry eye as needed.
