      has on the speed of performing specific medical procedures. In two simulated scenarios, the
      times from the decision to execution of medical procedures will be measured. In the first
      scenario, the equipment is located in the standard way and the research participants know
      where it is located. In the second scenario, the equipment is placed elsewhere and
      participants do not have the opportunity to check the equipment before the scenario. For the
      statistical comparison the Student's T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used. For
      analysis of variance will be used the ANOVA test and for more than two dependent selections
      the Friedman's ANOVA test will be used.
