      Primary

        -  To compare the response rate in HER2-negative patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic breast cancer or locoregional breast cancer recurrence treated with docetaxel
           and a dietary phytochemical vs docetaxel alone.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the overall clinical benefit rate (i.e., objective response plus stable
           disease) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To assess biomarkers of response in blood samples from patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to recruitment center
      and line of chemotherapy (first vs second line of docetaxel). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3
           weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I. Patients also receive an oral dietary
           phytochemical twice on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
