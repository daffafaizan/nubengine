      steps with poor motor control on the paretic leg while paradoxically increasing the cost of
      energy expenditure. Biomechanical evidence shows that impaired gait performance for people
      with chronic stroke is not solely the result of the loss of muscle strength, but involves
      complicated movement discoordination across multiple joints in the affected leg. This has
      been taken to indicate a persistent motor control deficit in the paretic leg post stroke.
      Recent imaging studies suggest that the persistent motor control deficit after stroke may be
      the result of the disruption of motor memory consolidation, a process by which a
      newly-learned motor skill is transformed from a fragile state to a stable state and is
      "saved" in our brain afterward. This indicates that the same brain area responsible for
      controlling motor activity is also involved in memorizing newly-learned skills during the
      early stage of motor learning. Presence of persistent motor control deficits in the chronic
      stage may be attributed to the fact that damage to the brain cortex significantly impacts the
      ability of acquiring motor skills and consequentially defers the improvement of motor
      function, including gait.
