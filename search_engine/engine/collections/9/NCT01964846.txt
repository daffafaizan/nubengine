      numerous chronic conditions and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Also, high-fat meals have been
      shown to induce postprandial oxidative stress and inflammation. Polyphenols are compounds
      found ubiquitously in plants and are known to regulate many processes like plant growth,
      reproduction, seed germination as well as resistance to pathogens and predators. They are
      present in fruits and vegetables and exhibit favorable physiological effects that even if
      they remain not fully understood, still allow the classification of phenolic compounds as
      antiinflammatory molecules.

      Resveratrol is a polyphenol that is found in berries, grapes and red wine among others.
      Interest for resveratrol as a health-promoting molecule has flourished in recent years as it
      has been shown to prevent co-morbidities associated with diabetes and CVD. Evidence of the
      physiological benefits of resveratrol in humans is somewhat limited, but nonetheless supports
      an antiinflammatory action.

      There is also an increasing body of evidence supporting the role of curcumin, a polyphenol
      from the curcuminoid family, as a modulator of the inflammatory pathway.These observations
      underline the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin and how it may serve in the prevention
      and treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes and CVD.

      The general objective of this project is to investigate the acute effect of consuming dietary
      supplement combining resveratrol and curcumin on the inflammatory response following the
      consumption of a high-fat meal in healthy individuals with slightly elevated waist girth.
