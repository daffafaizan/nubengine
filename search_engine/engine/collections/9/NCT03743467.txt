    
      In Parkinson's disease (PD) several non-motor signs and symptoms already occur in the early
      stages of the disease; the symptoms are diverse and these also involve visual difficulties
      which commonly affect the majority of patients and which gradually worsen the quality of
      life.

      The most common malfunction produced by PD is the dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways that
      may be responsible for a series of visual deficits too:

        -  decreased visual acuity and decreased sensibility to light and color,

        -  strabismus and forms of sensory and eye movement dysfunctions,

        -  eyelid dysfunctions and dry eye syndrome

      Moreover, in patients affected by PD, typical retinal features were discovered for the first
      time in 2004 by the use of OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) such as:

        -  the reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)

        -  a typical thinning of the macular thickness, even if with different results. In the
           follow-up of the PD, these retinal features, verifiable by the use of OCT, could be
           considered as a marker of the pathology.

      For these reasons it may be useful:

        -  quantify in an objective manner how much the visual aspects affect the overall
           deterioration of the quality of life in patients with PD

        -  demonstrate the validity of a specific and integrated outpatient diagnostic protocol for
           the study of visual and ophthalmological disorders in patients with PD

        -  demonstrate the diagnostic role of early changes in macular thickness and of the optic
           disc in subjects suffering from PD using the OCT

        -  establish orthoptic evidence in patients with PD
