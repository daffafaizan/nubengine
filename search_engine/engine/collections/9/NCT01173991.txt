    
      This study was designed as a randomized, controlled (versus standard education), open,
      one-center trial. Patients in group 1 were taught carbohydrate counting to estimate insulin
      preprandial bolus, while the patients in group 2 followed standard education. Primary outcome
      (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) and secondary outcomes (fasting glucose, glycemic
      variability, insulin requirement, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, quality of
      life) were measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
