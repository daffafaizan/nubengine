      aortic stenosis with or without symptoms are insufficiently defined. This lack of definition
      can contribute both to delay in treatment and inappropriate treatment decisions. While this
      has been confirmed in hospitals with a full complement of treatment modalities for severe
      aortic stenosis, including surgery and percutaneous options, it is not known whether delay in
      treatment or appropriateness of treatment decisions are better or worse in smaller hospitals
      without equivalent on-site access.

      The aim of this study is to delineate the case load of patients with aortic stenosis, outline
      the management of these patients and determine appropriateness in participating centres with
      and without on-site access to surgery and percutaneous treatment.
