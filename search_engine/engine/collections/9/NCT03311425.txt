      surgery with a published incidence that ranges from 1.7% to 50.3%.1-9 The pathophysiology of
      post-operative dysphagia is not fully understood and is subject to further study.
      Postoperative dysphagia has been reported to improve with time with a mean incidence of 19.8%
      at 6 months, 16.8% at 12 months, and 12.9% at 24 months after ACDF. The investigator's
      standard of practice is to provide 10mg of dexamethasone IV intraoperatively in order to
      reduce postoperative prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Despite the growing popularity of
      ACDF procedures, there is a lack of clear evidence supporting the utilization of
      perioperative corticosteroids in the setting of an ACDF.
