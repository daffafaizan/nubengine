    
      Patients with PKAN who have completed both the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial
      TIRCON2012V1 and its follow-up, the single-arm open-label extension study TIRCON2012V1-EXT,
      may enroll in this compassionate-use/expanded access program in order to continue receiving
      the iron chelator deferiprone. Participants in this program will be followed locally by their
      own neurologist or other appropriate specialist. Patients will take deferiprone oral solution
      80 mg/mL at the same dose they were prescribed in the TIRCON2012V1-EXT clinical trial. Safety
      monitoring of the patients will be performed. At a minimum, the program will continue until
      the analysis of the currently blinded TIRCON2012V1 trial is completed (approximately Q4
      2016), at which time it will be re-evaluated.
