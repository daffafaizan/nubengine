      cardiac event. Referrals to the CRP are a standard part of the community-based continuing
      care process within the Winnipeg region, to include automatic referrals for hospitalized
      patients, based on specific criteria, physician referrals and self-referrals. However, fewer
      women than men are referred to and participate in CRPs in Winnipeg.

      The investigators' study is unique in that the investigators plan to capture those women who
      may not be ready to change or participate in a traditional CRP. While women who are in the
      pre-contemplative or contemplative stages of change may not be ready to participate in a
      standard CRP, they may be willing to explore a complementary opportunity: the FHHS STEP
      Program. The overall goal of this project is to provide a collaborative team environment that
      will engage women; educate, and empower women; and provide women with the necessary personal
      resources to enable them to take the step towards a cardiac rehabilitation program and a
      life-long commitment to heart health. The investigators' 2-group randomized clinical trial
      will compare physiological and psychosocial outcomes among women completing a 12-week gender
      specific introduction to cardiac rehabilitation with non-program attenders.
