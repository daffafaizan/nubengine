      events and all-cause death in patients with baseline prediabetes and stage1 hypertension
      after18 years follow up, then explore the role of risk factors. After assessing the
      association between BP categories and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, to
      analyze the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by blood glucose categories and
      BP categories combined by using multiple Cox regression analysis. To analyze the
      corresponding incidence of all-cause mortality per 1,000 person-years for the BP<130/80 mmHg,
      130-139/80-89 mmHg, and â‰¥140/90 mmHg or treated groups respectively after adjusting for age,
      sex, and other factors. To identify the associations between cardiovascular mortality and BP
      categories alone or combined with blood glucose categories were consistent with that of
      all-cause mortality.

      To identify relative metabolic molecular biomarker panel detected by mass spectrometry in
      blood samples correlating with efficacy in prediabetes and stage 1 hypertension among Chinese
      adults. Compare the plasma metabolic profiles of different groups and the metabolic markers
      were screened and optimized by multivariate statistical analysis, logistic regression
      analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

      To determine whether one or several metabolites can be used as serum markers to judge the
      prognosis of patients with prediabetes and stage1 hypertension, and to establish the
      evaluation model of metabolites for the prognosis.
