      treatment choice. Steroids decrease the synthesis and maturation of collagen, suppress
      fibroblast function, and inhibit the antibacterial phagocytic action of some defense cells
      and vasoactive substances release.These actions are considered to be functional for treating
      vocal nodules. Many studies, investigated steroid injection in benign lesions including
      nodules, reported that 93-100% of the nodules either disappeared or improved. The reported
      nodules recurrence rate after 2 years was 26.7- 31%.

      However, to our knowledge, no previous study has compared vocal nodule steroid injection with
      a group receiving voice therapy to accurately assess the clinical role of vocal fold steroid
      injection.
