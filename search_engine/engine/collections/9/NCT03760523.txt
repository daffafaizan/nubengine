      and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Minnelide as single-agent in relapsed/refractory (R/R)
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy.
      The oral formulation of Minnelide will be used. Minnelide is a prodrug of triptolide (a
      potent heat shock protein (HSP) 70 inhibitor) with promising preclinical activity in AML.
