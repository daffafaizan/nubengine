      I. To assess the efficacy of SB-715992 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer who have
      received at least one prior therapy. This will be achieved by a multi-center, single arm
      phase II study to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial
      response with this agent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival. II. To assess the time to progression. III. To evaluate
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ispinesib (SB-715992) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
