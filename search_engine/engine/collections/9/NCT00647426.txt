      progression by radiographic imaging studies. The primary goal of this study is to determine
      the clinical response rate of this regimen in patients with advanced lung cancer. Secondary
      endpoints include time to progression, overall survival, and toxicity. Blood levels of
      ERK-phosphorylation, activated caspase 3, cyclin D1, anti -cIAP2, p-Akt, and Mcl1 activity
      will be measured at the beginning, middle and end of therapy to help identify predictors of
      drug response and toxicity during the first cycle of treatment.
