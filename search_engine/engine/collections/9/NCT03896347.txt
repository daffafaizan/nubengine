    
      Up to 120 patients undergoing three-level OLIF using ViBone, DBM, and BMP each on separate
      levels will be enrolled.

      Implantation of ViBone, DBM, and BMP will be randomized between the three levels.

      Subjects will be followed for a total of 12 months. Data and x-ray radiographs will be
      collected according to standard of care, including baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-surgery. Additionally, a CT scan will be required at 6 and 12 months.
