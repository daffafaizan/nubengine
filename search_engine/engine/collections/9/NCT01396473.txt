      a critical time to intervene on physical activity and nutrition. Previous research has mostly
      focused on during-school-day efforts, or on child care policies and practices for very young
      children, leaving a gap in the knowledge of what might work with programs serving school-age
      children during out of school time. OSNAP aims to implement low cost and sustainable policy
      and environmental interventions to improve physical activity and healthy eating/beverage
      environments. Data will be collected via observations, plate waste and accelerometers on
      program policies, environments, practices and behavioral outcomes related to physical
      activity, beverage, snack and screen time outcomes.
