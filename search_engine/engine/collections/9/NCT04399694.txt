      DNA will be sequenced (targeted capture and/or whole genome DNA sequencing (WGS)) to identify
      any non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs), smaller insertions/deletions (indels), or
      larger structural variants (SVs). RNA will be sequenced (RNA-seq) to identify genes that are
      expressed in a differential and/or allele-specific manner, which may indicate a functional
      non-coding or splicing variant. We will test the function of non-coding variants using
      high-throughput reporter assays and CRISPR based methodologies.
