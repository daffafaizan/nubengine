    
      This is a single institution historical cohort study of patients with Wolman (WD) or
      Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD). Retrospective data will be collected and abstracted
      from the medical records of both living and deceased patients. Additionally prospective data
      from living patients will be collected and abstracted annually until the end of the study.
      Literature sources will be used as secondary source data and will be screened to
      minimize/eliminate duplicative reports.
