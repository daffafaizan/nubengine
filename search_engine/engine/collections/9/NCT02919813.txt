      Educational seminars teach women about the different aspects of PLV that affect emotional and
      physical health. Both groups will be given a binder containing course material at the first
      session and homework at each session that you will be asked to complete. The group education
      seminars will include an informational video clip reviewing an aspect of PLV and sexuality
      and will be followed by a group discussion facilitated by an instructor. Each session will
      involve a teacher and a small group of 6 to 12 women with PLV. Additionally, women in both
      groups will be asked to perform a weekly test to measure pain and to complete a daily diary.
