      traumatic brain injury. Previous studies have reported positive effects on cognitive function
      after computerized cognitive training, aerobic exercise, or a combination of the two,
      however, the effects are variable and hardly be transferred to enhance daily participation.
      It is thus still inconclusive that which types of interventions are better for cognitive
      remediation and daily participation in patients post traumatic brain injury. Several
      pioneering studies used guided training for patients with brain injury to acquire
      problem-solving skills, improve life function and promote participation. After the training,
      the effect lasted for six months. However, due to insufficient research samples, it was
      inferior in generalizability.

      In the present project, the investigators design an innovative combinatorial training that
      composites of guided training, computerized cognitive training, and aerobic exercise. The
      investigators expected that this combinatorial training not only improve cognitive ability
      but also facilitate daily participation in patients with traumatic brain injury. The
      investigators plan to recruit 50 patients with traumatic brain injury who have cognitive
      deficits and will assign them randomly into two groups: sequential training group, and
      combinatorial training group.

      There will compare the immediate effects and long-term effects of combinatorial training and
      combined training (computerized cognitive training plus aerobic exercise) on cognitive
      function and daily function/participation and psychological function of persons with
      traumatic brain injury.
