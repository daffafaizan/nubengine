      surgery for children and adults improves abnormalities in the functional anatomy of language
      that may be associated with uncontrolled localization-related seizures. We will use an
      established modality, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has been used
      extensively for evaluation of patients with epilepsy, as our primary outcome measure, and an
      emerging modality, magnetoencephalography (MEG), as a secondary measure. We will explore
      methods of MEG data analysis for comparison with fMRI results.

      Study Population:

      150 patients with localization-related epilepsy who are surgical candidates and 50 healthy
      volunteers.

      Design: This is a non-invasive imaging study that will employ a test battery including
      standard neuropsychological tests, structural MRI, fMRI, and a 275-channel whole-head MEG
      recording, for evaluation of the functional anatomy of language. The test battery will be
      performed pre-operatively and at 12 months after surgery.

      Main outcome measure: Measurement of the "laterality index" comparing left and right
      hemisphere regional activation on fMRI before and after surgery, in patients after left sided
      or right-sided surgery, and healthy controls.

      Secondary outcome measure: Measurement of the "laterality index" comparing left and right
      hemisphere regional activation on MEG before and after surgery.
