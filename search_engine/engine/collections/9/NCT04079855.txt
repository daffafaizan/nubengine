      approaches to alter dietary pattern, especially macronutrient profile. The investigators
      propose a prospective, randomized trial that is designed to overcome the above limitations to
      test the hypothesis that changing dietary macronutrient profile can change taste perception
      and food preference. Data from this study will provide information that policy makers,
      regulators, and the food industry can use to develop successful approaches (gradual or
      otherwise) for providing healthy diets in the marketplace.
