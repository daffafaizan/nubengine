      cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of Youth Representative-led vs. probation staff-led
      PHAT Life in a real-world juvenile probation setting. The Specific Aims of this study are:

        1. To conduct a methodologically-rigorous 2-arm trial comparing the impact of PHAT Life on
           350 13-17 year-old offenders' risky sex, STI, substance use, and theoretical mediators
           when delivered by Youth Representatives (YR) vs. probation staff (PS).

        2. To compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of 100 YR-led vs. PS-led PHAT Life with
           respect to the acquisition of incident STI.

      We hypothesize: (a) Compared to teens in PS-led groups, we expect teens in YR-led groups to
      report less risky sex and substance use at 6-month follow-up, to demonstrate greater
      improvement on theoretical mediators of risk, and to have fewer incident STI infections; (b)
      We expect YR-led PHAT Life to cost less and be more cost-effective than PS-led PHAT Life.
