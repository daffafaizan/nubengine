           will record brain activity as subjects are waking up from anesthesia

        2. While subjects are staying at New York Presbyterian hospital before the second surgery
           we will record brain activity. Most of the recordings will be performed as subjects are
           going to sleep naturally, but other recordings will be acquired during waking hours.
           This will not interfere with normal monitoring of seizure activity.

        3. Final recording session is immediately before the second operation as general anesthesia
           is gradually induced. During this time subjects may be asked to follow simple commands
           like: "Open your eyes" in order to determine the level of consciousness. Also during
           this session, if arterial line is placed by the anesthesiologist for real-time blood
           pressure monitoring we will collect several small (~1 ml) blood samples to determine
           blood concentration of anesthetics. Approximately 1 teaspoon of blood will be obtained
           in total. No additional venipuncture will be necessary.

      No additional invasive procedures will be performed for the purposes of the study. We will
      use the same electrode array as is typically used for monitoring and mapping of epilepsy.
      Subjects will receive the same anesthetic agent as is commonly used for induction of
      anesthesia for this surgery (propofol). Subjects will be monitored in the same way as is
      normally done during surgical procedures and during your stay at New York Presbyterian
      hospital.

      As a part of the study subjects may be asked simple questions as they go under anesthesia.

      We may collect several small blood samples (described above) to determine the concentration
      of anesthetic agents.
