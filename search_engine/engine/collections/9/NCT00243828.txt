      in patients with acute respiratory failure due to enhanced tolerance and the allowance of
      higher airway pressure without massive leaks.OBJECTIVES: To assess, in acute respiratory
      failure patients, whether the total-face mask reduce the intubation rate. Additionally,
      whether it may improve mask tolerance, skin pressure damage, number of patients receiving
      higher pressures, or even a reduction in mortality. METHODS: 300 patients admitted in the ICU
      for acute respiratory failure needing continuous noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The type
      of mask (total-face vs. conventional face mask) will be randomized. PEEp will be titrated to
      the best oxygenation and IPAP up to reduce dyspnea and respiratory frequency, with the limits
      at clinical tolerance and massive leaks. Defined failure criteria and weaning technique will
      be used. Data to record include clinical parameters and mortality risk score (SAPS II), and
      physiologic response to NIV (either subjective and objective), technique failures and
      outcome. EXPECTED RESULTS: The study has been powered to detect a 30% relative improvement in
      intubation rate from a 35% baseline incidence of intubation in the conventional group.
