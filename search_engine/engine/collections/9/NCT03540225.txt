      decreased by using of progesterone. However, in twin pregnancies, no significant reduction in
      preterm birth has been demonstrated in any trial.

      One explanation for the lack of benefit of progesterone in previous twin studies may result
      from a suboptimal dosage. The investigators therefore hypothesize that progesterone dosages
      that are sufficient for singleton pregnancies are insufficient for twins and this is likely
      to be one of the reasons why prophylactic progesterone has failed to reduce preterm birth in
      twins.

      Another possible explanation for the negative findings in previous twin studies may result
      from administration beginning too late in the second-trimester. It is thought that the
      mechanism of preterm birth in twin pregnancies is more strongly related to exaggerated
      uterine distension, which may override any benefit of progesterone on the cervix after a
      threshold has been reached. It is also plausible that cervical shortening occurs earlier in
      twin pregnancies than with singletons, and that treatment is required before a threshold of
      shortening is reached or before any inflammation-mediated component to the initiation of
      preterm birth has been established as the biological mechanisms by which preterm birth occurs
      differ from those in singleton pregnancies.
