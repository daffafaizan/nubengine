      programs (PAPs) of ESKD patients may be facilitated by the presence in the Renal Unit of an
      exercise specialist able to design tailored programs and that this intervention may lead to
      measurable benefits on physical fitness, quality of life and general health.

      The possible different solutions offered by an expert of exercise in chronic diseases might
      reduce most of the barriers to exercise responsible of the sedentary behavior of the ESKD
      patients. Aim of the project is to test the impact of the regular presence of this
      facilitator in a Nephrology Unit in terms of applicability and feasibility as well to
      identify the preferred and the most effective pathways for the patients.

      The identification of a novel cost-effective intervention may represent an important step to
      manage the change of lifestyle of ESKD patients, to slow down their physical and QoL decline
      and to reduce hospitalizations and negative outcomes affecting this population.
