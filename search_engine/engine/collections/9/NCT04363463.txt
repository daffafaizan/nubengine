    
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled study. 400 patients with COVID-19 documentation
      and undergoing oxygen therapy will be randomly assigned, with a 1:1 ratio, to conventional
      positioning or repeated prone sessions.

      The control group will have conventional positioning: semi-seated in bed or seated in a
      chair. The prone position is not allowed during the day (it is allowed at night if it is the
      natural sleeping position).

      The intervention group will have:

        -  Two sessions minimum of prone position over the day. With a total objective of at least
           2h30 of cumulated duration over the day. The objective is to spend as much time as
           possible in prone position if the patient tolerates it well.

        -  The maximum of prone position at night. Patients must be able to take position by
           themselves or with minimal assistance. The rails will be positioned in order to prevent
           falling out of bed. The patient will be free to choose his preferred prone position as
           long as the back is not compressed
