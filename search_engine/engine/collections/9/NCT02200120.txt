      efficacy of temporary and tunneled catheters for renal replacement therapy in patient with
      acute kidney injury. In particular, we will be assessing renal replacement adequacy for
      patients on dialysis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration by monitoring urea reduction
      ratios, venous and arterial pressures. We will also be monitoring infection rates. We will
      compare these outcomes in patients receiving tunneled catheters and patients receiving
      temporary catheters.
