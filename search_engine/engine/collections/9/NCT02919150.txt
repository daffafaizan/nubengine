      properties of muscle tone like isokinetic dynamometer.

      The purpose of this investigation is to establish the reliability, validity and sensitivity
      of a myotonometer to assess myofascial trigger points. The results of this study will verify
      the inter-reliability of a myotonometer device in order to evaluate muscle tone, examine
      correlations and associations between myotonometric measurements and isokinetic measurements
      and provide a measurable understanding of the location of myofascial trigger points.

      Assessment:

      Myoton device is a simple and portable tool to obtain quantitative and objective assessments
      of mechanical properties of muscle tone.

      Isokinetic dynamometric technique is considered a valid biomechanics method to measure muscle
      tone in non-injured subjects but isokinetic machine is a heavy and expensive equipment.

      Outcome measures:

      Myotonometric measures will include muscle frequency, decrement (elasticity) and stiffness.

      Isokinetic measures will include passive resistive torque to ankle dorsiflexion and
      dorsiflexion passive range of motion (PROM)

      All outcome measures will be evaluated once.
