      by phone and qualified subjects will be sent home for 2 weeks to complete a bowel movement
      logbook, then return into the CEWM office where they will submit validated surveys
      (specifically, the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL) and have a photo taken of their tongue. A baseline
      non-invasive heart rate variability (HRV) measurement will be taken at this time as well.
      Study personnel will instruct each subject on TEAS pad placement and how to use the device,
      but not tell the subjects where to place the pads. The subjects will been assigned to one of
      two experimental groups (verum and sham) based on a 1:1 random allocation, with the study
      personnel blinded to the allocation. Both groups will be given transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulator (TENS) units with pre-set parameters and access to the adjustable amplitude
      dial for self-adjustment of amplitude, with the verum group given pre-printed information on
      proper application on true acupoints, and sham group will be given information on
      non-acupuncture points. The subjects will be instructed on daily use for 30 minutes per day
      for at least 5 days per week, and asked to track device use as well as bowel movement
      frequency and quality using a logbook. They will also submit to an online survey every week
      during the 4-week trial period. At the conclusion of the study, they will return the units
      and repeat the survey and HRV measurements.
