      their sensitivity for detecting early cardiac involvement. The final objective is to use
      these validated cardiac MRI biomarkers to better understand the genotype-phenotype
      correlation in boys with DMD, which to date remain tenuous. The investigators propose a pilot
      study to explore cardiac genotype-phenotype correlations in boys with DMD and outlier
      phenotypes using approaches they have pioneered for skeletal muscle.
