      clinical trials with sugammadex. In clinical practice however, a PNS is commonly

      used in many hospitals worldwide. A disadvantage of a PNS is that it is not objective
      monitoring like the TOF-Watch® SX, and it can detect only the number of twitches. In this
      trial, the relationship between the time to reappearance of T4 using PNS (i.e. Ministim®
      model MS-IV) and the time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 using the TOF-Watch® SX was
      determined after a dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex was administered 15 minutes after the last
      dose of rocuronium. Determining this relationship will enable the provision of advice on when
      it is safe to extubate participants after administration of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex for
      reversing neuromuscular block while using a PNS. The time to reappearance of T4 was assessed
      by a blinded PNS-assessor. This assessor was blinded for the dose of sugammadex used and for
      the TOF results measured with the TOF-Watch® SX.
