      new MRI technique - termed arterial spin labeling (ASL) - in the diagnosis of pediatric brain
      tumors. This technique can non-invasively measure the blood flow to the brain during MRI
      examination. Because aggressive brain tumors require new blood vessels and a high level of
      blood supply to support its growth, we believe the tumor blood flow measured using ASL is a
      reliable indicator of tumor grade. This information may be useful for doctors to make
      treatment decisions and to monitor patients' response to treatment.
