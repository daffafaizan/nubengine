      social & emotional behavior, including emotional reactivity and emotion regulation, the
      present study aims to explore effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) on emotion
      processing and emotional interference processing within a randomized double-blind,
      with-subject, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI experiment. To further examine the potential
      moderating effects of the genetic makeup of the serotonin system the present study will
      include a pharmacogenetics imaging approach. Given that TPH2 is the key regulator of the
      serotonergic signaling pathway, we therefore assessed whether such the effects of tryptophan
      depletion vary according to the TPH2 genotype. To this end, healthy male TPH2-GG or TPH2-TT
      carriers will be recruited and will receive ATD (100g) and placebo (102.3g) in a within
      subject design. To control for potential effects of pre-medication personality traits as well
      as effects of medicines on mood, subjects will be administered pre-treatment assessing
      relevant personality traits and post-treatment assessments of mood.
