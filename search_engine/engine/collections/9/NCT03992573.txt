      extraction. On one side of dental arch, post-operative region was field with CGF material,
      while on the other side it was left to normal healing. In both cases pain, swelling, alveolar
      osteitis, antibiotics and analgesics intake in post-operative period were evaluated in the
      first, fourth and seventh day after surgery. Wound healing was assessed seven and thirty days
      after extraction.
