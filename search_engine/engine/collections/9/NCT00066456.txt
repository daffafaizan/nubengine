      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel in combination with low-dose abdominal
      radiotherapy in patients with recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian, peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 35.
      Within 3 hours after beginning docetaxel, patients also receive low-dose abdominal
      radiotherapy twice daily (at least 4 hours apart) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 24, 29, 30,
      35, and 36. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
