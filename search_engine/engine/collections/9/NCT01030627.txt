      with magnesium sulfate will be given the option of participating in the study. Those who
      choose to take part in the study and meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive
      full information about the study and be required to give their written or signed informed
      consent.

      Women agreeing to participate in the study will receive a loading dose and maintenance
      therapy using an IV infusion administered by the Springfusor® pump. Women will receive a 8 mL
      loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4*7H2O) 50% solution, which is
      approximately 2 mmoL magnesium/mL. The loading dose of 8mL with 4 g MgSO4 will be
      administered using the Springfusor® pump. The administration of the loading dose will be
      immediately followed by a maintenance infusion. The maintenance dose of 4 g (8 cc, 50% MgSO4)
      will be administered with the Springfusor® pump continuously over four hours. Clinical
      monitoring will occur once every hour during the treatment period. Clinical monitoring will
      occur throughout the treatment, with reflexes, urine output and respiration to be checked at
      least every hour (or, if more frequent, as per standard practice at the study site). The pump
      will be checked at each monitoring visit. Prior to discharge from the study, patients will be
      asked to assess their opinions about the acceptability and ease of use of the mode of
      administration. All requests or inquiries about termination of treatment will be recorded.
