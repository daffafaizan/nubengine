      of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.
      "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved letermovir for treatment of
      cytomegalovirus infection, but it has approved letermovir for the prevention of
      cytomegalovirus infection in bone-marrow transplantation patients.

      This is the first time that letermovir will be administered to children in a clinical trial.

      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus, which a majority of people acquire at some time in
      their life. CMV remains in your body, but does not cause symptoms in the majority of people.
      Patients with a weakened immune system (a system that protects you from infections) may be
      more at risk for the virus becoming active and causing damage to some of your organs,
      especially in the gut and lungs. If the virus becomes present above a certain quantity, the
      doctor usually prescribes a drug to treat the infection at this stage to avoid damage to the
      organs.

      In this case, the virus is no longer responding to the prescribed drug, and other drug
      options will be harmful to the participant's health. Participants are being invited to take
      part in a research study for an investigational drug called letermovir. The purpose of this
      study is to find out whether letermovir is as effective and as safe in treating CMV infection
      in patients who cannot tolerate standard treatments such as ganciclovir or foscarnet.
