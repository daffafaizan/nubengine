    
      The study consists of a Screening visit; a Run-in Period of at least 2 weeks and up to 4
      weeks, where existing phosphate binder treatment is maintained; and a 4-week Double-Blind
      Treatment Period.

      At Screening, a subject must be on thrice daily phosphate binder therapy and have a serum
      phosphate (s-P) level ≥5.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL to qualify for entering the study. s-P will be
      measured at each visit during the run-in period to enable the evaluation of the s-P
      randomization criteria.

      Subjects who qualify to enroll in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      tenapanor or placebo while continuing their existing phosphate binder treatment.

      During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, subjects will receive tenapanor or placebo starting
      at a dose of 30 mg bid
