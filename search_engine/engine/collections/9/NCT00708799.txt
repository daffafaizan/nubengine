      response, unrelated to their anti-microbial properties, have been appreciated. Clinical
      trials of macrolides added to -lactams in bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have consistently demonstrated an absolute risk reduction
      in mortality of 15% in most populations. Several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) interleukin (IL) -1 and IL-8 which are generally proinflammatory and IL-6 and IL-10,
      which tend to be anti-inflammatory have been associated with sepsis. TNF is a cytokine that
      for a number of reasons is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and
      septic shock. TNF concentrations are increased during clinical and experimental sepsis and
      increasing concentrations and especially persistence of high concentrations of TNF during
      sepsis are associated with decreased survival. Therefore, our primary aim is to determine
      whether macrolide treatment of patients with severe sepsis has an advantageous
      immunomodulatory and clinical effect compared to severe septic patients without macrolide
      therapy. Our main hypothesis is macrolide use in addition to standard therapy in severe
      septic patients has an advantageous immunomodulatory and clinical effect compared to patients
      with severe sepsis not treated with a macrolide.
