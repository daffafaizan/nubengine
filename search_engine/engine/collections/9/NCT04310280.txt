    
      A randomized, split-plot, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Chronic Varicose Ulcers
      measuring more than 4 cm in any of its dimensions, and that comply with candidate criteria
      are included in the present study. A split-mouth model is used.

      The ulcer is divided into two (sides A and B). The side in which treatment is applied is
      randomized. Half of the wound's surface is treated locally with insulin (Glargine) applied at
      an approx depth of 3-4 mm. Both halves are covered with dressings and compression therapy is
      applied. Treatment with insulin is administered for 7 days. Biopsy specimens of the two sides
      are obtained on days 0 and 7. A thermographic photograph of the wound is taken at days 0 and
      7, as control of the local temperature of the wound. This is to asses the process of healing
      and to correlate with our outcome measures. The number of blood vessels will be evaluated as
      the main outcome. Fibroplasia and thermal asymmetry between wound sides will be evaluated as
      secondary outcomes.
