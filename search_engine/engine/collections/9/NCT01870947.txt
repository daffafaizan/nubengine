      To evaluate changes in body weight, fitness, bi-manual dexterity, exercise motivation and
      self-reported eating behavior (via questionnaires) before and after a 16-week exercise
      intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-EOT, in obese EC patients who will be randomized
      to perform 'assisted' or voluntary exercise.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Objective 1: To objectively examine food behavior as determined by neuronal response to high-
      versus low-calorie visual stimuli under fasted (hunger) and fed (satiated) states and stop/go
      signaling (SST) in fed states in brain regions of interest (reward and motivation circuitry)
      using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI before and after a 16-week
      exercise intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-intervention in obese EC patients
      performing 'assisted' and voluntary exercise.

      Objective 2: To examine the modification of the neuronal response to high vs. low calorie
      food images in regions of interest by polymorphisms in key genes (e.g., dopamine receptor and
      dopamine transporter) and serum biomarkers (e.g., leptin, BDNF) involved in regulating
      homeostatic and non-homeostatic energy systems.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either the assisted exercise (n=60) or voluntary
      exercise (n=60) group. Subjects in the voluntary group will exercise on a stationary
      recumbent exercise cycle and pedal at their preferred rate. Subjects in the assisted exercise
      group will cycle on the same stationary exercise bike; however, a motor will provide
      assistance to the patient in order to maintain a pedaling rate 35% greater than their
      voluntary rate. Subjects in the exercise groups will complete 45 minute to 1-hour sessions,
      three times per week for eight weeks. The control group will be asked to complete all
      exercise, body composition and fMRI testing similar to the exercise groups.
