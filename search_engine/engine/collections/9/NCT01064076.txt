    
      This clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study without a
      control group conducted in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria for implanting an S-ICD System will be enrolled in this
      clinical study, implanted with an S-ICD System, and followed prior to hospital discharge, and
      post-implant at 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days. After the 180-day post-implant follow-up
      visit, patients will continue to be followed semi-annually until study closure.

      Eligible patients enrolled in this clinical study may also participate in the chronic
      conversion sub-study.

      The safety endpoint will be evaluated through the use of a 180-day S-ICD System
      complication-free rate. The effectiveness endpoint will be evaluated using an induced
      ventricular fibrillation (VF) conversion efficacy rate. Spontaneous episodes and chronic
      conversion testing data will be evaluated using descriptive statistics to provide additional
      data supporting the continued chronic performance of the S-ICD System.
