      well at the level national as international because at this day there is no international
      publication dealing with this problem which begins to emerge in the structures setting in
      charge of the patients suffering of chronic pain. A recent article (Denk and al, on 2014)
      underlines the importance to look for the predictive factors of the chronic pain. This
      epidemiological study of prevalence of the social vulnerability even of the precariousness as
      well as predictive factors of this circumstance will allow to identify the patients with risk
      in a earlier way and to refer them as soon as possible for a support in the social domain. In
      a completely empirical way we notice important obstacles of psychosocial and societal order
      during the therapeutic care of the patients. This study will allow to bring important
      information on a troop about one thousand patients distributed on the French CETD.
