      demonstrated that microvascular blood flow in skeletal muscle plays an integral role in this
      process. Physiological doses of insulin stimulate microvascular blood flow, and that this
      increase is associated with enhanced glucose uptake by muscle. This microvascular action of
      insulin is lost during insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

      The oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) is the gold standard for assessing insulin resistance
      and pre-diabetes and is used world-wide. However high blood glucose levels following a
      glucose load may adversely impact on microvascular function. The aim of this project is to
      determine whether a mixed meal challenge (liquid drink consisting of carbohydrate, fat and
      protein) is a better test for assessing microvascular-derived insulin resistance.
