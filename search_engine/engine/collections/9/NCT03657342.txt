      for maintenance of the lung allograft. Eligible patients for the clinical trial must have a
      tacrolimus-based triple-drug therapy in combination with mycophenolate mofetil or its
      equivalent and a corticosteroid.

      A total of 11 visits will be performed during the clinical trial. After informed consent has
      been obtained, a Screening Visit will be carried out in order to check general eligibility
      for participation. At the Randomization Visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      re-checked and spirometry performed. During the 48-week treatment period, visits are
      scheduled every 4-8 weeks. If a patient has an event that meets one of the criteria for
      progression of BOS, he/she will return to the clinic at least 2-weeks later for an
      unscheduled visit to have spirometry and other procedures performed.
