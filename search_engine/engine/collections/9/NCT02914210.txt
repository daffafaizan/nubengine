      tele-rehabilitation-supported physical therapy versus traditional home and/or clinic-based
      physical therapy following total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. It will also examine
      standard post-surgical clinical measures to confirm non-inferiority of outcomes between
      groups. A total of 300 patients will receive standard pre- and post-surgical medical care
      from their healthcare providers, and be randomized to receive pre-surgery rehabilitation
      exercises ("pre-hab") and post-discharge physical therapy provided via either a home-based
      tele-rehabilitation platform (intervention group, n=150) or home-health and clinic-based
      physical therapy regimen (control group, n=150). Data will be collected by sites at
      enrollment, baseline, hospital discharge, and 6 weeks following surgery. Patients will
      complete telephone surveys regarding their health and knee function at baseline, 6 weeks, and
      3 months after surgery. Patients will also keep a diary from hospital discharge through 3
      months documenting healthcare utilization and progress toward a personal recovery goal. Diary
      information will be collected over the phone concurrently with administration of the 6-week
      and 3-month surveys. The episode for analysis will be from surgery through 3 months
      post-discharge, in alignment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
      Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) bundled payment model. Physical risks or
      benefits to patients for participating in this study are as expected from standard pre- and
      post-surgical physical therapy associated with total knee replacement surgery. The low risk
      of loss of confidentiality for all subjects will be minimized using appropriate safeguards.
