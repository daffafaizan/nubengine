    
      This phase 1/2 study evaluates the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      antitumor activity of COM701 an inhibitor of poliovirus receptor related immunoglobulin
      domain containing (PVRIG) in combination with BMS-986207 (an inhibitor of TIGIT) and
      nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of 2 parts (part 1 -
      dose escalation and part 2 - dose expansion).

      Part 1: escalating doses of COM701 will be combined with fixed doses of BMS-986207 and
      nivolumab. Upon completion of dose escalation a recommended dose of COM701 in combination
      with BMS-986207 and nivolumab (3-drug combination) will be determined.

      Part 2: subjects will be administered the recommended dose of COM701 in combination with
      BMS-986207 and nivolumab. Subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts based on their
      cancer type.

      Cohort 1: subjects with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or
      fallopian tube cancer will receive study treatment with either the 3-drug combination or
      nivolumab monotherapy.

      Cohort 2: subjects with MSS- endometrial cancer will receive study treatment with the 3-drug
      combination.

      Cohort 3 (Basket cohort): subjects with tumors that have high expression of a biomarker
      (PVRL2) will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination. Subjects with tumor types
      in cohorts 1 and 2 will not be enrolled into this cohort.
