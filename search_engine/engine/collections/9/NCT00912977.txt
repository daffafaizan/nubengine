      inpatient study visit. These measurements include standing on a forceplate for 1 minute while
      performing a mental task such as reciting the alphabet backwards. During this forceplate
      stance, a rater will visually score your movements. All participants must be eligible for
      another Parkinson's disease study at Oregon Health and Science University.
