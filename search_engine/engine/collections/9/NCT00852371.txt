      years (girls) attending primary schools in Tororo district. Schools will be selected using
      convenience sampling with the assistance of the district and the education sector. The target
      population includes children attending primary schools in Uganda. The accessible population
      includes the children attending the participating primary schools in classes 3-7 in Tororo
      district. Children who meet the selection criteria for participation in the study will be
      randomized to treatment with one of the four study regimens and will be followed for 42 days.
      Repeat evaluations will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 (and any unscheduled
      day that a student is ill) and will include assessment for the occurrence of adverse events.
      Treatment efficacy outcomes will be assessed using revised WHO outcome classification
      criteria. Acceptability of treatment regimens will be assessed using a questionnaire
      administered to participating students on day 7. The primary outcome measure is risk of
      parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after 42 days of follow-up.
