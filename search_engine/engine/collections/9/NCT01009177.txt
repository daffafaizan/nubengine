    
      This is a randomized, double-blind (1:1 bosentan : placebo) trial to evaluate the effect of
      bosentan in combination with DTIC on TTP or death in patients with metastatic melanoma stage
      IV.

      The patients will receive study medication (bosentan or placebo) and DTIC for 35 weeks to 105
      weeks; the study will be completed when 66 events (tumor progression, death due to underlying
      disease, other/additional anti-tumor therapy) have been observed.

      Study drug will be administered orally, 500 mg twice a day. DTIC will be given once every
      three weeks in a dosage of 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) or in accordance with the
      Institution's DTIC treatment protocol.
