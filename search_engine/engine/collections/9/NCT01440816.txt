      I. To measure the effect of intratumoral injection of tavo followed by in vivo
      electroporation (EP) (electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy) on the local
      expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the tumor microenvironment in patients with Merkel
      cell carcinoma (MCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of tavo-EP in MCC. II. To assess the clinical efficacy of this
      treatment approach in MCC. III. To assess the immunologic changes resulting from this
      treatment approach.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tavo intratumorally (IT) and undergo electrical discharge via OMS around the
      tumor site for electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy on days 1, 5, and 8.
      Patients with unresectable disease may receive a second course of treatment in 12 weeks.
      Patients with localized disease proceed to definitive treatment as determined by the treating
      physician starting 2-4 weeks after the first injection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 4-8 (for patients who
      received definitive treatment) or 12 (for patients with unresectable disease) and then
      annually for up to 5 years.
