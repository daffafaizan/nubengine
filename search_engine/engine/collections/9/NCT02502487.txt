      containing 2% lidocaine, about 76% men suffer from mild to severe pain when undergoing rigid
      cystoscopy, and approximately 27% men could still feel mild to moderate pain 7 days after the
      procedure. The most painful part of the procedure for men is when the cystoscope passes
      through the membranous urethra. Song et al did autopsy on males found dorsal nerve of the
      penis (DNP), the terminal branch of the pudendal nerve, innervates the membranous urethra in
      53.3% specimens. In addition, urethral mucosa has branches of DNP innervated. Dorsal penile
      nerve block (DPNB) is usually used for circumcision in children and it has been shown to
      provide effective analgesia for penile surgeries. According to the evidence that some DNP
      branches innervate membranous urethra and urethra mucosa and most pain originates from
      cystoscope passing through membranous urethra, we speculated that DPNB could overall reduce
      pain level in men during rigid cystoscopy.
