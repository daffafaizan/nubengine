    
      Specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To identify genetic variants in selected synaptic genes, by targeted sequencing with
      deep coverage of coding regions and a strong focus on previously untested regulatory regions
      in Autism Spectrum Disorder

      Aim 2: To define the range of clinical phenotypes caused by mutations in synaptic genes by
      establishing detailed genotype/phenotype correlations and analyzing segregation in families
      with multiple individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder
      traits or other neuropsychiatric disorders

      Aim 3: To generate a repository of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Autism Spectrum
      Disorder subjects with synaptic mutations for translational studies, including expression and
      functional assays.

      Aim 4: To identify the neuronal phenotypes caused by deleterious synaptic mutations for
      further translational studies
