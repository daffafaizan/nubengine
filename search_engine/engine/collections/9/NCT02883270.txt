    
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous
      system, which may lead to rapidly developing motor deficits, sensory deficits, autonomic
      dysfunction and respiratory failure. Approximately, 20.3% of patients cannot walk unaided at
      4 weeks of symptom onset and 18.0% at 6 months. So, restoration and improvement of
      independent walk are one of major goals of GBS rehabilitation. For severely affected
      neurological patients, gait training using conventional therapy is technically difficult due
      to their motor weakness and balance problems. Robotic-assisted gait training （RAGT）is an
      effective alternative to treadmill therapy with partial body weight in intense gait
      rehabilitation after some neuropathy. And the proven reliability and safety of RAGT suggest
      that it may be effective for treating non-ambulatory patients after some neuropathy. In our
      study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAGT in non-ambulatory patients of
      GBS.
