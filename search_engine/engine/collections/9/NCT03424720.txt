           investigators compare PLE value with BIS score during induction and emergence of general
           anesthesia using propofol target controlled infusion.

        2. In addition, the investigators verify whether or not the facial nerve integrity
           monitoring affects the efficacy for PLE and BIS values as an anesthetic depth indicator.
