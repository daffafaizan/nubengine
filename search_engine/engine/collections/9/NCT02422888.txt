      myocardial infarction and has important prognostic implications. Current data suggest that
      ticagrelor might be superior to prasugrel in the reduction of coronary microvasculature
      dysfunction. Thus, we have designed a clinical trial that will compare microvascular function
      in revascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients at treatment steady state with
      ticagrelor or prasugrel. Coronary microvascular dysfunction will be assessed with the index
      of microcirculatory resistance after primary percutaneous coronary intervention and at 1
      month follow-up in the infarct-related vessel and non-infarct related vessel.
