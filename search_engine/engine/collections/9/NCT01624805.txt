    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hATG (horse anti-thymocyte globulin),
      methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and GCSF (filgrastim) in achieving response (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR], or hematologic improvement [HI]) in patients with
      aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and toxicities of the combination of hATG,
      methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and GCSF in patients with aplastic anemia, or MDS. II. To
      assess time to response, response duration, and overall survival of patients with aplastic
      anemia, or MDS being treated with the combination of hATG, methylprednisolone, cyclosporine,
      and GCSF.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive methylprednisolone intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on days 1-4 and IV or
      orally (PO) with taper over days 5-30. Patients also receive horse anti-thymocyte globulin IV
      over 8 hours daily on days 1-4, cyclosporine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-180, and
      pegfilgrastim or pegfilgrastim biosimilar subcutaneously (SC) on day 5 and/or filgrastim SC
      beginning on day 5 and continuing until absolute neutrophil count recovers. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
