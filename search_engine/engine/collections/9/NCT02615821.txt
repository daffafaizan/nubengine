      regular physical activity, which can have implications for individuals' physical and
      psychological health (Bray & Born, 2010). Accordingly, it is imperative to find and implement
      cost and time-effective interventions to mitigate the consequences of this transition. Mental
      contrasting is a goal-setting strategy that involves imagining the greatest outcome
      associated with achievement of a desired future goal while considering the aspects of one's
      present situation that may serve as obstacles for attaining that same goal (Oettingen &
      Gollwitzer, 2010). Intervention research has shown that mental contrasting can be taught as a
      metacognitive strategy in a cost- and time-effective way, affecting numerous health
      behaviours including physical activity (Oettingen, 2012). Drawing from diverse theoretical
      perspectives (e.g., Bechara, 2005; Lawton, Conner, & McEachan, 2009; Williams, 2010), recent
      meta-analytic evidence suggests that affective judgements (e.g., enjoyable-unenjoyable) exert
      greater influence on physical activity behaviors than health-related instrumental judgements
      (e.g., useful-useless; Rhodes, Fiala, & Conner, 2009). Nevertheless, research has yet to
      utilize mental contrasting as a means of targeting affective judgements, through
      intervention, in order to bolster physical activity promotion efforts. This research will
      examine how an affective mental contrasting intervention will change university students'
      affective judgements in comparison to instrumental mental contrasting and standard mental
      contrasting comparison conditions, and the subsequent impact of these changes on physical
      activity behaviour.
