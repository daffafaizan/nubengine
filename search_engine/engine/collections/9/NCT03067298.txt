    
      The objective of this study is to validate the predictive values of biophysical (maternal
      blood pressure); biochemical (sFlt-1, Î²-hCG, PlGF, and AFP) and ultrasonographic (cervical
      length, Doppler, 3D evaluation of the placenta, 3D nasal bone) biomarkers at several
      timepoints for the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth,
      preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and intra-uterine fetal death.

      These biomarkers will be evaluated at 14-16 weeks, 20-24 weeks and 30-34 weeks. Those
      specific gestational ages have been selected because they correspond to the typical
      clinical/hospital visits for prenatal blood and/or ultrasound screening.
