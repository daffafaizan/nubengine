      of vaginal vault. A recent meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of laparoscopic suturing
      using barbed suture or conventional sutures in myomectomy or hysterectomy revealed that
      suturing with barbed sutures was associated with less suturing time and operative time.

      Although numerous studies revealed the advantages of using barbed sutures , no studies have
      yet evaluated the use of barbed sutures in laparoscopic excision of endometrioma.

      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare operative data and early
      postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic excision of endometrioma using barbed sutures with
      those of laparoscopic excision of endometrioma using conventional sutures.
