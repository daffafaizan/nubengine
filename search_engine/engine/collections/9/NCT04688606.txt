    
      1. Screen patients with suspected liver cancer Long-term exposure to liver cancer risk
           factors (hepatitis B carriers, past history of schistosomiasis, long-term diet of
           Aspergillus food, history of liver cirrhosis, etc.), patients with liver cancer are
           initially suspected.

        2. Monitor the number of CTCs in the blood of patients with liver cancer before and after
           surgery Imaging examinations show that liver space is occupied by patients with
           suspected liver cancer. Use CTCBIOPSYÂ® technology to monitor patients' surgical
           operations (including interventional therapy, tumor resection, or liver cancer liver
           transplantation) at different times 1-3 days before, 1 month after surgery, and 6 months
           after surgery The number of CTCs in peripheral blood.

        3. To evaluate the clinical application significance of CTCs in liver cancer screening and
           postoperative recurrence monitoring in patients with liver cancer Combined with
           clinicopathology, tumor marker examination and imaging examination, clinical follow-up
           and follow-up, analyze the clinical significance of CTCs detection in liver cancer
           patients, and focus on evaluating the relationship between circulating tumor cells in
           liver cancer screening and postoperative recurrence, and establish a new The liver
           cancer prediction model improves the prognosis of liver cancer patients.
