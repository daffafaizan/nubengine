    
      This is an interventional, single arm, non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa clinical trial
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of the IMP allo-APZ2-EB in patients with RDEB.

      Patients will undergo treatment with the IMP (three repeated intravenous applications) and
      will be followed up for efficacy for 12 weeks. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-EB one
      follow-up visit at Month 12 and one follow-up visit at Month 24 post IMP applications is
      included.

      Determination of the EB linked symptoms and quality of life will be assessed by using the
      EBDASI score, the iscorEB, the change in pain and itch perception, and patient's quality of
      life in EB. The wound healing process will be documented by photography.
