      children are frequent. These errors, which include inaccurate dosing as well as nonadherence
      to medication regimens, place children at risk for morbidity and mortality. Misdosing is
      prevalent, with 50% or more of pediatric caregivers either measuring an incorrect dose or
      reporting a dose of liquid medication given outside the recommended range. Of further concern
      are reports of an overall poor adherence rate of 50% for pediatric medications, with
      implications for treatment failure and drug resistance.

      Few studies have examined strategies for decreasing medication administration errors in
      pediatric patients. Pictograms represent a promising approach in which simple diagrams are
      used to improve understanding of concepts. Pictorial-enhanced written materials have been
      shown to improve comprehension and adherence with medical directions, particularly for
      patients with low literacy.

      We developed a pictogram-based intervention to decrease dosing errors and improve adherence.
      In this study, we sought to assess whether this intervention would reduce medication dosing
      errors and improve adherence in a pediatric emergency room serving at-risk families.
