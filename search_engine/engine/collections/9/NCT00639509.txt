      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody
      IMC-A12.

      II. To determine the best overall response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this drug. II. To
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and adverse events profile of this drug in these patients.

      III. To perform a subgroup analysis to compare PFS of patients with advanced HCC who are
      hepatitis B positive/hepatitis C negative versus patients who are hepatitis B
      negative/hepatitis C positive treated with this drug.

      IV. To store pre-therapy paraffin embedded tumor tissue for future tissue-based correlative
      studies.

      V. To evaluate tumor necrotic areas using a new volumetric method of assessing non-viable
      tumor as a correlate for response.

      VI. To prospectively validate and compare the CLIP and the GDETCH staging systems and
      additional prognostic factors.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 IV over 1 hour
      once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo serum sample collection at baseline for future tissue-based correlative
      studies. Previously collected paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples are also stored for
      future correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for at least 1
      year.
