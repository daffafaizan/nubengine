      nephropathy (CAN), is diagnosed by pathologic changes involving all parts of the renal
      parenchyma and is one of the factors impacting graft survival and outcome. Currently, there
      is no standard to predict allograft fibrosis status at the time of procurement. Noninvasive
      biomarkers are necessary to monitor allograft status and to predict long-term outcomes.

      The investigators aim to conduct a multicenter prospective study to identify urinary exosomal
      biomarkers that represent the extent of graft fibrosis from deceased donor kidney
      transplantation. Urinary samples will be collected from deceased kidney donors at the time of
      procurement and zero-day kidney graft biopsy will be performed at the time of transplant. The
      zero-day biopsy tissue will be stained with Masson's Trichrome staining, Collagen I, III, IV
      immunostaining to evaluate the degree of fibrosis. Also, by ultracentrifuge, we will extract
      urinary exosomes and perform proteomics analysis and RNA-sequencing. The association between
      urinary exosomes and the degree of graft fibrosis will be analyzed to identify biomarkers
      that represent fibrosis. The correlation between these biomarkers and graft long term
      outcomes will be investigated.
