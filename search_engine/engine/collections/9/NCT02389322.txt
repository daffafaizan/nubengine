    
      1.the correlation of three detection methods for study population I

      500 study population I are randomly divided into two different dose group on average,
      according to ESAT6-CFP10 dose(5μg/ml or 10μg/ml). Do specific gamma-interferon(γ-IFN)
      detection before the skin test，then inject intradermally with 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 or 10μg/ml
      ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD at different arm of the same subject.Evaluate respectively the
      positive rate of three detection methods 、the correlation of three detection methods and the
      security of study population I after application for ESAT6-CFP10 .

      2.screen study population II

      Choose those participants, whose result of three detection (ESAT6-CFP10、TB-PPD andγ-IFN ) all
      negative, HIV negative and chest X-ray no abnormalities, into study population II.

      3.study population II vaccinate BCG or placebo

      Study population II ,according to the same proportion ,are randomly divided into four group
      in double blinded state,: 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after BCG immunization, 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10
      after BCG immunization, 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after placebo-controlled immunization , 10μg/ml
      ESAT6-CFP10 after placebo-controlled immunization.They vaccinate BCG or the placebo of BCG.

      4.Inject ESAT6-CFP10 12 weeks after inoculation in study population II

      The investigators draw blood and operate specific gamma-interferon(γ-IFN) detection before
      the skin test，then inject intradermally with 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 or 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 (in
      double blinded state) and TB-PPD at different arm of the same subject ,according to the above
      grouping scheme.

      Calculate the negative coincidence rate and the correlation of three detection methods, and
      observe the safety of ESAT6-CFP10 in study population II at the same time.Evaluate the
      specificity of different doses of ESAT6-CFP10, negative rate of ESAT6-CFP10 after vaccination
      BCG as the main index. And finally conform the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10.
