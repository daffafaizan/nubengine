      overweight and obese individuals. Although vigorous intensity may be more favorable promoting
      positive cardiac adaptations compared to low-moderate intensity, evidence of the positive
      effects of different exercise modes needs to be explored to allow for realistic comparisons
      with other strategies. Research using cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging that compares the
      effects of different modes of exercise - matched by exercise energy expenditure - on
      epicardial adipose tissue and paracardial adipose tissue, and how these interventions modify
      cardiac function and geometry have not been previously explored in obesity.
