      conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II.
      Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of radiographic tumor response, time to tumor
      progression, and survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Within 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive hyperbaric oxygen over 90 minutes
      once daily, followed by conformal radiotherapy twice daily 5 days a week for 17 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed within 2 weeks and then every 2
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
