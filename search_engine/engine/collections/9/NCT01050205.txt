      has been demonstrated in several clinical trials including a multi center clinical trial in
      the US, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The challenge for public health is to
      translate this promising and proven behavioral intervention utilized in the DPP research
      effort to the "real world", i.e., how to make it work in diverse communities in a variety of
      local settings at a reduced cost so that the maximal number of those at risk can benefit.

      The purpose of this application is to test a framework for translation of the DPP that
      includes: 1) demonstration of a training model for community health care professionals that
      includes initial training, support, and supervision in the delivery of a diabetes prevention
      curriculum and the needed behavioral lifestyle materials both initially and over time; 2)
      evaluation of a more compact and flexible DPP intervention program administered to each
      participant in a version of his or her choice (standard face-to-face group format or a DVD
      version of the same lifestyle intervention program content). These lifestyle intervention
      programs will be carried out in three different community settings; i.e. a health care
      practice, a worksite, and local centers in the community dedicated to healthy aging for older
      adults. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness analyses of the GLB intervention program in each of
      the three community settings will be tested.
