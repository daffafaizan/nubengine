    
      Primary Objective:

      To compare survival of patients treated with a combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine
      after failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) to historical survival for patients
      with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/
      myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (MDS/MPN) who are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the rate of hematologic improvement (HI) in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the complete remission (CR) and marrow CR rates in patients with
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi
           failure

        -  To determine the reduction of bone marrow blasts in patients with relapsed/refractory
           MDS or MDS/MPN treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine after DNMTi failure

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To correlate the mutation burden in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN
           with response to treatment with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To correlate genomic aberrations with rate of response and survival in
           relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN patients treated with pevonedistat and azacitidine

        -  To measure the effect of pevonedistat treatment in combination with azacitidine on
           quality of life in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS or MDS/MPN

        -  To define epigenetic biomarkers for pevonedistat use in relapsed/refractory MDS or
           MDS/MPN
