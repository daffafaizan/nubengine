      IOL at the operative visit for each eye, and up to 8 postoperative visits: Day 1-2, Day 7-14,
      and Day 30-60 after each implantation, and Day 120-180 and Day 330-420 after second eye
      implantation. The second implantation occurred within 30 days of the first.The primary eye
      was defined as the eye with higher astigmatism, with the other eye defined as the secondary
      eye. If both eyes had the same level of astigmatism, the first implanted eye was set as the
      primary eye.
