      bank of early pregnancy urine samples from the beginning of the cycle in which pregnancy is
      achieved, and throughout pregnancy.

      This generic study will be initiated to maintain the SPD sample bank, the study will run
      continuous to replenish the sample bank, as samples are used.

      To obtain these samples, volunteers wishing to become pregnant will be offered the use of a
      Clearblue ovulation prediction product to enable them to pinpoint their most fertile time and
      aid conception. Whilst on the study volunteers will be asked to collect daily urine samples
      and return them to SPD on a regular basis in addition to keeping a daily record of menstrual
      cycle details and test results. Women who become pregnant during the course of the study will
      be asked to continue collecting daily urine samples for a minimum of a further 4 weeks. Each
      volunteer will be on the study for a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 cycles. Volunteers will
      not be allowed to re-enter the study once they have completed without achieving pregnancy

      It is anticipated that any one of SPD's marketed ovulation prediction products may be used in
      this study to aid the conception rate, this may include, but not be limited to the Clearblue
      fertility monitor and Clearblue digital ovulation test.

      It is anticipated SPD will have to recruit approximately 600 volunteers to achieve each 100
      pregnancies and that approximately 500 volunteers will be participating at any one time. The
      study size may be increased or decreased to meet sample demands.
