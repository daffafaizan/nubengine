      when given with a standard multi-drug regimen. In the first part of the study, up to 18
      participants will be enrolled at different doses of MLN 9708. Once the maximally tolerated
      (highest, safest dose) is established, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled.

      Additionally, bone marrow (tissue found in the inside of bones) or stem cell transplantation
      will be given to some participants to study whether it helps to prevent ALL from returning.

      The study treatment consists of several different stages

        -  Induction

        -  Consolidation 1

        -  Or Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant (if you are eligible based on your medical
           condition and the availability of a matched stem cell donor)

        -  Or If you do not have a transplant:

             -  CNS Therapy

             -  Consolidation 2

             -  Continuation Therapy
