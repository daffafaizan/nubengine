      rFVIIa with that of PCC to increase thrombin generation in neonatal plasma after CPB. A
      pre-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) baseline blood sample will be obtained. After the
      termination of CPB and the administration of one round of protamine, platelets and fibrinogen
      (standard of care), a second blood sample will be drawn. All samples will be centrifuged to
      yield platelet rich plasma and stored until processing. In the pre-CPB sample, baseline
      thrombin generation will be measured. The post-CPB sample will be divided into three aliquots
      to measure thrombin generation under three different circumstances: the first will serve as a
      control, the second will include rFVIIa and the third PCC.
