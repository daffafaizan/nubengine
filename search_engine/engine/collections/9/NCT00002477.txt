    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen
      (e.g., carboplatin or CAP: cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin) prolongs survival in
      patients with early stage ovarian cancer compared to those receiving no adjuvant treatment.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized to Arm I or II; treatment should begin
      within 6 weeks of surgery. Regimens listed in Arm I are recommended, but other
      platinum-containing regimens are allowed provided the doses at a minimum meet those listed
      below. Arm I: Single-agent Chemotherapy or 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Carboplatin,
      CBDCA, NSC-241240; or CAP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127;
      Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875. Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,000 patients will be randomized.
