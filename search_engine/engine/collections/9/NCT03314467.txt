      for developing DR are diabetes duration, glycemic control, and hypertension. The prevalence
      ranges from 17 to 61% according to the diabetes duration.

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is very frequent in Type 2 Diabetes population,
      reaching a prevalence of 23-48%.

      Few is known about the exact role of OSAS in the development of DR. A recent study has shown
      that OSAS is an independent predictor for the progression to pre-/proliferative DR. The
      purpose of the present study is to assess if the presence of OSA in diabetic patients is a
      predictive factor for DR occurrence.
