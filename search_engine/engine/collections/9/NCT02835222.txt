      I. Assess the feasibility of adding selinexor to induction, consolidation and maintenance
      therapy of elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of administering selinexor under the proposed study regimen.

      II. To assess response and survival endpoints of patients receiving the proposed study
      regimen.

      III. To assess the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly from day 1. Treatment
      continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RE-INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients whose disease has not responded receive cytarabine IV on days
      1-5, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-2, and selinexor PO twice weekly. Treatment
      continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients in remission receive cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1,
      3 and 6, and selinexor PO twice weekly from day 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who have had a response and have not gone on to transplant
      receive selinexor PO twice weekly. Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
