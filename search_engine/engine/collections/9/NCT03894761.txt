    
      Patients who were diagnosed as rotator cuff syndrome by clinical examination and magnetic
      resonance imaging will be included in this prospective study.

      Demographic data (gender, age, education level, occupation), shoulder pain duration, history
      of trauma to the shoulder, smoking, dominant arm and diabetes will be questioned and body
      mass indexes will be calculated. Active shoulder range of motion of the patients will be
      measured by goniometer and recorded .

      Specific tests, which are important for rotator cuff lesion, will be performed to determine
      whether they are positive or not.

      Magnetic resonance imaging of the patients with shoulder pathology will be recorded.

      A visual analog scale will be used to determine the intensity of day and night pain. Shoulder
      Shoulder Pain and Disability Index to assess shoulder disability of patients, SF-36 form will
      be filled by patient to evaluate the effect of shoulder pathology and Kinesiophobia Score to
      assess the avoidance of pain induced movement.
