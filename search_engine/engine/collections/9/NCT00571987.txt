      ablation of soft tissue after the breast cancer is removed. This study seeks to remove the
      tumor and then ablate a tumor-free zone (margin) of tissue around the lumpectomy site instead
      of removing more tissue. The primary short-term goal is to obviate the need for re-excision
      in the event of close or positive margins (< 3 mm) which occurs on average in ~40 percent of
      the cases. Permanent pathology is only an estimation of margin status since 90% of
      recurrences occur at the site of the original lumpectomy. RFA ensures a sterilized margin
      regardless of the accuracy of the permanent pathology.
