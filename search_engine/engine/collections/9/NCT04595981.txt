    
      This is a single site, single arm Phase II trial pilot study to explore if chemo-embolization
      increases progression free and/or overall survival in a subpopulation of cisplatin-ineligible
      head and neck cancer patients with an acceptable morbidity rate in the U.S.
      Chemo-embolization will serve as adjuvant therapy performed in addition to standard of care
      radiation and chemo- and/or immunotherapy. Within UAB, the Investigators plan to recruit 48
      patients to implement the intervention, within a two-year period. Progression free survival
      will be assessed at 3, 6 and 24 months (if available) after intervention, which is determined
      based upon the results of follow-up Head and Neck imaging (CT or MRI) interpreted by a
      Radiologist not involved in the study, per standard of care. Overall survival will be
      reported by the patients' Oncology team on a monthly basis. The trial endpoints will form the
      basis of how PFS and OS compare to historical outcomes in a similar cohort of patients.
