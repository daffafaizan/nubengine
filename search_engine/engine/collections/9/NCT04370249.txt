      (VIRUScore), based on risk factors, clinical elements and ultrasound data. This predictive
      score corresponds to a probabilistic measure of the individual risk of aggravation and is
      intended to become the cornerstone of a decision-making algorithm for triaging/managing
      COVID-19 patients (VIRUS algorithm). Initial VIRUScore and evolution of clinical and/or
      clinico-biological signs will thus have to arbitrate different patient pathway scenarios with
      2 major objectives: first, to reduce hospital tension and desaturate emergency departments
      and COVID-19 units to ensure maximum monitoring of moderate forms, some of which are likely
      to evolve towards severe forms. The negative predictive value of severe short-term
      aggravation (H48) should therefore be maximized for these patient profiles invited to return
      home and/or transfer to non-specialized hospitals or clinics. And secondly, it should be
      sensitive in detecting and predicting the most severe forms with a high risk of resuscitative
      escalation and/or death, allowing prioritization (access to CT, access to research protocols)
      and grading the intensity of clinical surveillance, for anticipation of resuscitative
      resources.
