      disorders. The incidence is about 1:10,000 livebirths. There are 5 subgroups base on onset of
      symptoms and clinical severity. Type 1 is the most severe type which age of onset is 6 months
      old and life expectancy is less than 1-2 years. SMA carrier frequency is approximately
      1/40-1/60. Molecular genetic testing to detect copies number of SMN1 gene is possible with as
      high as 95% detection rate. Since 2008, American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and
      American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommended SMA preconceptional and
      prenatal carrier screening in general population. In Thailand, there are no standard protocol
      for SMA prenatal carrier screening.
