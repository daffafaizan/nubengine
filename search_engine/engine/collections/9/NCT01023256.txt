    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects 0.5% to 1%
      of the adult population world wide. RA primarily affects the joints and is characterized by
      chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue, which eventually leads to the destruction of
      cartilage, bone and ligaments and can cause joint deformity.

      Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), interleukin (IL)-1,
      IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which lead to the
      activation and proliferation of immune cells, are found to be increased in the inflamed
      joint. Several preclinical findings support an anti-GM-CSF therapy for RA.
