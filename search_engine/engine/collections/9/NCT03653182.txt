      previous studies, researchers usually used constitutional questionnaires to determine
      constitutions.However, the importance of tongue diagnosis and pulse diagnosis remained
      unclear. The specific aim of this study is to evaluation indices of tongue diagnosis,
      auscultative diagnosis, and pulse diagnosis in the determination of constitutions. Meeting of
      specialists will determine the characteristics for each constitution first. This study plans
      to recruit 200 volunteers and determine their constitutions by constitutional questionnaires.
      Tongue manifestations and pulse pressure waveforms will be taken at the same time by
      standardized instruments. Relations between the indices and each constitution will be
      determined by multiple linear regression and logistic regression analysis. Then the
      percentage of importance of a specific index in a specific constitutional type could be
      determine.
