      management comparable to morphine. Oxycodone is N-demethylated by CYP2D6 to its active
      metabolite oxymorphone, a potent μ-receptor agonist. A genetic polymorphism divides a
      Caucasian population into two groups: 8% with an enzyme lacking activity, poor metabolizers
      (PM) and the rest with normal CYP2D6 activity, extensive metabolizers (EM).

      Many different, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are responsible for interindividual
      differences in the effect of opioids. Among these are the A118G SNP in the μ-receptor gene
      OPRM1 and the C3435T and G2677T/A SNPs in the MDR-1 gene of P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein is
      responsible for the absorption, excretion and transport of many drugs including opioids over
      the blood-brain barrier.

      Electrical stimulation and cold pressor test are among the most well defined and evaluated
      human experimental pain models. The 32 volunteers will be submitted to the tests before and
      1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after medicine intake.

      To determine the plasma levels of Oxycodone and its metabolites blood will be drawn after
      each pain test. Also the CYP2D6 genotype and the above mentioned SNPs will be determined from
      the blood samples.
