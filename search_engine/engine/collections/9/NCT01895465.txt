      in an innovative way can shorten the waiting time parents have to endure until an urine
      sample is perceived, and accordingly, the percentage of contamination in the samples
      obtained. The innovativeness introduced is that by using an ordinary everyday diaper, which
      is found in all marketing outlets, and by making a slit in the diaper where the pediatric
      urine collecting bag can be pulled out and thus allowing parents/care takers to see straight
      away whether urine has been given and thus cut back on opening and reopening of the diaper.
