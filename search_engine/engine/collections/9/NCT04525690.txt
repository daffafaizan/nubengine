      carcinoma in the United States, but direct-acting antiviral medications are now available and
      can cure the disease in over 95% of those that are treated. The Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 75% of all chronic HCV infections in the United States are
      among adults born between 1945 and 1965. The CDC and US Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPTF) therefore recommends birth cohort screening for all adults born in this time period.
      In 2016, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania signed into law a requirement that all hospitalized
      patients born during this time period be offered HCV screening. In this study, a
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted to test the effect of
      defaulting HCV screening into the admission order set to improve screening rates.
