    
      Design and Methods: Subjects in this study of 975 pre-operative, scheduled surgical patients
      are in one of the three following groups:

        -  Group 1 (N=325): Allocation sample of surgical patients required to be MRSA screened per
           hospital SOP (including patients having a positive MRSA history, orthopedic surgery,
           undergoing dialysis, or transfer from another hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing
           facility, or jail).

        -  Group 2 (N=650): Randomized sample (1:1 ratio) of surgical patients not required to be
           MRSA screened per hospital SOP, to one of the following two groups:

             -  2a (N=325): MRSA screening; or

             -  2b (N=325): No MRSA screening. All subjects were followed for 30 days
                post-operatively to determine the incidence of post-operative infection. Treatment,
                diagnostic, and hospitalization data were collected for patients diagnosed with
                post-operative infection.
