    
      Potential subjects were screened within 21 days prior to dosing of study drug (Medisorb
      naltrexone or placebo) on Day 0. Screening evaluations included a baseline hydromorphone
      challenge session in which increasing doses of hydromorphone (0 mg [placebo], 3 mg, 4.5 mg,
      and 6 mg) were administered at hourly intervals to produce a cumulative dose-response curve.
      Throughout the 4-hour challenge period, subject-rated measures (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]
      questions) and physiological measures (ie, pupil size) were recorded.

      As a safety measure, at least 7 days after the baseline hydromorphone challenge, a naloxone
      challenge was performed followed by a 1-day oral naltrexone tolerability assessment. On Day
      0, eligible subjects were administered a single dose of study drug. To assess the level of
      opiate blockade and surmountability attributable to Medisorb naltrexone, experimental
      hydromorphone challenge sessions were conducted postdose at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56,
      with a single placebo hydromorphone challenge administered at a randomly selected visit.
      Pupil size was measured 15 minutes prior to the first hydromorphone dose and at 15, 30, 45,
      and minutes after each ascending hydromorphone/placebo for hydromorphone dose. Blood samples
      for measurement of naltrexone and 6B-naltrexol were obtained at screening and before
      hydromorphone/placebo administration on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56.

      Subjects were monitored for safety through Day 56.
