      osteoporosis could have important public health ramifications. Different food sources of
      dietary protein may have different effects on bone metabolism. Animal foods provide a dietary
      acid load that may lead to negative calcium balance and increased bone resorption. In
      contrast, vegetable sources of protein, while providing some acid due to their protein
      content, provide proportionally more base that counters the dietary acid load. The effect of
      dairy products, which are rich in animal protein but also contain potential base precursors
      not found in vegetable foods, has not been established. Finally, soy protein sources may have
      a dual benefit: soy foods provide base precursors as well as plant estrogens that may have a
      beneficial effect on bone. We are resubmitting this proposal to randomize postmenopausal
      women to one of four diets equal in calories, protein, calcium, and sodium. The diets will
      differ by having 80 percent of the protein from one of four sources: non-dairy animal,
      vegetable, dairy, or soy foods, resulting in significant differences among the diets in acid,
      base, and isoflavone content. All food will be prepared and provided by the General Clinical
      Research Center. The subjects will consume the diets for 6 weeks with measurements of
      acid-base status, isoflavone excretion, and calcium metabolism. This will be the first
      intervention study to examine the effect of different sources of dietary protein in whole
      foods on calcium metabolism. Eventually our findings could have substantial public health
      implications and provide a widely available and low risk means to help prevent osteoporosis.
