      I. To evaluate the 1-year survival of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with
      bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. To evaluate the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15; liposomal
      doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 4; oral dexamethasone 20mg on days
      1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples may be collected for future research. Patients
      complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) neurotoxicity questionnaire
      periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
