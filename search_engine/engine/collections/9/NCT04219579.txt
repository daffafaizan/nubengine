      immediate post-liver transplantation period without clear evidence regarding the optimal dose
      or administration scheme.

      The investigators retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from the patients who received
      liver transplantation and developed pharmacokinetic model of AT-III in the previous research.
      According to this study, optimal AT-III activity level will be well-maintained with smaller
      dose with continuous infusion than with intermittent infusion which is widely accepted way of
      administration currently.

      A prospective study was planned to show the more effective manner of AT-III concentrate
      administration after liver transplantation.
