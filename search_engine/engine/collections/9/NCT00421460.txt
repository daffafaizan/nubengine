    
      Hypogonadism is a pathophysiologic and clinical factor in a substantial number of patients
      with ED,and data indicate that a threshold level of testosterone is necessary for normal
      erectile function.Testosterone therapy is clearly indicated in hypogonadal patients and is
      beneficial in other patients with ED and hypogonadism.However,testosterone efficacy as
      monotherapy for ED could be limited,and combination therapy with testosterone and other ED
      treatments,such as PDE-5 inhibitors may be valuable in certain subpopulations of patients.
