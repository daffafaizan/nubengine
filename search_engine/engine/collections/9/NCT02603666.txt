      till 15 years of age are screened for liver disease annually by ultrasound (US) and also by
      biochemical markers. Ultrasound is performed every third year over 15 years of age in
      patients without CFLD, while all of them with diagnosed CFLD are continued to be investigated
      annually. Biochemical markers are controlled at least once every year in all CF patients.
      Elastography of the liver will be planned together with the investigations of the annual
      follow up, in an optimal clinical status. If either US or elastography of the liver indicates
      liver disease or progress of the already existing pathological changes, a liver biopsy will
      be performed according to routine procedure at Stockholm CF Centre. Also, historical data of
      liver biopsies and biochemical investigations will be considered in the study.

      Elastography of the liver will be performed by Fibroscan device, with transducers for
      children and adults, respectively.

      Clinical importance Liver US investigations in CF patients have important implications but
      are difficult to standardize in a routine clinical setting. Elastography may have an
      advantage in the evaluation of early fibrosis with clinical importance in pursuing
      diagnostics and intensifying treatment. A significant group (up to 25 %) of CF patients may
      be helped by this novel method. Including histological data, accuracy of elastography in CF
      patients may be improved. Further details of the importance of fatty acid status in CF may be
      elucidated.
