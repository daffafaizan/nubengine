      effectiveness of a pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients with suboptimal
      glycemic control awaiting elective cardiac surgery. Consenting patients will be randomized to
      a Standard Pre-Operative Diabetes Care Group (Group 1) and a Structured Pre-Operative
      Diabetes Optimization Group (Group 2).
