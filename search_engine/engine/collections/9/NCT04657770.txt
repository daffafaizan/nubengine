      that high doses of rehabilitation therapy can reduce disability, but many patients do not
      receive this, e.g., due to obstacles such as difficulty accessing care. The research team has
      previously found that telerehabilitation is an effective way to deliver care and improve
      outcomes. These prior studies were performed after hospital discharge, when patients were
      already back at home. The current study aims to extend this work by introducing
      telerehabilitation to the bedside of patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation
      facility. In this study, key areas of interest include issues related to, and the clinical
      effects of, telerehabilitation that is started during the rehab admission and is continued
      after discharge in the patient's home.
