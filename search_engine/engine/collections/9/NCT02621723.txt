    
      Data will be derived directly from patients, from the clinical notes of the previous
      admission and records of discharge communication. Also information from treating physicians,
      nurses and immediate caregivers will be collected. The data set will contain no directly
      identifiable variables (data will be registered by using a research code for each patient).

      Data collection will include: Hospital-related data, patient-related data, health-related
      data, time-related data, and physician related data. Also patient feedback is requested.

      After obtaining written informed consent, the researcher will ask the patient 7 questions
      about the (preventability of their) readmission. Also the patient will be asked if one of the
      direct carers can be approached with 2 questions. The carer will most often be a sibling, a
      good friend or someone from the neighborhood. We will approach the carer in person or by
      telephone, and only after explicit permission from the patient. Lastly, we will ask a doctor
      and nurse (responsible for the patient in the first 24 hours of his readmission) similar
      questions.
