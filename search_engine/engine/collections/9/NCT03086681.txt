      standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria, exclusion
      criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Nine medical centers
      participated in this study and 120 patients with pathologically confirmed Locally advanced
      cervical carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were randomly divided into two groups:
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 45-50Gy, DDP 40mg/m2, per
      week for 5cycles, Endostar: 7.5mg/m2 d1-10, repeat every 15 days, for 4 cycles) and
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( IMRT 45-50Gy, DDP 40mg/m2, per week, for 5cycles). After
      treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The treatment toxicity, local control
      rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival were
      observed and assessed.
