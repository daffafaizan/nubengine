      those with SCI and ABI. An a priori sample size of 117 individuals based on an alpha level of
      .05 and level of acceptable error at 3% was calculated. Anticipating for loss to follow up
      rate of up to 20%, a total of 142 participants will be recruited. Patients will be recruited
      among those who attend virtual medical appointments at Parkwood Institute for ABI and SCI. We
      will also liaise with SCI-Ontario and the Ontario Brain Injury Association to assist in the
      recruitment of additional participants. Those who consent will complete an online survey on
      enrollment into the study, and subsequently at 3 and 6 months. Demographic data of the
      individuals participating in the study will be recorded. Participants' access to health care
      services will be evaluated using the following subdomains: medical care, complementary care,
      medications/equipment, satisfaction/acceptability, affordability, ability to engage, and
      indirect support.
