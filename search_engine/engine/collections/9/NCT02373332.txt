      important roles in regulating platelet activation, but the underlying mechanisms have not
      been fully elucidated as well as their true protection from thrombosis.

      12-lipoxygenase inhibition prevents platelet activation in part by inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase
      oxidation of free fatty acids in the platelet. These oxidized fatty acids are known to play
      both a pro- and anti-thrombotic effect on platelets depending on the fatty acid. oxidation of
      arachidonic acid by 12-lipoxygenase results in a pro-thrombotic bioactive lipid whereas
      oxidation of the omega-6 fatty acid DGLA found in plant oil results in formation of a potent
      anti-thrombotic bioactive lipid. Determining the extent of protection from this and other
      bioactive lipids produced through 12-lipoxygenase will allow for a better understanding of
      which fatty acid supplementation may best protect from thrombosis.

      Essential fatty acids such as omega-3 (DHA/EPA) and omega-6 (DGLA) appear to be protective.
      However the underlying mechanism for this potential protection is not well understood.
      Identifying the mechanism by which these supplements protect from platelet activation may
      identify new approaches to preventing thrombotic events in this high risk population.
