      socio-cognitive functions, as it enables us to internally simulate and understand others'
      actions, emotions and intentions. Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation
      of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact
      from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social
      salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).

      Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with
      correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience
      eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the
      observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring
      processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.

      As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative
      behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal
      oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a
      neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known
      to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior. As such,
      it is regarded a promising intervention for alleviating the social and communicative deficits
      in ASD.
