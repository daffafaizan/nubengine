      protein loss leading to hypoalbuminemia and rapid clearance of infliximab (IFX). Importantly,
      2 studies have associated the loss of IFX in stool with poor outcomes. Multiple observational
      studies have identified that patients with faster IFX clearance have worse clinical outcomes
      and higher rates of antidrug antibody formation. To better understand optimal dosing of IFX
      in ASUC, the pharmacokinetics of IFX in association with outcomes must be better defined in
      this setting.
