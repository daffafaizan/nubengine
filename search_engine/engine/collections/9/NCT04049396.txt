    
      A seven-week (45-day), open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a medical
      center affiliated with the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security in Iran to study the
      impact of berberine on liver function and metabolic profiles of patients with NAFLD. Hospital
      employees who met the enrollment criteria were identified through electronic health records
      (EHRs) available in a human resource database of employee routine annual examinations. Using
      a computer-generated random-allocation sequence, eligible employees were equally assigned
      (1:1) to berberine 6.25 g per day (arm A) or no intervention (Arm B). Berberine was
      administered orally (100 g dried berberine in 5 Liter water boiled at 167Â°F until 4Liter).).
      To control the potential impact of confounders on outcome measures, and to balance the daily
      dietary and physical activity among the study groups, all participants were trained by
      skilled experts on lifestyle and behavior improvement.
