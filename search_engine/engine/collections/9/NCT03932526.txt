      advanced breast cancer; and its future therapeutic trend includes chemotherapy combined with
      molecular targeted therapy. Apatinib mesylate (Aitan), a novel small molecule anti-angiogenic
      agent, highly selectively inhibits the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor-2 tyrosine kinase. Aitan also blocks the signaling of vascular endothelial growth
      factor binding to its receptor, thereby strongly inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and exerting
      anti-tumor effect.However, a randomized controlled clinical trial of apatinib combined with
      vinorelbine for TNBC has not been reported. The objective of this study is to compare the
      therapeutic effect of vinorelbine alone or combined with apatinib mesylate for recurrent or
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who have received at least two
      regimens containing anthracyclines and taxanes.
