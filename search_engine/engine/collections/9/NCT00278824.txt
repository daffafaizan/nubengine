    
      ZARS Pharma is developing a Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug
      Delivery) Drug Delivery System to be used for the treatment of chronic and breakthrough pain.
      The Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System has been designed to provide
      long-term delivery of fentanyl for the treatment of chronic pain as well as intermittent
      increases in fentanyl concentrations for the treatment of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough
      pain is defined as a transitory exacerbation of pain that occurs on a background of otherwise
      stable pain in a patient receiving chronic opioid therapy.

      Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System has 2 components: a matrix transdermal
      fentanyl patch (the ZR-02-01 patch in doses of 25, 50, 75 and 100 mcg/hr) with corresponding
      thin film dressing (ie, overlay) and the CHADD (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery).

      The matrix transdermal fentanyl patch provides a continuous delivery of fentanyl over 72
      hours, in a manner similar to DuragesicÂ®. During a breakthrough pain episode, a CHADD unit is
      placed over (adhered to) the matrix transdermal fentanyl patch. The CHADD is a thin
      patch-like chemical heating device that generates a controlled level of heat for
      approximately 15-20 minutes. The application of heat delivers increased amounts of fentanyl
      when applied over the ZR-02-01 matrix transdermal fentanyl patch.
