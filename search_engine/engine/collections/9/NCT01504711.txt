    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy of the addition of fosaprepitant (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in
      controlling acute and delayed vomiting with the standard prophylactic anti-emetic combination
      of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving
      FOLFIRINOX (5-FU [fluorouracil], oxaliplatin and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride])
      chemotherapy.

      II. To determine the rate of complete response (no emetic episode and no rescue medication)
      in the combined acute and delayed phase from 0-120 hours after chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of nausea and vomiting in both acute (< 24 hours) and delayed
      (24- 120 hours) setting in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Follow overall survival in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine intravenously (IV) 30 minutes prior to FOLFIRINOX
      chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 months.
