    
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of Tazarotene Foam 0.1% to induce a phototoxic reaction in healthy
      adult volunteers. Approximately 40 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65
      years will be enrolled.

      Each subject will be exposed to three (3) sets of three (3) patches containing Tazarotene
      Foam, Vehicle Foam and a Blank Patch (no study product). Each patch set will be applied to
      randomized sites on the subject's back. Patch sets will be removed and evaluated after 24
      hours of exposure. The exposed patch sites will then be irradiated (exposed to light) and
      evaluated at 1 hour post irradiation and at 24, 48, and 72 hours.
