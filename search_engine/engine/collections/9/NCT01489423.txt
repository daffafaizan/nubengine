        -  To compare the pathology of primary melanomas, melanoma metastases, and post-treatment
           melanoma metastases in relation to clinical outcomes for patients receiving ipilimumab
           plus sargramostim (GM-CSF) and patients receiving ipilimumab alone.

        -  To determine the effects of the addition of systemic GM-CSF to ipilimumab on effector
           immune function in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  To determine the effects of the addition of systemic GM-CSF to ipilimumab on regulatory
           immune function in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  To determine the effects of the addition of systemic GM-CSF to ipilimumab on anti-tumor
           humoral immunity in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor tissue (from primary tumor and
      post-treatment biopsies) samples are analyzed for biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes,
      immune function, and anti-tumor humoral immunity by IHC, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, ELISPOT
      assays, and ELISA.
