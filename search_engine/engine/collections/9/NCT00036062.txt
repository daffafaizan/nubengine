      inhalation of foreign substances into the lungs, or pneumonia. The tissues and blood vessels
      in the lungs become inflamed, and the body does not receive enough oxygen. Patients with this
      condition are placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing.

      Patients entered into this study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: a
      sivelestat group or a placebo group. Once entered into the study, patients are monitored for
      up to 6 months.
