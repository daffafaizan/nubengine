      and the cervical canal, yielding a measurable angle. The first ray was placed from the
      internal os to the external os. The calipers were placed where the anterior and posterior
      walls of the cervix touch the internal and external os along the endocervical canal. If the
      cervix was curved, the first ray was also drawn from the internal os to the external os as a
      straight line. A second ray was then drawn to delineate the lower uterine segment. This ray
      was traced up the anterior uterine segment to a distance allowed by the preloaded image.
      Ideally, the second ray would reach 3cm up the lower uterine segment in order to establish an
      adequate measurement. The anterior angle in between the two rays was measured with a
      protractor. In the presence of funneling, the first ray was placed to measure the length of
      remaining cervix. The second caliper was placed from the innermost portion of measurable
      cervix and extended to the lower uterine segment. In the event that the lower uterine segment
      was found to be irregular, the second caliper was placed centrally along the segment. In the
      event of a retroverted uterus, the angle should be measured in a similar fashion with the
      first ray along the measurable cervix and the second ray traced along the lower uterine
      segment. Unlike in an anteverted or axial positioned uterus, however, the posterior side of
      the angle closer to the intrauterine contents should then be measured.
