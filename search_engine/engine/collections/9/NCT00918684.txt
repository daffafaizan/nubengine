      Prominent among aging-related changes is decline in white matter disproportionately affecting
      frontal structures.Based on previous findings, we conceptualized treatment resistance,
      disability, and executive dysfunction as clinical phenomena contributed, at least in part, by
      compromised integrity of frontal neural systems. The study focuses on frontal white matter
      abnormalities in geriatric depression and their relationship to treatment response,
      disability,and executive dysfunction.
