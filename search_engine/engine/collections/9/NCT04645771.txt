      a set of a series of clinical syndrome caused by venous reflux, common symptoms are
      heaviness, fatigue, swelling, burning sentation, itching, pain, etc.The main causes of
      superficial varicose veins are weakness of superficial vein wall, insufficiency or defect of
      vein valve closure and increased pressure inside veins.The weakness of venous wall, the
      decreasing of flexibility, venous valve defects the the poor structure, be related with
      genetic factor, belong to "primary" inferior venous valves' incomplete closure.The
      influencing factors of primary valve insufficiency include heavy physical labor, long
      standing or sitting work, obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, and chronic
      cough.Varicose veins secondary to a history of venous thrombosis of the lower extremities,
      venous system obstruction and increased venous pressure caused by circulating blood volume
      exceeding reflux load are secondary.When the valve of the great saphenous vein at the
      junction of the saphenous vein is damaged and closed incompletely, the valve function of the
      distal and perforating vein can be affected step by step, and the small saphenous vein can
      also be affected through its branch vein.Because the superficial vein wall's muscle layer is
      thin and their surrounding lackness of connective tissue, blood regurgitation can cause the
      venous lumen to thicken, tortuosity and lengthen, presenting as superficial varicose
      veins.Because of the severe venous pressure of lower extremity,the vascular permeability of
      football boots is increasing,resulting the appearance of a large number of blood capillary
      hyperplasia.Due to a large number of fibrinogen hindered the exchange between capillary and
      the surrounding tissue, the nutritional change of subcutaneous tissue occured,including skin
      pigmentation, eczema, dermatitis, subcutaneous lipid sclerosis and ulceration.

      The traditional treatments of lower extremity varicose veins,including high ligation and
      stripping of great saphenous vein,varicose vein's resection and ligation of perforating
      vein,can cause large trauma,huge pain,limitation of activity and long convalescence and
      aesthetic problems,etc.As a consequence,a variety of minimally invasive method with small
      wound,little pain and early recovery are prevalently applied in clinical, also achieved
      plenty of good therapeutic effect.According to the different mechanism of minimally invasive
      treatment, it can be divided into two categories: physical injury (laser closure,
      radiofrequency closure, microwave treatment, electrocoagulation, transparent direct rotation,
      laparoscopic great saphenous vein resection, etc.) and chemical injury (sclerosing agent
      injection).

      Clinical observation in our department found that the pain, bruising, numbness, and number of
      incisions after microwave ablation were all lower than those of traditional high position
      ligation and extraction with laser closure.

      The purpose of this study is to report a monocentricity, prospective Chinese experience using
      the ECO Varicose Veins Therapeutic Unit from ECO (Nanjing ECO Microwave System Co.Ltd) for
      Endovenous Microwave Ablation (EMA) to treat primary great and short saphenous vein reflux
      and to evaluate its safety, efficacy and life quality.
