    
      Patients aged 18 or over with active UC defined as a Mayo score > 3 with an endoscopic score
      >0 will be eligible for the study. Subjects will be excluded if they are participating in
      another clinical trial, are unable to give informed consent, have severe comorbid medical
      illness, have concomitant Clostridium difficile infection or have severe UC requiring
      hospitalization. Continued treatment with 5-ASA, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or anti-TNFα
      therapy (e.g. infliximab) will be permitted if taken at stable dose for ≥12 weeks prior to
      randomization. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to metronidazole 500mg bid,
      doxycycline 100mg bid, Terbinafine 250 mg and or identical placebos all for two weeks.
      Patients will all then receive their first FMT 1-3 days after completing their course of
      antibiotic/placebo. FMT will be administered twice per week for 8 weeks.

      Eighty active UC patients will be randomized 1:1 according to a computer generated
      randomization list. Randomization will be administered centrally at the GI Clinical Trials
      Unit to ensure concealment of allocation.

      Subjects will have a sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy if clinically indicated), physician
      assessment and complete a Mayo score, IBDQ questionnaire, EQ5D and HAD questionnaires at
      baseline. A repeat sigmoidoscopy, Mayo score, IBDQ, EQ5D and HAD questionnaires will be
      completed at 9 weeks, at exit from the study (one week after last FMT). No new medical
      therapies (e.g. corticosteroids, antibiotics, probiotics) will be permitted during the 9 week
      study period.
