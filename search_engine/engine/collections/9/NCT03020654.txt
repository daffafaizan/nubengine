      such as labyrinthitis). This causes an over-reliance on the eyes to maintain balance which
      causes disorientation in busy environments such as the supermarket. The treatment involves
      trying to desensitise the individual to visually stimulating situations. Further head and eye
      exercises are completed alongside the exposure to overcome the damage done to the balance
      system.
