      material contains a concentrated aqueous mixture of hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (37%) and
      hydroxymethoxybenzene acids (23%), sulfuric acid (28%), and water (12%).

      The investigators planned a clinical and microbiological study using the decontaminant device
      in order to destroy the dental biofilm of root canals in cases of irreversible pulpitis. The
      ability of the decontaminant device to immediately stop bleeding during canal instrumentation
      was found out accidentally during the procedures of this still unpublished trial.

      Due to this fact, the investigators were interested in evaluating the coagulation property of
      the material. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study is to describe a new approach to
      obtain hemostasis during root canal therapy using a sulfonic/sulfuric acid solution.

      A total of 15 teeth with irreversible and acute pulpitis were included in the study. After
      manual and mechanical instrumentation of the root canal, a sterile paper point was introduced
      in the canal, and a first score was given based on the blood quantity.

      The solution was used to irrigate the bleeding root canal; then a second sterile paper point
      was introduced, and the same score was assessed. The null hypothesis was that there is no
      difference in root canal bleeding before and after the use of the solution (⎧=0)
