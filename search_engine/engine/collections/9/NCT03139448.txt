      of colorectal cancer prevention. About 15 million colonoscopies were done in the United
      States in 2012. Data from United States and European countries suggest that the majority of
      investigations are performed with the aid of sedation. Since sedation can cause significant
      respiratory depression, resulting in hypoxia, especially in obese and elder populations who
      are more likely to undergo colonoscopy, usually oxygen is provided to patients via a nasal
      cannula to minimize the risk of hypoxia.

      Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has been shown to effectively relieve upper
      airway obstruction in patients with OSA as it creates a pneumatic stent in the hypopharynx
      that reduces obstruction and allows for continuous oxygenation. Nasal ventilation was also
      proven to be more effective than combined oral-nasal ventilation during induction of general
      anesthesia in adult subjects. However, it is not clear if nasal mask can be used safely for
      oxygenation and ventilation in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      The SuperNO2VA™ device is a new commercially available nasal mask that provides both nasal
      CPAP and nasal mask ventilation. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of
      oxygenation and ventilation during colonoscopy using the novel nasal mask, SuperNO2VA™, and
      standard care with nasal cannula.
