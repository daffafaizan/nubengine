    
      An open-label multicentre controlled trial randomized in 3 parallel groups (1:1:1) to assess
      the one-year superiority of bio physical inductor (C02 laser, D0 and M6, group laser)
      compared to the standard treatment currently recommended (Mucogyne, 2 times a week for one
      year, control group) in the one hand, and of chemical bio inductor (Desirial, injection of 1
      mL of hyaluronic acid in the first 3 cm of the vaginal walls, D0 and M6, HA injection group)
      compared to the control group in the other hand in BC survivors with VVA, with blinded
      primary endpoint assessment.

      The use of these innovative treatments (lasers and injections) for Vulvovaginal atrophy based
      on the bio induction and the regenerative medicine could improve the quality of the vaginal
      mucosa after breast cancer therapy and could be a new strategy for these women who cannot
      benefit from Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). The benefits expected are the improvement of
      the quality of vulvo-vaginal mucosa and the improvement of the sexual quality of life of the
      patient.
