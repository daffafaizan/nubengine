      alone or in combination with tin mesoporphyrin.

      Patients receive tin mesoporphyrin IV as a single dose. Heme arginate is administered as a
      single intravenous infusion.

      Patients are entered in cohorts of 4. Subsequent cohorts of 4 patients each receive
      escalating doses of tin mesoporphyrin in combination with 1 of 2 different dosages of heme
      arginate. Subjects must maintain a constant diet.

      Patients experiencing adverse reactions are followed as clinically indicated.
