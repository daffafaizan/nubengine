      400 mg zinc gluconate or placebo (200mg BID) for 8 weeks in addition to the standard of care.
      Clinical assessment of warts and additional standard treatment will occur every 7-10 days for
      a maximum of 8 weeks. A telephone call will occur at week 20 to determine if any of the warts
      have cleared or re-appeared. The appearance of new warts will also be noted. The proportion
      of subjects who have complete clearance of genital warts at 8 weeks will be compared between
      groups.
