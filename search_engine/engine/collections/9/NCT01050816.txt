      12 months in patients with ankle cartilage defects. In this clinical trial, 30 subjects were
      screened- 4 were excluded half way and 26 finished the trial. Full-thickness articular
      cartilage specimen was obtained from sites that do not have direct articulation within the
      ankle joint(anterior talus, anterior process of calcaneus, calcaneocuboid joint area.)
      Gel-type CHONDRON (Fibrin mixed Autologous chondrocytes) was transplanted at the defects.
      Evaluation variables were AOFAS, 100 mm VAS, HANNOVER score, self-assessment of improvement
      by the patient, MRI and arthroscopy.
