      Plasmodium falciparum strains resistant to commonly used antimalarials. Fosmidomycin was
      shown to be well tolerated and fast-acting in paediatric outpatients and adults, but late
      recrudescences preclude its use as monotherapy. Clindamycin was identified as a suitable
      combination partner following the demonstration of synergistic inhibition of plasmodial
      growth by in vitro and animal studies.

      In this study, the safety and efficacy of fosmidomycin-clindamycin (30 mg/kg plus 10 mg/kg)
      twice daily for three days is assessed in children with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria.
