      the 1940s through the late 1970s who reside in the Lake Apopka area for OCPs and for the
      auto-antibodies. In addition, questionnaires will provide insight on their health status and
      health concerns.

      The investigators will collect existing data from the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey (NHANES) which has monitored the pesticide exposure (with the exception of
      toxaphene) of people older than 8 years, so there is information on the range of
      concentrations of these chemicals in the blood of Americans. This data will be use as the
      control group for comparison with the values found for OCP concentrations.
