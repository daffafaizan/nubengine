      / the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp associated with a measure of the insulinosecretion
      thanks to a test of load in glucose IV. The coupling in the same procedure of these 2 tests
      is the Botnia clamp. We also wish to use the continuous measure of subcutaneous glucose
      during several days to estimate the reduction in the average glycemia on the fast and
      prandial periods as well as the decrease of the time spent in hyperglycemia during the day.
      This tool demonstrated its interest in type 2 diabetic population in several studies. Finally
      the current / spectro-IRM methods of imaging are now validated to quantify and measure
      exactly the importance of the steatosis, including in type 2 patients, because we know that
      it is probably the result of the insulino-resistance; We would also like to demonstrate that
      some genetic polymorphisms of proteins (polymorphisms G / T493 of the MTP, 1927 C/T of the
      receiver R1 of the adiponectin and 265 C/T of the gene of Apolipoprot√©ines A) are factors
      which can modulate the steatosis development in case of type 2 diabetes.

      In other secondary criteria we wait for an improvement of HbA1c, quality of life of type 2
      obese people with regard to the treatment by intensified Multi-injections.
