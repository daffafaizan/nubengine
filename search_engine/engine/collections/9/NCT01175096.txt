      of 10 mg RAD001 administered orally on a continuous once-daily dosing regimen in the
      treatment of advanced pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor. The neuroendocrine tumors arising from
      bronchi and lung account for 30% of all carcinoid tumors, and there are a lot of well
      differentiated adenocarcinoma, squamous cancer and large cell lung cancer with significant
      neuroendocrine carcinoma characteristics who seems had a similarly prognosis with carcinoid
      tumor. There is no effective treatment available for advanced pulmonary NETs at this time.

      The rationale for this study is based on both preclinical and clinical considerations. IGF-1
      is a known autocrine regulator of CgA secretion and cell growth in human neuroendocrine tumor
      cells (von Wichert, et al. 2000; Wulbrand, et al. 2000; Van Gompel and Chen 2004). A role for
      RAD001 as monotherapy in carcinoid and pancreatic NET is suggested by the regulatory role of
      mTOR in cell growth, metabolism and protein translation (Fingar and Blenis 2004; Vignot, et
      al. 2005) and the Novartis observation that the PI3K/mTOR pathway is activated by IGF-1 in
      carcinoid and pancreatic NET cells (von Wichert, et al. 2000; Van Gompel and Chen 2004).

      The proposed RAD001 dosage regimen is 10 mg/day in both monotherapy and combination therapy
      settings. This regimen is based both on Novartis Phase I/II studies and on results from an
      investigator-sponsored study in NET. Initial Phase I studies of the RAD001 10 mg/day schedule
      demonstrated dose limiting toxicities in 2 of 12 patients. Tolerability of this schedule was
      verified in a total of 33 patients in Phase 1 studies as well as in 12 breast cancer patients
      treated with letrozole 2.5 mg plus RAD001 10 mg/day. Pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that
      downstream effectors of mTOR are completely suppressed by RAD001 at the 10 mg/day dose. No
      increased toxicity is expected from use of RAD001 in combination with Sandostatin LAR® Depot.
      The investigator-sponsored study in NET, toxicity observed with RAD001 5 mg/day in
      combination with Sandostatin LAR® Depot was similar to that observed for RAD001 5 mg/day
      alone in Phase 1 studies (Yao, et al. 2006). Therefore a dose of RAD001 10 mg/day will be
      evaluated in this study.
