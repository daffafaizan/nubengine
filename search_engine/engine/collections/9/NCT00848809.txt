      being treated with various types of renal replacement therapy. The renal replacement
      therapies studied in this trial will be slow-low efficiency daily (SLED) dialysis and
      intermittent hemodialysis. This data will be collected and plotted for vancomycin for each
      dialysis mechanism utilized and plotted on drug concentration versus time graphs to determine
      drug clearance in each type of renal replacement therapy. Subjects will have blood samples
      drawn and sent to the laboratory according to the dialysis method studied (9 for SLED
      dialysis and 10 samples for intermittent hemodialysis). Serial levels will be drawn prior to
      the drug being administered and after the drug is infused to assess the clearance and
      distribution of vancomycin. Study drug levels will be drawn from blood that is already
      available in the laboratory when timing of such samples is appropriate, in order to limit the
      amount of blood that is drawn from each study subject. A total of 30 milliliters of blood
      will be collected from each subject for any one study arm they fit into. Blood will be
      collected no more than two times per week and only more than once in a particular patient if
      their dialysis regimen changes. A single particular subject will only be able to supply blood
      samples once for each dialysis regimen being studied. This study would allow for the data
      collection of vancomycin levels at several time points during renal replacement therapy to
      assess the pharmacokinetic parameters associated with vancomycin dosing in each specialized
      patient-dialysis combination.
