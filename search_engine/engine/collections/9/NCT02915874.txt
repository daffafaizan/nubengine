      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) will improve vascular function, inflammation, mSNA, and oxidant
      stress.

      The investigation also explore other secondary endpoints related to oxidant stress and
      inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. If anxiety increases inflammation, then we
      predict that ACT will reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produce a phenotype
      of endothelial cell proteins reflecting decreased inflammation compared to pre-treatment. And
      if anxiety increases oxidative stress, then ACT should produce a phenotype of endothelial
      cell proteins reflecting decreased oxidant stress and increased nitric oxide synthase
      activity.
