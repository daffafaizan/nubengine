      study is to: (1) use Rasch methodology to assess the reliability, construct validity, and
      overall appropriateness of test score interpretation of 5 shoulder-related patient reported
      outcome measures in patients experiencing shoulder dysfunction following neck dissection
      surgery for head and neck cancer; and (2) based on these findings, provide recommendations of
      which patient reported outcome measure or combination of measures most accurately reflects
      shoulder disability in patients who experience shoulder dysfunction following neck dissection
      surgery. Two-hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited during regularly scheduled clinical
      visits at Mayo Clinic. Subjects will complete five shoulder-related patient reported outcome
      measures on only one occasion, therefore subjects will be responsible for study participation
      only at the time of enrollment and same day completion of study-related documents. Upon the
      conclusion of data collection, Rasch analysis will be utilized to analyze data related to the
      research objectives, and descriptive statistics will be utilized to describe the sample.
