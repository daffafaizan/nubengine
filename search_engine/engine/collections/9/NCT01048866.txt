      instructed to suck 1 sugar-based, flavoured flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge or 1 sugar-based,
      flavoured matching vehicle control/placebo lozenge and remained at the study center for a
      2-hour observation period to assess their responses to the study medication during the
      initial 2-hour post-dose period. Patients were allowed a dose of rescue medication
      (acetaminophen 650mg), as needed, post-treatment dosing during the study.

      After the initial 2 hours in the research center, patients were discharged with an outpatient
      diary to continue (while awake) to document hourly assessments of Sore Throat Pain Intensity
      Scale (STPIS), Difficulty Swallowing Scale (DSS), and Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS) through 24
      hours. They used the assigned lozenges as needed every 3-6 hours, up to 5 lozenges over 24
      hours. A Follow-Up Visit was conducted for the 24-hour assessments.

      Patients received additional study lozenges for use as needed (up to 5 lozenges per 24 hours)
      over the following 6 days, rescue medication (acetaminophen 650 mg) and a Diary to document
      their safety and efficacy assessments immediately before and postdose after each as-needed
      use of a lozenge for the remaining days in the 7-day treatment period. At the end of the
      7-day trial, patients returned to the research center for final assessments, review of
      adverse events over the week, and discharge from the study.
