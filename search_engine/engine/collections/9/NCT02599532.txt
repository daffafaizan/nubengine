      with nephrotic syndrome are known to be hypercoaguable with increased incidence of venous
      thromboembolism necessitating anticoagulation. While classically warfarin has been used as an
      anticoagulant in NS, newer oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, are increasingly used to
      treat venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the general population. It is unknown how
      hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban.

      This will be a parallel arm, single-dose pilot study of the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in
      adults with nephrotic syndrome. Goal enrollment of twenty subjects with non-diabetic
      nephropathy who have nephrotic-range proteinuria, defined as >3.5g/24 hours or UPC >3.5 and
      ten healthy control subjects without nephrotic syndrome. Each subject will be administered a
      single dose of apixaban 10 mg. Plasma drug concentration level and plasma anti-Xa activity
      levels will be measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours after drug administration in order
      to determine the maximum plasma concentration of apixaban, area under the curve, and
      half-life of apixaban in the setting of hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria due to nephrotic
      syndrome. Apixaban levels will be measured via liquid-chromatography spectrometry mass.
      Additionally, thrombin generation will be measured at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours.
