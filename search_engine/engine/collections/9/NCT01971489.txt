    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities, maximally tolerated dose, and identify the
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of BKM120 (buparlisib), gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride), and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe safety and tolerability of the combination of BKM120, gemcitabine, and
      cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy with this combination. III. To describe any
      pharmacokinetic (PK) effect of gemcitabine and cisplatin on the plasma concentrations of
      BKM120.

      IV. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutations as predictive biomarkers of efficacy for the combination.

      V. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms and polymorphisms in BKM120 transport and metabolism as
      predictors of toxicity and/or efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
