      complicated grief (CG). Study design: randomized controlled trial. Setting: Institute of
      Psychiatry-FMUSP (Ipq-FMUSP). Subjects: cases: patients seeking for treatment or under
      treatment for CG (Group 1), and patients with normal grief (Group 2). Controls: Hospital
      staff at the HC-FMUSP or volunteers from a list of other studies conducted at the Ipq-FMUSP
      (Group 3). Method. Psychiatric evaluation: Structured Clinical Interview (SCID), Texas
      Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG) and clinical interview. Intervention: instruction of oral
      hygiene. Dental evaluation: probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing,
      and frequency of plaque at six sites per tooth. Procedures: all participants will complete
      the psychiatry and dental evaluation at baseline. The bleeding on probing and frequency of
      plaque will be recorded at baseline, once a week (1 month follow-up) and at 3 months. The
      probing depth and clinical attachment level will be recorded at baseline and at 3 months.
      After 3 months, the patients will be referred for dental treatment.
