      Intermittent bolus of 100 mcg, or continuous infusion of 100 mcg/min. The infusion will
      contain either phenylephrine or normal saline (placebo). Subjects who are randomized to
      receive a bolus dose will receive placebo in the infusion. Subjects who are randomized to
      receive the phenylephrine infusion will have normal saline (placebo) in the bolus syringe.
      Baseline blood pressures will be obtained prior to surgery and then maintained using these
      drugs. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored as usual standard of care. Continuous
      cardiac output and hemodynamic monitoring will be obtained using CNAP (Tm) or similar
      (equivalent) monitoring device. Blood pressure will be maintained at 90-120% of baseline
      utilizing infusion and/or bolus with the 3 regimens.
