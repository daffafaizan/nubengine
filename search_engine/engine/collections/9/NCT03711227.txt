      prepopulated bundle includes an initial and 24 hour procalcitonin level, much like the
      current initial and 4 hour lactate orders are set-up. These patients will receive treatment
      for their pneumonia as is deemed appropriate by their care teams, both in the Emergency
      Department and while an inpatient. Then, after discharge, the 30 day mortality, length of
      stay, choice of antibiotic therapy, and qSOFA score (which will be retroactively calculated)
      will be compared to the patient's initial and 24 hour procalcitonin level.
