        -  Compare the quality of life of patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic
           cancer treated with gemcitabine with or without dalteparin.

        -  Compare the survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of venous thromboembolic complications in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of dalteparin, in terms of bleeding complications, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (unresectable nonmetastatic vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-7 for the
           first course only. Beginning on week 9, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
           once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment then repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine as in arm I and dalteparin subcutaneously once
           daily for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks during study therapy.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 40 months.
