      disorder. Treatment with standard pharmacologic agents may worsen mood problems or lead to
      drug dependency. Inositol has shown benefits for bipolar depression in adults. This is an
      open multi-case control study. The investigators will enroll 20 children and adolescents ages
      8-17 treated at the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Services (CABS) at Western Psychiatric
      Institute and Clinic. Participants' involvement will be 14 weeks, including the initial
      titration of the supplement, maintenance, and taper. Primary outcomes will include standard
      measures of mood and anxiety. Also, physiologic measures including body mass index and
      bedside glucose will be followed.
