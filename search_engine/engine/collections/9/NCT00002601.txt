      and doxorubicin followed by melphalan and cisplatin, each followed by autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell support, in patients with high-risk or advanced sarcomas. II. Determine the
      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine response rate and
      disease-free and overall survival in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Beginning at least 4 weeks prior to the start of chemotherapy, patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) harvesting. Beginning 5 days after the start of G-CSF, PBSCs are collected over
      several days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.
      Regimen A: Patients receive high-dose ifosfamide IV and doxorubicin IV continuously over 96
      hours on days -8 to -4. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day -2 and 37.5% are
      reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Regimen B: Beginning at least 4 weeks after day 1 of Regimen A, patients
      receive high-dose melphalan IV followed immediately by cisplatin IV on days -11 and -4.
      Patients receive G-CSF IV on days -10 to -6. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on
      day -3 and the remaining 37.5% are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning on
      day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year,
      every 3 months for 1 year, and then as needed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
