      diagnosed previously with severe AS will choose an envelope which determines the treatment
      method. There will be 60 envelops assigning for the groups mixed together in one box. This
      will ensure a randomized allocation of patients to either group of this study.

      Hysteroscopy adhesiolysis will be done to all participants in the study. in the first group,
      Adhesiolysis will be followed by intrauterine use of PRP then insertion of intrauterine Foley
      balloon catheter that will be inflated and left for 2 weeks. in the second group,
      adhesiolysis will be followed by insertion of intrauterine Foley balloon catheter covered by
      freeze-dried amniotic graft and will be inflated and left for 2 weeks. In the third group,
      Adhesiolysis will be followed by insertion of intrauterine Foley balloon catheter that will
      be inflated and left for 2 weeks. All patients will be given antibiotics and hormonal
      treatment. Also, they will be given low dose aspirin and sildenafil 50mg daily.
