      following pathological factors were recruited: lymph node metastases (LNM), positive
      parametrium or margins (PPM), lymphatic vascular space involvement (LVSI), deep invasion of
      cervical stromal (DIS). Eligible patients were randomized to three groups. Group A underwent
      50 GY RT alone. Group B received concurrent weekly cisplatin and RT. Group C received
      paclitaxel and bolus cisplatin every three weeks for two cycles before RT, followed by two
      cycles.

      We have recruited 800 patients till November 2014.
