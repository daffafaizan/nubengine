      and well-tolerated dose. This study looked at the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      properties (how the drug moves throughout the body) of the drug and safety (lab results and
      side effects) in people who took TAK-438.

      This study was designed to consist of 4 sequential substudies: a single rising dose study
      (Cohorts 1 to 7), a food-effect study (Cohort 8), a multiple rising dose study (Cohorts 9 to
      11), and a Japanese bridging study (Cohort 12). However, the protocol was halted during the
      food effect study (Cohort 8) following the discovery of previously unidentified metabolites
      and as a result, the multiple rising dose (Cohorts 9-11) and ethnicity (Cohort 12) studies
      were not carried out.

      The study population for each of Cohorts 1 to 7 consisted of 9 subjects; with 6 subjects
      randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-438, and 3 subjects to receive placebo. Subjects
      in Cohorts 1 to 7 received a single dose of study drug after a 10-hour fast. The starting
      dose was 1 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 20, 15, 40, and 30 mg.

      In Cohort 8 the plan was to assign 12 participants in a 2-sequence, 2-period crossover
      design. Six participants were to receive a single dose of TAK-438 on Day 1, in the fasted
      state, followed by a second single dose of TAK-438 on Day 15 in the alternative fed state.
      The other 6 participants were to receive the study drug like-wise but in the fed then fasted
      state.

      To investigate the effect of multiple dosing, a further 3 cohorts (Cohorts 9-11), each
      comprising 12 participants were to be introduced to the protocol following completion of the
      single rising dose study. A final cohort, Cohort 12, consisting of 24 Western participants
      and 24 Japanese participants was to be used to assess the effect of TAK-438 and esomeprazole
      on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pH of the stomach between these 2 ethnic
      groups.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in the United Kingdom.
