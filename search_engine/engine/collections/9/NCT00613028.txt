      either daily temozolomide/etoposide among GBM pts w progressive disease following bev +
      irinotecan. About 48 participants w recurrent GBM will take part in this study. Approximately
      24 participants will receive bev plus temozolomide & approximately 24 will receive bev +
      etoposide. Pts must have confirmed diagnosis of GBM & radiographic evidence of recurrence
      following prior therapy bev + irinotecan. 24 pts will be enrolled onto each arm of this
      single-stage study. If 4 or more of these 24 pts live 6/more months without disease
      progression, treatment regimen will be considered worthy of further investigation. Otherwise,
      treatment regimen will be determined not worthy of further investigation within pt
      population. Type I & II error rates associated w testing are 0.030 & 0.115 respectively.
      Management guidelines dose reduction/interruption for temo, etoposide, & bev.
