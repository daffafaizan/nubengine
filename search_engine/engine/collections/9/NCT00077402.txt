      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of fenretinide, in terms of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
           response rate, in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone-refractory prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with identifiable soft tissue disease
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of PSA response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine PSA progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine self-rated symptoms, functions, attitudes to oral therapy, and quality of life
           of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each course, and at the end of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
