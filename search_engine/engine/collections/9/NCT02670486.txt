      urodynamic evaluation (UDE), is presumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of overactive
      bladder syndrome (OAB) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI). However, the mechanism of DO is
      not fully understood and the detection rate of DO on UDE is low. Currently there is limited
      data in the literature investigating audiovisual stimulation of DO. To improve the
      understanding of the neural regulation of micturition, the investigators propose adding an
      audiovisual stimulant to standard UDE. Methods: 218 women with OAB and/or UUI undergoing UDE
      will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized to standard care versus standard care with the
      addition of an audiovisual stimulant, involving the patient listening to running water and
      watching a video of several well-known triggers. The primary outcome will be proportion of
      patients in whom detrusor contractions are seen. Secondary outcomes will include number,
      amplitude and length of contractions and presence of incontinence associated with a
      contraction. The objective of this study is to estimate the effect of adding audiovisual cues
      during UDE on the proportion of patients in whom DO is detected compared to standard clinical
      care. The hypothesis is that the proportion of patients in whom detrusor contractions are
      seen will be higher in female patients with OAB symptoms and/or UUI using an audiovisual
      stimulant. Data obtained will be analyzed by chi square, t-tests, and multivariable logistic
      regression analysis as appropriate.
