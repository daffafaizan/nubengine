    
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the ICU triage practices of clinicians at MD
      Anderson Cancer Center using the standard Society of Critical Care Medicine Prioritization
      Model (SCCMP) versus a uniquely designed flowchart-based triage tool created specifically for
      the oncologic setting.

      Study participants will initially receive either an email explaining the study and asking if
      they would agree to participate in the survey, or a hard copy of an identical letter. Their
      participation will remain anonymous, and will strictly be on a volunteer basis. If the
      participant wishes to participate, they will be given either a link to the survey using an
      institutionally improved electronic survey tool, or alternatively a hard copy of the survey
      with identical instructions.

      The survey consists of 15 fictional patient case scenarios, and participants will be asked to
      use the modified SCCMP to prioritize each patient scenario into one of the 5-point
      likert-scale categories for admission. The participants will be randomized with 1:1 ratio to
      use either a) the standard SCCMP or b) the SCCMP in addition to a newly designed
      flowchart-based triage guide to prioritize each patient case scenario into one of the 5-point
      likert-scale categories.
