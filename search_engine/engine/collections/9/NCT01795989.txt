      evaluated/demonstrated in two phases. Patient safety and image quality will be
      evaluated/demonstrated in Phase One by collecting images on healthy participants using a
      combination of the existing commercially available coils and the new coils. Clinical
      efficacy/equivalence will be evaluated/demonstrated in Phase Two by collecting standard MRI
      exams in pediatric patients. In Phase Two, the imaging data for a given patient will be
      collected by one of the two following scenarios : 1) the clinically ordered exams will be
      completed using a combination of the existing commercially available coils and new coil, with
      the images from each directly compared, or 2) the clinically ordered scans will be collected
      using one of the new coils and the images compared to historical de-identified MR exam, age
      and gender matched patient data (which were acquired using the existing commercially
      available coils). Results of Phase One will be reported to the IRB. Phase Two will not begin
      until the IRB has reviewed the results of Phase One and approved the commencement of Phase
      Two.
