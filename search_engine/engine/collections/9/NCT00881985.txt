      concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes. Resistant hypertension is
      defined in order to identify patients who are at risk of having secondary causes of
      hypertension, and who may benefit from specific diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
      Despite the fact that OSA is listed as one of the causes of resistant HT , paucity of works
      has demonstrated the magnitude of problems of untreated OSA in subjects with resistant HT.
      There is so far two study demonstrating the beneficial effect of CPAP treatment in subjects
      with resistant HT, though both studies were flawed by not including the control group, no
      randomization and limited sample size. We aim at conducting a randomized controlled study to
      explore the beneficial effect of CPAP treatment in subjects with OSA and resistant
      hypertension.
