    
      -  To study the effect of preemptive therapy with IV ganciclovir and PO valganciclovir as
           determined by quantitative CMV PCR.

        -  To determine the incidence of CMV disease and CMV related mortality following preemptive
           treatment with oral valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir.

        -  To compare the incidence of recurrent CMV viremia after treatment with PO valganciclovir
           to that seen after treatment with IV ganciclovir.

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of valganciclovir.

        -  To screen for mutations in the UL97 gene in patients who have increasing CMV viral loads
           after 14 days of treatment.

        -  To determine if patients treated with PO valganciclovir have ganciclovir drug levels
           which are equivalent to those seen in historical control subjects treated with PO
           valganciclovir.
