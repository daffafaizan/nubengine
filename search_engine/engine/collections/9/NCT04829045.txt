    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled and parallel design trial.
      Participants will be randomized to either acupuncture (n=30) or placebo (n=30) using a 1:1
      ratio. The permuted blocks with a block size of 2 will be used. Both groups will continue
      with their routine diabetes care. Primary outcome of HOMA-IR and secondary outcomes of HRQoL,
      body mass index and waist circumference will be measured at the time of recruitment
      (baseline), after completion of 5 sessions (week 3/4) and 10 sessions (week 7) of the
      treatment. Any adverse event will be recorded at every visit. The sequence generation and
      allocation will remain concealed from the patient and practitioner
