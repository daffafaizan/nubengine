      detectable and/or rising PSA after radical prostatectomy may be offered radiation. An
      increasing number of patients are being referred post-operatively for radiotherapy, which
      creates an added burden on radiotherapy departments. Therefore, a strategy that could
      potentially decrease the number of radiotherapy fractions, yet maintain its efficacy, would
      be highly desirable for patient convenience, cost saving, and resource utilization as long as
      the toxicity profile is acceptable. This study will be conducted to asses the toxicity and
      efficacy of Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in post-prostatectomy patients.
