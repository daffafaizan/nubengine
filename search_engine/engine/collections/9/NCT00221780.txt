      symptoms and mortality in heart failure patients. However, very few is known about the
      importance of the left ventricular pacing site.

      Design. Single-blind, monocentric, randomized cross-over study comparing 11 left ventricular
      pacing sites in a random order.

      Intervention. Left ventricular DDD pacing on 11 ventricular sites, prior to the implantation.
      At each pacing site, a control hemodynamics will be obtained in AAI pacing at the same pacing
      rate. At each pacing site, 2 AV delays, a short and a long one, will be assessed.

      Eligibility criteria. Patients referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy for heart
      failure

      Outcomes. Hemodynamic measures using pressure-volume catheters.
