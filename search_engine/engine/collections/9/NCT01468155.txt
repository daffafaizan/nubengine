      to the ablation procedure. If patients were already on warfarin therapy, then warfarin should
      be stopped for a minimum of 2 days prior to Dabigatran initiation, when the INR is less than
      2. Patients will remain on the same dose of Dabigatran until the day before ablation. On the
      day prior to ablation, patients will not take any Dabigatran, nor will any be taken on the
      day of ablation, until after sheath removal.

      For patients in high-risk groups for bleeding, the lower dose of Dabigatran may be used, or
      the drug may be stopped further in advance of the procedure. For patients with age greater
      than 80 years old, the lower dose of Dabigatran (110 mg BID) may be used as an alternative.
      For patients with impaired renal function, the lower dose may be used, but the drug may be
      stopped earlier in advance of the procedure as per the suggestions in Appendix A.

      Post-ablation, Dabigatran will be started at the same dose - either 150 mg or 110 mg - as
      before the ablation procedure. Dabigatran will be initiated 8 hours post sheath removal and
      continue twice daily until the three month follow-up.
