      morbidity and mortality. Beside chronic respiratory insufficiency, necessitating a
      ventilatory support, mostly performed by non-invasive ventilation (NIV), cough is impaired
      due to the muscle weakness, and respiratory physiotherapy becomes an essential part of the
      management.

      Various techniques have been proposed to improve lung recruitment and cough in neuromuscular
      patients. The assisted techniques based on a positive pressure insufflation maneuver have
      shown an improvement in physiological variables on the short term, but there is to date no
      good-quality prospective study allowing to evaluate the long term efficacy of mechanical
      cough assistance devices in neuromuscular patients.

      We designed a randomized, cross over, open label study to assess the long-term effect of LIAM
      (Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver) on respiratory performance in NIV patients suffering from
      neuromuscular disease.
