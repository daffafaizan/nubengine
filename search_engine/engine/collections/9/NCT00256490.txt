      after the first cycle of chemotherapy, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy and then 12 weeks after
      the end of the treatments. The only additional test performed in this study compared to the
      regular follow-up of patients that are not in this study is the PET/CT exam after the first
      cycle. Your participation in this study will not affect treatment since the results of the
      first PET/CT test will not be communicated. All other tests results will be available in the
      medical record.
