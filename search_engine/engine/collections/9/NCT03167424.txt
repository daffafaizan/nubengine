      and drug-coated balloons (DCB) are considered as the strategies of choice in this setting.
      However, existing data about ISR of BVS are scarce (isolated cases and retrospective series
      with very few patients) on the incidence, predisposing factors, pathophysiology, treatment,
      and long-term prognosis of these patients. In this sense, a prospective Spanish registry of
      patients with ISR of DVB can obtain a very relevant clinical information that allows us to
      advance in our knowledge about this phenomenon that helps to prevent it and to treat it in
      the safest and most effective way possible.

      Clinical events will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Event Committee.
