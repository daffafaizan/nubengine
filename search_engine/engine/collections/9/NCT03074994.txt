    
      Patients scheduled for unilateral primary TKA; 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive
      peri-articular TXA, intraarticular TXA and control group. 36 patients received either: (I) 15
      mg/kg peri-articular TXA combined with multimodal local anesthetic infiltration (bupivacaine,
      morphine, ketorolac and epinephrine) into the anterior soft tissue, medial gutter area,
      lateral gutter area prior to capsular closure and tourniquet deflation (group 1). (II) 2 g of
      intraarticular TXA after complete capsular closure just before tourniquet deflation (group
      2). (III) Don't receive any route of TXA in control group (group 3). Hemoglobin (Hb)
      concentrations were measured at 24 and 48 hour, and the number of blood transfusions and knee
      circumference measurements were recorded. Serum TXA was recorded at 2 and 24 hours after
      operation. The reviewers were blinded to treatment group.
