    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the hypothesis that combination biotherapy with aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept) and
      high-dose (HD) interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin) will improve the progression-free survival
      compared to HD IL-2 alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of aflibercept
      and HD IL-2 as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
      version 1.1 and compare to results of HD IL-2 alone.

      II. Evaluate the toxicities and tolerance of combination biotherapy with aflibercept and HD
      IL-2 and maintenance aflibercept alone in this patient population and compare to HD-IL2
      alone.

      III. Test the hypotheses related to the laboratory correlative studies. IV. Evaluate the
      overall survival of patients treated with aflibercept and HD IL-2 and HD IL-2 alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over at least 1 hour on day 1 of
      weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 (and in week 9 of course 1 only) and high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15
      minutes every 8 hours for 5 days in weeks 1 and 3 (and in weeks 3 and 5 of course 1 only).
      Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising ziv-aflibercept
      IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for 5 days in
      weeks 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 5 years.
