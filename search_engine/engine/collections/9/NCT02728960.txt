      examination of TBI participants and normal control participants through MRI (Without
      Contrast) scanning. Normal controls are essential to develop a statistically sound range for
      the metrics derived from High Definition Fiber Tracking (HDFT). TBI subjects will undergo 1
      MRI scan and normal controls will be asked to undergo 1 MRI scan. The study will involve
      blinded evaluations of results to determine the ability of HDFT imaging methods to evaluate
      TBI.

      In addition to the TBI and normal controls evaluated in this research study, investigators
      will be running 30 pilot participants. These participants will be undergoing MRI in order to
      streamline our pulse sequence and calibrate the MRIs. This is part of the technical
      development for the project and will occur before the recruitment of TBI subjects and normal
      controls for comparison. Data from the pilot subjects will not serve as control data for the
      TBI subjects.
