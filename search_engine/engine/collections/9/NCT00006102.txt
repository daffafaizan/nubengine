      I. Determine the response in children with solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated
      with rebeccamycin analogue.

      II. Determine and maintain a plasma concentration of at least 5 Âµg/mL of this drug in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients with solid tumors are stratified according to tumor histology (neuroblastoma vs
      Ewing's sarcoma [closed to accrual as of 5/19/03]/peripheral primative neuroectodermal tumor
      [PNET] vs osteosarcoma [closed to accrual as of 5/19/03] vs rhabdomyosarcoma vs non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma vs other solid tumors). Patients with CNS tumors are stratified according to tumor
      histology (medulloblastoma/PNET vs ependymoma vs brainstem glioma vs other CNS tumors).

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21
      days for a total of 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.
