      associated with adverse clinical outcomes.END is a heterogeneous complex of
      pathophysiological and clinical entities. Despite some straight forward causes, DWI lesion
      growth is reportedly a primary underlying mechanism. Early recognition of END risk would
      allow for timely identification and proper intervention, improving stroke health care.

      Thromboelastography (TEG) measures the coagulation process from initial clotting cascade to
      clot strength, providing an integrated picture of two separate but simultaneously occuring
      components of coagulation, thrombosis and lysis. It has been reported to be associated with
      short and long-term outcome in patients with trauma, coronary artery diseases , pulmonary
      embolism and, most recently, stroke prevention.The purposes of this study is to evaluate how
      effective TEG is on predicting END, by producing a range of TEG values correlated with
      clinical and radiological assessment.
