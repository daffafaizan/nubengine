      African-American caregivers are most often middle aged adult children of AD patients (vs.
      spouses), women, and are at higher risk for chronic health problems. AD lifestyle
      interventions offer an alternative to medication, and are generally affordable, accessible,
      and adaptable to the lives of caregivers. To date, most non-pharmaceutical interventions have
      focused on exercise and nutrition, both of which have proven to be highly successful in
      conferring AD related benefits and decreasing AD risk.

      The goal of the project is to determine the extent to which indices of inflammatory
      biomarkers, cognition and mood, are influenced by a partnered, dance-based intervention vs
      control condition in African American (AA) female family caregivers, at high risk for
      Alzheimer's disease.
