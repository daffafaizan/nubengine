      interplay between respiratory muscles and intrinsic pulmonary function to maintain adequate
      ventilation. In the absence of respiratory muscle activation, pressure gradients cannot be
      developed and air exchange at the alveolar surface cannot occur. Thus, any impairment in
      respiratory muscle performance can lead to pulmonary dysfunction, respiratory distress and
      even death. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a primary disorder of the central nervous system that
      often affects motor pathways, causing diminished muscle strength and endurance throughout the
      body including the ventilatory muscles. Respiratory complications are recognized as the major
      cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with advanced MS. The investigators' research
      team has over 15 years of experience using Functional Magnetic Stimulation (FMS) for
      stimulating nerves and muscles below the level of injury in patients with chronic SCI; and
      has also demonstrated significant benefit for improving respiratory muscles, bladder and
      bowel functions. In this study, the investigators will investigate the efficacy of using FMS
      technique for respiratory muscle conditioning in patients with multiple sclerosis; and will
      compare the results of the expired functions (volume, pressure, and flow) generated by using
      the FMS technique with data obtained from using the resistive expiratory muscle training
      (REMT) methodology.
