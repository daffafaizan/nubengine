      pancreatic head and neck, and for selected patients with chronic pancreatitis. A
      postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a severe and frequent complication that may lead
      to a potentially letal arrosion hemorrhage from the stump of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA).
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the prophylactic wrapping of the GDA stump using the
      falciform hepatic ligament during the index operation. The null hypothesis is that
      prophylactic wrapping does not decrease the incidence of arrosion hemorrhage from the GDA
      stump. The study is designed as a randomized, single-blinded, controlled, multicenter trial.
