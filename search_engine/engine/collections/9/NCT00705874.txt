    
      This study will use a dose escalation design to determine the MTD of CGC-11047 when used in
      individual combinations with gemcitabine, or docetaxel, or bevacizumab, or erlotinib or
      cisplatin or 5-flurouracil or sunitinib in one of 7 treatment arms. The dose of CGC-11047
      will be escalated in cohorts of 3 patients and dose escalation can proceed in each treatment
      group independent of dose escalation in the other treatment groups. CGC-11047 will be
      administered IV over 60 minutes and the doses of gemcitabine, docetaxel, bevacizumab,
      cisplatin, 5-flurouracil or sunitinib will remain fixed according to their respective product
      labeling.
