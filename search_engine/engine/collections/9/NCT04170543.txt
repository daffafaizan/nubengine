    
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of MEDI3506 on top of standard of care,
      including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
      (ARBs) and dapagliflozin in adult subjects with diabetic kidney disease, defined as subjects
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of
      25-75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a UACR in the range of 100-3000 mg/g, who meet all eligibility
      criteria. Approximately 565 subjects, among multiple countries will be randomized to MEDI3506
      dose 1, 2, 3 or dose 4, or placebo during a treatment period of 24 weeks. All subjects will
      receive Dapagliflozin daily, as administered orally from Day 85 to Day 168. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the effect of MEDI3506 on albuminuria in subjects with DKD.
      Secondary objectives include evaluating safety, PK and the incidence of ADA during the
      treatment period.
