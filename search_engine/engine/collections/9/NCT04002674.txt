    
      A phase II randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study will be performed to evaluate
      the impact of Nilotinib (Tasigna®, AMN107, Novartis, Switzerland) on safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in patients with Dementia with Lewy
      Bodies. Sixty ( 60) participants will be recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo (arm
      1) or 200 mg Nilotinib (arm 2).This study will be conducted in DLB patients with 2.5≥Hoehn &
      Yahr≤3 and UPDRS I-III ≤50 and 15≥UPDRS III (motor) ≥40 (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Score)and MoCA≥18(Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Eligible participants must be stable on
      MAO-B inhibitors (Rasageline or Selegeline) for 4 weeks and must not be on ≥800mg Levodopa
      daily. Participants must be stable on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and other medications
      for at least 6 weeks. Participants will be treated for 6 months and monitored every month ( 4
      weeks) in a total of 9 visits that include screening , baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months
      follow up and 7 month washout. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected at
      baseline and at 6 months to determine Nilotinib effects on CSF biomarkers.
