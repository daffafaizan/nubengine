    
      The methodology used will be a retrospective non interventional study of the cohorts of
      paediatric patients having had one or more ileostomies performed in one of the surgical
      centers participating in this study, between 2007, january the 1st and 2019, august the 31th.

      The main outcome will be the duration (days) between full refunctionalization of the bowel in
      the groups of conventional ileostomy or ostomy in continuity, as assessed by the end of
      parenteral nutrition or the closure of the stoma.

      Secondary outcomes will include (1) the number and type of complications directly related to
      the stoma and/or to intestinal complications; (2) the comparison of the results obtained by
      Santulli and Bishop-Koop ileostomies; (3) a sub-group analysis of the outcomes in the
      different underlying pathologies.
