      increasing the socio-economic problem. Depending on the reason for the dysfunction, various
      classifications describing the level of advancement are used. The literature on the subject
      commonly uses the division into protrusion and extrusion of the intervertebral disc, as
      approved by the American Society of Neuroradiology.

      The lumbopelvic kinematics, including gait and daily living activities, can be affected by
      the LDH: protrusion or extrusion. This pathology may be different due to the direction of
      disc migration: centre, left, right or all mentioned. Therefore, we believe that from the
      different direction of the disc migration the different symptoms can be observed.
