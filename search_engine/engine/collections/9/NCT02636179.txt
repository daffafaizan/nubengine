    
      The methodology is a comparative epidemiological survey, between children from a historical
      cohort born after intraconjugal In Vitro Fertilization (singleton or twin) aged 11-15 years
      and a control group recruited in schools after the agreement of Academic Inspection.

      Parents of the two groups will be contacted either by phone calls or through written
      information given in the schools. They will receive the questionnaire and an information
      letter, once they give their agreement to be a part of the study.

      Data collection will be conducted using two anonymous questionnaires. The first questionnaire
      was built based on items proposed in the international Health Behaviour in School-aged
      Children (HBSC) survey of the World Health Organization (WHO). The second questionnaire will
      be sent to parents. It will focus on the pregnancy and it will be used to adjust the
      analysis.

      This study was submitted and approved by an Institutional Review Board in France (Comité de
      Protection des Personnes Sud-Méditerranée II) on 11th September 2015.
