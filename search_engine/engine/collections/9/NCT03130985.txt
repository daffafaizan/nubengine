      The left atrial appendage (LAA) will be removed for research and intended prophylactic
      purposes, using a surgical stapler or surgical knife prior to the standard procedure.
      Epicardial mappings may be performed during cardiac surgery with a 48-multi-electrode.
      Patients will be followed with regular 24-hour Holter investigations.

      This study will be an exploratory study with a required inclusion of 150 patients, based on
      the estimated event rate. Patients will be recruited by the investigators during
      pre-operative assessment.

      Clinical data will be gathered at baseline and stored in a customized microsoft access entry
      database. Statistical analysis will be performed in collaboration with the Bioinformatics
      Laboratory from the Academic Medical Center.
