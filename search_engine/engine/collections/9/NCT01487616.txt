      to be more common in women with poor pregnancy outcomes, e.g. miscarriage (Rackow and Arici
      2007) and preterm delivery (Tomazevic, Ban-Frangez et al. 2007). However, the true prevalence
      is difficult to assess as there are no universally agreed classification systems and some of
      the best investigations are invasive. In addition, previous prevalence studies have not
      examined the details of subfertility or pregnancy loss, such as duration of subfertility, the
      gestation of pregnancy loss, or miscarriage pattern.

      Aims: We plan to investigate how common uterine malformations are in high-risk women (with
      history of miscarriage or preterm delivery), by analysing different characteristics in these
      groups. This study will also investigate other ultrasound characteristics detected on these
      women. This study will point towards the possible mechanism of how uterine malformations may
      affect pregnancy outcomes.

      Methods: We plan to recruit women who have had miscarriage or preterm delivery into our
      study. A sample of women who had normal term deliveries will be recruited as comparison. All
      women will undergo one 3-dimensional ultrasound scan each.

      Outcomes: The proportions of women with congenital uterine malformations will be determined.
      Any ultrasound-detected markers found especially in women with poor pregnancy outcomes may
      point towards how uterine malformations affect pregnancies.
