      intralesional Pentostam injection may be applied. This treatment is extremely efficient but
      painful, however without the known adverse effects of IV Pentostam treatment.

      In this study the investigators will follow systematically all leishmania patients who are
      receiving the intralesional treatment. A structured questionnaire will be filled up in each
      doctor visit.

      The current study goal is to examine the adverse effects and the patient reaction to this
      treatment, and to follow the recovery of lesion(s) after this treatment including the number
      of IL injections which was needed.
