    
      Sedation of critically ill ventilated coronavirus patients, continues to be a challenging
      issue. Also, neurological symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease have been described frequently.
      Difficulties in sedation of these patients have been discussed repeatedly. The aim of this
      study is to investigate whether an encephalographic correlate can be found. Appropriate
      processed encephalographic techniques have been used for anesthesia monitoring for many
      years.

      The aim of our study is to collect unrelated processed and raw EEG data of sedated COVID-19
      patients and to investigate the correlation to the necessary sedation.
