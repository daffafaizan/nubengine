      to scratch. The induction of itch and scratching by mere (audio-) visual stimuli such as
      pictures of insects on skin or video clips showing individuals scratching themselves,
      indicates that itch can be perceived in the absence of a pruritogenic somatosensory stimulus.
      This phenomenon is referred to as "contagious itch" (CI). CI may play a special role in the
      content of scabies both for the affected patients as well as the treating staff: It is a very
      common phenomenon that family members who are not infested by scabies themselves experience
      itch when watching their infested relatives scratching. The same is very frequently expressed
      by health care professionals being confronted with scabies patients. Two further important
      factors may be involved in the context of CI: disgust and empathy. Empathy is defined as a
      psychological concept that enables individuals to understand and share emotions of others.
      Disgust is an emotional response of revulsion to potentially contagious and/or harmful
      objects or subjects. This study is to assess the relationship between CI, disgust and empathy
      in medical staff treating patients with scabies, to differentiate the impact of visual and
      verbal stimuli contributing to CI and to assess information about CI, disgust and empathy in
      a family infested with scabies.
