      referred to as 'HIV') related morbidity and mortality, transforming an invariably fatal
      disease into a manageable, chronic condition. Yet even HAART-treated HIV infection is
      characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and immune activation. This systemic
      inflammatory response is composed of multiple components, and can be quantified by measuring
      markers of immune activation, inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants, endothelial
      activation markers, and markers of microbial translocation. This inflammation is clinically
      relevant, as it may contribute directly to HIV disease progression and non-AIDS related
      morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Because this inflammation persists even in
      the context of suppressive HAART, albeit at modestly decreased levels, adjunctive therapeutic
      strategies to attenuate this persistent inflammatory response are therefore needed. Herpes
      simplex virus type 2 is a common, clinically important co-infection seen in individuals
      living with HIV infection, and may contribute to this ongoing inflammation. This pilot trial
      will investigate whether short-term valacyclovir for HSV-2 suppression can decrease systemic
      inflammation in HAART-treated, HIV-1, HSV-2 co-infected individuals.
