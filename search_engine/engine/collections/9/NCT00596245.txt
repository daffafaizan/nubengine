      screening and a treatment period. A total of 42 (approximately 21 of each sex) non-smoking
      healthy volunteers aged 18 - 35, will be selected for treatment. Potential subjects will be
      assessed for exposure to ionizing radiation or working with cytotoxic chemicals, or who have
      cell cycle times that fall outside the range of 13 Â± 1.5 hours or subjects with stable
      chromosomal rearrangements and/or abnormally high background chromosomal aberration
      frequencies. Approximately 30 subjects (10 per arm) are estimated to be needed for analysis.
