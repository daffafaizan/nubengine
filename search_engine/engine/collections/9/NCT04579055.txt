      there is a difference in repetitions during the 1-min STS test if the seat height is adjusted
      to 90° knee joint angle or the standard height chair of 46 cm is used.

      Patients with COPD referred for pulmonary rehabilitation will be invited to perform one
      standardised- (chair seat height 46cm) and one individualized (chair seat height adapted to
      90° knee flexion) 1-min STS test on two different days in random order.

      The tests will be performed after patients are familiarised with the 1-min STS testing
      procedure and learning effects can be excluded.
