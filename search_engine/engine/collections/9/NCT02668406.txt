    
      Study will be proposed to all patients at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of HOPE (SHCH) and HOPE
      Community Medical Center (CMC) presenting with systemic inflammatory response syndrome
      (SIRS).

      Blood samples will be collected upon admission for patients with blood culture request as
      part of routine patient care and agreement on informed consent. A second sample will be
      collected in patients with blood culture proven melioidosis or suspicion of melioidosis (only
      for phase B), at day 5 after initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment. Depending on the
      final diagnosis, a subset of patients will be assigned to 3 groups:

        1. Patients for whom blood cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei

        2. Patients for whom blood cultures did not grow a pathogen, but have other body site grown
           with Burkholderia pseudomallei, or are suspected of melioidosis

        3. Patients for whom blood cultures grew with another pathogen

      In phase A only, at least 20 ml of voided urine will be collected when a patient is
      hospitalized and identified as belonging to study group 1, 2 or 3. A second collection of
      voided urine will be collected for group 1 and 2 patients during routine further hospital
      stay or a routine follow-up visit.

      The clinical samples from these patients will be processed and shipped to SRI International
      with the purpose of design (=phase A) and validation (=phase B) of in-vitro diagnostics for
      melioidosis.

      A coded database will be completed with basic demographic, clinical and microbiological data
      and final diagnosis. This coded information will be provided to SRI International.
