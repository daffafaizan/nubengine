      accumulation with bone loss, particularly in postmenopausal women. And body iron accumulation
      is accurately reflected by levels of serum ferritin in clinic. The levels of serum ferritin
      among healthy women are about 13-150μg/L, and we give a definition of iron accumulation when
      serum ferritin range from 500μg/L to 1000 μg/L. How will the bone mineral density change in
      iron accumulation? The investigators intend to perform this study to explore and establish
      the relational function and logical function between serum ferritin, bone mineral density and
      biochemical markers of bone metabolism in Chinese healthy postmenopausal women.
