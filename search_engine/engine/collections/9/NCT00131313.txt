    
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia in the U.S.
      Recent experience with Nipent in conjunction with Rituxan has shown that this combination is
      well tolerated and is clinically promising. It is expected that the addition of Cytoxan in
      patients with previously untreated CLL and patients who have relapsed or failed prior therapy
      may benefit from combined therapy using Nipent, Cytoxan and Rituxan. It is unknown how the
      addition of Cytoxan will affect the toxicity profile of the Rituxan and Nipent regimen,
      however, patients will be monitored for toxicities. It is expected that bone marrow
      toxicities will not increase to unreasonable levels.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the overall efficacy response rate
      following treatment with Nipent, Cytoxan and Rituxan of patients with previously untreated or
      treated CLL. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the duration of response,
      time to progression, time to treatment failure and to evaluate the toxicity of this
      combination of drugs and the incidence and severity of adverse events.
