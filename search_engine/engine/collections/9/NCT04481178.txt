      of all cases have the age of onset at birth or within the first year of life, others appear
      before puberty. It typically presents as a unilateral mottled blue-gray macules and patches
      distributed along the first and second branches of trigeminal nerve. Due to its marked
      hyperpigmentation on the face which does not resolved spontaneously, patients may experience
      psychosocial disturbances and often seek for treatments. Based on selective photothermolysis
      theory, Q-switched lasers (ruby 694nm, alexandrite 755nm, Nd:YAG 1064nm) have been used for
      the treatment of nevus of Ota with a success rate of 95% after 6-8 sessions. Reported
      complications from the lasers are hypopigmentation(15.3%), hyperpigmentation(2.9%), texture
      changes (2.9%), and scarring (1.9%). Siriraj Skin Laser Center provides laser treatment for
      nevus of Ota using mainly Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and Picosecond laser. The study of efficacy
      and complications of Q-switched Nd:YAG and Picosecond laser in the treatment of Nevus of Ota
      in Thai patients has never been reported. Therefore, we conduct a retrospective study on
      efficacy and complication of laser treatment (Q-switched Nd:YAG and picosecond laser) of
      nevus of Ota in Thai patients.
