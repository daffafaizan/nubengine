      morbidity, hospitalization, and cardiac symptoms and function when compared to standard
      pharmacologic therapy. The COMPANION trial is designed to address all of these objectives.
      This clinical investigation is an open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical
      trial. Every patient enrolled in the study is to be prescribed to optimal pharmacologic heart
      failure therapy, as tolerated, regardless of randomization.
