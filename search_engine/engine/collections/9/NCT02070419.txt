      I. To determine in patients with stage A to C hepatocellular carcinoma, if stereotactic body
      radiotherapy after TACE enhanced the response rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when
      compared to TACE alone at 3 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in patients with stage A to C hepatocellular carcinoma, if TACE plus SBRT can
      achieve a downstaging rate of >= 30% at 3 and 6 months.

      II. To determine the rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with SBRT for liver
      tumors.

      III. To determine the rate of local progression after SBRT. (Based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) IV. Number of patients who achieve liver
      transplantation. V. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms after the first loco-regional
      therapy with TACE.

      ARM I: Patients undergo TACE according to institutional standard with doxorubicin-eluting
      beads.

      ARM II: Patients undergo TACE as in Arm I and 3 or 5 fractions of SBRT given at least 48
      hours apart over 14 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months and then
      periodically thereafter.
