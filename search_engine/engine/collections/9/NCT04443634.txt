    
      Aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of the adductor canal block to the combined
      adductor canal block and saphenous nerve block at the distal third of thigh in the
      intermuscular plane between Vastus Medialis and Sartorius muscles in pain relief following
      knee arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament repair.

      After written informed consent, patients will be randomized in three groups:

      Group (Adductor 20): Ultrasound guided adductor canal block will be performed with injection
      of 20 ml bupivcaine 0.5%.

      Group (Adductor 30) Ultrasound guided adductor canal block will be performed with injection
      of 30 ml bupivacaine 0.5%. Group (Adductor/saphenous ): Ultrasound guided adductor canal
      block will be performed by injection of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5%, combined with ultrasound
      guided saphenous
