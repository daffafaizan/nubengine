      I. Objective tumor response rate (complete plus partial response plus stable disease > 16
      weeks as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) in
      women with recurrent or refractory advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to disease progression, median survival time, and duration of overall cancer antigen
      (CA)-125 response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
