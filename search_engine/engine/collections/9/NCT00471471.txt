        -  Determine the safety of a peptide vaccine comprising MART-1:27-35 peptide, gp100:209-217
           (210M) peptide, and tyrosinase peptide with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and CpG 7909
           emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant in patients with unresectable recurrent stage
           III or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the efficacy of immunoadjuvants CpG 7909 and GM-CSF, in terms of a strong
           antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response, in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-pigmentary response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor response, in terms of objective tumor regression,
           progression-free survival, and overall survival, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive peptide vaccine comprising MART-1:27-35 peptide, gp100:209-217 (210M)
      peptide, and tyrosinase peptide with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and CpG 7909 emulsified in
      incomplete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, day 50-53, and day 91-94. Samples are examined by
      ELISPOT assay to measure lymphocyte immune response and by flow cytometry for biomarker
      quantification and T-cell response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for at least 2
      years.
