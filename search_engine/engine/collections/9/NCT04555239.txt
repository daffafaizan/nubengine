      in the ED combined with standard care holds enormous promise. High-quality studies
      investigating whether single-episode FDM therapy in the ED is effective are needed. Our goal
      is to conduct a randomized, prospective clinical trial investigating the use of FDM plus
      standard ED pain management for non-specific subacute and chronic extremity compared with
      standard ED pain management.

      The anticipated outcome of this study is statistically and clinically significant improvement
      in function and pain in those treated with FDM compared with those compared with standard
      emergency department care alone for their extremity pain. Demonstration of such results would
      provide stronger evidence base for manual manipulation, particularly in the emergency
      department setting. This is a low-cost intervention that can be learned easily by physicians
      and providers of a variety of backgrounds (advanced care practitioners, physical therapists,
      etc.) and can thus provide an excellent alternative for pain management as opposed to our
      traditional approaches to pain such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), and
      medications such as NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and acetaminophen. We all
      realize that part of the reason we are struggling with an opioid epidemic in our country is
      that our traditional approaches to pain management are not always enough and that patients
      subsequently become dependent upon stronger medications for pain control that unfortunately
      have addictive properties as side effects. If FDM proves to be a successful intervention for
      managing subacute and chronic pain in the emergency department with a single treatment,
      imagine its applicability on a wider scale in the outpatient setting for chronic pain
      management and how this could help us combat the current opioid crisis.
