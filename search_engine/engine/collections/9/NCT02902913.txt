      controlled crossover study that will test the acute effects of oleocanthal-rich extra virgin
      olive oil intake on platelet aggregation. Each participant will be asked to participate in
      four study days, separated by at least 1-week, in which they will be randomized to consume on
      each study day 40 mL (~3 tablespoons) of either oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oil (OO),
      or an extra virgin OO that is matched in total phenolics but oleocanthal-poor, or a refined
      OO that is low in all phenolics In addition to the oils, on a fourth study day visit, after
      completion of the study visits involving oil intake the subjects will be asked to take 400mg
      of ibuprofen.

      Collection procedures will be performed at the same time of the day to avoid circadian
      effects. A blood sample (50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp) will be collected for the measurement of platelet
      aggregometry and COX metabolites. Following this initial blood draw, the subjects will
      consume their assigned test product for the day. Two-hours following the intake of the
      assigned olive oil, a second blood sample will be drawn (50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp). After the second
      blood draw, the study day will be complete.
