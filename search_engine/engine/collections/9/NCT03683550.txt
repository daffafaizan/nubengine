      factor, lowering the 5-year survival rate to approximately 50%.

      Recommendations for the use of SLNE for primary melanoma are included in the current American
      Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines. Critics argue that the routinely performed SLNE is a
      cost intensive surgical intervention with potential morbidity that does not offer patients
      any advantage in overall survival. The current gold standard for detection and targeted
      extirpation of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is preoperative lymphoscintigraphy as an imaging
      technique to identify the lymph drainage basin, determine the number of sentinel nodes,
      differentiate sentinel nodes from subsequent nodes, locate the sentinel node in an unexpected
      location, and mark the sentinel node over the skin for biopsy. Single-photon emission
      computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) provides complementary functional and
      anatomical information and has been shown to be superior to planar imaging in a number of
      indications. It can provide valuable information before sentinel lymph node biopsy and
      advocate its use in a range of tumors such as truncal and head and neck melanomas.

      The objective of the planned multi-center randomized prospective trial is to compare distant
      metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with cutaneous melanoma between sentinel lymph
      node excision with versus without preoperative SPECT/CT imaging and metastatic node
      detection.
