        -  Compare the effects of alagebrium vs placebo on the change from baseline in
           endothelial-mediated vasoreactivity immediately after exercise, as assessed by pulse
           perfusion-mediated vasodilation (PPMV).

        -  Confirm results observed in the single-blind segment.

        -  Explore several variables as potential independent predictors of vascular stiffness and
           endothelial function. These parameters include age, body mass index, gender, renal
           disease, history of cardiovascular disease, serum cholesterol, and antihypertensive
           medication use.

        -  Provide insight into nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function in the setting of
           increased arterial stiffness by determination of substances in the nitric oxide
           signaling pathway (specifically, levels of serum cGMP; serum nitrate and nitrite; and
           serum asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA], an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide
           synthase).

        -  Provide insight into the relationship between AGE levels (AGE markers: pentosidine,
           furosine), collagen metabolism (collagen markers: procollagen I carboxyterminal
           propeptide [PICP], procollagen type I N terminal propeptide [PINP], cross-linked
           carboxyterminal telopeptide of Type I collagen [ICTP], n-terminal propeptide of type III
           procollagen [PIIINP]), and endothelial function; and insight into the changes in these
           markers in response to treatment with an AGE cross-link breaker (alagebrium).

        -  Provide insight into the relationship between markers of inflammation [specifically,
           free and total serum matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1), free tissue inhibitor of
           metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), vascular cellular
           adhesion molecule (VCAM), P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWf), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
           endothelin 1, VEGF, NFkβ, TGF-β, IGF-1 and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs CRP)]
           and endothelial function; and insight into the changes in these markers in response to
           treatment with an AGE cross-link breaker (alagebrium).
