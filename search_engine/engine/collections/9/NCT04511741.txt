      percent of patients with respiratory failure need long-term mechanical ventilation. There is
      a lack of data on children with long-term mechanical ventilation in China.The investigators
      conducted this study to investigate the clinical characteristics of children with long-term
      mechanical ventilation in China. The investigators conducted a multicenter clinical
      epidemiological survey.The study included PICU wards in major children's hospitals in China
      and investigated the causes of prolonged mechanical ventilation, the outcome of long-term
      mechanical ventilation.PMV definition: continuous invasive or noninvasive ventilation time ≥
      21 days, daily ≥ 6 hours.
