      Up to 15% of pancreatic cancers have a hereditary component. Several gene mutations and
      cancer syndromes have been identified that are frequently found in greater frequency in
      individuals with pancreatic cancer, including the breast ovary cancer syndrome (BRCA1/BRCA2
      mutations). No studies adequately describe the epidemiology of inherited pancreatic cancer
      and genetic risk factors that may modify the penetrance of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. The primary
      aim of this study is to determine the frequency of BRCA1 (185delAG,5382insC) and BRCA2
      (6174delT) mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish pancreatic cancer patients. Secondary endpoints will
      include determining the individual frequency of these mutations and other disease-modifying
      mutations, death from any cause, disease-free survival, and stage of disease at time of
      presentation, differences in tissue pathology, risk factors, treatment decisions and
      development of metachronous malignancies.

      The investigator plan to study about 100 patients, which will enable the true frequency of
      the mutation to be estimated. Although the impact of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations will be initially
      studied in the Ashkenazi population, these data will be widely applicable to other pancreatic
      cancer patients carrying BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in
      relatives of hereditary pancreatic cancer patients may allow early screening, treatment, and
      resection of pre-malignant tissue or malignant lesions.
