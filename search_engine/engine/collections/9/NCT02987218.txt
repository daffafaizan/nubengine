    
      100 patients will be randomized into two groups, Desflurane group (Group D) and Propofol
      group (Group P) using a computer generated algorithm. Written informed consent will be taken
      from all the patients.

      Cognition assessed using MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)test. A preoperative assessment
      for establishing the patient's baseline performance. Surgery-related factors may affect test
      performance if performed too early to reduce possibility of confounding factors, we planned
      to conduct the test for POCD at the time of discharge of the patient after surgery. To
      compare long term protection provided by anesthetic agent cognitive functions were assessed
      at one month following surgery.

      Cognitive functions will be assessed at following time period A) Preoperatively B)
      Postoperatively B1- At the time of discharge B2- 1month after discharge following surgery.

      Biomarker levels S100B levels were also measured A) Preoperatively B) Intraoperatively - post
      clipping C) Postoperatively - 1hour after surgery
