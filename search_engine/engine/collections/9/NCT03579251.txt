      "portable" intervention, "Black Men's Care" (BMC), to re-engage in HIV care HIV+ Black men
      who have sex with men who have left HIV care (+BMSM-LC) that is flexible with respect to
      where it can be conducted. The aims of the study are: Aim 1-to conduct formative research to
      develop BMC content and optimize its delivery; Aim 2-to develop BMC, a theory-based,
      combination in-person and text messaging (mHealth) intervention for +BMSM-LC; and Aim 3-to
      evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of BMC in preparation for
      submitting an R01 proposal to finalize and conduct an efficacy trial of BMC. Aims 1 and 2
      will comprise the formative phase of the proposed study. Aim 1 will consist of
      semi-structured interviews with 2 staff members at each of 3 city and county health clinics,
      3 community-based organizations, and 3 emergency rooms to identify effective settings for
      intervention. Aim 2 will consist of semi-structured interviews with 10 +BMSM-LC and 10 HIV+
      Black men who have sex with men who remain in care to develop intervention content. Findings
      from these semi-structured interviews and Aim 1 will be used to develop a preliminary
      intervention protocol that will be refined across 2 sets of 3 sequential, single-subject
      iterations of the intervention sampled by age (n=3 for ages 18 to 29 years, n =3 for ages 30
      and up). For Aim 3, a pilot study of 18 +BMSM-LC purposively sampled by age will assess
      acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes of BMC for re-engaging +BMSM-LC in care.
      The research and career development activities of this K23 proposal will allow the PI to
      achieve the goal of becoming an independent, R01-funded investigator. The PI will gain a
      broad range of critical skills (e.g., intervention development; qualitative research methods;
      trial design, safety monitoring, and process and outcome evaluation) and experiences to
      address the health needs of vulnerable populations at greatest risk of morbidity and
      mortality.
