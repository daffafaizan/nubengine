    
      This study will be a randomized trial over a 6-month period (March 8 through September 7,
      2019) in 3 GI endoscopy clinics (Franklin, Rock Creek, and Lone Tree). All members currently
      receive a text reminder 7 days prior to their procedure, which rolls over to a telephone
      reminder if the text cannot be delivered or the member's phone is not text-enabled. Members
      will be randomized either to receive this standard IVR-T protocol (control) or to receive an
      enhanced reminder (intervention) protocol.

      Randomization: Beginning in March 8, 2019, a randomization algorithm will be used in the
      Structured Query Language program that manages the IVR relational database to assign each
      visit for a procedure at all three sites to control or intervention. Since members with
      multiple procedures on different days during the study period could receive control or
      intervention for different visits, the statistical analysis will be limited to the first
      randomized appointment during the project period. Randomization will be stratified by clinic
      site.
