      simultaneously targets multiple anxiety disorders with or without co-occurring depression.
      This will be accomplished by evaluating an innovative treatment delivery method that directly
      addresses barriers associated with standard psychotherapy delivery. The main objectives are
      to (1) determine if an intensive CBT protocol (iCBT) delivered over one weekend can improve
      community reintegration, quality of life, and emotional functioning compared with standard
      CBT (sCBT) and treatment as usual (TAU); (2) examine the rates of psychotherapy engagement in
      iCBT compared with sCBT; and (3) obtain a deeper understanding, through qualitative
      interviews with Veterans and their family members, of how iCBT and environmental factors may
      impact the process of reintegration and quality of life.

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 3 treatment arms. A transdiagnostic
      group CBT protocol will be compared in a compressed weekend format (iCBT) with a standard
      group delivery format involving 3 months of weekly sessions (sCBT). A treatment as usual
      (TAU) condition will be included to compare outcomes. Veterans with one or more anxiety-based
      disorder(s) (with or without co-occurring depression) will be randomized to one of the three
      treatment arms. Veterans will be asked to attend a total of four assessments during the study
      including a baseline evaluation, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. Qualitative
      interviews will be conducted with Veterans who completed iCBT and family members.
