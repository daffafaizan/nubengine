      frequently leads to many nights of lost sleep for parents and also to unfavorable sleeping
      arrangements, especially for older children and adolescents. Sudden unexplained death in
      epilepsy patients (SUDEP) is also a major concern for both parents and neurology
      practitioners. Patients with epilepsy have increased risk of sudden unexplained death
      compared to the rest of the population. The risk of sudden death in epilepsy is estimated at
      24 times the risk of the general population. Specific risk factors for sudden death have been
      evaluated and the most frequently reported risk factors include: nocturnal seizures, being in
      bed, and history of generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Interestingly, one case-control study
      observed a decreased risk of SUDEP with nighttime monitoring or supervision which raises the
      possibility that some cases of SUDEP may be preventable if another person is able to give
      assistance. This finding may indicate that some of these deaths may be preventable if a
      caregiver could be alerted to seizure activity. Use of "baby monitors", apnea monitors and
      pulse oximeters to monitor their children at night has been attempted by families; however,
      these devices are not specific to seizure activity and in the case of apnea monitors and
      pulse oximeters have frequent false alarms leading to further anxiety and sleep disturbance
      for families. Therefore, there is a need for a product that can reliably detect seizure
      activity without such frequent false positives as to interfere with sleep and functional
      life.
