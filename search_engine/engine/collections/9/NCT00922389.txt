      critical limb ischemia (CLI), which may result in limb loss. Epidemiological evidence
      confirms an association between diabetes and increased prevalence of peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD). The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease among the Indian diabetic
      population is 13%.

      This therapy provides a targeted approach i.e. by improving blood perfusion in the ischemic
      area of the lower limb by inducing neovascularization, which would be further evaluated by
      measuring the change in transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TCpO2), NMR angiography of
      local vessels, ulcer healing, pain relief, limb salvage, ABI index etc.

      The specific design of the trial enables us to differentially study the effect of stem cell
      on diabetic foot CLI as compared to G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) in (one
      control group) and standard therapy (in another control group), this study would also
      evaluate the effect of stem cell dose.

      Extracting stem cells from this method is far more easy to perform as compared to extracting
      from bone marrow and is less painful for the patient as well.

      The yield of mononuclear stem cell from peripheral blood is much higher as compared to bone
      marrow and role of CD34+ cells in limb ischemia is not yet established in humans, therefore
      this study would evaluate the dynamics of different types of mononuclear cells and its
      correlation with the therapeutic effect.

      This clinical trial highlights the safety of using G-CSF in diabetic CLI by having a separate
      control group in which volunteers would be given only G-CSF through subcutaneous route, also
      this would tell about the therapeutic effect if any attributable to it.
