           the proposed intervention on reductions in sexual risk taking and crystal meth use. The
           primary outcome is the number of unprotected anal sex acts and a secondary outcome is
           reduction in crystal meth use episodes over the follow up period.

        2. To explore the degree to which improvements in sexual risk taking are associated with
           the conceptual mediators of the effects of the intervention: reductions in crystal meth
           use and increases in pleasurable (but safe) activities, BAT skills, use of risk
           reduction skills, and reductions in depressed mood.
