      In normal wound healing, platelets activate macrophages to produce endogenous platelet
      derived growth factor (PDGF) and other growth factors which are responsible for would
      healing. In chronic wounds, macrophage activation is suppressed which leads to an
      inappropriate growth factor response causing failure of positive autocrine feedback loop
      which normally controls the healing process. The regular application of exogenous PRP and
      Thrombin, to chronic wounds, restores the autocrine feedback loop of tissue repair which
      appears to accelerate the normal cascade of tissue repair
