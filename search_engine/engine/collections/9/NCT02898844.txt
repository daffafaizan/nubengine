      diet success and outcomes related to dieting. Pairs of non-romantic cohabiting female dyads
      (i.e. roommates) were randomly assigned to one of the following three-week manipulations: (a)
      neither roommate dieted, (b) one roommate was assigned to a 1200-calorie/day diet and the
      other ate normally, (c) both roommates were assigned to a 1200-calorie/day diet. Both pre-
      and post diet, participants were weighted and measured, filled out psychological
      questionnaires, and provided two days of diurnal salivary cortisol samples. During the
      three-week manipulation period, participants who were assigned to diet recorded all calories
      consumed on each day. This study tested whether dieting in a pair would lead to improved diet
      outcomes in terms of adherence and weight loss, changes in psychological well-being, and
      changes in cortisol.
