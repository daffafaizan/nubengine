      response. About 24% of the total energy provided by Glucerna SR is due to monounsaturated
      fatty acids, which can help keep good metabolic state in accordance with the recommendations
      of the American Heart Association. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Glucerna
      SR treating newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients (NDM) on glycemic stability, with the
      application of CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) and to further realize the safety
      and effect of Glucerna SR consumed as a meal replacement at breakfast meal on daily and
      day-to-day amplitude of blood glucose fluctuation.
