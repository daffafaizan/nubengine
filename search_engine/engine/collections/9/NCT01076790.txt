      during anaesthesia (dexmedetomidine 0.1 mcg/kg within 10 minutes, thereafter 0.7 mcg/kg/h
      until 30 min after skin incision).

      Multi-channel EEG, Entropy, BIS, multi-channel EMG, ECG, and plethysmogram are recorded on
      computer. Anaesthesia and surgery associated events are annotated on computer.

      Time points of endotracheal intubation, skin incision, and course of surgery well be analyzed
      in detail. Additionally, tetanic stimulus of ulnar nerve will be applied for each patient,
      and reactions to the stimulus will be analyzed.
