    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled, single blind, superiority trial
      that will include 35 international sites. The investigators aim to enroll 556 subjects with
      complex coronary bifurcation lesions in native coronary arterial segments.

      All patients with complex coronary bifurcation lesions suitable for DES implantation will
      undergo 1:1 randomization either to IVUS-guided or angiography-guided DK crush stenting using
      a randomization schedule blocked by site.

      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
      per protocol and will further undergo angiography before DES implantation. Data and images
      will be collected during the index procedure, during re-intervention in the case of
      clinically driven TVF, and at the predefined 12-month clinical follow-up visit. All subjects
      will also undergo angiographic follow-up at 13 months.
