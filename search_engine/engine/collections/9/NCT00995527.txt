      vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen which has the
      potential to cause devastating morbidity and mortality in the coming months. In June 2009,
      the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 outbreak to be a global pandemic. At present
      there are limited data on the early non-specific (innate) immune responses in adult
      recipients of the H1N1 vaccine.

      Therefore the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes
      this protocol designed to investigate the early innate immune response. Healthy adult
      subjects (NIH employees) will be admitted as inpatients to receive the FDA-licensed H1N1
      vaccine followed by serial blood draws. These samples will be used to perform comprehensive
      and detailed analyses of the innate immune system s response to vaccination. To our
      knowledge, this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human innate immune
      response to H1N1 vaccine. This information may be useful in designing newer, more effective
      vaccines to prevent the spread of H1N1.

      The primary objective is to collect blood to be used strictly for laboratory studies designed
      to characterize the innate immune response to H1N1 vaccine. Samples will be collected from
      healthy adult volunteers (NIH employees) at baseline and serially during the first 36 hours
      after vaccination with the H1N1 vaccine.
