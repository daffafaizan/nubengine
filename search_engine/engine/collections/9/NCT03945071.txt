      diabetic retinopathy, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein
      occlusions require regular, periodic injections. Patients often reports eye surface
      irritation post intravitreal injection. One of the reasons for such discomfort is attributed
      to povidone-iodine solution used to clean the eye surface to reduce sight-threatening
      infections. Patients who already experience symptoms of dry eye are at increased risk of
      discomfort after povidone-iodine prepped intravitreal injections.

      Povidone-iodine is known to be corrosive to the corneal epithelium and delay eye surface
      healing. Human tears contain proteins and chemicals that lubricate, heal, and protect the eye
      surface from infections and irritants. Adequate tear film therefore not only dilutes
      povidone-iodine, but also promotes corneal healing post povidone-iodine prepping.

      The primary long-term objective of the present study is to investigate whether punctal plugs
      will reduce eye discomfort post intravitreal injections as reported by the Ocular Surface
      Disease Index (OSDI) and other relevant surveys. The secondary outcome is to describe any
      other risk and protective factors associated with eye surface discomfort after intravitreal
      injections.
