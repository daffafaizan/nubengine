      board and included based on predefined in- and exclusion criteria. Eligible candidates with
      primary colorectal or appendiceal cancers will be treated with intraperitoneal oxaliplatin
      delivered by the PIPAC procedure, while patients with other primary cancers will be treated
      with a combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin. Three PIPAC treatments will be scheduled in
      intervals of five weeks. MRI and QoL questionnaires will be performed at baseline and after
      three PIPAC treatments. If the patients respond to the PIPAC treatment, further courses of
      PIPAC can be planned at the tumour board meeting.

      In brief, PIPAC is performed during a standard laparoscopy using two access ports, where the
      magnitude of PM is evaluated using the Peritoneal Carcinosis Index and the Dutch 7 regions
      count. Afterwards, the peritoneum is biopsied at different regions and peritoneal lavage
      fluid is sent for cytology. Then, chemotherapy is aerosolised within the abdomen, and after
      30 minutes, the aerosol has been absorbed by the peritoneum, and the patient is closed
      according to departmental guidelines. The patients are expectedly discharged within 24 hours,
      and will after each PIPAC treatment be screened for adverse events using the CTCAE and
      Dindo-Clavien classification.
