      Lead/Select Site Registry: Acute Study" are studies designed to look at alternate lead
      locations for defibrillation leads for ICDs. The registry is designed to capture data from
      patients who have already undergone implant, so as to be able to publish long term data on
      defibrillation thresholds, pacing thresholds and left ventricular function. This will include
      both patients from the acute study, and those patients in whom leads have already been
      placed, and the exact lead location is known. The acute study is designed to directly compare
      defibrillation thresholds in the apical location versus the interventricular septal location
      for defibrillation leads. This study involves a direct comparison of two different sites in
      the same patient; using defined criteria for implant location (see protocol). The acute study
      is anticipated to enroll 34 patients, but the registry to collect ongoing data will be
      larger, encompassing previously implanted patients, with an expected sample size of 61 total
      in the registry for data collection.
