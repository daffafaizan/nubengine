    
      In the study, 200 of stage IB,II and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer patients obtained
      radical resection will be recruited. All the patients will receive biopsy genotype assay and
      ctDNA liquid biopsy. The abundance of mutations of ctDNA was tracked at 4 time points,
      including:

        1. st: 10 Days after patients received radical resection.

        2. nd: When patients finished the chemotherapy or target drug delivery two cycles.

        3. rd: 10 Days after patients finished the chemotherapy or target drug delivery four
           cycles.

        4. th: When tumor recrudescence / 2 years after radical resection.

      Tumor genomic clonal evolution was assessed by analyzing the relative abundance of mutations
      in plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
