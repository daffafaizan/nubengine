        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered with cisplatin and
           thoracic radiotherapy (given at two different schedules) in patients with limited stage
           small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and non-dose-limiting toxicity of
           these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the reversibility of all toxic effects associated with these regimens in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned
      to 1 of 2 radiotherapy (RT) treatment groups.

        -  Radiotherapy:

             -  Group I: Patients undergo thoracic RT twice daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks.

             -  Group II: Patients undergo thoracic RT once daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks.

        -  Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and
           8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 1 course
           for group I and 2 courses for group II.

        -  Post RT chemotherapy: Patients receive irinotecan and cisplatin as above for 3 courses
           for group I and 2 courses, beginning after RT is complete, for group II.

      Sequential cohorts of 6 patients per group receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients (6-18 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within 18 months.
