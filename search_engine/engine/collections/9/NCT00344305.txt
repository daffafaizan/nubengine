      virus shedding and safety of trivalent influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal in children 6
      to < 60 months of age. Enrollment of approximately 200 participants was stratified by age,
      with 100 participants 6 to < 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their
      second year birthday) and 100 participants 24 to < 60 months of age (who reached their second
      year but not their fifth year birthday). Baseline medical history data collection included
      the participants prior receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory-confirmed
      influenza illness in the previous influenza season.
