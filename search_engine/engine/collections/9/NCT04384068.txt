      which inhibits the binding of this cytokine to its receptor. It is the first monoclonal
      antibody developed for RA treatment with this mechanism of action and has been approved by
      regulatory authorities in China since 2013. Data from five phase III studies with over 4000
      recruited patients have shown that tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg, in combination with
      methotrexate/DMARDs or as monotherapy, can produce a quick and clinically relevant
      improvement in RA signs and symptoms, health status, and prevent joint damage, for both
      patients who have not been previously treated with and refractory to methotrexate, other
      DMARDs or anti-TNF agents. However, in real-world clinical setting, the safety profile and
      treatment pattern with regard to the persistence on tocilizumab and the efficacy are not
      clear in China. The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      tocilizumab using Chinese Rheumatology Information Platform (CRIP) on Chinese Rheumatology
      Data Centre (CRDC, http://www.crdc.org.cn/) in Chinese RA patients.
