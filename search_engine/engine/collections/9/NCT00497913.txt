      controversy on the amount of botulinum toxin injected and the location of the injection. The
      purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection with
      placebo at a new injection site at the forearm in the treatment of chronic tennis elbow
      unrelieved by corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy. It is a double blind randomized
      controlled trial.
