    
      Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), which occurs secondary to an imprinting disorder due to the
      anomalous methylation of chromosome 11 or due to a uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, is a
      rare syndrome (ORPHA813, OMIM 180860) characterized by growth retardation with an
      intrauterine onset, a normal head circumference, small postnatal size and major feeding
      difficulties. Starting at a very young age, the rapid aging of bone can occur even in the
      absence of central puberty, in association with the production of androgens by the adrenal
      glands (adrenarche). This advanced bone maturation can compromise final size, even when the
      child receives growth hormone (GH) treatment for several years.

      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is also a rare disease (ORPHA739, OMIM 176270), occurring
      secondary to an imprinting disorder due to an anomaly in chromosome 15 (paternal deletion or
      maternal disomy). These children also present feeding difficulties during the first few years
      of life, as well as small size. They are frequently treated with GH, and their bone age can
      increase during the course of adrenarche, as in certain patients with SRS.
