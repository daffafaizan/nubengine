      pharmacogenomic testing is utilized to select and dose narcotic pain medications prescribed
      for breakthrough pain in post-operative total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. Patients will
      receive individualized analgesics and doses for pain mitigation based on genetic testing
      results. Post op pain scores, narcotic consumption, adverse reactions, length of stay and
      patient satisfaction with pain management will be collected and analyzed to determine the
      significance of the pharmacogenomic analgesic testing.

      Due to the lack of literature and evidence surrounding pharmacogenomics and its use in
      selecting analgesics to control post-operative pain a pilot study is being conducted to
      evaluate effect size (statistical variability) in an attempt to predict an appropriate sample
      size for a larger scale randomized control trial. The subjects enrolled and data collected
      for this internal pilot will be used in the larger scale parent study as well.
