      spermatic cord. varicocele has been described as the most common surgically correctable cause
      of male subinfertility.this is a disease that devolops during puberty when both endocrine and
      exocrine function of the testicle dramatically increases, along with testicular blood flow.
      varicocele only rarely detected in boys less than 10 years. left sided varicocle found in 15%
      of healthy young men.incontrast, the incidence in sub fertile men approaches 40% bilateral
      varicocele is uncommon in healthy men (less than 10%) but palpated in 20% in sub fertile men.
      in-general varicocele don't spontaneously regress. an accurate physical examination remain
      the corner stone of varicocele diagnosis.

      several anatomic features contribute to the predominance of left sided varicocele is the left
      intrnal spermatic vein longer than the right and it typically joins the left renal vein at a
      right angle.as result of this character higher venous pressures fair transmited to the left
      spermatic vein and result in reterograde reflux of blood.

      varicocle are associated with testicular atrophhy and varicocle correction can reverse
      atrophy in adolececnt. there is strong evidence affect semen quality it can cause
      abnormalties in concentration, motility and morphology.main defect is the motility.

      indication of varicocelectomy:

        1. Large varicoceles in adolescents

        2. Childhood varicocele with testicular atrophy

        3. Varicoceles with elevated FSH values, or low testosterone levels

        4. Varicoceles with scrotal pain

        5. Cosmetic indication

        6. Male infertility with pathological semen analysis and varicocele
