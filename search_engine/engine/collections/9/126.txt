studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deephypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients withinthe body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basalblood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portionof the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure oftotal body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperaturedifference and the extracorporeal flow rate .3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods ofperfusion alone .4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatoryarrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average bodytemperature .5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production oflactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impairlactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive inprolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatoryarrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profoundcooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchangeduring perfusion cooling .7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on coreorgans . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of theanimal may remain cold .
