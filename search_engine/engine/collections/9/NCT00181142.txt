      complicating the utility of lung transplantation. The timing and frequency of acute rejection
      has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of chronic allograft
      rejection. As an adjunct to standard triple immunosuppressive therapy, induction therapy is
      thought to decrease the incidence of acute rejection.Daclizumab is an interleukin 2 receptor
      (IL-2) antagonist which is FDA approved as an immunosuppressive agent. Thymoglobulin is an
      anti-lymphocyte immunosuppressive agent that has been shown in other solid organ transplant
      studies to be successful in delaying the first episode of rejection but has not decreased the
      incidence of Obliterative Bronchiloitis (chronic rejection)in lung transplantation.
