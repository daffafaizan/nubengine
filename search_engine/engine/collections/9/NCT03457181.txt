      computer-generated randomization order into 2 groups: Music Group (Group M) and Operating
      Room (OR) Noise Group (Group O). Randomization was independently carried out in both centers.

      Preoperative and postoperative State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores, intraoperative
      STAI responses, preoperative and postoperative numerical rating scale scores for anxiety,
      pain scores and hemodynamic parameters were recorded.
