      administered as a novel modified-release formulation (EUR1025 24 mg) as well as the
      immediate-release formulation (Zofran 8 mg) after single and multiple oral dose
      administration under fasting and fed conditions based on the requirements of the respective
      indications. The safety profile of each treatment will also be assessed by recording the
      nature, severity, frequency, duration and relation to the treatment of any adverse events.
