      This impairment is due mainly to the decreased ability to modulate appropriate muscle
      activation patterns. Issues with appropriately modifying activation patterns can profoundly
      affect tasks of daily living. This study is evaluating a novel software focusing on
      retraining hand muscle activation patterns through an Electromyographic (EMG) controlled
      game. Stroke survivors with chronic, severe hemiparesis of the hand will participate in a
      longitudinal study consisting of 3 weeks of training. We hypothesize that stroke survivors
      will experience a decrease in time to complete a test of EMG control, as well as improvement
      in hand motor control.
