      years, studies comparing their efficacy have little scientific value.

      Evidence-based dermatology proves minocycline to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris
      while the patient remains on the medication; however, the relapse rate of acne after a course
      of antibiotics has never been established.

      The relapse rate would appear to be significant, as repeated courses and long-term antibiotic
      use are commonly prescribed in practice. The increasing problem of drug resistance has raised
      issues of the suitability of such long term antibiotic treatment and this overuse is probably
      a contributing factor of multiple drug resistance in our society.
