      via production of oxidative free radicals. Consequently, there have been numerous studies on
      the potential dermatological/anti-carcinogenic benefits of anti-oxidants, such as vitamins C
      and E, melatonin, green tea, zinc, and selenium. There is, however, a limited amount of
      literature on the quantity of UV exposure in high-risk settings, such as extreme altitude and
      equatorial zones. Currently, there is no literature on UV exposure on Mount Everest.
      Additionally, the efficacy of antioxidants (topical or systemic) has not yet been established
      in this environment.

      This will be an observational study where the principal investigator will collect accumulated
      ultraviolet exposure at different extreme altitudes during a 6 week period of a summit
      expedition on the north side of Mt. Everest. Included in the data collection will be patient
      demographics, time, altitude, temperature, use of anti-oxidants, sunscreen (weighed), and
      skin erythema (spectophotometer).
