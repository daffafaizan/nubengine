    
      A 12-month longitudinal study will be conducted in secondary school settings.

      The investigators will investigate incidence of probable depression (i.e., from
      non-depression, CESD<16, at baseline to probable depression, CESDâ‰¥16, at month 12) and
      remission of probable depression.

      The investigators will investigate factors that can prospectively predict new cases/remission
      of probable depression, including both well-documented risk/protective factors and some
      under-examined but potentially important local factors (e.g. school/academic stress,
      psychological resilience). The relative importance of the risk/protective factors at
      different socio-ecological levels will be compared and their combined effect will be
      identified.

      Based on the selected factors, the investigators will derive a new prediction index called
      the Adolescent Depression Prediction Index (ADPI) in a model building sample and test its
      performance in predicting incidence of depression in a validation sample among secondary
      school students in Hong Kong.
