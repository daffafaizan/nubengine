      to infection with SARS-CoV-2 over time in convalescent adults, including acquired immune
      responses, gene expression profiling in peripheral blood and to identify host genetic
      variants associated with disease progressions or severity. We would like to ascertain why
      different people experience different disease phenotypes with this coronavirus infection.

      Our primary objective is to determine key protective cellular immune parameters (e.g. T cell
      responses) and confirm whether there are host genetic factors that provide protection from
      disease. We aim to define immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes by screening overlapping
      peptides from the viral proteome and mapping responses to individual COVID proteins expressed
      intracellularly in antigen-presenting cells (to confirm processing and presentation at the
      cell surface). Peptide-HLA multimers will be constructed for confirmed immunodominant
      responses. These reagents will allow rapid enumeration and tracking of COVID-specific T cell
      responses in patient samples.

      Our secondary objective is to determine whether there are public (shared) T-cell receptor
      responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will also examine whether pre-existing T-cells responses to other
      viruses protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced disease (COVID-19). T-cells generated will be used
      to test and verify detection reagents. These reagents will be developed for various projects
      in Oxford University including monitoring of T-cell responses induced by COVID vaccines. We
      will also establish whether pre-existing cross-reactive immunity to other coronaviruses
      correlates with disease severity as seen with the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
