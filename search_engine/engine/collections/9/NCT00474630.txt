      achieve physiologic control of blood glucose as well as other often associated conditions
      including hypertension, dyslipidemia and excess weight. Pharmacologic interventions for the
      treatment of obesity in type 2 diabetes have shown significant reductions in HbA1c. Two Phase
      II clinical trials demonstrated that a combination of bupropion SR and naltrexone is
      associated with greater weight loss than bupropion SR alone, naltrexone alone, or placebo in
      subjects with uncomplicated obesity. The current study investigated the safety and efficacy
      of the combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR compared to placebo in obese subjects
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
