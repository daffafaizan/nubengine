      Primary

        -  To compare the efficacy of daily administration of naproxen vs placebo in preventing or
           reducing the severity and duration of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain (PIBP) in patients
           with non-hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To identify potential risk factors for the development of PIBP.

        -  To identify potential clinical predictors for the response or failure to respond to
           naproxen in preventing PIBP.

        -  To assess the toxicity of naproxen when administered in the preventive setting.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by Clinical Community Oncology
      Program (CCOP) site. Patients are randomized to 1 treatment arm vs placebo.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral naproxen twice daily beginning on the day pegfilgrastim is
           administered (day 2, 3, or 4) and continuing for 5-8 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive matching placebo twice daily beginning on the day pegfilgrastim
           is administered (day 2, 3, or 4) and continuing for 5-8 days.
