    
      This study will conducted as a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial.

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of a combination
      of Nintedanib + induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine the efficacy (rate of CR/CRp/CRi) of
      Nintedanib+ induction vs Placebo+ induction.

      The secondary objectives of this study include: determining the overall response rate
      according to IWG AML 2003 criteria, the toxicity profile and safety of the combination, the
      percentage of patients bridging to transplantation, the overall survival, leukemia free
      survival including analysis with censoring at HSCT and rates of haematological improvement
      according to IWG MDS 2006 criteria. In addition, exploratory correlative studies will be
      conducted.
