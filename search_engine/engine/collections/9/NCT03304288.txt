      achieve remission from first-line therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of
      steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a great
      challenge. Rituximab has been shown to partly improve the complete remission rate of ITP.
      All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has an immunomodulatory effect on haematopoiesis, making it a
      possible treatment option.

      A multicentre prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were
      either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed. Patients were
      randomized to the low-dose rituximab+ATRA and the low-dose rituximab monotherapy groups.
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Interim analysis was scheduled at 50% through recruitment. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study, in order to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      low-dose rituximab and ATRA in patients with steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
