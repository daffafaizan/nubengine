      recollection training (repitition-lag procedure). The patients in the active control group
      undergo the standard memory therapy that is normally provided in the rehabilitation centre
      (with a focus on the acquisition and execution of different memory strategies, e.g. the
      spaced retrieval method). The patients in both groups are tested on different
      neuropsychological tests before and after nine hours of therapy. Additionally, a test is
      conducted that assesses memory in everyday life.
