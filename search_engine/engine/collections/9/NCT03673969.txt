      The ideal features are highly safe operation, revisable, reversible, extremely effective,
      short operative time, short hospital stay, cost-effective, no long-term complications and
      acceptable to the patients.

      Mini Gastric Bypass/One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass MGB/OAGB is relatively a new bariatric
      /metabolic surgery operation that is increasing in popularity and currently more than 60,000
      operations are performed worldwide. Only 125 MGB operations are published from UK.

      No previous RCT to date in the UK to test the new operation although RCT was done in Taiwan
      2005 and showed that MGB is not inferior to the Roux EnY Gastric Bypass RYGB. This research
      project is assessing the outcomes of this operation and opening the doors to understand its
      effects and how it works compared to the standard RYGB. The possible development in the
      project is to study the hormonal changes after the MGB.
