    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, sequential, drug-drug-interaction (DDI) study in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of 2 parts: a DDI part (Part I) and a rucaparib
      treatment part (Part II).

      In Part I, the PK of cytochrome P450 (CYP) cocktail probes: caffeine, S-warfarin, omeprazole,
      and midazolam and a P-glycoprotein probe (digoxin) will be assessed with and without
      rucaparib treatment. Patients will receive single doses of CYP drug cocktail (caffeine,
      warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam) on Day 1 and Day 12, and single doses of digoxin on Day
      2 and Day 13. Continuous treatment with 600 mg rucaparib twice daily (BID) will start on Day
      5 and will last until at least Day 16 of Part I.

      In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.
