      of testosterone for about two weeks. Subjects will receive acyline as shots three times over
      a six-week drug administration period. During the time when the body's production of
      testosterone is turned off, we will give testosterone either by itself or with a medication
      called finasteride by mouth twice daily for one week to see how much is absorbed and present
      in the bloodstream after administration. Subjects will go through three one-week study drug
      exposure periods. During two of the three one-week study drug administration periods subjects
      will also take a second medication, finasteride, by mouth twice daily. On the last day of
      each one-week drug administration period, subjects will be admitted to the University of
      Washington General Clinical Research Center overnight for monitoring of your blood
      testosterone levels. There will be 3 overnight visits for this study. This study will allow
      us to determine the absorption of testosterone taken by mouth, and the relative impact of two
      different doses of oral finasteride on testosterone absorption.
