      randomised to practice hypnosis and will learn to practice self-hypnosis to reduce food
      impulsivity and specially disinhibition. In the same time, all the included patients will
      follow therapeutic workshops based on current recommendations of the High Health Authority of
      France (HAS) for physical activity and the dietetic.

      In the hypnosis group, eight workshops are planned during six months. Furthermore, patients
      have to practice daily self-hypnosis. In the same time, all the patients included will
      participate in eight dietetic workshops.

      It is expected an improvement in patient involvement in personalized care plan, that eating
      behavior is more suited and consequently a significant decrease in weight.
