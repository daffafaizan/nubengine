    
      A multicenter (more than one medical research center involved in study), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know
      about the study drug), placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study of ustekinumab in
      participants with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Participants will be screened to
      achieve all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria and will then receive either
      ustekinumab or placebo along with concomitant background medicine. Participants will be
      primarily assessed for response using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Response Index 2000
      (SRI-4). Participants' safety will be assessed throughout the study.
