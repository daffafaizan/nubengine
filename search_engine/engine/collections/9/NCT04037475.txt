      pain and aesthetic compromise. It is characterized by the formation of small vesicles that
      coalesce and rupture forming extremely painful ulcers, that evolve to crusts, dry
      desquamations until their complete remission. Currently, the treatment of these lesions is
      done with acyclovir. Although it diminishes the symptomatology, it causes viral resistance
      and does not prevent the recurrence of the lesions. It is known that photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) has numerous advantages, among them: the reduction of the time of remission, and does
      not cause resistance.

      Materials and methods: A total of 30 patients with herpes labialis in the prodromal stage of
      vesicles, ulcers, and crusts will be selected to participate in the study and randomized into
      two groups: G1 control and G2 experimental. After signing TCLE and TA, patients in group G1
      will undergo the standard gold treatment for cold sores with acyclovir and simulated PDT
      treatment. Patients in the experimental G2 group will be treated simulating the gold standard
      treatment of herpes labialis (placebo) and PDT. In all patients will be collected saliva
      samples for analysis of cytokines, and will be performed exfoliative cytology in the lesions.
      The pain will be assessed through a pain scale and a questionnaire of quality of life-related
      to oral health (Ohip- 14) will be given to them. Patients will continue to be followed up
      after 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year and, if there is a recurrence of the
      lesion, they will contact the researchers.
