      general anesthesia. Propofol injection is associated with pain that can be severe.

      The investigators also place a lidocaine/tetracaine skin patch (Synera) to decrease pain
      associated with IV placement. Because the local anesthetics of the Synera patch diffuse deep
      underneath the skin, in this study the investigators would like to evaluate whether the
      application of Synera Patch can decrease the pain associated with propofol injection.

      Children will be randomized to receive either the patch or the Ethyl Chloride before the IV
      placement. A total of 33 patients will be enrolled in each group.
