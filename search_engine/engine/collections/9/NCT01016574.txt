      Following the whole breast irradiation, a boost dose is given to the lumpectomy cavity, in
      order to further reduce the local recurrences in the immediate vicinity of the treated
      breast. The boost dose is usually applied with electrons, 6-18MEV. Sixteen Gy is the usual
      dose, 2 Gy/Fx, for 8 fractions.
