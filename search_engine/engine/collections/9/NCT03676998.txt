      Hospital to undertake a weaning program will be closely followed up to assess twice a week
      their diaphragm function. Only one experimental group will be constituted. Diaphragm function
      will be assessed with both 1) the phrenic nerves stimulation technique and 2) diaphragm
      ultrasound (thickness, thickening fraction). The time course evolution of the diaphragm
      function over the stay will be investigated and all potential factors involved in the change
      in diaphragm function will be determined.
