      recording the electrical activity of brain. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was proposed to
      decompose EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) which can obtain instantaneous
      frequency data and work well for data that is nonstationary and nonlinear.

      The relationship between frontal EEG patterns and hypnotics remain poorly understood. The
      investigators only can tell the increase in frontal EEG power and shift power to lower
      frequencies during general anesthesia from publications. The investigators are going to
      decompose EEG with HHT and find the energy shift during general anesthesia, compare with
      different anesthetics.

      The investigators will record 120 patients who received general anesthesia, their EEG data
      recorded from BIS machine for EMD analysis, the investigators decomposed EEG signal to
      different oscillations and tried to observe the differences between hypnotic medications
      through EEG analysis.
