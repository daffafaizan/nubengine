    
      Approximately fifty HIV/HCV coinfected patients with decompensated liver disease will be
      enrolled in the study. Ten (up to twenty) subjects will be treated with FDC SOF/LDV pre or
      post liver transplant and followed prospectively. Forty + subjects will be enrolled
      retrospectively with the intent to capture all patients who have been exposed to sofosbuvir
      based DAA therapies at participating sites since 1/2014, and to mirror the population being
      enrolled prospectively.

      In addition, participants in the retrospective arm will be contacted to consent to one
      prospective study visit for liver staging to determine rates of reversal of decompensation,
      reversal of cirrhosis and improvements in graft survival post treatment, and for future
      contact by the NIH Clinical Center to assess longer term outcomes when this study ends.
