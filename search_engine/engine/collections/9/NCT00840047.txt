      Primary objective:

        -  To estimate the success rate of Methionine (MET) for visualizing tumors at the time of
           diagnosis. The study hypothesizes that at least 70% of newly diagnosed tumors within
           each group will be studied and will be successfully visualized.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To compare uptake of MET in tumors with tumor grade in patients with newly diagnosed or
           relapsed, and/or persistent disease. Hypothesis: high grade tumors will concentrate
           higher amounts of MET than lower grade tumors measured both qualitatively and
           semi-quantitatively.

        -  To examine the bio-distribution of MET in organs that do not contain tumor, in
           particular the lungs, heart, mediastinum, liver, spleen, pancreas, muscle, brain, and
           bone marrow.

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To compare the findings on MET PET scans with those of standard imaging modalities,
           principally MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET CT
           (computed tomography) at diagnosis, or at study enrollment for patients with relapsed
           and or persistent disease, and for all patients over time.

        -  To compare the extent of abnormality on MRI with that of MET.

        -  To determine the presence or absence of elevated MET uptake beyond those of MRI defined
           abnormality.

        -  To explore the relationship between MET uptake and prognosis.
