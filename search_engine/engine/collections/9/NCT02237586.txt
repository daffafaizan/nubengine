      malaria in a controlled infection setting. The main objective is to characterise the role of
      sickle cell trait and naturally acquired immunity in development of malaria, defined by
      positive smear for P. falciparum and signs or symptoms associated with malaria. Three groups
      of volunteers will receive radical cure treatment and subsequently PfSPZ Challenge by IV
      administration. The groups are:

        1. Adults with naturally acquired immunity and HbAA (Group IA, n=10-20)

        2. Adults with naturally acquired immunity and HbAS (Group IS, n=10-20)

        3. Adults without previous exposure to malaria and HbAA (Group NI, n=5)

      The initial challenge dose of 3,200 PfSPZ administered once intravenously leads to consistent
      infection in na√Øve adults (15/15 in prior studies) and thus should infect all volunteers in
      Group 3. However, volunteers with naturally acquired immunity or sickle cell trait might
      require a higher dose. Thus if 50% or less of volunteers become parasitemic in Groups IA or
      IS, 10 additional volunteers will be enrolled and challenged with 12,800 PfSPZ. All
      volunteers will be healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years. Safety and infectivity data will be
      collected for each of the regimens and dose-levels. Effective treatment is initiated
      immediately upon development of parasitemia together with the presence of symptoms associated
      with malaria.

      Laboratory staff reading blood films and processing samples will be blinded to group
      allocation. Volunteers and clinical investigators will be blinded to group allocation among
      the IA and IS groups.
