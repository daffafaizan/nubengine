      sounds in a single sensor single indicator manner (5). In an effort to improve the
      situational awareness of the end user (6), we design and develop various visual metaphors and
      audible representations of information to communicate the past, present, and future status of
      a complex system. Our studies will identify the visual and auditory elements that optimize
      the presentation of critical domain specific information in an intuitive, meaningful manner
      as well as communicate critical events efficiently and saliently as they arise.
