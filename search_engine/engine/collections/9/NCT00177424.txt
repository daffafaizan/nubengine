      (PSMD), an illness that has a negative impact on post-stroke physical rehabilitation and is
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, early detection and
      successful treatment of post-stroke major depression improves, but does not normalize, stroke
      rehabilitation outcomes compared to stroke survivors who never developed post-stroke
      depression. Therefore, preventing the onset of PSMD and its associated disability is an
      attractive possibility. This study is a placebo controlled, 10-month double-blind trial of
      sertraline in the prevention of PSMD in stroke survivors, with a 2-month naturalistic
      continuation phase. The primary outcome will be the incidence of Major Depression
      post-stroke. Additional outcomes will include the severity of depressive symptoms post-stroke
      and the level of disability experienced by the two treatment groups. An exploratory analysis
      will also be conducted to elucidate participant characteristics that may be moderators of the
      participants' response to the preventive intervention, thereby refining the profile of
      disabled stroke survivors most likely to benefit from the preventive intervention.
