    
      This is a 3 day study to assess safety and tolerability of a new topical gel product, NVN1000
      with and without the application of a commercially available moisturizer in approximately 15
      healthy subjects. The test product will be applied to the forehead of healthy volunteers once
      daily for 3 days. One group of subjects will have a moisturizer applied to the same area 15
      minutes after the test gel was applied and one group of subjects will be treated with the gel
      vehicle which does not contain the active product. The hypothesis is that the application of
      moisturizer will not effect safety or local tolerability.
