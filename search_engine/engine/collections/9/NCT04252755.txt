      training protocols. The outcome measures of NFB efficacy have also varied widely. As
      mentioned above, the studies also used expensive, non-portable equipment which may limit the
      application of NFB in treatment settings. This study seeks to address these limitations by
      using a commercially-available neurotechnology, the Museâ„¢ headband by InteraXon (Toronto, ON,
      Canada) and using their standard NFB protocol built into the device application. This will
      maximize the standardization and portability of the NFB as essentially an "out of the box"
      intervention. The outcome measures will also capture multiple relevant domains, including
      clinical outcomes (e.g., drinking motivation) and neurocognitive performance (e.g., cognitive
      control / response inhibition).

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of NFB training on measures of
      cognitive control and alcohol motivation among young adults who engage in heavy episodic
      drinking (defined as exceeding 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for men/women).

      The study will examine whether NFB reduces motivation/attention and craving for alcohol and
      attentional bias to alcohol-related cues. The primary outcome will be assessed by changes in
      the alcohol purchase task and approach/avoidance task, which participants will complete pre-
      and post-NFB training.

      A secondary outcome is to determine whether NFB results in transfer of heightened
      fronto-cortical activity to improvements on general executive functioning following 8
      sessions of NFB training. The secondary outcome will be assessed via changes in
      neurocognitive tasks assessing behavioural inhibition, risky decision making, and executive
      functioning, all of which will be administered pre- and post-NFB training.
