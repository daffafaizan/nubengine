    
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an early 'palliative care'
      intervention consisting of anticipatory care planning coordinated in primary care that is
      systematically triggered when patients with poor prognosis gastrointestinal cancers start
      palliative oncology treatment.

      Patients will be identified and invited to participate during their assessment and treatment
      planning by the cancer care clinicians. A screening log will record eligible cases. Patients
      who consent will be randomised to receive a letter about the benefits of early anticipatory
      care planning to take to their preferred general practitioner to help trigger earlier support
      by their primary care team. Control patients receive usual care. All study patients will be
      asked to complete 3 questionnaires (EuroQol EQ-5D-5L (full title of tool), ICECAP Supportive
      Care Measure (full title of tool), and CollaboRATE (full title of tool) for shared
      decision-making) at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. A purposive sub-sample of patients,
      family carer and general practitioner (GP) triads will be invited for interview at around 6
      and 20 weeks to explore their experiences of trial participation, their illness and care.
      Health service use will be recorded including hospital admissions, oncology treatment,
      palliative care referral, time and place of death or survivorship.
