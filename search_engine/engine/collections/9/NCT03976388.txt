      improve adherence to current clinical guidelines. Methodology: A double-masked randomised
      trial will be held among students at the School of Medicine of the Universidad Andres Bello.
      Participants will be randomised to receive training using a clinical virtual simulator (Body
      InteractÂ®, Body Interact Inc, Austin, TX) designed to review key concepts in Cardiology.
      Students allocated to the control group will receive a small-group discussion lasting up to
      60 minutes in which key topics regarding the same clinical condition will be reviewed as
      well. Main outcomes include the overall performance in an objective structured clinical
      examination (OSCE) that will be reviewed by an expert panel prior to its implementation and
      adherence to specific recommendations in current national guidelines. This OSCE will be held
      15 days after the educational session has taken place. Analyses will be undertaken under the
      intention to treat principle and missing data will be handled using multiple imputation
      techniques.
