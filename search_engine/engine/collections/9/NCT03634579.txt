      low-risk process to an aggressive high-risk potentially fatal disease. Active surveillance
      has been introduced as an alternative treatment to patients with low- risk prostate
      cancers.Focal therapy techniques have been introduced in prostate cancer to destroy the tumor
      itself with adequate safety margin with the advantage of preserving the surrounding
      non-cancerous tissue. Thus maintaining disease control at acceptable levels, while minimizing
      complications.

      With the advent of multiparametric MRI (Mp-MRI), it is now possible to identify suspicious
      prostate gland focal lesions, determining their extent and targeting them for biopsy and
      focal ablation. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is well suited for MRI environment.
      Laser fibers are flexible so they can fit into the MRI gantry. Laser has been shown to
      produce homogenous tissue necrosis that can be monitored by real time temperature maps, a
      feature that facilitates effective and safe ablation.

      20 subjects with localized low and intermediate risk prostate cancer that meet the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. During baseline evaluation, subjects will undergo
      lab tests, MR imaging, and will complete QOL questionnaires. Subsequently, subjects will
      undergo the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Guided Focal Laser Interstitial Thermal Ablation
      procedure. Subjects will be followed immediately after the procedure, at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, one year and two years after procedure for adverse events and recurrence of prostate
      cancer
