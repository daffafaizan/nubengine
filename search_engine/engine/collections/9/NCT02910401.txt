    
      Primary objectives are:

      To determine whether RV increases expression of interleukin (IL)-25 transcripts by nasal
      epithelial cells in the asthma and AR but not control cohorts at the peak of infection (days
      3 and 4).

      To determine whether RV increases lower respiratory symptoms in the asthma but not AR and
      control cohorts.

      To determine whether asthmatics and allergic rhinitics will demonstrate an increased severity
      of infection in comparison to control subjects.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased IL-25 transcript
           expression over the course of RV infection

        2. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased expression of mRNA
           transcripts of a type 2 cytokine-inducing profile (IL-33 and thymic stromal
           lymphopoietin (TSLP)).

        3. To determine whether increased transcript expression of this type 2 cytokine-inducing
           profile can be corroborated as increased expression of protein.

        4. To determine whether RV infection in the asthma cohort is associated with increases in
           biomarkers of inflammation.

        5. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts
           will be associated with more symptoms.

        6. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts is
           related to decreased innate immunity.
