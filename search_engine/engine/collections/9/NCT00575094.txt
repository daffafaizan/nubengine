      the treatment of Japanese subjects with CAP. Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of CAP
      who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered for enrollment. Qualifying subjects
      will be assigned to receive tigecycline via IV administration for 7 to 14 consecutive days.
      The exact duration of administration of the study drug will be at the discretion of the
      investigator, based on the subject's condition. Subjects will be followed for safety until
      the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment 10 to 21 days after the last dose of therapy, and for
      efficacy until TOC assessment.
