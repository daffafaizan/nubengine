      and following NAC. Samples from initial subjects (Cohort A; n~6) will be used primarily for
      validation of biomarker assays in nasal filter paper eluates. Validated biomarker assays will
      be applied to analyze biomarker changes in a further cohort of subjects (Cohort B; n~12) with
      the aim of fully defining the optimum panel and sampling time points for future studies.
