        -  Measures of patient activation, patient self-management, treatment adherence, patient
           satisfaction with care, and disease specific knowledge.

        -  Process measures relevant to appropriate care for CVD, CHF, and DM.

        -  Clinical markers of cardiovascular or diabetes morbidity and risk.

      These aims will be evaluated in one-year prospective study. Patients who use the portal will
      be randomized to control (i.e., access to routine portal-related information) and
      intervention groups (i.e., targeted and periodic messages designed to capture data relevant
      to self-management; to improve knowledge of their specific disease, tests, and risks; to
      devise time-dependent goals; and to motivate self-efficacy). Outcomes including activation,
      satisfaction, and adherence will be measured by telephone interview prior to and one year
      after intervention, and by lab and clinical measures and data available from the EHR. We will
      also evaluate potential selection issues among those who sign on to the e-portal by
      administering the same baseline interview to a matched (by disease and by age) random sample
      of patients who do not sign on to the e-portal.

      Patients with chronic diseases are likely to experience particular benefit from online
      e-health resources as they have greater information needs and participate in
      self-management.(Camer, 2000) Unlike traditional office visits, online interactions eliminate
      the need to travel, are always available and give the patient access to a broad range of
      information, helping them actively participate in their own care.(Brown, 1999) There is
      growing evidence that patient education and engagement using e-health applications results in
      improved patient outcomes in the care of chronic illnesses, improved patient-physician
      communication, and reduction of anxiety for caregivers.(Brennan et al., 2001; Bronson et al.,
      1986; Bronson & O'Meara, 1986; Ross et al., 2003a, 2003b) We anticipate demonstrating
      clinically meaningful improvements in chronic disease health status, using evidence-based
      science delivered in behaviorally-validated ways.
