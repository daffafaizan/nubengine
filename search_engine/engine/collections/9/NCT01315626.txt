      (Description in Appendix A). As part of the educational intervention, primary care
      physician(s) will be trained in the use of an algorithm to guide assessment of patients seen
      with a respiratory chief complaint, and who have not previously been identified as having a
      diagnosis of BE. We propose an evaluation of three primary care practice(s) to compare the
      number of patients identified in three three-month periods as having a diagnosis of BE.

      The evaluation periods will be as follows: Period 1) the three-month period immediately
      following the intervention, Period 2) the three-month period immediately preceding the
      intervention, Period 3) the three month period starting one year prior to the intervention.
