      concurrently with panitumumab in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck. This protocol addresses patients with medical comorbidities that make them
      poor candidates for concurrent chemotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment will be directed at
      disease visible on diagnostic imaging modalities and the ipsilateral hemi-neck, sparing
      elective regions in the contralateral N0 hemi-neck with less than 20% chance of microscopic
      involvement. We explore the following hypothesis: Can acceptable locoregional disease control
      be obtained with less treatment-related morbidity by focusing RT on regions of gross disease,
      sparing regions with a low risk of harboring subclinical disease from elective RT?
