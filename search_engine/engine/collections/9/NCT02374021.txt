      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment arm with either synthetic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [triple therapy: sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and
      hydroxychloroquine] or biologic DMARDs [etanercept or adalimumab, plus background
      methotrexate for all subjects and hydroxychloroquine for subjects who were taking this at
      screening].

      Once randomized, a baseline visit will be conducted with each subject. Baseline data
      collection includes questionnaires, disease activity score, and the first FDG-PET/CT imaging.
      After the baseline at week 0, subjects will visit with their rheumatologist at weeks 6, 12,
      18, and 24 for safety labs and further collection of disease activity scores and
      questionnaires. The second FDG-PET/CT will be performed at week 24. Blood specimens will be
      collected at weeks 0, 6, 18, and 24 for bioassays. Subject participation will end after the
      week 24 visit.

      Patients and care providers will be unblinded. The FDG-PET/CT image readers will be blinded
      to treatment arm as well as timepoint of image acquisition.
