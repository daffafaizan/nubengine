      hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia often presenting in the pediatric population. The
      underlying pathogenesis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is poorly understood but likely
      involves dysregulation of the immune system, and the majority of patients respond to steroid
      therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, relapses are common, with at
      least one relapse occurring in up to 90% of patients. Frequently-relapsing patients may be
      exposed large amounts of steroids and other immunosuppressants with a multitude of adverse
      effects, while others may not even respond to these treatments. Therefore, novel therapies
      are being studied.

      Vagus nerve stimulation is a novel therapy with the potential to treat inflammatory
      conditions via inhibition of cytokine release by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the use of vagus nerve stimulation in the
      prevention of nephrotic syndrome relapses and treatment of proteinuria in pediatric patients
      with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.

      Patients will be enrolled if they have frequently-relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or
      proteinuria which does not respond to steroid therapy. These patients will perform daily
      transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve stimulation (taVNS) therapy 5 minutes a day for a 6
      month period and will be monitored for urine/bloodwork or clinical signs of nephrotic
      syndrome relapse.
