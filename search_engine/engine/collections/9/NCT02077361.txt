      medical records will determine patient eligibility. Patients will receive a subretinal
      injection of the rAAV2.REP1 vector by a trained vitreoretinal surgeon in one eye. Each
      patient will be followed up for 24 months after treatment to assess the primary and secondary
      endpoints of this study using a number of outcome measures. However, further follow-up will
      continue after the study on an annual basis for a minimum of ten years. Data will continue to
      be analyzed by members of the study group after this study is complete.
