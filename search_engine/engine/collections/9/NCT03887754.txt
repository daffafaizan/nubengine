      disabilities in skills associated with overall behavior and communication. The term (ASD)
      includes Autistic Disorder (AD), Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified
      (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's Disorder .

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment in which patients inside a hyperbaric chamber
      breathe a concentrated oxygen pressurized more than sea level (1 atmosphere absolute) .

      It was obvious that autistic children may have some benefits of HBOT by increasing in
      cerebral perfusion during treatment. Inhalation of more pressurized oxygen might elevate
      partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood, and increased oxygen that reaches the brain
      . Another mechanism of action of HBOT that it might have anti-inflammatory properties by
      reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukins 1 and 6, interferon-γ, and tumor
      necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, HBOT might enhance mitochondrial dysfunction, and upregulate
      the antioxidant enzymes production.

      Risperidone is a second generation antipsychotic, approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for treatment of autism-related irritability. Its approved in 2006 only
      for children not less than 5 years old . This trial aimed to study the effects of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy and/or Risperidone in management symptoms of autism.
