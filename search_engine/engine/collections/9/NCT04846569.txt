      transmission to 2.7%, however, optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence remains a
      difficult goal to reach, particularly postpartum. Longitudinal qualitative research reveals a
      variety of facilitators and barriers to the transition from pregnancy to postpartum including
      employment/financial concerns, logistical concerns around childcare and breastfeeding,
      worries about vertical transmission and difficulties bonding. This intervention draws on the
      growing cadre of community health workers within the South African health care system and
      Transition Theory to develop a behavioral intervention to support women living with HIV
      through the transition from pregnancy to postpartum. The investigators are conducting a small
      scale pilot study to compare the impact of a Transition Theory-based intervention to enhanced
      standard of care on self-reported ART adherence and engagement in ART services among pregnant
      and postpartum women living with HIV.
