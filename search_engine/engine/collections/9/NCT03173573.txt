      first-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following single oral
      administration of FDL176 to healthy male participants. Part 2 is a single dose, open-label
      study in healthy male participants to determine the effect of food on the PK profile of
      FDL176. Part 3 is a single dose, double blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy female
      participants to assess the PK, safety and tolerability profiles of FDL176. Part 4 is a
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and PK profiles following multiple oral administrations of FDL176 to healthy
      male and female participants. Part 5 is a single dose, open-label study in male and female
      participants with CF to determine the PK profile of FDL176.
