    
      Smartphone Impact Scale (SIS) was originally developed in English to determine the cognitive,
      affective, social, and behavioral impacts of smartphones in everyday life. The purpose of
      this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIS instrument into Turkish and
      investigate its psychometric properties. Two hundred healthy young adults will include. For
      cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation procedure.
      Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants completed the Turkish
      version of SIS (SIS-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (Î±) was used to
      assess internal consistency. The correlations with the Turkish version of the Smartphone
      Addiction Scale (SAS-T) and Turkish version of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP-T) will
      determine to check the validity.
