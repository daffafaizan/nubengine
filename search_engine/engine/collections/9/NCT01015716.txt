      workability and physical fitness. Most studies have focused on increasing physical fitness in
      order to increase workability and to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and sick leave. Studies
      however also show that many health care workers are obese and obesity has been linked to poor
      workability.

      Limited research is available on the effect of reducing body-weight in this group in order to
      increase workability and to decrease musculoskeletal disorders and sick leave.

      This study introduces a combined worksite based lifestyle intervention consisting of physical
      exercise, dietary counseling and cognitive behavioral training aimed at reducing weight in
      health care workers.

      On specific worksites, health care workers are cluster randomized to either intervention or
      control group.

      Effects on physical capacity, body composition, musculoskeletal disorders, workability and
      sick leave are evaluated before and after a 1 year intervention period
