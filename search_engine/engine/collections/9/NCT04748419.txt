      to 10Gy x 2 fractions in a 3+3 design. Consolidative hfRT will be delivered one to two months
      after finishing definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT) and concurrently with adjuvant
      anti-PD-L1 therapy using durvalumab in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      At the final determined consolidative hfRT dose level, a total of thirty-two subjects with
      pathologically documented stage III NSCLC treated with dCRT will be enrolled for data
      analyses.

      Follow-up assessments will occur every 3 months during durvalumab therapy for the first two
      years, then every 4-6 months after 2 years from study registration until confirmed disease
      progression or death. Primary endpoints include the safety of boost hfRT and concurrent
      anti-PD-L1 therapy adjuvantly following dCRT, and the 12-month progression-free survival to
      compare with historical results.
