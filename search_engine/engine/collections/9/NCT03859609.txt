      insufficient adaptation of the fused spine to the proper individual spinal alignment. In the
      recent years, comprehensive understanding of spinal alignment and definition of several
      parameters contributed to develop score systems to evaluate the alignment of the multilevel
      spinal fusion and to predict failure. In the following study the results of multilevel spinal
      fusion were evaluated retrospectively according to two scoring systems: GAP-score und
      Schwab-score. The predictive value of each score system is analyzed by the correlation of the
      failure rate with its corresponding score value.
