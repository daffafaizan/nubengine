    
      This study is an open-label (both physician and patient know the name of the study drug),
      multicenter (more than one site) study of siltuximab in patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma receiving siltuximab in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are
      distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body over time), efficacy and
      immunogenicity (the ability to induce immune responses). This study is planned with a dose
      escalation of siltuximab to levels of 5.5 mg/kg (Dose Level 1) and 11.0 mg/kg (Dose Level 2)
      given intravenously. Recommended doses will be determined based on the incidence of
      dose-limiting toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma when
      siltuximab at dose levels of 5.5 mg/kg and 11.0 mg/kg is administered with
      bortezomib/dexamethasone. Treatment with siltuximab will be started at Dose Level 1, and
      treatment at Dose Level 2 will not be started until completing the safety evaluation at the
      end of the observation period of Cycle 1 for all patients at Dose level 1. Once 11.0 mg/kg is
      determined as a recommended dose, the dose for patients whose starting dose is 5.5 mg/kg, and
      who have not achieved complete response, can be escalated to 11.0 mg/kg based on patient
      consent and investigator discretion in the next cycle. Siltuximab will be given at 5.5 or
      11.0 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 1 hour on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until
      progression. Twice-weekly intravenous administration of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (Days 1, 4, 8,
      and 11) will be followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 12-21). Four-per-week oral
      administration of dexamethasone 20 mg (Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12) will be followed by
      a 9-day rest period (Days 13-21).
