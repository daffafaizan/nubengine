      changes in stress outcome measures (self-report questionnaire, genomic expression,
      biochemical assay) in moderately to severely stressed healthy subjects randomized to one of
      three health education interventions at both end-intervention and at a 6-month long-term
      follow-up. This study will also determine which of the different outcome measures exhibit the
      greatest degree of sensitivity, reliability and consistency at both end-intervention and
      long-term follow-up.
