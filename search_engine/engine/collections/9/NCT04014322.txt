      those with psychiatric conditions, and the risks and potential benefits of e-cigarette use
      have been the topic of much debate. More research is needed to understand the impact of
      e-cigarette use on smoking behavior and smoking-related cognitions among individuals with
      psychiatric conditions.

      This study will investigate the effects of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking and
      motivation/readiness to quit among smokers with psychiatric disorders who are not yet ready
      to quit smoking. A total of 50 adult daily cigarette smokers who are receiving outpatient
      psychiatric treatment and not yet ready to quit smoking will be recruited. All participants
      will be instructed to switch completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the
      next 8 weeks. E-cigarettes will be provided to participants at no cost. Participants will
      also be asked to complete 5 (remote and in-person) assessment sessions (i.e., baseline,
      2-week, 4-week, 8-week and 12-week follow-ups).
