      Aim 1: Add a "SUDEP module" to CHICA to identify children at increased risk of SUDEP, provide
      patient education materials that the clinician can share with the families, and recommend
      timelier follow-up with a child neurologist. The SUDEP module will be added to the existing
      installation of CHICA in the Eskenazi Health System in Indianapolis, IN so that SUDEP risk
      screening and advice are generated automatically in the setting of routine primary care in
      the 5 Eskenazi clinics.

      Aim 2: Interview families of patients with epilepsy to determine if their pediatricians
      shared the SUDEP information and/or referred them to their neurologist. Families whose
      children are at risk for SUDEP will be identified through CHICA. The investigators will
      utilize the Pediatric Practice-based Research Network (PResNet) to follow-up these families
      by phone after their visits with the pediatrician. PResNet will determine if SUDEP was
      discussed, if a handout was provided, and if SUDEP has been discussed previously by their
      pediatrician or neurologist.

      Aim 3: The investigators will assess physician and staff satisfaction regarding the SUDEP
      module of CHICA. Each year, PResNet will conduct a satisfaction survey among the clinic
      physicians and staff that use CHICA. The survey consists of general questions about CHICA
      that are asked every year and module-specific questions about new functionality that has been
      added.
