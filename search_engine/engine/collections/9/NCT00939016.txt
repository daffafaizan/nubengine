      restraint, social desirability, and food type ("healthy" vs. "unhealthy") on the accuracy of
      reporting consumption of a laboratory meal during a 24-hour dietary recall. The automated
      multiple-pass method (AMPM) of 24-hour dietary recall is considered the gold standard of
      dietary assessment however the potential for error and biases is widely acknowledged with a
      tendency towards underreporting. Underreporting has been linked to many factors including two
      individual characteristics, dietary restraint and social desirability. Both dietary restraint
      and social desirability have been extensively studied however the influence of their
      interaction on reported dietary intake is not fully understood. In addition, a relationship
      to the types of foods (healthy vs. unhealthy) has also been found. For this study, 40
      normal-weight female participants will be recruited at The University of Tennessee using
      flyers inviting volunteers. Participants will be categorized by dietary restraint, high or
      low, and social desirability, high or low, based on questions during the initial screening.
      In a laboratory setting participants will consume a meal of pre-weighed foods, including both
      "healthy" and "unhealthy" foods. The following day, an AMPM 24-hr dietary recall will be
      conducted with the participant over the telephone. Accuracy of the reported dietary intake of
      the laboratory meal will be determined by the equation [(reported intake - measured
      intake)]/measured intake] x100 for amount (weight or volume) and energy (kilocalories) with
      comparisons between groups and within food types using mixed factorial analysis of variance.
