      and postural instability. Current treatments primarily focus on replacement of dopamine to
      compensate for the degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neuronal
      population. Though dopamine treats many of the motor symptoms of PD, postural instability
      (which often leads to falls) typically is least responsive to therapy. More recently, the
      degeneration of the cholinergic system arising from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) in the
      brainstem has been implicated in gait dysfunction in PD. Striatal cholinergic inputs are
      supplied from the PPN both via the intralaminar complex of the thalamus and through direct
      inputs. The primary subtypes of cholinergic receptors present in the striatum are nicotinic
      and include α4β2, α6β2, and α7 receptors. Varenicline (Chantix) is a novel partial α4β2
      agonist and full α7 agonist developed as an aid for smoking cessation and has been shown in
      initial studies to improve imbalance in patients with inherited spinocerebellar ataxia. The
      unique method of action of varenicline may make it an ideal drug for the treatment of balance
      impairment in PD.
