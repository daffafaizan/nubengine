      concentration under total intravenous anesthesia differences between young and elderly must
      be modeled. Method: adaptative clinical trial (Dixon's Up and Down method) for determination
      of ED95% of propofol concentration (plasmatic, Marsh model) for hypnosis (BIS ranging from 40
      to 60) under general anesthesia for young and elderly adults.
