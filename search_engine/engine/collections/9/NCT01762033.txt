    
      LT1009-Onc-002 is a Phase 2a open-label, multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of ASONEP (sonepcizumab/LT1009) monotherapy in subjects with advanced,
      unresectable, refractory RCC who have previously failed up to 3 therapies, including VEGF
      and/or mTOR inhibitors. Two cohorts will be enrolled for a total of up to 39 subjects.
      Subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ASONEPâ„¢ over 90 minutes at 24 mg/kg
      once a week and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.
      Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 22 subjects. A second cohort of up to 17 subjects will be
      enrolled if at least 12 out of 22 subjects from Cohort 1 demonstrated PFS at 8 weeks. Weekly
      dosing will take place from the date of randomization until the date of first documented
      progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first.
