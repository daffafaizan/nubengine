      assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in hospitalized adult (18-99 years old) male
      and female patients with SARS-CoV-2 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and have
      serologic markers of inflammation but do not need mechanical ventilation (see Inclusion
      criteria). Sixty patients will be recruited to receive tofacitinib or placebo in addition to
      standard of care (SOC) in a 1:1 ratio.

      Subjects will be screened during hospitalization. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
      infection, and meeting all other Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, will be randomized to
      either treatment with tofacitinib or placebo in addition to SOC during hospitalization (dose
      adjusted, if required), with the exception of pre-specified immunomodulatory agents (as
      documented in the inclusion/exclusion criteria). Tofacitinib will be administered in a dose
      of 10 mg PO BID until return to their clinical baseline (as defined by need for supplementary
      oxygen), and will continue to be administered at 5 mg PO BID for a total duration of therapy
      of 14 days; follow-up off tofacitinib will continue up to Day 90. We anticipate completion of
      subject recruitment in 6 months.
