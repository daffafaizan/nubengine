      I. To develop and validate a clinical risk prediction model using clinical factors for the
      development of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy
      regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective measures of chemotherapy induced
      peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to better define the phenotype of peripheral neuropathy in this
      patient population.

      II. To assess the incidence of CIPN within one year in this patient population. III. To
      identify predictors of treatment dose reductions, delays, and discontinuations associated
      with CIPN symptoms in this patient population.

      OTHER OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect serum and plasma samples for future testing for biomarker and mechanistic
      studies of CIPN.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive chemotherapy regimen per treating physician for 52 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete questionnaires at weeks
      4, 8, 12, 24 and 52.
