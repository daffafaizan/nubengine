      most commonly affects the skeleton. Bone metastases are the cause of significant morbidity
      and mortality in these patients, and require long-term management. Study participants in this
      research study will have a diagnosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to
      bone.

      Cabozantinib is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      people for castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to bone or for any other type of
      cancer. Giving cabozantinib to human cancer patients is experimental. Cabozantinib is
      currently being given to patients on other studies. Cabozantinib is known to have anti-tumor
      effects and to reduce bone metastases based on early clinical studies in prostate cancer and
      other cancers. The drug is known to have side effects. The most common side effects were
      fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, rash, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome. To
      date, it is not known if cabozantinib is safe and/or effective.
