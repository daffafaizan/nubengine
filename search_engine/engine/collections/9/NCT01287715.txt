      children. Etanercept has proven to be an effective treatment for JIA. Considering the risk of
      occurrence of long-term side-effects and to prevent the burden of the weekly injections and
      costs, it is a logical step to discontinue etanercept after reaching remission (no disease
      activity for at least six months). Especially since there are concerns about the long-term
      effect of suppressing the immune system with etanercept. However, little is known about if
      successful discontinuation is possible or when to stop. Risk is that the disease might flare
      (reactivate) again.

      For this study, JIA patients in remission will be selected from the ABC-register (an
      observational study including all Dutch JIA patients who use etanercept). Eligible patients
      will be randomized to stop etanercept or continue it for another 9 months. Patients are
      followed with standard visits evaluating disease activity until 12 months after
      discontinuation of etanercept. In case of a disease flare etanercept therapy will be
      reintroduced immediately and the patient will be treated according to the insight of their
      treating physician. Expected is that JIA patients who were in remission for more than 12
      months before discontinuation have a better chance to retain remission.
