      Aspergillus fumigatus associated with azole treatment failure. Multiple amino acid
      substitutions in the cyp51A gene have been described to be associated with azole resistance
      that emerges during azole treatment, while a resistance mechanism, TR34/L98H mutation in
      cyp51A, has been linked to the agricultural use of azole fungicides in Europe, which have
      also been widely used in Taiwan for years. The current prevalence of azole-resistant
      Aspergillus isolates and mechanisms of azole resistance in Taiwan is not clear. Considering
      the potential of geographic migration of resistant isolates from neighboring countries and
      the possibility of emergence of locally revolved resistant strains, this 2-year multi-center
      project aims to investigate the prevalence rate of azole resistance in Aspergillus clinical
      and environmental isolates, to determine the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance, and to
      describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of Aspergillus diseases in
      Taiwan. Clinical and environmental Aspergillus isolates will be collected and examined, and
      clinical data from patients with Aspergillus diseases or colonization will be retrieved and
      analyzed. Through this study the investigators anticipate increase in awareness of prevalence
      and impact of azole resistance in patient safety in participating hospitals. In addition, the
      investigators may update Taiwan treatment guideline for aspergillosis on the basis of these
      evidence and knowledge.
