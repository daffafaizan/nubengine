      invasive growth which that cannot be removed endoscopically. In case of high risk of
      conversion endoscopic procedure the patient will be discussed on MD consillium. All of them
      will be informed about the possibility of resection methods in the absence of using
      endoscopic technics. Then the patients will be prepared for the operation in accordance with
      the method adopted in the clinic. At first colonoscopy will be performed in the operating
      room. Those patients for whom to perform endoscopic removal of the formation is impossible
      will be randomized intraoperatively using an Internet resource into 2 groups (main and
      comparison group).

      The patients of the main group will undergo to hybrid laparo-endoscopic operation and
      comparative group - to laparoscopic colon resection.

      After surgical procedure a pathomorphological examination of the speciments will performed
      with assessment of its quality. Postoperative complications in both groups will be recorded
      in accordance with the Clavien-Dindo classification. The level of postoperative pain will
      also be registred according to the visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Also we will be study
      the time of activation of patients, patient self-care scope according to the Bartell scale,
      postoperative hospital stay will be assessed.
