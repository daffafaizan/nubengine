    
      We will equip several local advanced life support ambulances with a low cost video
      laryngoscope for a total of 12 months. We will outfit ½ of the ambulance crews with the King
      Video Laryngoscope (KVL) for 6 months while the other ½ of the ambulances will use
      traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL). After 6 months, the groups will switch devices. We will
      randomly assign those ambulances that first use the KVL. After one year (12 months) we will
      compare the outcomes between the two methods including first pass intubation success, total
      success rate for intubation, and complications (need for surgical airway, rescue device, need
      to revert from KVL to DL, etc.). Please see the attached protocol page for additional
      details.
