      Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly
      improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been
      used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both
      in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs
      as an alternative for antibody induction therapy. Moreover, we examine if MSCs could improve
      the recovery of early function in transplanted kidney.
