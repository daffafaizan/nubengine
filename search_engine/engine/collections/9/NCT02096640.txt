      (TNF-alfa, interleukin 1, 6, 10) at 24 hrs following the start of the surgical procedure? Are
      there differences between the two arms in the incidence of postoperative complications (i.e.
      bleeding, incidence of stomal infections, tracheal tube dislocation, airway compromisation),
      postoperative pulmonary infection (during the stay in the ICU) and pulmonary function (FEV1,
      dynamic complicance, oxygen demand, time to weaning off the ventilator: all measured daily
      during the ICU-stay), postoperative mobilization (time to mobilization to sitting, standing
      and walking, respectively)?
