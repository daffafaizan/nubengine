      wish to participate will send a data sharing letter to the PI of the study. Once the TWU
      SCOPE research team has received the data sharing letter, a clinical data packet will then be
      distributed to the therapist through the U.S. mail or an email will be sent containing a web
      address link to http://www.myweb.twu.edu/~ttioseco for access to the clinical data packet via
      the internet. Those therapists who collect ten pieces or more of de-identified data and send
      them to the TWU SCOPE research team will receive an incentive in the form of a gift card.

      No risks are involved because data collected is without any personal identifiers.
