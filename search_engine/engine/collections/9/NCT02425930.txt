      The complement C3 is the point of convergence for the three complement activation pathways.
      However, the concrete effect of C3 in the development of gastric cancer is still obscured.
      This study is designed to explore whether complement C3 can be regarded as a predictive
      factor of postoperative outcomes for postoperative patients with gastric cancer.

      This study is designed as a prospective cohort study and included consecutively treated
      patients. The perioperative plasma value of complement components, such as C3, C4, and CH50,
      are detected to explore the incidence rate of complement depletion. All enrolled patients are
      divided into two groups mainly according to the levels of preoperative C3 levels (C3
      depletion and Non-C3 depletion groups). The primary endpoints are the 1-year overall survival
      and disease-free survival, while the secondary endpoints are postoperative complications,
      length of hospital stay, and hospital charges.

      This study would be helpful to confirm the role of complement depletion in anticipated
      outcomes of postoperative patients with gastric cancer.
