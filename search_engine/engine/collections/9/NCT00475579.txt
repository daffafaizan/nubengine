      the channels within folds of the cuff wall, to the lower respiratory tract causing VAP.
      Subglottic secretion drainage (SSD) appears to be effective in preventing VAP, primarily by
      reducing early-onset pneumonia; but it may not prevent late-onset pneumonia. We set out the
      hypothesis that using an endotracheal tube incorporating, besides of a subglottic secretion
      drainage lumen, a polyurethane cuff (which reduces channel formation and fluids leakage from
      the subglottic area) it should be also possible to reduce the incidence of late-onset VAP.
