      undergoing caesarean section in spinal anesthesia when 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor
      antagonists were used prophylactically.

      Due to this fact in our clinic the standard procedure was changed. All patients for caesarean
      section receive Granisetron before spinal anesthesia.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the usage and dose of sympathomimetics during
      spinal anesthesia.

      Therefore the investigators will evaluate approximately 120 participants who received
      granisetron and 120 participants who did not receive 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor
      antagonists.
