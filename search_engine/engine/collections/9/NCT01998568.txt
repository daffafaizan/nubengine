      tonometry were performed in enucleated cadaver eyes, or contact lens-induced corneal edema
      eyes. Thus, it remains unclear as to how the clinical corneal edema that is found in routine
      clinical practice will affect the variation of intraocular pressure measurement using the
      standard Goldmann applanation tonometer and other more modern tonometers such as the dynamic
      contour tonometer, the iCare, and the Tonopen.
