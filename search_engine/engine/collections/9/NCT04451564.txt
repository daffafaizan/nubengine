    
      the present study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 3 time points:
      before the intervention, after completion of the intervention and 3-months after completion
      of the intervention. Eighty FM patients will be randomly assigned to either the MORE
      intervention (N=40) or to a wait-list control group (N=40). Additionally a comparison group
      of healthy women (N=20) will be enrolled. The MORE intervention consists of eight 2-hour long
      group sessions administered weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Before and after the
      intervention, FM participants will undergo [18F] DOPA Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
      functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging while performing a monetary reward task. The
      primary outcome will be endogeneous DA changes measured with [18F] DOPA PET at baseline,
      after the intervention (after 8 weeks for control group), and at 3 months' follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes will be (1) clinical pain measures and FM symptoms using standardized
      clinical scales 2) functional brain changes 3) measures of negative and positive affect,
      stress and reward experience in daily life using the Experience Sampling method (ESM) 4)
      biological measures of stress including cortisol and alpha-amylase.

      Design: If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of MORE in restoring DA
      function, reducing pain and improving mood symptoms, MORE can be judged to be a promising
      means to improve quality of life in FM patients. The findings of this trial may inform health
      care providers about the potential use of the MORE intervention as a possible
      non-pharmacological intervention for FM.
