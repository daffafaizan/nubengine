      radiology departments and imaging in adult-sized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners is
      associated with significant safety and image quality issues. For these reasons, the potential
      of MRI for diagnosing disease in neonates has yet to be fully realized. The overreaching goal
      of our research effort is to bring high-performance MRI into the NICU so that neonates can
      benefit from the same quality of diagnostic imaging as adults. To accomplish this we have
      converted a commercial small-bore 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner designed for orthopedic use into
      a neonatal MRI system optimized for whole body imaging of neonates. The purpose of this
      initial study is to determine the safety of the customized scanner installed in the NICU at
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and gather preliminary data on image
      quality in a group of 10 medically stable infants admitted to the CCHMC NICU.
