    
      This is a prospective cohort pilot study at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) that will
      explore the source of presumed CLABSI, which we believe may actually have multiple possible
      sources including MBI. We plan to enroll all inpatient children at BCH who meet the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of MBI-LCBI as well as children who meet
      the criteria for CLABSI without MBI. For all enrolled patients, we will collect samples from
      the oral cavity, respiratory tract, skin, and stool. These samples will be cultured in order
      to see if the same microbial species and strain(s) growing from the blood also grow from
      these other sites. Cultures will then have isolated colonies selected for whole-genome DNA
      sequencing to allow assessment of genomic diversity between body sites. Stool and blood
      samples will be tested for markers of MBI. All patient enrollment and sample collection will
      be done at BCH.
