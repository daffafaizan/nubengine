    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which dose of Campath (alemtuzumab) allows related and unrelated human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-II mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with an
      incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) less than 40%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of graft rejection.

      II. Number of days of steroids >= 1mg/kg required before day 100 in each patient.

      III. Incidence of non-relapse mortality.

      IV. Risk/incidence of infections.

      V. Immune reconstitution.

      VI. Risk for disease progression and relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) over 6
      hours once daily on days -6, -5, and -4 OR days -5 and -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV over
      30 minutes on days -4, -3, and -2. Patients also undergo low-dose total-body irradiation
      (TBI) on day 0.

      ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): After completion of TBI,
      patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or IV every 12 hours on days -3
      to 180 followed by a taper until day 365 in the absence of GVHD. Beginning 4-6 hours after
      completion of allogeneic PBSCT, patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO every 8 hours on
      days 0 to 100 followed by a taper until day 156 in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months, at
      18 months, and then annually for 5 years.
