    
      This is a mutli center, prospective ,single arm study enrolling up to 60 patients at up to 12
      centers in New Zealand and Europe.

      The purpose is to prospectively collect information to evaluate the safety and performance of
      the Akesys Prava Sirolimus eluting bioresorbable scaffold system in peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) Patients will be treated with the investigational device and followed up
      clinically at 1 month, 6 Months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months post procedure.

      Patients will undergo non-invasive assessments such as Duplex Ultrasound (DUS),
      Ankle/Brachial Index (ABI) measurements and will complete a Walking Impairment Questionnaire
      (WIQ) and Quality of Life Questionnaire (VASCUQoL) at each follow up interval.

      Data will be collected via electronic data capture (EDC) and reportable Events will be
      reviewed by a medical monitor and classified using the MedDRA system. The information entered
      by the research centres will be source data verified (monitored) by an independent Contract
      Research Organisation (CRO.) A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with appropriately qualified
      members independent of the study will meet to review and adjudicate on events at
      predetermined intervals, according to the charter.

      Primary safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 6 months There will be no formal
      hypothesis testing in the study, endpoints will be evaluated with 95% confidence intervals
      around the observed point estimates. The endpoints will be evaluated with Kaplan-Meier
      methodology.
