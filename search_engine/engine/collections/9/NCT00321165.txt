    
      Two hypotheses will be tested in the AOT trial:

        1. The use of taurolidine as an antibiotic lock (5 mL) to flush the central line after
           infusing the TPN formulation, when compared to the present use of heparin solution (5
           mL, 150 E/mL) decreases the rate of catheter-related infections in HPN patients

        2. Implementation of the acridine orange staining test allows an earlier diagnosis (or
           rejection of this diagnosis) compared to culture results. Importantly, in the present
           trial the results of this test will not be used for treatment decisions.

      To this end, patients who are admitted to the clinical ward because of suspected central line
      infection (mostly because of fever and/or chills) will be treated according to the current
      protocol for catheter sepsis, after obtaining central line and peripheral blood cultures.
      This protocol includes the administration of medicinase through the central line and i.v.
      antibiotics peripherally. After obtaining informed consent, in addition 5 cc of EDTA blood
      will be drawn from the central line to perform (within 24 hours) the acridine orange cytospin
      staining test and a Gram stain. These results will than be compared to the culture results.
      Based on culture results, the antibiotics will be tailored.

      If the patient recovers and TPN administration can be restarted, randomisation between
      heparin lock (5 mL, 150 E/mL) versus taurolidine lock solution 2% (5 mL) will take place. In
      case the catheter has to be removed because of ongoing or recurrent sepsis, randomisation
      takes place after a new central line has been placed and the patient continues on TPN.

      A new episode of proven catheter sepsis is considered as the primary end-point.
