      indication for ablation treatment. These include patients with low grade dysplasia (LGD),
      high grade dysplasia (HGD) or residual Barrett's after a complete endoscopic resection of a
      lesion containing HGD or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Ablation treatment will be performed by
      the EndoRotor ablation device, followed by surveillance endoscopy at 3 months where the
      feasibility for ablation will be assessed. During the 3 months follow-up, all adverse events
      such as perforation, post-procedural bleeding, stricture, and pain will be registered.

      The EndoRotorÂ® System is in automated mechanical endoscopic mucosal resection system for use
      in the gastrointestinal tract. The EndoRotor suctions up the tissue and cuts it,
      automatically sending the tissue to a collection trap for histological evaluation.
