      functional goals including the ability to work and perform daily tasks. Cognitive Remediation
      Therapy (CRT) is a psychological therapy developed to improve cognitive functions in people
      with schizophrenia but ultimately with a focus on improving social and functional outcomes.
      There is evidence that CRT is effective in improving cognition and functioning but there is
      still a limited understanding of the mechanisms responsible for different treatment
      responses. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and testing a new form of CRT,
      which will personalise therapy elements according to participants' characteristics. The
      therapy will consist of task practice using a computerised Cognitive Remediation software and
      supervised activities supported by a therapist to boost functioning. The knowledge gathered
      in this work will contribute to develop the next generation of personalised treatment
      approaches for people with schizophrenia.
