      traditional wound management principles is restrictive, and a treatment paradigm aimed at
      high-energy projectile contaminated wounds suits the requirements of our combat casualty care
      program. The nature of war wounds makes them unsuitable for conventional, saline-soaked-gauze
      dressings.

      Extra-corporeal-shockwave-therapy (ESWT) has been used successfully for orthopedic soft
      tissue indications. Pilot studies indicate that ESWT enhances tissue healing through
      growth-factor release and neovascularization, with favorable safety profile and
      anti-bacterial effect, particularly in problematic wounds including fracture non-unions,
      post-traumatic wounds, and burns.

      The need to improve the healing and quality-of-life of the combat wounded, the potential of
      this minimal-risk technology to improve healing of difficult-to-treat orthopedic/soft tissue
      injury and infection, as well as the combat casualty care experience of surgeons at WRAMC,
      dovetail uniquely to have our wounded soldiers and medical center play a pivotal role as the
      fundamental proving ground and primary beneficiary of this technology.

      Comparison(s): Standard-of-care wound therapy compared to standard-of-care wound therapy +
      ESWT for extremity wounds with the aim of conducting a definitive critical analysis of the
      role of ESWT in improved treatment and outcomes of traumatic soft tissue injuries of the
      extremity.
