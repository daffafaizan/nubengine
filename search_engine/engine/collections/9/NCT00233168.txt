      Tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for almost one billion deaths in the 20th century. It is
      epidemic in the developing world and immigrants introduce TB to developed nations. TB control
      requires treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) and active disease, as well as adherence to
      medical regimens. This study will determine the effectiveness of a public health model of
      LTBI control among high-risk adolescents. The integration of behavioral science, medical
      services, parent instruction, and assistance from schools and clinics (coordinated by the
      county health department) is based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC). The effectiveness of this system is dependent, in part, on patient
      adherence.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The primary outcome of this study is adherence to an INH treatment regimen. For a given
      participant, adherence is assessed every 30 days, with the final outcome determined 12 months
      after treatment start date. Adherence is assessed using participant recall, urine testing for
      INH metabolites, pill counts, and medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps.

      The key secondary outcomes are parent knowledge and practice of intervention support
      procedures, parent knowledge of TB, self-esteem effects and life skills acquisition, cost and
      cost effectiveness of the intervention, and knowledge and practice of LTBI care by providers
      at participating community clinics.
