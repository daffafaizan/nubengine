      handling, renal hemodynamics, tubular function and vasoactive hormones in healthy humans
      during normal and high sodium intake.

      We wanted to analyze if changes in renal hemodynamics, tubular function, hormones, blood
      pressure and HR under acute treatment with atorvastatin depends on sodium intake.
