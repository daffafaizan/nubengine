      Primary

        -  To determine the time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell
           lung cancer treated with second- or third-line bendamustine.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  To determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks.
