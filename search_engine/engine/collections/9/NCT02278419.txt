    
      This is a partly randomized, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer
      and study staff), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks,
      an open-label treatment period of 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period
      until 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Participants without cirrhosis will be assigned
      to Group A wherein half of the participants will receive 8 week treatment in Group A1 and
      remaining participants will receive 12 week treatment in Group A2. Participants with
      cirrhosis, will be assigned to Group B to receive simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir
      for 12 weeks. The duration of participation for each participant, including the screening
      period, will be approximately 36 or 40 weeks for 8 or 12 week treatment, respectively.
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of participants with SVR12. Participants'
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
