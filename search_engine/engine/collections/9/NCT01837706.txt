      physicians after a poor outcome if the physician demonstrated empathy by verbalizing that
      they recognize the patient is concerned about their symptoms, and that the patient knows
      their typical state of health better than a physician seeing them for the first time.
      Accordingly, the investigators will assess whether the presence or absence of emergency
      physician empathetic statements in videotaped simulated encounters will alter patient
      propensity towards litigation. Secondary objectives are to assess whether the presence or
      absence of empathetic statements alters patient perceptions of discharge instruction clarity,
      physician expertness, physician caring, and physician desirability.
