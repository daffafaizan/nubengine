      patients with leptomeningeal metastases from any solid tumor.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Pembrolizumab

        -  Lenvatinib

      The study treatment will last for up to 35 cycles (a cycle is 21 days long), or until the
      disease gets worse or unacceptable side effects. Participants will be followed for up to 90
      days after the end of the study treatment.

      It is expected that about 19 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug
      combination works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug
      combination is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab or lenvatinib for
      this specific disease but each has been approved for other uses.
