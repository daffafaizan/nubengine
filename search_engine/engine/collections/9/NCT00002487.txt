      complete response rate, disease-free survival, and duration of response produced by
      intraperitoneal dipyridamole/methotrexate (DP/MTX) administered as a 7-day continuous
      infusion in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma that is recurrent following or
      refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. II. Determine the peritoneal and systemic
      toxicity of DP/MTX.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Chemopotentiation. Methotrexate,
      MTX, NSC-740; with Dipyridamole, DP, NSC-515776.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 40 evaluable patients in each category (prior intraperitoneal vs.
      prior intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy) will be studied. If no responses are seen in
      the first 20 patients in either category, accrual to that category will cease. An accrual
      rate of 15 patients/year is anticipated.
