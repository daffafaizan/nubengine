acromegalythe effects of various steroid hormones on theinsulin-induced growth hormone responseand peter h. forshamthe availability of a sensitive assay for human growth hormone has madeit possible to directly measure the effects of various agents purported toalter growth patterns.  acromegalic patients present a special problem both inearly diagnosis and in therapy.  being able to measure growth hormone inthese patients provides an accurate index of activity and a precise measureof therapeutic effectiveness.in an attempt to determine whether a pituitary block of growth hormonesecretion is feasible in this condition, a study was made of the effects ofestrogen, androgen and glucocorticoid administration on growth hormoneresponse to a standard insulin tolerance test in a patient with active acro-megaly.  in the dosage schedules used in this study, it was not possible tosuppress either basal growth hormone secretion or blunt its responsivenessto the normal physiologic stimulus of hypoglycemia.
