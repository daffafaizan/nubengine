      in patients who are very sick and need a machine to help them breathe. Patients are asked to
      be in this study because they had problems breathing on their own and therefore needed the
      help of a machine called a ventilator. In order for this ventilator to push air into the
      lungs, patients need a tube placed in the throat called an endotracheal tube. The process of
      placing this endotracheal tube was called intubation. The tube has now been removed, which is
      a process called extubation. Sometimes, people who have had endotracheal tubes can have
      difficulty swallowing food and liquids for a period of time. This disease is called
      post-extubation dysphagia (PED). PED is a serious condition and may result in food or liquid
      going from the mouth into the lungs. This could cause further lung problems. Given this risk,
      doctors sometimes suggest that patients with PED either avoid eating or drinking, or get a
      feeding tube. Currently, nobody knows how often patients develop PED, why they develop it, or
      the best method to detect it. Standard care involves clinicians making educated guesses. This
      study looks to determine if watching the patient swallow, both with and without a small
      camera, is an accurate method for detecting PED.
