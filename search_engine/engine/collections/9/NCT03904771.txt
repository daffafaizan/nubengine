      The behavioral nutrition counselling is theory-based, i.e. solution focused theory (SFT) and
      self -determination theory. SFT places responsibility for change in the hands of subjects by
      using empowering language and recognizing them as skilled in matters of self-care. Subjects
      have strengths, resources, and coping skills that drive change while generating optimism and
      hope. Use of basic counseling skills, such as attending and listening, genuineness, empathy,
      positive regard and reflection, provide the foundation upon which SFT is practised.
