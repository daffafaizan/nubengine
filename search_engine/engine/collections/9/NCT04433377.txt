    
      Patients will be randomly assigned Subacromial injection group or Suprascapular nerve block
      group

      In the suprascapular nerve block group, suprascapular nerve block will be performed with a
      MyLab60 model a high resolution 7-12-MHz linear probe ultrasonography device. After the
      suprascapular fossa will be observed by ultrasonography, a betamethasone dipropionate plus
      betamethasone sodium phosphate solution (6.43 mg / mL + 2.63 mg / mL; 1 mL), 0.5 %
      bupivacaine (2 mL) and physiological serum (2 mL) will be injected with an in-plane technique
      using a 22 gauge 90-mm injector.

      In the subacromial injection group, subacromial injection will be performed with a MyLab60
      model a high resolution 7-12-MHz linear probe ultrasonography device. After the subacromial
      bursa will be observed by ultrasonography, a betamethasone dipropionate plus betamethasone
      sodium phosphate solution (6.43 mg/mL + 2.63 mg/mL; 1 mL), 2% lidocaine (2 mL) and
      physiological serum (2 mL) will be injected with an in-plane technique using a 21 gauge 38-mm
      injector.

      A home exercise program will be given both groups. The exercise program consisted of passive
      and active-assistive ROM exercises (3 sets daily, 20 times in each set).
