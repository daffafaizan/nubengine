        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of T cells activated in vitro and
           modified with chimeric anti-CEA immunoglobulin T cell receptors (Ig TCR) in patients
           with CEA expressing adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen by the persistence of modified T cells in
           the blood of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the immunogenicity of murine sequences in chimeric anti-CEA Ig TCR.

        -  Assess immunologic parameters which correlate with the efficacy of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the efficacy of this regimen in patients with CEA
           bearing tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) are harvested. PBL are activated in vitro and then
      modified with recombinant chimeric anti-CEA immunoglobulin T cell receptors (Ig TCR). Ig TCR
      modified T cells are reinfused over 30-60 minutes.

      The estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience unacceptable toxicity. If the MTD is not reached within the first cohort, a second
      cohort of 3 patients then receives 4 doses of modified T cells at a higher dose.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-9 patients will be accrued for this study.
