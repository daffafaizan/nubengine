      children born 2004-16. The project group has extensive experience of similar research, and
      includes representatives from different fields and levels of health care.

      The results will provide a solid fundament for improvement of today's clinical practice,
      including development of knowledge-based routines in neonatal medicine and planning of health
      care services. Implementation is given particular attention, and will be managed in an
      interdisciplinary setting. The project will be of major relevance for the patients and their
      families as well as medical professionals at all levels of health care.
