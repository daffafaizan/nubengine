      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients with sarcoma. The toxicity profile and
      activity level suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel
      compounds may be added. Pazopanib has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in
      sarcomas in the preclinical and clinical settings. Pazopanib has also been shown to have
      additive or synergistic effects in preclinical models of sarcomas when combined with
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic studies of pazopanib and irinotecan as well as
      pharmacodynamic studies of pazopanib to assess anti-angiogenesis will be performed.
      Exploratory studies to assess non-invasive methods of monitoring tumor response [circulating
      tumor DNA and functional imaging by positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) will be performed].
