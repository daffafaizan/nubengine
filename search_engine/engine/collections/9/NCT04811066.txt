      ganglia function, such as bradykinesia and tremor. Beyond the visibly recognisable motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the ability to learn a sequence of movements is also
      compromised and poses a significant barrier to effective rehabilitation. In healthy
      individuals, transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex
      during motor task practice has been shown to significantly improve motor learning compared to
      placebo conditions.

      The present study seeks to examine the effect of multi-session transcranial direct current
      stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with Parkinson's disease on
      sequential motor learning performance. Participants will be required to attend eight
      laboratory sessions, comprising five intervention and three assessment sessions and will be
      tested on their ability to learn a 16-digit finger tapping sequence with their right hand.
      Sessions one to five will form the intervention and will be performed at the same time on
      consecutive days (i.e. mon-fri). In addition, session one will double as a baseline
      assessment and intervention session. Assessments sessions will be performed once before the
      intervention (session one), and three times following the intervention on day three, one
      week, and four weeks post intervention.
