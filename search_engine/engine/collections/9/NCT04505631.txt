    
      Main objective To assess respiratory sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized
      patients with severe pneumonia requiring oxygen supply and followed up for 6 months after
      hospital discharge (see primary and secondary outcomes).

      Secondary objectives

      To describe pulmonary sequelae according to :

        -  the unit in which the patient was hospitalized,

        -  the maximum oxygen flow rate required during hospitalization,

        -  McCabe score,

        -  age,

        -  tobacco consumption,

        -  biological data (e.g. blood count, CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin),

        -  number of days from onset of symptoms to hospitalization,

        -  co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease/heart failure, mild
           to moderate COPD/respiratory failure, overweight),

        -  concomitant treatments (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids,
           immunosuppressants, ACE inhibitors)

        -  specific drug treatments administered to treat COVID-19 infection,

        -  non-drug treatments (invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, postural treatment)
           to manage respiratory disorders of COVID-19 infection.

      To assess the impact of factors of social inequality on the severity of COVID-19 infection.

      Conduct of research Patients who have been hospitalized for severe pneumonia due to CoV-2
      SARS infection will be seen in consultation at approximately 3 and 6 months after hospital
      discharge, as per standard practice.
