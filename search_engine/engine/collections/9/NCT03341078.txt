      there are no medications that a doctor can give someone to help them stop using
      methamphetamine. More research is needed to develop drugs for methamphetamine addiction.
      Ibudilast (the study drug) is a drug that could help people addicted to methamphetamine.

      The investigators are interested to know if the study drug can help some symptoms that
      methamphetamine can cause, specifically inflammation in the brain. Inflammation has been
      shown to affect decision-making. The study drug has anti-inflammatory properties, however it
      is not yet known whether the drug will reduce inflammation in the brain.
