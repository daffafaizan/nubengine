    
      The Phase I study proposed is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of oxfendazole (0.3 to 30
      mg/kg) in healthy volunteers. The dose will be increased approximately three-fold (one-half
      log) at each increment, and each cohort will comprise ten volunteers (eight drug, two
      placebo). Subjects will be monitored for three weeks after dosing, including monitoring the
      pharmacokinetics and metabolism of oxfendazole in blood and urine. Each new cohort will be
      dosed only after the three week safety data for the preceding group have been analyzed. If a
      clinically significant adverse event is observed, and if this event is possibly drug-related,
      an additional (and final) cohort of volunteers will repeat the highest tolerated dose of
      oxfendazole. Up to 70 volunteers (56 drug, 14 placebo) will complete the study.
