    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of CBP-201 on a background of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing
      endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) and nasal congestion/obstruction score (NCS) severity in
      eligible patients with CRSwNP whose disease remains inadequately controlled despite daily
      treatment with intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) therapy in comparison to placebo. CBP-201 is
      administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. The study is divided into a treatment period
      of 24 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.
