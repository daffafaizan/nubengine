      the antiviral regimen. Current evidence suggests that a combination of ganciclovir and
      foscarnet may be the most efficacious therapy and appears to be well tolerated. This study
      will provide key information regarding safety and CSF penetration of the drugs available for
      treatment of these lethal diseases. It will also provide preliminary information regarding
      virologic factors relevant to CMV CNS disease. The study will also provide further data about
      the natural history of CMV brain infection detected by a combination of symptom complex and
      PCR identification of CMV in CSF and the potential of semi-quantitative PCR evaluation of the
      CSF for the disease.

      Patients will be stratified by clinical syndrome as having either primarily A) encephalitis;
      or B) radiculomyelitis. If patient has combined encephalitis and radiculomyelitis, then the
      patient will be stratified as encephalitis. CMV therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet will
      first be given at an induction level and then a maintenance level. For the first 4 weeks,
      patients will be given foscarnet plus ganciclovir. Then for the following 20 weeks, patients
      will be given foscarnet plus ganciclovir with ganciclovir at a lower dose. NOTE: A maximum of
      10 patients that have proven to be intolerant to either foscarnet or ganciclovir may receive
      the alternate agent alone.

      NOTE: Ganciclovir experienced subjects will be given GCV at induction and maintenance doses
      if tolerated.

      NOTE: Induction doses will not be re-started in the face of clinical relapse on switching to
      maintenance therapy.
