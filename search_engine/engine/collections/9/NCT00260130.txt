      that may account for the differential appetitive responses they elicit, potential
      contributory mechanisms as well as the dietary implications of their consumption. Study 1
      will contrast the acute effects of fluid and solid foods varying in macronutrient content on
      satiation, satiety and feeding. Study 2 will determine if the pattern of fluid and solid
      ingestion influences satiety and feeding by monitoring appetitive and dietary responses to
      energy and macronutrient matched fluid and solid loads ingested as meal components or between
      meal snacks. To better assess the clinical implications ofdiets incorpprating liquid or solid
      supplements. Study 3 will entail chronic ingestion of matched energy yeilding fluid or solid
      loads with concurrent measurement of appetite, dietary intake, energy expenditureand body
      weight/composition.
