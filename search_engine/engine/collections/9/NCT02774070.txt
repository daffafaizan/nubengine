      complications if not detected early. It may not be detected unless it becomes symptomatic.
      However, asymptomatic atlantoaxial joint affection is not uncommon. Investigators will try to
      detect atlantoaxial joint affection at an early stage and its relation to symptomatology and
      other disease criteria. So investigators will use conventional plain X-ray examination
      combined with magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine to detect soft tissue as well
      as bony changes of this condition.
