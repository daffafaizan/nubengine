      plana vitrectomy for macular edema due to preretinal membranes. Specifically, we will examine
      its effect on macular edema (measured by OCT), and visual recovery (measured by visual
      acuity). We will examine its use in patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for macular
      edema with associated taut membrane. This will be a prospective pilot study with patients to
      receive an Ozurdex implant at the time of vitrectomy.
