      its efficiency seems to be preserved even if the chlorhexidine concentration is bellow 0.10%,
      the formulation of the final product may affect the effectiveness. Thus, it can be concluded
      from this study that 0.12% CLX alcohol base mouthrinse is significantly more effective in
      inhibiting plaque than the diluted 0.1% CLX non-alcohol base containing formaldehyde
      mouthrinse.
