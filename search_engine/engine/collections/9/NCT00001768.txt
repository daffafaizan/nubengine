      Tourette's syndrome have implicated an autoimmune etiology in a subset of these conditions,
      and renewed interest into the possibility of autoimmune pathophysiology underlying other
      psychiatric disorders. There are several clinical and epidemiologic similarities between
      autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia: genetic predisposition, but with twin concordance
      below 50%; waxing and waning course; exacerbation of symptoms or precipitation of relapse by
      psychosocial stress. However, other mixed evidence has engendered considerable debate in the
      literature regarding the role of immune mechanisms in schizophrenia. The clinical efficacy
      and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in immune-mediated neurological diseases has
      been documented, and clinical studies of the efficacy of IVIg in the treatment of both
      Tourette's syndrome and OCD are currently ongoing at the NIMH (see protocol 92-M-0132). In
      this protocol, we propose a 13-week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study of IVIg
      in 25 patients suffering from treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. After the
      first 5 patients have completed the trial, this data will be presented to the NIMH
      Institutional Review Board and a decision will be made as to whether this trial should
      proceed.
