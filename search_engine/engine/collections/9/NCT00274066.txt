      regular maintenance therapy is desired, a therapeutic intervention with a combination of
      bronchodilators is recommended. The risks of side-effects increases with increasing dose of
      any drug and, therefore, the most important rationale for combination therapy is a very
      favourable ratio of efficacy and safety. Knowing that anticholinergic and beta-adrenergic
      agents achieve their bronchodilating effects by different mechanisms, in particular the
      combination of these agents has proven to be beneficial in the management of COPD. Based on
      the established clinical benefits, tiotropium is an attractive and promising agent for the
      first-line long-term maintenance therapy in COPD. This also implies that a therapeutic
      intervention with other bronchodilators will be prescribed in daily practice. At present no
      studies on combination therapy with short-acting agents are available. Therefore, using a
      double-blind, randomised, crossover design, the bronchodilator effects of single doses of
      ipratropium or fenoterol were compared with placebo when added on top of steady state
      tiotropium. Patients were pre-treated with tiotropium to achieve this pharmacodynamic steady
      state. Serial lung function tests (FEV1, FVC, Raw, sGaw) were conducted following add-on of
      the short-acting bronchodilators or placebo.

      Study Hypothesis:

      H0: there is no difference between treatments in mean peak FEV1 H1: there is a difference
      between treatments in mean peak FEV1

      Comparison(s):

      Add-on of placebo was compared to add-on of ipratropium or add-on of fenoterol. The
      comparison of ipratropium with placebo was primary. The other 2 pair-wise comparisons were
      secondary.
