      4g/day of acetaminophen for more than 4 days causes an asymptomatic ALT elevation in some
      people. This elevation most likely resolves while continuing treatment, but it is possible
      that some individuals may go on to develop clinical liver injury. By carefully following
      healthy subjects who are taking the maximal daily dose of acetaminophen, we can safely
      determine if the ALT elevation resolves or progresses to clinical liver injury. If a subject
      develops clinical liver injury we can intervene before irreversible injury occurs.
