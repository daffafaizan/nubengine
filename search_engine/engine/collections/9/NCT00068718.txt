      I. To assess the safety of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) as adoptive immunotherapy for
      persistent or relapsed malignant diseases in patients after related or unrelated
      nonmyeloablative transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine disease response, progression free and overall survival, chimerism, grade of
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo unirradiated DLI over 15-30 minutes on day 0. Patients then undergo
      restaging on day 28 and may undergo a second DLI after at least 4 weeks if no significant
      GVHD develops and disease status worsens or after at least 8 weeks if disease status is
      unchanged and persistent donor T-cells are documented.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
