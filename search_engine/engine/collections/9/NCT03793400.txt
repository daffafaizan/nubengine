    
      To evaluate the long-term outcome of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in punctate
      inner choroidopathy (PIC) or multifocal choroiditis (MFC) after anti-vascular endothelial
      factor treatment.

      The age, sex, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in Snellen chart, and refractive status for
      each patient were recorded. All patients had thorough clinical examinations, including slit
      lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoloscopy, and spectral domain optical coherence
      tomography during each visit. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine
      angiography were performed on all patients. OCT angiography was performed.
