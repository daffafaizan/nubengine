      ways including identifying a specific-size for the prosthesis prior to surgery, increasing
      operating room efficiency, and reducing the number of traditional instruments needed. This
      may reduce cost associated with the instrument inventory and instrument sterilization.
      Operating time may also be reduced, potentially decreasing the patient's risk of infection.
      However, before these hypotheses can be tested, it is important to fully understand the
      efficacy and accuracy of Signature Custom Guides and their use in Total Hip Arthroplasty.
