      worldwide, mostly in developing countries. Pakistan's textile industry accounts for 8.5% of
      the national GDP and employs around 40% of the industrial workforce. High burden of
      respiratory illnesses, including byssinosis and lung function decrements has been reported
      among cotton textile workers in developing countries and previous work undertaken by Dr
      Nafees found a high burden in Pakistan. Dr Nafees recently implemented an interventional
      study designed to improve workers' knowledge, attitude and practices and respiratory health,
      and reduce dust exposure at cotton textile mills through a multifaceted intervention
      (MultiTex pilot study). The preliminary findings from the pilot were helpful in improving the
      overall design and implementation of a larger and more definitive study (cluster randomised
      controlled trial). The aim of the trial would be to determine the effectiveness of a
      multifaceted interventional package for improvement in reducing dust levels at the cotton
      textile mills as well as improvement in respiratory health of textile workers.This study will
      add important context-specific knowledge regarding preventive strategies in cotton mills with
      policy implications for Pakistan and other developing countries.
