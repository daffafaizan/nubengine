      interpretation of IPS. However, ALL affects 50% of diabetic patients after 20 years of
      disease with predominant involvement in the infra-popliteal gland consisting mainly of
      mediacalcosis, but often respecting the arteries of the foot.

      The recommendations of the French-speaking Association for the Study of Diabetes and
      Metabolic Diseases in 1997 and of the American Diabetes Association in 2001, recommended the
      SPI and the realization of ultrasound for the diagnosis of ALL. Some authors have shown that
      SPI can be falsely normal with 4.3 times more false negative ankle SPI in diabetics compared
      to the general population. This is why this measurement of the SPI is coupled with the
      measurement of the pressure of the big toe (PGT) or even the transcutaneous measurement of
      the oxygen pressure (TcPO2) as recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the
      American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 2005, in case of uninterpretable IPS.

      The subjects at risk of mediacalcosis are: diabetics, renal insufficiency and the very
      elderly.

      A recent thesis work confirmed that the SPI alone was not reliable as a screening tool in
      diabetic patients, with good sensitivity of the measurement of PGT.

      What about a population over the age of 70, without diabetes and without kidney failure?
