      beta-adrenolytics are the first-line treatment agents in patients with heart failure. In case
      of fluid retention, diuretics, as a part of symptomatic treatment, should be administered. In
      practice, the most common diuretic used in patients with heart failure is loop diuretic -
      furosemide. What is important, furosemide has no effect on patients' outcomes. Some studies
      showed unfavourable influence of this drug on rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

      Alternative loop diuretic, which may be administered in patients with heart failure is
      torasemide. Its longer elimination half-life time, similar diuretic effects, lower influence
      on electrolyte disorders and additional pleiotropic effects could make torasemide more
      beneficial than furosemide.

      Accordingly, only direct comparison of furosemide and torasemide could present similarities
      and differences of these two agents.

      The hypothesis of this study is that torasemide may present more favourable effects on some
      clinical parameters in patients with heart failure, than furosemide (e.g. clinical symptoms,
      biochemical parameters, activity of rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, side effects).
