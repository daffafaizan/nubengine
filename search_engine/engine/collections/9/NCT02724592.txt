      Self-assembling peptide (P11-4) has proven to enhance biomimetic mineralization of early
      carious lesions. Aim of this study was to evaluate safety, clinical applicability and effect
      of using P11-4 (Curodont™ Repair) in non-invasive treatment of early occlusal lesions.

      Methods: 70 patients with active early occlusal lesions (ICDAS-II:1-3) on first or second
      permanent molars at eruption will be allocated in this randomized, controlled, single blinded
      study to test (Curodont™ Repair+Duraphat®) or control (Duraphat®) groups. Safety and
      applicability will be evaluated using dentist's/patient's questionnaires about adverse
      events, difficulties of application and satisfaction with procedure. Lesions will be assessed
      at baseline and recalls after 3 and 6 months regarding caries activity, clinical status
      (ICDAS-II) and with Diagnodent®. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of regression and of lesion
      size in addition to the Global Impression of Change Questionnaire will also be assessed. At
      every recall, fluoride varnish will be applied on lesions and patients received oral health
      instructions.
