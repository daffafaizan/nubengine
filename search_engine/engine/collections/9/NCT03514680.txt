      management of CIPN. The algorithm is designed to help clinicians make decisions about which
      strategies to use for the assessment and/or management of CIPN. The investigators need to
      recruit participants receiving chemotherapy that is known to cause CIPN to determine how well
      the algorithm works to increase clinicians' use of recommended CIPN assessment and management
      strategies.
