      constipation can seriously impact a patient's quality of life. At present, one of the most
      frequently used treatment is catharsis, which deals with the symptom. There are three main
      problems with catharsis. First, there are no long-lasting effects once the patient stops
      taking medication. Second, there are many side effects, including abdominal pain with
      defecation and diarrhea. Third, long-term use of irritant laxatives will not only make the
      constipation become refractory and complex; but also, this type of medicine can harm the
      enteric nervous system, cause melanosis coli, or even carcinoma of colon. Therefore, a
      therapy that is safe with minimal side effects and good short-term and long-term effects is
      urgently needed in functional constipation treatment.

      Clinical practice shows that acupuncture may meets this need to some extent. The acupuncture
      therapy is safe and effective and the therapeutic effects are still present several months
      after the treatment has been completed.
