      6 hospitals in China. Pressure-wire-based FFR is conducted in the standard protocol by each
      hospital. FFR>0.8 is chosen as the threshold to indicate non-ischemia. CFD-based RuiXin-FFR
      is performed by Raysight Medical (Shenzhen, China). CT images are acquired in a standard
      protocol by each hospital. Images with poor quality are excluded in this trial. Based on
      these images, RuiXin-FFR reconstructs the 3D model of coronary trees and obtains RuiXin-FFR
      values by conducting CFD simulations in a blinded fashion. RuiXin-FFR>0.8 is chosen as the
      threshold to indicate non-ischemia as well. By comparing the clinical diagnosis outcome of
      pressure-wire-based FFR and CFD-based RuiXin-FFR, the sensitivity and specificity of the
      RuiXin-FFR are obtained, which is the primary end point of this trial. The secondary end
      point includes the measurement of NPV, PPV and ROC of the RuiXin-FFR.
