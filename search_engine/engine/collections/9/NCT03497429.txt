      Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Niraparib administered once daily orally.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 patients as a maximum. Participants will be assigned
      to Cohort 1 (21-day treatment cycle). After that, participants will be assigned to Cohort 2
      when safety and tolerability of the 200 mg dose will be demonstrated.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 16 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with
      final visit approximately 28 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
