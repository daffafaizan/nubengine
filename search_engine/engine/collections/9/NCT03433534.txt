      and renal cell carcinoma. Huge variability exists between patients treated by nivolumab in
      terms of efficacy and side effects. Like others monoclonal antibodies, a relation between
      concentration and effects of nivolumab may exist.

      The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between blood concentration of nivolumab
      and progression free survival, overall survival and side effects on the one hand, and on the
      other to describe pharmacokinetic of nivolumab
