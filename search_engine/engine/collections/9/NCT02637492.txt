      of limb ischaemia despite recommendations, mainly because of lack of vascular medicine units
      able to measure ischaemia with adequate methods such as toe pressure or TCpo2. It would be
      very useful to better identify the patients who need to be explored, or at least to have an
      evidence-based clinical assessment in those who cannot be explored . The objective is to
      develop a simple clinical prediction rule of critical lower limb ischaemia.

      Two definitions are currently used for critical limb ischaemia. In both definitions,
      objective confirmation is needed for critical limb ischaemia by measurement of ankle
      pressure, toe pressure or transcutaneous oxygen pressure. These two latter measurements are
      mandatory in the numerous patients whose ankle pressure measurement is not possible
      (diabetes, chronic renal failure). Unfortunately few vascular medicine units exist to carry
      out these measurements, so that it would be useful to better identify those patients who need
      to be explored. In those who cannot be explored, better clinical assessment would also be
      very useful.

      The investigators aim to develop a simple clinical prediction rule by completing a specific
      clinical chart in the patients hospitalized for peripheral occlusive arterial disease in
      Bordeaux, Toulouse and Limoges university hospital vascular medicine units and included in
      the COPART II cohort. Internal validation will be performed using cross-validation and
      bootstrap methods.

      To achieve the secondary objective, the patients will be followed-up for the duration of the
      study (ie from 1 to 3 years) to evaluate the prediction of clinical outcomes (death or
      amputation) by both definitions of critical limb ischaemia.
