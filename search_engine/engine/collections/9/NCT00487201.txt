      than 1000 ERCP procedures. The procedure was performed with the patient under general
      anesthesia with propofol. A stenosis was considered to be present if the cholangiogram showed
      strictures with a narrowing of the anastomosis or the proximal donor duct site of the
      anastomosis and incomplete distal runoff of the contrast agent.

      The patients were divided into two groups: 1) balloon dilatation of the stricture, 2) balloon
      dilatation plus plastic stent placement.

      In both groups, endoscopic treatment of the patients comprised sphincterotomy, consecutive
      dilation of stenosis up to 10 F, removement of occluding material from choledochus duct using
      a balloon catheter if necessary, and repetitive balloon dilatation of the anastomosis
      stricture or of the non-anastomotic proximal donor duct stricture to 18 F at the first
      intervention and to 24 F in the following interventions.

      The second group of the patients were additionally treated by large-diameter (10 F) plastic
      stent placement after balloon dilatation. This procedure was repeated in 6 - 8 weeks
      intervals in both groups.
