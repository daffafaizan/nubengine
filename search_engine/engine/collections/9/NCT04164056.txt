      Neuromodulation such as deep brain stimulation is an alternative therapy for patients with
      drug-resistant epilepsy, especially for those not suitable for resective surgery. This
      prospective, randomized, open-label trial aims to compare the effectiveness of deep brain
      stimulation of the hippocampus and the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for bilateral
      temporal lobe epilepsy.
