      ability of HDL to transport cholesterol from the periphery to the liver to be eliminated.
      This process is called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and is one of the main mechanisms
      by which HDL protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mutations in some of the
      genes affecting HDL metabolism, may results in changes in RCT. The validation of a method
      assessing RCT is important for the development of new drugs which affect RCT and may result
      in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.

      Subjects carrying mutations in genes known to affect HDL metabolism and healthy controls will
      be enrolled in the study. Changes in the tracer activity in total plasma, lipoproteins
      fractions and feces will be analyzed following the intravenous administration of radiolabeled
      particulate cholesterol.
