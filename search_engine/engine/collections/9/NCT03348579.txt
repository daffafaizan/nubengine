      participating ICUs before the national guidelines publication concerning healthcare
      associated pneumonia.

      The second period (phase 2) will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the publication of the national guidelines publication concerning
      healthcare associated pneumonia.

      Afterward, an interphase will occur during which all physicians, residents, physiotherapists
      and nurses will receive a formal training for the processes and procedures related to the new
      guidelines published in september 2017.

      In the intervention group, on top of the standard training, the centers receive an analysis
      of the evolution of the practices of their center and the future of their patients between
      phases 1 and 2, as well as these same values for the data set. The centers are then called to
      conduct a meeting to determine their priority improvement points based on this audit.

      The third and final period (phase 3) will consist of all consecutive patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the formal training.
