      FFR. The diagnostic tests undergoing evaluation are resting conditions and hyperemia induced
      by intracoronary injection of contrast medium. While all these tests give a continuous
      result, we will apply binary cutoffs for comparison to FFRâ‰¤0.8 as the reference standard.
      Subjects will be selected prospectively from consecutive patients undergoing FFR assessment
      for standard clinical indications. The paired comparative design means that each patient will
      undergo resting (baseline), post-contrast, and adenosine-derived measurements. To enhance
      test integrity, all pressure recordings will be analyzed in a central physiology core
      laboratory blinded to clinical data and recruiting site.
