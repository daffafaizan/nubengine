      an early stage of neurodegenerative diseases. It is estimated that exist 24.3 million people
      worldwide with neurocognitive disorders. Cognitive Stimulation (CS) is defined as the set of
      techniques and strategies that optimize the effectiveness in various functions of different
      cognitive abilities throughout its use in rehabilitation on MCI. Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe neuromodulation technique that modifies brain electrical
      activity through electromagnetic fields. There is evidence of the relationship between CS and
      rTMS for the improvement in MCI levels and cognitive functions; itÂ´s important to deepen the
      knowledge of the therapeutic potential of both techniques combined on MCI
