        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fenretinide in patients with metastatic or
           unresectable malignant solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and in vivo activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, disease or tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive fenretinide IV continuously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a complete or partial response may continue to receive fenretinide at the discretion
      of the study chair.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection to determine plasma concentrations
      (pharmacokinetics) of fenretinide periodically during course 1 and at the end of courses 2-6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
