      data on executive function deficiencies in obesity, this study aims to explore the impact of
      executive function training on food-related choices, cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes, but
      also on the psychological and physical status and quality of life measures.

      The specific hypotheses are:

        1. Obese children undergoing the training programme will perform better than those
           receiving the control programme in cognitive, emotional state, physical activity and
           quality of life measures at the end of the intervention and follow-up at 12 months.

        2. Obese children receiving the training programme will take better food-related decisions
           at the end of the intervention and follow-up at 12 months.

        3. Obese children receiving the training programme will show changes in brain connectivity,
           which will be observable immediately at the end of the intervention and during the
           follow up period at 12 months.

        4. There will be an association between changes in neuroimaging biomarkers and food choice,
           cognitive, emotional, physical and quality of life outcomes in individuals receiving
           training.
