      A list will be compiled of patients who underwent cesarean section at Memorial Hermann
      Hospital in the Texas Medical Center from January 1st 2010 through January 1st 2011. Only UT
      patients who had their skin closed with Insorb or metal staples will be included in this
      list. Patients' clinical charts will be reviewed for post-operative follow-up, and notes will
      be made of the wound assessment. Any complications such as infection, seroma, hematoma, and
      wound separation or delayed healing will be recorded. Additional notes will be made of any
      co-morbid conditions, including, but not limited to, >30 BMI, chronic hypertension, diabetes
      mellitus, HIV, history of tobacco use.

      Once the data is gathered, it will be compared with published national averages to determine
      if there is an increased risk of wound separation or wound infection at our institution. In
      addition, rated of infection and wound breakdown following closure with either absorbable or
      metal staples will be compared by Fisher's exact test, to determine statistical significance.

      Course of Study: Data will be obtained from UT patients who underwent cesarean section from
      January 1st, 2010 through January 1st, 2011. Only patients who had skin closure with InSorb
      or metal staples will be included in analysis.
