      TURP surgery using monopolar electronic resectoscope. Eligible patients will be allocated
      into one of three study groups (n=20 in each). Group A patients will receive NaCl 3% HS at a
      dose of 4 ml/kg/hr; Group B patients will receive NaCl 3% HS at a dose of 2 ml/kg/hr; while
      Group C patients will receive NaCl 0.9% Normal Saline(NS) at a dose of 6 ml/kg/hr. All
      intra-venous infusions will be started 30 minutes before the subarachnoid block, and
      continued all through the procedure at the same specific rate for each infusion. Vital signs
      [mean BP, HR, CVP & oxygen saturation (spO2)] will be recorded. Plasma electrolytes (sodium,
      potassium, chloride)and serum osmolality (mOsm) will be measured. Incidence of TUR syndrome,
      need for ICU admission, post-operative ventilation and total hospital stay will be noted.
