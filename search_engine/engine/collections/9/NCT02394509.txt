    
      HOBSCOTCH (Home Based Self-management and Cognitive Training Changes lives) is a home-based
      self-management program to treat cognitive symptoms and improve quality of life, while
      minimizing the barriers of access to care. The program is based on Problem Solving Therapy
      (PST) and teaches problem solving strategies and compensatory mechanisms to help manage
      cognitive dysfunction and enhance quality of life.

      HOBSCOTCH Phase II is a replication study of the original HOBSCOTCH study, designed to
      translate the findings of HOBSCOTCH into a real world setting. This is a multi-center study,
      with the HOBSCOTCH intervention being implemented at four epilepsy clinics in New England.
