    
      This is an open labeled, multi-center, phase I/II, cohort study involving a single infusion
      of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector
      G2SCID in up to 10 patients with X-linked SCID (SCID-X1) at Boston Children's Hospital and
      UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital. Patients will receive transduced cells after low dose
      targeted busulfan pre-conditioning (n=10).

      Enrolled subjects will be followed for 2 years after infusion on this protocol. Required
      long-term monitoring for a total of 15 years after infusion will be performed on a separate
      protocol.

      Single infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the SIN lentiviral vector
      rHIV_IL2RGcoG2SCID (hereafter G2SCID) The primary objective is to measure event free survival
      and T cell immune reconstitution at 1 year post-infusion

      Secondary objectives are to measure overall survival, event-free survival, safety related to
      the procedure, and clinical and laboratory measures of efficacy including humoral immune
      reconstitution and gene marking after gene transfer.

      Exploratory objectives include: molecular characterization of gene transfer, detailed
      assessment of biomarkers of T and B cell development and function, assessment of infections,
      nutritional status, growth and development post gene therapy, assessment of T cell receptor
      and B cell receptor repertoire by next generation sequencing, correlation of busulfan levels
      with immune outcome and molecular measurements of gene transfer
