      individuals with a similar smoking history. This suggests that schizophrenic individuals may
      absorb higher doses of nicotine. The purpose of this study is to determine whether smokers
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have higher serum nicotine and cotinine levels
      in comparison to smokers without schizophrenic-related disorders.

      This observational, case-control study will enroll 150 participants, of which 100 will be
      smokers with schizophrenic-related disorders and 50 will be smokers without a mental illness.
      Upon completing baseline assessments, participants will smoke a single cigarette.
      Approximately two minutes following, 3 to 4 ounces of blood will be analyzed for nicotine and
      cotinine levels. An expired carbon monoxide reading will also be measured. This measurement
      correlates with the amount of smoke inhalation. Individual participant studies will be
      completed in 1 to 2 hour-long sessions.
