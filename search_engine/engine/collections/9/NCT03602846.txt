      resistance is often found during pregnancy leading to a compensatory increase in pancreatic
      Î²-cell response and eventually hyperinsulinemia. Undiagnosed and untreated diabetes in
      pregnancy have been shown to be linked with numerous comorbidities and complications to both
      mother and foetus.

      This study aims to compare the clinical, glycemic profile along with comorbidities,
      management and outcomes of diabetic mothers. Pregnant mothers with gestational and
      pregestational diabetes diagnosed under the ICD-10 coding of O24 were included in this study.
      The inclusion criteria was all patients with primary diagnosis of O24, have visited the
      clinic at least twice with a complete record of glycemic profile, management and fetal
      outcomes.
