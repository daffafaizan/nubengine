      mechanical ventilation from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Japan and Peru. Informed consent
      will be waived due to the nature of observational study. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2
      infection will be included. Prior to initiating the protocol, patients will be sedated deeply
      with sedatives and/or opioids and paralyzed with a continuous infusion of rocuronium. The
      distribution of ventilation will be evaluated with EIT.
