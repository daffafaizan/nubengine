    
      To achieve the proposed objective it will be performed a randomized, crossover, triple-blind
      (volunteers, outcome assessors and therapists), placebo-controlled trial.

      Twelve volunteers will be allocated to four interventions/situation. The order of the
      interventions/situations will be randomized.

      The volunteers will be treated by a blinded therapist.

      The outcomes will be obtained at baseline (prior to WOD), and 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after
      WOD. Except for the ratings of perceived exertion that will be obtained at baseline, after
      WOD, and 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after WOD. In addition, for the functional analysis the data
      will be collected at baseline, after applied intervention, and 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after
      WOD. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor.

      The WOD will be consisted in finish as quickly as possible a sequence of three exercises
      (Calories in Assault AirBikeÂ®, Hang Squat Clean and Box Jump Over), in a well-known series
      model for the athletes, without rest.

      The investigators will analyze: ratings of perceived exertion; activity of creatine kinase
      (CK); levels of the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and maximum number of free squat reps in 1
      minute.

      Statistical analysis:

      All data will be analyzed both in their absolute values and in relation to their percentage
      variation from the values obtained in the pre-WOD (baseline) assessments. The results
      obtained will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data show normal
      distribution, the ANOVA test (one or two way depending on the outcome analyzed) with post-hoc
      Bonferroni will be used. The level of statistical significance will be p<0.05.
