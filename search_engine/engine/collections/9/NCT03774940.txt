      calculi. However, the prevalence of postoperative fever is reported to be 16.7%-35%, even
      with appropriate prophylactic antibiotic therapy and a sterile urine culture. The most
      probable causes are urinary extravasation and bacteremia. Although it is important to
      postoperatively isolate the causative bacteria, bacterial isolation may not always be
      possible, and urinary and blood cultures may prove negative. In addition, establishing the
      etiology of fever could be time-consuming and the techniques involved may generate
      pseudo-negative results owing to several factors, especially the antibiotics used
      prophylactically. This can result in a prolonged hospital stay and increased the cost of
      patient care.

      The most commonly used parameters for the early diagnosis of bacterial infections, despite
      their limited use, are C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count .
      Superior parameters include procalcitonin, pro-adrenomedullin, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8,
      but their use is limited by their lack of availability in some centers and their higher
      costs. Recently, the ratio of neutrophil count to lymphocyte count (NLR) has been proposed as
      an effective, simple, and useful biomarker for the early diagnosis of bacterial infections.
      However, these tests are used after the emergence of fever. As yet, no single parameter has
      been proposed for predicting postoperative fever in the absence of preoperative factors known
      to cause fever.

      The aim of this study was to investigate whether neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR
      obtained from routine preoperative blood tests could be used in predicting fever following
      PNL in patients with no risk factors for infection.
