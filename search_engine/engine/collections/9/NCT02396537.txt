      academic pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 67,000 patients. Children
      6-12 years old for whom IN midazolam was ordered were eligible for enrollment. Patients were
      randomly assigned an identical intranasal medication (4% Lidocaine or 0.9% saline). Patients
      were administered the study drug followed by IN midazolam. Patients then assigned a pain
      score for midazolam administration using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating scale. The primary
      endpoint of pain score was analyzed with a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, with P < 0.05
      considered statistically significant.
