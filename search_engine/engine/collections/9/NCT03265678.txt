      in skin and may be linked to skin ageing either due to age or the effect of the sun. Some
      data suggests that these changes may have a genetic basis.

      In this study, the doctor will use a clinical scale to assess the participants skin type, the
      scale will range from 1-5 with 1 being fairer skin types and 5 being darker skin types. The
      doctors will select 10 female participants who meet the required skin types (1-4), aged
      between 55 and 65 years who attend clinics for reasons other than skin cancer or other skin
      diseases. 5 of these patients will have high levels of skin ageing and 5 will have low levels
      of skin ageing as defined by a set of pre-defined criteria. The criteria will be identified
      by examining the skin on the participants face and forearm. The study sponsor will collect
      skin and blood samples from all participants in the high and low skin ageing groups and these
      will be sent to a specialist laboratory for DNA and RNA analysis (genetic analysis).

      The study sponsor hope that this will help us understand the effects of ageing on skin's
      normal functions but also help us interpret results coming out of other genetic studies in
      skin cancer. This information will help to better understand the changes linked with the
      development of skin cancer.
