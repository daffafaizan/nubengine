      the potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation
      technologies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to
      demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions. Electricity has no
      metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with minimal discomfort and without
      problems associated with drug-drug interactions.Transcranial direct current stimulation has
      been studied in patients with various disorders and multiple pain syndromes. There is also
      evidence that tDCS might be useful in postsurgical pain reduction.
