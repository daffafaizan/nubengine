    
      This is a prospective randomized double-blinded study that will compare two commonly used
      approaches for the continuous blockade of the brachial plexus: the CCPVB, which focusses on
      the six cervical nerve root (C6 root), and CISB, which focuses on the upper trunk of the
      brachial plexus. Data of sensory testing, motor strength, shoulder pain, phrenic nerve
      function, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RNL) function, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, block time
      and medication doses used for block placement, will be collected. All observations and
      measurements will be made by a member of the research team who is unaware of patient
      allocation to any particular group.
