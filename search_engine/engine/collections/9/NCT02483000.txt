    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y activity that can be delivered via
      pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) using B9E9-fusion protein (B9E9-FP), clearing agent
      (CA), and radiolabeled tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-biotin when
      followed by carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall and progression-free survival of the above regimen in such patients.

      II. To evaluate the response rates of the above therapy.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of the above therapy.

      IV. To evaluate the feasibility of delivering sequential high-dose PRIT and chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of B9E9-FP and radiolabeled DOTA-Biotin.

      II. Assess ability of the clearing agent (CA) to remove excess B9E9-FP from the serum.

      III. Evaluate the impact, if any, of circulating rituximab on biodistributions.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 DOTA-biotin followed by a
      phase II study.

      B9E9-FP INFUSION: Patients receive B9E9-fusion protein intravenously (IV) over a minimum of 2
      hours on day -17.

      CLEARING AGENT INFUSION: Patients receive clearing agent IV over a minimum of 30 minutes on
      day -15.

      RADIOBIOTIN INFUSION: Patients receive indium In 111-DOTA-biotin IV and yttrium Y 90
      DOTA-biotin IV over 2-5 minutes on day -14.

      BEAM CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV over 3 hours
      on day -7; etoposide IV over 2 hours twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV over 4 hours BID on
      days -6 to -3; and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT)
      on day 0 per standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then annually thereafter.
