      upregulation with ischemic reperfusion injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key
      step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation. It is
      further hypothesized that eculizumab, an antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in humans will be
      an effective prophylactic agent to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury in high risk
      recipients. To test this hypothesis, this study is a pilot prospective, randomized study to
      test the efficacy of eculizumab vs. placebo given once at the time of transplantation in
      preventing delayed graft function in first adult recipients of deceased donor kidneys.
