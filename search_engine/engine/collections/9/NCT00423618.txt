      Primary

        -  Determine if reduced volume adjuvant radiotherapy increases limb function without
           compromising local control in patients with previously resected extremity soft tissue
           sarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall level of disability in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to tumor grade (1 vs 2 vs 3), adequacy of surgical clearance (R0 vs R1),
      and treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), including full
           margins, once daily 5 days a week for 6Â½ weeks .

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo EBRT as in arm I but only reduced margins are included.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
