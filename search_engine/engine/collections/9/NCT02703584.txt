    
      A prospective, randomized, double blinded clinical trial. Patients will undergo standard
      clinical and hormonal investigation as usual for IVF. Patients that will be given the
      standard GnRH antagonist IVF protocol will be prospectively randomized into two groups: 1.
      hCG group- will be triggered for final follicular maturation with hCG (Pregnyl 10,000IU) as
      is usual and placebo (normal saline) - 36 hours prior to oocyte aspiration. 2. The Double
      trigger group- will receive GnRH agonist (Suprefact 0.5 mg) and hCG (Pregnyl 10,000IU) 36
      hours prior to the oocyte aspiration. All patients will be supplemented with the usual
      progesterone preparation (vaginal progesterone suppositories) for luteal support.

      In order to increase the rate of MII from to 65% to 80% with an alpha error of 5% and beta
      error of 80% the sample size needed is 276 total patients in both groups or 138 patients in
      each group.
