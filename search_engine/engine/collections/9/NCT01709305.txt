      take about 10 weeks, and then combination therapy with metformin + sitagliptin will begin
      during Phase 1 (Week 0 through Week 20). If a participant has already been on a stabilized
      metformin dose, they will start immediately on combination therapy with metformin +
      sitagliptin for 20 weeks (Phase 1).

      In Phase 2, participants who have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control (A1c ≥ 7% and ≤
      10% at Week 16 and fasting finger stick glucose ≥130 mg/dL and ≤280 mg/dL at Week 20) will be
      randomized to receive add-on therapy with glimepiride, repaglinide, acarbose, or gliclazide
      for 24 weeks (Week 20 through Week 44).
