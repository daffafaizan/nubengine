      healthy volunteers following a single intravenous infusion. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MTP-131. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized trial. A total of 40 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 3:1
      active to placebo ratio for a total of 5 treatment groups of 8 volunteers. As far as is
      logistically possible, each treatment group will have similar numbers of male and female
      volunteers. After the last subject for each cohort has completed the day 3 clinical
      assessment and no stopping rules have been met according to Safety Review Board decision, the
      next cohort will commence.
