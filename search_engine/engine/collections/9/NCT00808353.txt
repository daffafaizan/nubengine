    
      The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), sponsored by the National Heart, Lung
      and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S.
      communities. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of
      atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in
      cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date.

      ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The
      Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a
      cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in
      their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including
      medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were reexamined every three years
      with the first screen (baseline) occurring in 1987-89, the second in 1990-92, the third in
      1993-95, and the fourth and last exam was in 1996-98. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to
      maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.

      In the Community Surveillance Component, currently ongoing, these four communities are
      investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction
      and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is
      investigated in cohort participants only. The study conducts community surveillance of
      inpatient heart failure (ages 55 years and older) and cohort surveillance outpatient heart
      failure events beginning in 2005.
