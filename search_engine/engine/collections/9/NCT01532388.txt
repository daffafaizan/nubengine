      screening and brief intervention (SBI) site for problematic alcohol and drug use among
      illicit drug users.

      Method: Individuals searching for information about alcohol or drugs online who scored over 0
      on the Drug Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test (DUDIT) and were 15 years or older were
      recruited for this trial and randomized into one group receiving Internet-based screening and
      brief intervention via eScreen.se(n = 101) or one assessment-only control group (n = 101).
      Both groups were screened at baseline and followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome
      measure was the DUDIT-C score and secondary outcome measures were DUDIT, AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identiﬁcation Test-C) and AUDIT scores.Additional outcomes included the proportion
      of drug abstainers and those who made a clinically signiﬁcant change in their alcohol and
      drug use. Four statistical models of analysis were used to conservatively assess results.
