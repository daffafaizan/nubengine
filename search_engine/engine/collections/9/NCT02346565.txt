      previous history of CAD and intermediate pre-test probability of CAD as determined by
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, who require a functional
      test as part of their assessment. All patients that meet the inclusion criteria and do not
      meet any of the exclusion criteria will be approached for consent to the study.

      Patients who can perform greater than 5 metabolic equivalents (METS) on the Duke Activity
      Status Index (DASI) questionaire will be randomised between undergoing an Exercise ECG
      (Ex-ECG) or Exercise Stress Echo (ESE). The DASI is a 12-item questionnaire that estimates
      self-reported physical work capacity and is converted to an estimate of peak metabolic
      equivalents. Patients who do not meet this criteria, will undergo a pharmacological stress
      echocardiogram using Dobutamine (DSE), including Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE).
      Investigations will continue to be performed as per standard clinical departmental protocols
      as described below. In addition, all patients will undergo carotid ultrasonography. The
      techniques used are described for completeness as they are all well-established in clinical
      practice.
