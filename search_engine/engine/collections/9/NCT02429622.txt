      carcinoma, which improves 5-year survival rate from 10% to 20%-40% and decrease recurrence
      rate from 80% to 50%-60%, local recurrence remains to be the most common failure pattern.
      Therefore, enhancing local control is the key to obtain a better survival.

      A phase Ⅱ study of radical radiotherapy with IMRT simultaneous integrated boost technique and
      concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal carcinoma use the same radiation dose as the high dose
      arm in RTOG 94-05, which reveals an significantly improved median survival time of 23 months
      and 3-year overall survival rate of 44.4%. This study implies the simultaneous integrated
      boost technique may be effective to some extent. But the question is how to identify patients
      who may gain potential benefits, and whether this therapeutic model can be copied in the
      specific situation in China? Few adverse effects such as perforation, hemorrhage and stenosis
      was reported, mainly owing to the lack of cases. For widely application of this new technique
      in the clinic, more studies need to be conducted in the future to obtain sufficient evidence.

      The current IMRT can simultaneously achieve prophylactic dose (DT 50Gy) and radical dose (DT
      60-64Gy) in respective target volume by using inverse intensity-modulated planning system.
      However, it is still controversial on whether esophageal carcinoma can receive prescription
      dose more than 2.0Gy each time. That is to say, it is challengeable to find an optimal
      fraction dose and total dose between tumor and adverse effects. For this reason, the dose
      escalation trial is to be conducted to explore the clinical value and optimal dose to
      esophageal carcinoma with different radiosensitivity, and also provide data support for phase
      Ⅲ clinical trials.
