    
      24 hopeless single root teeth will be selected. The horizontal and vertical measurements will
      be assessed in 12socket after immediate implantation and filling the gape with DFDBA.

      Horizontal dimensions (bucco-lingual) of alveolar ridge will be measured at 1,3 and 7 mm
      using caliper and CBCT , and vertical ridge dimensions at 8
      points:(mid-buccal,mid-lingual,mesial,distal,disto-buccal-mesio-buccal,disto-lingual,mesio-li
      ngual ) will be determined using a periodontal probe from the line connecting the two
      adjacent CEJs ,and dimensional changes will be measured after 3 months following implant
      insertion with the same device during the second stage surgery.

      The vertical and horizontal dimensions between the implant and alveolar crest and between the
      crest and base of the gap will be measured at 8
      points:(mid-buccal,mid-lingual,mesial,distal,disto-buccal-mesio-buccal,disto-lingual,mesio-li
      ngual ).

      The primary and secondary stability will be measured using Osstell at baseline and 3-month
      later.

      Twelve sockets will heal without grafting materials, soft and hard tissue measurements
      including horizontal and vertical ridge dimensions will be determined. All the measurement
      will be assessed using caliper and CBCT at the time of extraction and 3-month later at the
      time of implant insertion.
