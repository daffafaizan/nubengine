      second-degree perineal lacerations that differ only in management of the perineal skin :

        1. Closure of the deep tissues and superficial perineal skin using a continuous 3-0 Vicryl
           suture

        2. Closure of the deep tissues with a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture and reapproximation of,
           but not suture-closure of the perineal skin.

      The primary goal of our study is to compare patient pain amongst the following three perineal
      skin repair techniques after second degree laceration:

        1. Perineal skin closure with suturing

        2. Not suturing the perineal skin

        3. Closure of the perineal skin with n-Butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (IndermilÂ®) surgical glue.

      In all women, the deep vaginal and perineal tissues will be closed using a continuous 3-0
      Vicryl suture, as is current standard practice.

      Aim: To assess and compare patient pain among the three groups at intervals of 1 day, 2
      weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months postpartum.
