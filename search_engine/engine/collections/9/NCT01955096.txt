      consecutive advanced gastric cancer patients. (Trial registration number: JLUFHC1722013)
      Further divide into a fast-track surgery group (n=30) and a conventional surgery group
      (n=31). Surgical technique in both groups is same laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy with D2
      lymphadenectomy. Compare outcomes includes length of hospital stay, return to normal diet and
      postoperative complications.Results: Recovery parameters such as the length of time to return
      to normal diet; to the first defection; start of ambulation time ;the mean hospital stay will
      be all less in patients assigned to the fast track surgery protocol compared with those in
      the conventional care programme. Conclusion: We will consider fast-track rehabilitation to be
      safe and feasible in advanced gastric cancer patients. Moreover, it will result in decreased
      hospital stay.
