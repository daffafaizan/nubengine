    
      Population: Approximately 100 patients admitted to the Department of Medicine, Levanger
      Hospital and Stroke Department, St. Olavs Hospital with history and findings suspicious of
      stroke/transitory ischemic attack (TIA). Informed consent mandatory.

      Exclusion criteria: CT angiography of carotid vessels performed after index event, unless all
      participating clinicians are fully blinded to the results.

      Hypotheses:

      The carotid arteries can be assessed bed-side by pocket-size ultrasound scanners with high
      feasibility and reliability by junior doctors with limited training.

      Bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries by pocket-size ultrasound scanners may reduce the
      need for more advanced (higher cost) imaging procedures.

      New high frame rate tracking doppler can increase accuracy and reproducability of stenosis
      grading.

      Methods:

      Pocket-size imaging device from GE Ultrasound, commercial available. Approved for clinical
      use. High-end carotid Doppler ultrasound by high-end equipment (GE Vivid 9) and computer
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at the Department of Radiology, Levanger Hospital
      and St. Olavs Hospital Verasonics research scanner for high fram rate imaging
