    
      GPA-TriMAR is a modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that consist of three subunit in
      it's outer membrane domain. The outer membrane domain linked to the inner membrane 4-1BB/CD3Î¶
      domain through the transmembrane domain, thus compose the complete chimeric antigen receptor.
      Patients' autologous T cells will be isolated and transduced by GPA-TriMAR lentivirus to
      generate the GPA-TriMAR-T cells. When infused back to the patient, the modified GPA-TriMAR-T
      cells will recognize and kill malignant melanoma cells in the body, and in the meanwhile the
      other two subunits function to stimulate the innate immune system and enhance GPA-TriMAR-T
      cells tumor Infiltration.
