    
      The purpose of the current study is to describe the microbiome in children with FD and to
      explore relationships between the microbiome and postprandial distress syndrome, anxiety
      scores, and mucosal biomarkers or anxiety.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To determine the frequencies and relative proportions for specific bacteria or bacteria
           phyla in children with FD in both duodenal mucosal specimens and stool samples.

        2. To determine if the frequencies or proportions of specific bacteria or bacteria phyla
           differ between children with and without PDS.

        3. To determine bi-variate correlations between bacteria/phyla frequency, bacteria/ phyla
           proportion, anxiety scores, and mucosal biomarkers, respectively.
