           treatments will be repeated after the initial eight weeks as long as the patient
           continues to receive benefit from the treatment. If the patient experiences significant
           toxicities, the dose may be reduced or the chemotherapy may be discontinued.

        -  Before beginning treatment and during therapy, routine laboratory tests, scans and
           x-rays will be done to check the body's response to treatment. A physical exam will be
           done at the start of the study and before each course of treatment. Scans will be done
           after eight weeks of therapy.

        -  Patients will remain on this study as long as their disease does not become worse or
           they do not experience severe side effects.
