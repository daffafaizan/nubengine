      visit and at follow-up visits. Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by
      removal of pleural or peritoneal fluid, or by excisional biopsy, or other procedure. In
      general, biopsy tissue will be obtained as an additional sample at the time of a medically
      indicated procedure. In some cases, a biopsy may be performed only to obtain a research
      sample providing the tumor is accessible with a minimal risk to the patient. Specific risks
      will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of the biopsy. Tumor
      samples and blood samples will be processed and/or stored for use in research efforts in the
      laboratories of the Medical Oncology Branch, Experimental Transplant and Immunology Branch,
      or Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI at Navy and NIH.
