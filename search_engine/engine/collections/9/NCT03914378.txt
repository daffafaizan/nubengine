      individual substructures of the auditory pathway such that a better balance can be made
      between hearing loss and tumour control during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. In
      particular the study aims to:

        1. Determine the impact of radiotherapy to the head and neck region on auditory function,
           including measures of hair cell and neural function

        2. Determine the interaction between radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy on auditory
           function

        3. Determine relations between different functional effects and radiation dose to
           substructures within the ear using advanced voxel-based data mining techniques

        4. Determine the auditory substructure that is most associated with speech-in-noise
           deficits

        5. Identify and validate a test which is most predictive of damage to that substructure,
           and could be the basis for future diagnosis

        6. Validate the importance of the localised sensitive substructure in an independent cohort
