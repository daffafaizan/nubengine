      dietary pattern with the circadian pattern od blood pressure, central and peripheral blood
      pressure pulse wave velocity and biological markers of endothelial dysfunction in active and
      sedentary people without atherosclerotic disease.

      Methods:

      Design: Cross- sectional study 1Âª step of clinical trial later. Project multicentric with
      seis research groups.

      Subjects: From subjects of PEPAF project cohort, that remain in last control 3105 (1.163
      active and sedentary 1942) and 2346 were excluded for actives. By Random sampling included
      352 subjects who remained sedentary, 588 who have become active and 560 of which were
      excluded for being active in baseline assessment, a total of 1,200. Each of the six groups
      included 250 subjects.

      Measurements: We evaluated height, weight, abdominal perimeter, blood pressure clinic,
      ambulatory blood pressure with Radial pulse wave acquisition device (BPro), central blood
      pressure, (aortic) and Augmentation index with Pulse Wave Application Software (A-Pulse) and
      Sphigmo cor System Px (Pulse Wave Analysis), pulse wave velocity (PWV) with Sphigmo cor
      System Px (Pulse Wave velocity), nutritional pattern with a food consumption survey, physical
      activity 7 Par-day questionnaire and the accelerometer (MTI/CSA 7164) and physical fitness
      with cicloergometro (PWC170) and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (endoglin and
      osteoprotegerin).
