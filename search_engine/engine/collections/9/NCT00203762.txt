    
      Large-scale public sector antiretroviral treatment programmes, like those planned for
      sub-Saharan Africa, will compete for scarce resources, in particular scarce human resources,
      with other priority primary care programmes like tuberculosis and childhood immunization.

      This could lead to impaired performance in other priority programmes like childhood
      immunization while health workers are distracted by the demands of establishing and
      maintaining ART programmes. On the other hand, ART provisions may have positive spin-offs for
      related programmes like improved case detection of tuberculosis among HIV-positive patients
      seeking ART. The impact of the ART programme on primary healthcare more generally must be
      weighed against the benefits of providing antiretroviral treatment to those with AIDS.

      Comparison: Primary care clinics in the Free State province, South Africa. 15 clinics
      participating in the first phases of the national ART programme will be compared with 24
      clinics which have yet to be included in the national treatment programme. The unit of
      analysis will be the clinic although the outcome data will be collected from individual
      patients.
