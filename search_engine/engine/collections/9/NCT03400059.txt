    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical investigation of
      a medical device. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 6-week treatment period
      (2 weeks run-in and a 4-week observation window to assess the treatment effect), and a 4-week
      follow-up period.

      The study primarily aims at evaluating the effect of intranasal kinetic oscillation
      stimulation using the Chordate System S211 as a preventative treatment on monthly headache
      days with moderate to severe intensity.
