      feedback theory). The facial expression of negative emotions involves facial muscles of the
      glabellar region. It has been shown that paralysis of facial muscles in the forehead using
      botulinum toxin A leads to the improvement of depressive symptoms. It is believed that the
      limited ability to express these emotions alleviates depressive symptoms. As Borderline
      personality disorder is characterized by negative emotions expressed via facial muscles in
      the forehead, it is hypothesized that BPD patients could profit from botulinum toxin
      treatment.
