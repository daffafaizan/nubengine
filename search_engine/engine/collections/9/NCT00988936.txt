    
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine the utility of a new molecular imaging tracer,
      [F-18]RGD-K5 to monitor treatment responses in patients scheduled to undergo treatment with
      Avastin® (Bevacizumab) plus standard chemotherapy. The changes of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT image
      scans between before treatment and after both mid-treatment cycles of Avastin® (Bevacizumab)
      will be evaluated. The hypothesis for this study is that changes in the uptake of
      [F-18]RGD-K5 PET in tumors may reflect changes in the level of integrin expression and/or
      angiogenesis. This pilot study will help to define if changes in uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 are
      an early indicator of treatment efficacy to Avastin®.
