      associated with increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin
      or THL) inhibits gastrointestinal lipase and reduces the absorption of dietary fat. The
      purpose of this study is to to determine if a 24 week weight loss program with orlistat 60 mg
      would produce greater changes in adipose tissue depots (specifically VAT) compared to
      placebo. This study will use the Echo MRI technology across multiple sites to measure total
      fat mass. EchoMRI is a non invasive method ideally suited for studies which track changes in
      human body composition over time, with measuring times of less than 3 minutes and no
      radiation exposure.
