      suppressed persons living with HIV (PLWH) and demographically similar HIV uninfected (HIV-)
      controls. This proposal collects advanced functional neuroimaging that provide critical
      information about cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain connectivity (functional connectivity
      strength; FCS); quantitative measures of immune dysfunction in the blood and cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) (immune activation and immune exhaustion); and neuropsychological performance
      testing. This overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the interplay between dysfunction
      in frontal networks and recruitment of compensatory networks that underlie the
      neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in PLWH.
