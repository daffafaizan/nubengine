      insufficiency with 87% of one-year survival. Cardiovascular complications are common after LT
      with an incidence at 6 months ranging between 25 and 50 %. These complications are associated
      with significant morbidity and represents the third cause of post LT mortality. Myocardial
      perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography, used for preoperative cardiovascular
      evaluation, are not enough efficient to predict the risk of post LT cardiovascular
      complications. However, to improve the prediction capacity of cardiovascular disease is
      fundamental in order to better select the candidates for LT or to develop preventive
      strategies. Such a strategy could reduce the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular
      diseases after LT and improve the results of LT. Cardiovascular biomarkers such as troponin
      or natriuretic peptide are known to be predictive factors of postoperative cardiovascular
      complications in non cardiac surgery. The use of biomarkers in combination with conventional
      tests could improve the preoperative prediction of post LT cardiovascular complications.

      Hypothesis: The preoperative biomarkers dosage could improve the prediction of cardiovascular
      complications occurring in the year after LT.
