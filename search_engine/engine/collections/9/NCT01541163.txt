      natriuretic peptide, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, creatinkinase MB, troponin T),
      inflammatory markers (interleukine 6, procalcitonin, high sensitive C-reactive protein), and
      coagulation parameters in patients with CE IS compared to other causes of IS.

      Assessing the glomerular filtration of cystatin C, glycated haemoglobin and serum lipids and
      its correlation with prior medicament use will allow to evaluate the long-term compensation
      of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia in IS patients.

      In addition to the above mentioned comprehensive cardiological examinations, 1- and 3-week
      ECG-Holter will be performed in subpopulation of patients old up to 50 years and with
      cryptogenic ischemic stroke in the period from 1st May 2013 to 31st December 2015. These
      patients will also fill in a special epidemiologic questionnaire. Anticipated enrollment in
      this substudy of HISTORY study is 40 - 80 patients.

      In selected young cryptogenic stroke patients, a subcutaneous cardiac monitor was implanted
      for the detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the period from 1st January 2014 to
      31st December 2015.

      From 2016 in young ischemic stroke (IS) patients under 50 years, a standard
      perfusion/ventilation scintigraphy of lungs will be performed to exclude acute pulmonary
      embolization (coincidental) in case of elevated serum D-dimers after admission.

      In all enrolled young IS patients, a BP Holter will be performed after the discharge home to
      exclude possible arterial hypertension, which did not presented during hospitalization.
