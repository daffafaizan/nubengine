      All the patients with colon cancer will undergo elective radical operation. The observations
      were recorded during the operation and on the postoperative specimens. Intra-operative
      photographs were taken at various stages, as were photographs of the postoperative specimen.
      According to the CME operation keypoints, all the photographs will accept third-party
      assessment of the expert group, while the third-party expert group will not participate in
      the management of patients. Both of The evaluators and research doctors are double-blind
      state. The postoperative patients will divided into two groups according to the results of
      the assessment. The clinical and pathological data of the patients as well as follow-up
      information will be recorded and collected.

        1. Outcome of CME By comparison to clinicopathologic variables, and precise tissues
           morphometry of two groups, the prognosis, lymph nodes harvest and removal of the
           mesocolic area were investigated. Outcomes of interest also include disease-free
           survival, local recurrence-free survival, recurrence rate. In addition, we analyzed the
           correlation between mesocolic area and height, weight, body surface area and body mass
           index.

        2. Safety of CME CME group and non-CME group were compared the differences of security,
           included operation time, blood loss, postoperation complications, flatus restoring time,
           defecation restoring time, drainage removal time, Diet restoring time, drainage volume
           in three days after surgery, hospital deaths, the exhaust time, hospitalization time and
           hospitalization costs. In addition, the feasibility of CME techniques as the surgical
           approach of choice for elderly patients was also evaluated.
