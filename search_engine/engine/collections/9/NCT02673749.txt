      maldigesters when consuming lactose or when lactose is added to a previously low-lactose
      diet. Lactose intolerance is characterized by one or more of the cardinal symptoms that
      follow the ingestion of lactose-containing foods. These symptoms include; abdominal pain,
      cramping, bloating, flatulence [gas] and diarrhea. As such, most lactose intolerant
      individuals avoid the ingestion of milk and dairy products, while others substitute
      non-lactose containing products in their diet. Currently, there are no approved treatments
      for this condition.

      Based on the health implications from insufficient calcium intake over a lifetime, including
      increased risk of osteoporosis and hypertension, there is need in the medical community for a
      tolerable and convenient treatment that allows for all levels of milk and dairy product
      consumption in people suffering from mild to severe lactose intolerance.

      Study Objective:

      To access efficacy of two RP-G28 dosing regimes on symptoms related to lactose intolerance
      relative to placebo after 30 days of treatment. The 30 day post-treatment phase will further
      evaluate the treatment's potential to prolong relief from symptoms.

      Study Design:

      The participants will take about 60 days to complete the study. The study consists of 3
      distinct phases: Screening, a 30-day Treatment Phase, and a 30-day Post-Treatment Phase (off
      study treatment observation period). A participant will need to visit the clinical only 6
      times throughout the study.
