      hemorrhoids, fistulas, perianal/perirectal abscess and anal fissure. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio using a random number generator to two arms to the study - usual
      care vs. usual care plus ice to numb the anal area prior to incision.

      The outcomes will be measured the same day as the surgery. Prior to leaving the operating
      room the anesthesia team will share with the surgeon the amount of each drug they
      administered. A comfort score will be recorded by the study personnel in the recovery area
      prior to discharge for each participant.
