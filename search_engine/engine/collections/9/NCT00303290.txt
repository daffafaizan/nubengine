      to 4 weeks. After 10 years, blood tests are recommended 2 times per year. Bone marrow samples
      will be taken every 3 months during the first year and then every 3 to 6 months. If you are
      on this study for 10 years or longer, the bone marrow collections will only be performed if
      the doctor thinks it is needed. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed
      with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large
      needle.

      During treatment, you will receive PEG-Intron once a week. You will also receive Ara-C
      injections under the skin. You will be taught to inject yourself, or a family member or
      friend can be taught how to give injections. Treatment will be given to you in the outpatient
      clinic at MD Anderson or in a clinic close to you.

      You will receive treatment as long as it is helping to control the disease. Treatment will go
      on for about 5 to 20 years.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved PEG-Intron only for research studies.
      About 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
