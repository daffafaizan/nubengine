      death, and has enormous economic and emotional costs for caregivers of patients. Most of the
      patients with AD develop disruptive, agitated behaviors at some point during the ailment that
      are a common catalyst for placement in long-term care settings where they represent more than
      half of all the residents. Disruptive behaviors create stress for both staff and patients in
      long-term care settings, reduce patient quality of life because of excess use of physical
      restraints, and drain the financial resources of the facilities. This study proposes to
      design specific interventions designed to decrease disruptive, agitated behavior in patients
      with AD residing in long-term care facilities. This 12-week study will assess the efficacy of
      two pharmacological agents, an atypical neuroleptic (risperidone) and an anticonvulsant and
      mood stabilizer (gabapentin) while identifying moderators of differential treatment response
      to the two drugs. Specifically, this study aims to randomize 130 patients with AD who are
      manifesting agitated disruptive behavior, into two groups of 65 patients each, with one group
      receiving risperidone and the other gabapentin. There are two main hypotheses: 1) Patients in
      both of the treatment groups will manifest different overall group decreases in ratings of
      disruptive, agitated behavior; and 2) Measurable, clinical characteristics will identify
      subgroups of subjects with differential treatment response to the two medications. The two
      variables to be considered as moderators are as follows: a) Patients with higher psychosis
      ratings will manifest greater responsivity to risperidone compared to gabapentin, and b)
      Patients with high levels of affective lability will manifest greater responsivity to
      gabapentin compared to risperidone.
