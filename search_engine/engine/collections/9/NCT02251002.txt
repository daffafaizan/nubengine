      participate in up to two study visits. Both visits will occur at the University of
      Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR). The first study visit will entail
      (1) interviews to determine the presence of (and, if present, the severity of) oculomotor
      difficulties such as convergence insufficiency, and (2) behavioral measures (e.g., visually
      track a moving dot) to assess skill at allocating spatial attention. For participants who
      have not before participated in an MRI study at the CMRR, a 15-minute scan to acquire
      research-quality anatomical images of the brain will be acquired at the end of the first
      visit. A subset of the approximately 88 participants who participate in Visit 1 will be
      invited to participate in Visit 2. Visit 2 will be dominated by a 90-minute scanning session
      in the 7 Tesla scanner, during which participants will perform a 10-minute spatial attention
      task and a 10-minute eye movement task, and high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging data
      will be acquired while participants enjoy the movie of their choice in the scanner.
