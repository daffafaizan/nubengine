      and then moved into the main study with some changes in design and execution occurring in the
      light of experience. Its execution has also been constrained by external factors beyond
      control.

      It is in essence asking whether wearing a Smart Watch which gives feedback on activity every
      two hours, with a specific target tailored to the patient's performance 24 hours earlier will
      be associated with a higher rate of physical activity than seen in people wearing the same
      watch without and feedback been given.

      The intervention only lasts unto 21 days, but earlier discharge will terminate that patient's
      participation sooner. A telephone interview at 12 weeks after entry collect data on mobility.

      Outcome measures will assess mobility, activity, and health status.
