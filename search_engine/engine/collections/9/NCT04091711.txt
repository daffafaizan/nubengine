      according to a pre-programmed treatment protocol. ReX addresses poor patient adherence,
      tracks patient's response to treatment and enhances patient engagement to therapy. The system
      comprises a reusable drug dispensing unit (Dispenser), a disposable Cassette containing the
      prescribed medication, a cellphone app, and the ReX cloud. The Dispenser manages pill
      administration. It includes a touch screen which guides the user and presents
      patient-specific clinical surveys and therapy information. The Dispenser contains a
      chargeable battery and indicators demonstrating device and battery status; a pill window
      enabling pills to be viewed; operational sensors; and communication to an app on cellphones.
      The patient receives the Cassette from the pharmacy, pre-filled with his/her specific
      medication. The Cassette is inserted into the Dispenser where it is locked in place. All
      therapy and patient survey data are transferred to a patient-specific domain on DosentRx'
      proprietary web-based cloud, named Dose-EÂ®.
