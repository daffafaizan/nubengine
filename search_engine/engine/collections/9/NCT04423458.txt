    
      This is an observational prospective pilot study of patients who underwent kidney
      transplantation and they are been referring to MRI scans for post-transplanted kidney
      assessment.

      Duration: 18 Months The research team will collect data from the patients after they have
      signed the informed consent form. Data collection will take place in the vascular laboratory
      unit in the hammersmith hospital.

      Initially, patients will be approached by their primary nephrology team within the
      hammersmith hospital. If a patient is prepared to discuss their potential role in this
      research, then the researchers will discuss the study details at the patient's convenience.
      Recruitment is completely voluntary and will not affect their routine care, this will be made
      clear during the discussion regarding the research, and again during the consenting process.
      Time will be made available for any questions and for the patient to consider recruitment in
      their own time. Patients will be required to sign their consent before any study-related
      procedures are carried out. Then their personal identifiable data will be coded and be also
      Pseudoanonymised.

      Nationally approved protocol for the scan will be followed including introducing the
      examiners and explaining the entire procedure. Before the ultrasound examination, there is no
      follow-up investigation in this study.

      Study data will be entered into a study database which will consist of a password encrypted
      stored on a password-protected computer in the vascular lab at Hammersmith Hospital. Only the
      study researchers will know the study database password.
