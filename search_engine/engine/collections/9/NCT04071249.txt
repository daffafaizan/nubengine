      Patients aged 12 years or older who suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by house
      dust mites, tree pollen or grass pollen and who are treated exclusively with symptomatic
      medication may take part. The treatment follows the normal medical practice in accordance
      with national medical guidelines. During the study, data are collected during 3 visits with
      regard to allergic symptoms of a patient and intake of symptomatic medication. The first
      visit takes place before allergen exposure, the second visit at the peak of allergen exposure
      and the third visit after allergen exposure. The allergen exposure ist defined as the
      enhanced exposure to house dust mites during the heating period or the respective pollen
      season. During the visits, the patients will be asked to complete questionnaires [the
      rhinitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ, Visit 1, 2 and 3) and the rhinitis control
      assessment test (RCAT, visit 2)]. Furthermore during allergen exposure, the patients document
      allergic symptoms and intake of symptomatic medication in a diary. These diary entries are
      used to generate the Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS) which will be validated in
      the course of this study. The validation will be performed by comparing the CSMS with the
      scores from the already validated RQLQ and RCAT.
