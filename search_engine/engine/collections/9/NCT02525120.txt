      Triojection and surgical discectomy. The study will include two follow-up phases: 1) an
      initial follow-up period during the first 6 months after treatment and (2) a long-term
      follow-up lasting an additional 18 months (2 years total).

      The hypothesis is that over the first six months after treatment, TriojectionÂ® will be
      non-inferior to discectomy with respect to the improvement in leg pain. This will be
      demonstrated using a non-inferiority margin of 19.4 points on the difference between baseline
      leg pain score and the average leg pain score recorded at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months.
