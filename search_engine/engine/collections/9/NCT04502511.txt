      relatedness: <All patients will undergo physical examination, including ultrasound evaluation
      upon ICU admission according to standard practice care. The burden will be a blood sample
      (and urine sample) at admission. Blood sample will be obtained by arterial line (or venous
      access) which is part of standard ICU care. So there will be no additional puncture for this
      study. Collection of variables during ICU stay will all be either part of standard clinical
      care or include extra physical examination or ultrasound evaluation. For follow-up patients
      will be evaluated by phone at 6 months and at 12 months by home-visit. This is also already
      part of the investigator's evaluation of quality of care. Except for blood sampling, all
      study related procedures have previously been approved by the Institutional Review Board
      (IRB). The patient will experience no individual benefit.
