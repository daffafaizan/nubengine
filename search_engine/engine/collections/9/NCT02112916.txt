    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) who are randomized
      to a modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ABFM) backbone versus bortezomib plus the
      modified ABFM backbone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of modifying standard therapy for T-ALL and T-LLy
      based on the results of UKALL 2003, which includes a dexamethasone-based induction,
      additional doses of pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) during induction and delayed intensification (DI),
      and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance therapy.

      II. To determine if prophylactic (presymptomatic) cranial radiation therapy (CRT) can be
      safely and effectively eliminated in the 85-90% of T-ALL patients classified as standard or
      intermediate risk.

      III. To determine the proportion of end of consolidation (EOC) minimal residual disease (MRD)
      >= 0.1% T-ALL patients who become MRD negative (undetectable by flow cytometry) after
      intensification of chemotherapy, using three high risk (HR) BFM blocks, and to compare EFS
      between the patients who become MRD negative after the three HR BFM blocks and continue on
      chemotherapy with those who continue to have detectable MRD and are eligible for other
      treatment strategies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      IV. To compare the EFS between very high risk (induction failure) T-LLy patients treated with
      HR BFM intensification blocks who have partial or complete response (PR or CR) with those who
      do not respond (NR).

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the prognostic significance of day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD in T-LLy
      patients.

      II. To determine if protein expression patterns can predict bortezomib response and drug
      resistance in T-ALL.

      III. To analyze and target relevant signaling pathways in T-ALL blasts, focusing on early T
      cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
