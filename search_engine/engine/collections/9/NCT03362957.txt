      population with knee pain secondary to arthritis to determine safety and efficacy. After
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of a written informed consent and over,
      approximately a 24 month duration, N=21 subjects will be recruited. Only subjects â‰¥ 40 years
      will be screened for study recruitment. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of
      GAE:Placebo and will be blinded from study treatment (see flow chart below). The placebo
      procedure will be a diagnostic angiogram of the knee, without embolization. Appropriate
      measures will be taken to ensure patients and nursing staff caring for the patient are
      blinded to assignment. Each patient will be told at the time of recruitment that they may be
      randomly assigned to sham, but if after 1 month they have not had symptom improvement, their
      assigned procedure would be revealed and, if they had undergone a sham procedure, they will
      be allowed to proceed with embolization. This second procedure should be shorter than a
      complete angiogram and embolization, as the detailed angiogram will not need to be repeated,
      and therefore both arms will have similar total radiation dose.

      Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening assessment to
      determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24
      hours, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months. An MRI may be performed after the 1-month visit.
