    
      High risk uveal melanoma is defined by :

        -  Clinical criteria: Largest Tumor Diameter ≥ 15 mm with extra scleral extension and/or
           retinal detachment or Largest Tumor Diameter ≥ 18 mm AND/ OR

        -  Genomic high risk signature (aCGH +/-LOH): Monosomy 3 or partial deletion of 3p
           associated with any 8 gain.

      Treatment schedule :

        -  Induction: Fotemustin 100 mg/m², D1-D8-D15, 1 hour IV infusion, 1 cycle

        -  Maintenance : restart on D50, Fotemustine : 100 mg/m², 1 hour IV infusion, D1 D21, 5
           cycles.

      Both groups are followed during 3 years for Metastasis- Free Survival, safety and tolerance
      of Fotemustin, quality of life, and Overall Survival.

      Note :Based on the second interim analysis showing futility, and no chance to observe any
      significant statistical difference at the end of the study, the Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee recommended to stop randomization and amend the protocol to propose an
      interventional surveillance to high-risk patients as per protocol (April 2016).
