      impairment that results from cerebrovascular diseases. SaiLuoTong capsule is a traditional
      Chinese medicine compound; it is composed of ginseng extract (the main composition: ginseng
      total saponins), ginkgo biloba extract (the main composition: YinXingTong ester) and
      safflower extract (the main composition: the west safflower total glycosides). The function
      of SaiLuoTong capsule is Yiqi Huoxue and Huayu Tongluo in Chinese traditional medicine
      theory. Pharmacodynamics studies showed that SaiLuoTong capsule can significantly improve
      neurological symptoms caused by focal cerebral ischemia in animals, and learning and memory
      ability in animal models of VaD. The result of the phase II study showed that the efficacy of
      SaiLuoTong capsule in the treatment of patients with VaD was better than that of placebo
      group and no difference in safety. Based on these previous evidences, the investigators
      conduct this study to further confirm the efficacy and safety of SaiLuoTong capsule in
      patients with mild to moderate VaD. This study is a phase III clinical trial of SaiLuoTong
      capsule for treatment of vascular dementia. The study is a 52-week, multicentre, randomized,
      double -blind, placebo-controlled study.
