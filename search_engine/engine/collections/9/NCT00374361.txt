      body (called the endothelium) and insulin work in adolescents. Abnormalities in how the blood
      vessels and insulin work in adolescents may cause high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes,
      stroke and heart disease.

      Healthy adolescents between 8 and 18 years of age are being studied in the Ohio State
      University General Clinical Research Center. Two visits will be necessary. One will be a
      screening visit to determine the child's stage of puberty and obtain a medical history. The
      second will be the study visit. During the latter, blood vessel function will be determined
      by studying the change in forearm blood flow before and after blood flow to the forearm is
      stopped. Insulin sensitivity will be determined using glucose water given into a vein.
