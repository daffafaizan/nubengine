      known pathologic hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid-beta (AB), in symptomatic individuals have
      proved largely fruitless so other potential disease targets warrant exploration.
      Neuroinflammation has interesting possible associations with AD dementia and may contribute
      to AD dementia in different ways among different individuals. Previous PET neuroinflammation
      data are not entirely consistent and new methods of PET imaging and studies with larger
      cohorts are needed to further investigate the role of neuroinflammation in AD dementia and
      the utility of PET as a biomarker. This project seeks to test new PET neuroinflammation
      imaging methods in unimpaired and AD dementia individuals with biomarker-identified brain
      pathology to help address these gaps in knowledge in the field.
