      Assia. The idea (principle) behind the Tri-MICS technique is the use of a sleeveless phaco
      needle which is introduced via a tiny incision (1.1mm). An additional corneal incision is
      made for the introduction of a second surgical instrument, and a third for an ACM as an
      exclusive source for the infusion - this saves the need for an additional instrument. The ACM
      that will be used in this study (AVI New York) is a small metal tube with an external
      diameter of 1.1 mm, and an internal diameter of 0.9 mm and was developed specifically for
      this use. This type of ACM has been used in hundreds of surgeries and has been found to be
      both effective and safe.

      This procedure has 4 clear advantages:

        1. The implementation of three corneal incisions, 1.1 mm wide with an angle of
           approximately 120 degrees between them - neutrality regarding astigmatism versus the
           Biaxial-MICS.

        2. This procedure does not require any special medical instruments, for example; new phaco
           instruments which are specifically adapted for the MICS approach at the cost of tens of
           thousands of dollars.

        3. This procedure allows a free use of the surgeon's second hand.

        4. A fixed intraocular infusion keeps the intraocular pressure (IOP) and anterior chamber
           volume constant and stable.
