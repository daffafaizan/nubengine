      added salt diet (120 milliequivalent (mEq) Na/Day) which will be maintained during the study.
      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive BNP or placebo (an inactive, saline
      shot). The participant will need to give themselves a shot in their stomach (similar to
      diabetics giving themselves insulin) twice a day for twelve weeks. The study requires a
      screening visit to determine eligibility and discuss the study. At this visit a blood draw
      for heart and liver function and a six minute walk will be done. There will also be two other
      outpatient visits and two inpatient stays, for 48 hours, in the Clinical Research Unit at St.
      Marys Hospital. During the two overnight stays, blood and urine samples will be done to get
      heart and kidney function as well as a research echocardiogram. An acute saline load (0.9%
      normal saline 1.25 ml/kg/min for 1 hour) will be given and blood and urine samples collected
      After enrollment, the study lasts for twelve weeks. It is planned to treat 2 subjects with
      active drug per each placebo subject to improved the precision of between group comparison.
