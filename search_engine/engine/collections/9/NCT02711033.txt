      standard surgical therapy. Apparently, lymph nodes (LNs) dissection along the splenic artery
      (No.11) and the splenic hilum (No.10) is recommended by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment
      Guidelines. Nevertheless, complete removal of the No. 10 and No. 11d LNs is technically
      challenging due to the tortuous splenic vessels and the high possibility of injury to the
      parenchyma of the spleen and pancreas. Recently, the application of minimally invasive
      surgery for advanced gastric cancer is gaining popularity. However, laparoscopic-assisted
      total gastrectomy (LATG) with standard D2 lymphadenectomy was still not widely performed,
      because pancreas- and spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph node dissection were mainly
      challenging manipulations for laparoscopic surgeons. Herein, we aim to investigate the safety
      and feasibility of LATG with spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph node dissection for
      proximal advanced gastric cancer and compares the early results of this procedure with open
      total gastrectomy (OTG).
