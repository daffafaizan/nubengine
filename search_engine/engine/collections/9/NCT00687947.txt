      spontaneous attacks in a large proportion of migraine sufferers. Treatment of spontaneous
      migraine attacks with an inhibitor of CGRP is effective in many patients. These data show
      that CGRP is involved in migraine pathophysiology.

      The importance of migraine genetics is disputed. Evidence from FHM patients with known
      mutations indicates that migraine pathways in FHM may be different from normal migraine. The
      aim of the present study is to examine whether this difference also exists in FHM patients
      without known mutations. The project will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of
      migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.
