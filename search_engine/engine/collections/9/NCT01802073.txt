      during vancomycin treatment of children and adults with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC),
      identify features of the host microbiota that are associated with disease activity and/or
      response to treatment and further delineate the immunological effects of oral vancomycin
      treatment of PSC. This study will correlate changes in microbiota with the immunological
      effects of oral vancomycin in children and adults with PSC. The results of this proposal will
      lead to new and validated targets for diagnosis and treatment of PSC that will have high
      impact in the short and long term for patients and their families.
