    
      Objective:

      To diagnose and elucidate the underlying disease mechanism in patients with neuromuscular and
      neurogenetic disorders with congenital or pediatric onset (phase 1 of the protocol) and to
      study the natural history and mechanism of disease in neuromuscular and neurogenetic
      disorders of childhood (phase 2 of the protocol).

      Study population:

      Patients with childhood onset neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders, their affected and
      unaffected family members, and healthy volunteers. Patients with later onset of a disorder
      that is known to typically have childhood onset will be included as well.

      Design:

      Diagnostic and prospective longitudinal natural history study.

      Outcome Measures:

      Diagnose and characterize patients with neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders with
      congenital or pediatric onset and study the natural history and underlying disease mechanism.
      In the characterized patient population identify and develop effective outcome measures for
      use in future clinical trials, including applicable motor scales, quality of life scales,
      biomarkers from blood and urine, imaging studies, and pulmonary function tests.
