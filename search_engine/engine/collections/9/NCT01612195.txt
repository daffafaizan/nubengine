      quality of life of affected individuals. The clinical course of abscess-fistula disease as
      well as its treatment modalities may affect anal continence. Anal fistula plug surgery is an
      Health Canada and FDA approved surgical treatment that has demonstrated promising results in
      terms of fistula healing and minimal patients' burden. The present cohort study prospectively
      investigates the results of anal fistula plug surgery performed in teaching hospitals
      affiliated to the University of Toronto. In particular, this study focus on the impact of
      anal fistula plug surgery on health-related quality of life, and its 2 major determinants
      anal continence and fistula healing. Fifty patients will be included and followed up at 6
      weeks and 6 months after surgery in the clinic of participating surgeons. Quality of life and
      anal continence will be measured with the validated Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2)
      and Fecal Incontinence Score Index (FISI) questionnaires, respectively. It is expected that
      the present study will provide objective information on the results and generalizability of
      anal fistula surgery, as well as on its impact on health-related quality of life and anal
      continence.
