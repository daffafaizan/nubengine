      a control group with testing according to clinical judgement and results ready within next
      office day. Subjects will be randomized on admission and unequal allocation ratio of 2:1
      (1112 subjects to intervention and 556 subjects to control arm) will be used. Data on rate of
      hospitalization, antibiotic prescriptions, ancillary testing and length of visit will be
