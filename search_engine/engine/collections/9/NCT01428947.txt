      cerebral microembolism. Cerebral microemboli were more common using the radial than femoral
      approach. Previously, cerebral microembolism has been associated with new cerebral lesions on
      MRI. The clinical significance of these new lesions is not determined. The primary aim of
      this pilot study is to see if coronary angiography cause cognitive dysfunction determined by
      the MoCA-test. A secondary aim is to relate cognitive dysfunction to cerebral microembolism
      measured by transcranial doppler. A third aim is to study potential differences between the
      femoral and radial approaches.
