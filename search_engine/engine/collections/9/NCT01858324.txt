      women are often poorly informed on preeclampsia and seeking care too late results in
      maternal/fetal complications. Many healthcare providers believe that delivering information
      for low-risk women only make them more anxious.

      Preliminary data: We published that an information pamphlet on preeclampsia increases
      knowledge, without increasing anxiety, and generates high satisfaction in women hospitalized
      for preeclampsia.

      Objectives: Demonstrate that (1) ambulatory low-risk pregnant women will benefit from the
      pamphlet/video with improved knowledge; (2) without any increase in anxiety, and with great
      satisfaction.

      Design: Prospective randomized controlled pilot study. Inclusion criteria: consecutive
      pregnant women aged â‰¥18 y.o. between 200-326 weeks presenting at the clinic and who
      read/write French or English. Exclusion criteria: Anticipated delivery or termination within
      one month. Intervention: pamphlet, magnet and video. Control: no educational tool. At
      baseline, women in both groups will answer questionnaire #1 on demographics; one month later:
      self-administered questionnaire #2 on knowledge, anxiety, satisfaction.

      Sample size: N=178 will provide 80% power to find a significant improvement of at least 20%
      in knowledge score and 96% power to find a difference of at least 1 on scale for anxiety
      (alpha of 5%). Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, missing answers <20%, and rate of answered
      questionnaire #2 of 50%, 400 subjects will be recruited.

      Anticipated results: The tools will improve knowledge by about 20% in intervention group
      compared to control group. They will not increase anxiety over one point and will be highly
      appreciated by women.
