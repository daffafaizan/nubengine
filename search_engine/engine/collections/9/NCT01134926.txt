      pregnancies, probably more often after termination of early pregnancies then after term
      pregnancy. Complication are abdominal pain, infection, bleeding and for the long term -
      intrauterine adhesions.Blood clots in the uterine cavity can cause similar complications. The
      definitive treatment is curettage or hysteroscopy, both of which are carried out under
      general anesthesia and require an operating theater. Although expectant management and
      uterotonic drugs are practically used in such situation, they are not described in the
      literature.This study compare between the outcome of misoprostol treatment and expectant
      management in the case of intrauterine residua after completion of pregnancy.
