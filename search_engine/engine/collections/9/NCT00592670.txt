      it is vital to understand how these antidepressants affect hypoglycemia- the most feared
      complication in diabetes. This study's aim is to determine whether individuals who are
      chronically taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a reduced ability to defend
      against hypoglycemia compared to individuals not taking the medication, thus leaving them
      more susceptible to hypoglycemia. Both healthy volunteers and volunteers with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus will be studied. The results could potentially be important to diabetic patients, by
      demonstrating to physicians how to modify therapy for those taking antidepressants in order
      to avoid hypoglycemia.

      The known effects of SSRI on the hypothalamo pituitary axis(HPA)may be important to the
      counterregulation of hypoglycemia. Prior research has demonstrated in healthy volunteers that
      antecedent increases in plasma cortisol result in significant blunting of neuroendocrine and
      autonomic responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. Thus, by activating the HPA axis, SSRIs could
      cause blunting of the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia.
