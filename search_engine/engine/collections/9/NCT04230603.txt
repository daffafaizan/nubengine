      visible and near infrared range (500-1000 nm). A RGB image and 4 false color images that
      represent physiologic parameters are intraoperatively provided by an analysis software. But
      after the procedure all spectral datasets could be investigated. To analyse and differentiate
      the different tissues, a catalog database is needed of all tissues including Tumors.
