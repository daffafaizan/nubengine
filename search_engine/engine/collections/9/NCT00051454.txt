      strategy for HIV prophylaxis using a DNA-prime plus recombinant fowlpox boost. The DNA
      plasmid and fowlpox vector contain HIV genes. However, these vaccines contain only some HIV
      genes and cannot themselves cause HIV or AIDS.

      Eligible volunteers at low risk of HIV infection will be randomized to receive either active
      vaccine or placebo injections at Day 0, Week 4, and Week 8. Intensive immunologic and safety
      monitoring will be done during the first 16 weeks of the study. Follow-up will continue to
      Week 52.
