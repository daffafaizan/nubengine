      colic being a common and painful symptom in these patients. Likely due to the relatively
      recent approval of intravenous ibuprofen use for fever and pain in adults, no assessment of
      its analgesic efficacy for biliary colic currently exists in the literature.

      Utilizing a visual analog scale (VAS) for patient self-assessment of pain, this study will
      address this lack of evidence and identify intravenous ibuprofen's value as a novel analgesic
      in the treatment of biliary colic. Patients will be given a VAS at the time of study therapy
      administration, at 15-minute intervals during the first hour post-administration, and
      30-minute intervals in the second hour. Though NSAID's have been extensively studied in the
      management of this phenomenon, this study aims to help optimize pain treatment of patients
      presenting to the Emergency Department with biliary colic, and potentially pave the way for
      future analgesic treatment comparison studies.
