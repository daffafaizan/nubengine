      crossover study, 48 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA will take
      atomoxetine-plus-oxybutynin ("AtoOxy") versus placebo nightly for 1 month, with a 2-week
      washout in between. The investigators will test the hypothesis that AtoOxy reduces the
      Apnea-hypopnea index (primary outcome measure), and improves the following secondary
      outcomes:

        -  Nocturnal oxygenation, per "hypoxic burden of sleep apnea"

        -  Frequency of arousals from sleep (Arousal index)

        -  Self-reported sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale)

        -  Disease-specific quality of life (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Short
           Form).

        -  Disease-specific quality of life (Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index, Short Form)

      Additional pre-specified exploratory outcome measures will be assessed, including Visual
      Analog Scales (Sleep Quality, Treatment Satisfaction) and additional polysomnographic
      measures of sleep (Stage 1 sleep, %total sleep time). Adherence and adverse events will also
      be carefully monitored to assess repeated-dose tolerance of the intervention.

      Aim 2 - Determine which patient phenotypes respond best to AtoOxy. Patients will also take
      part in an additional night before initiating study medication to measure the key mechanisms
      causing OSA. The investigators will prospectively test the hypothesis that greater pharyngeal
      collapsibility determines a reduced response to therapy. They will also separately test the
      hypotheses that a reduced muscle responsiveness, reduced baseline muscle activation, a higher
      arousal threshold, and a lower loop gain will facilitate a greater response to therapy.
