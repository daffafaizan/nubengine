      in minimally invasive surgery allow us today to embark on increasingly complex surgeries.

      Laparoscopic surgery has even become the gold standard approach for many interventions,
      whether for bariatric functional surgery, reflux surgery, pelvic static disorder surgery, but
      also for tumor surgery such as colorectal cancer, esophageal or tail of the pancreas.

      However, there are still interventions which, due to their technical difficulty, do not find
      unanimous consensus among the international scientific community for a possible minimally
      invasive approach.

      The close contact of the pancreatic gland with the splenomesaraic trunk making laparoscopic
      dissection difficult with risk of uncontrollable bleeding.

      It seems, however, that the finesse of the dissection and coagulation instruments and the
      precision of today's optics make it possible to approach the head of the pancreas in
      completely satisfactory conditions.

      Several centers around the world have developed the LPD technique with encouraging results in
      terms of perioperative mortality without showing any advantage over laparotomy.

      At the Montpellier University Hospital we started performing Laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) at the beginning of 2016.

      The aim of this study is to assess, on the one hand, the morbimortality and the quality of
      surgery linked to the development of this relatively new technique in a reference center for
      pancreatic surgery and on the other hand to assess a possible learning curve effect within
      our experience.
