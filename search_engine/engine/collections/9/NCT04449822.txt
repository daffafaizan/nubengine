    
      Acute colonic obstruction is one of the common clinical presentations of colorectal cancer.
      Surgical decompression with colostomy with or without resection and eventual re-anastomosis
      is the treatment of choice; however, emergency surgery is associated with higher morbidity
      and mortality.

      The colonic stent insertion effectively decompressed the obstructed colon and avoid needs of
      emergency surgery. This method is a palliation and bridge to surgery. Colonic stents allowed
      surgery to be performed electively.
