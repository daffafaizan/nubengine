    
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter single-arm study with a dose-escalation phase (Part
      1) followed by a dose-expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 75
      patients. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used for Part 1 in order to determine
      the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE).

      Part 2 will consist of 3 cohorts from one or more selected tumor types. Each cohort will
      enroll 15 patients.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of
      3-6 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (visits approximately every 12 weeks for up to 2 years
      after treatment discontinuation).
