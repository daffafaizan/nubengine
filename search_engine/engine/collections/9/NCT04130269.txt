      traumatic event that seems lifethreatening. Such anxiety, pain and stress can lead to the
      development of posttraumatic stress disorder in the long run. Previous studies suggest that
      there might be a relevant percentage of people developing PTSD after a myocardial infarction.
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease.
      The goal of this study is to detect the percentage of people that develop symptoms of
      anxiety, stress and PTSD after an acute myocardial infarction.

      Patients will be examined during three times - in the acute myocardial infarction period (Day
      1-3), before dismissal (Day 5-14) and after 6 months for a follow-up. During all times they
      will be given questionnaires asking about their levels of stress, anxiety and general
      well-being as well as tests checking their cognitive abilities (thus to find out if they
      decrease over time). Moreover, blood samples checking cortisol levels as well as metanephrine
      levels will be taken in order to objectify the levels of stress that are stated by the
      patients. Furthermore, clinical evaluations, laboratory runs (troponin), ECGs and
      echocardiographies will be done at all three points in time.

      The goal is to detect the biopsychosocial relations and to develop better prevention.
