      ventilator therapy and who have Pseudomonas infections. They will receive either placebo, or
      one of two dose levels of KB001, a Humaneeredâ„¢, high-affinity antibody fragment that KaloBios
      is developing for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infections. This trial will
      evaluate the ability of KB001 to protect host epithelium and immune cells, and evaluate
      reduction of pulmonary Pa burden.
