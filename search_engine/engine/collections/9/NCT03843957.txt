      Cancer), a patient-friendly iPad program used by individuals immediately before a routine
      primary care visit.

      To fully realize mPATH-CRC's potential to decrease CRC mortality, the program now must be
      implemented in primary care practices in a way that encourages routine and sustained use.
      However, while hundreds of mobile health (mHealth) tools have been developed in recent years,
      the optimal strategies for implementing and maintaining mHealth interventions in clinical
      practice are unknown. This study will compare the results of a "high touch" strategy to a
      "low touch" strategy using a Type III hybrid design and incorporating mixed methods to
      evaluate implementation, maintenance, and effectiveness of mPATH-CRC in a diverse sample of
      community-based practices.

      The study will be conducted in three phases: 1) in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of
      28 primary care clinics, the study team will compare the implementation outcomes of a "high
      touch" evidence-based mHealth implementation strategy with a "low touch" implementation
      strategy; 2) in a nested pragmatic study, the study team will estimate the effect of
      mPATH-CRC on completion of CRC screening within 16 weeks of a clinic visit; and 3) by
      surveying and interviewing clinic staff and providers after implementation is complete, the
      study team will determine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of mHealth
      interventions.

      This record refers to the cluster-randomized controlled trial of 28 primary care clinics.
