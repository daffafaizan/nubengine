      prostatectomy (RALP) are compared to those of 3D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The
      hypothesis of the study is that the functional and oncologic results of the two operative
      methods are equal, but the direct costs of RAPL are significantly higher. A randomized,
      prospective non-inferiority study will will enroll 280 patients randomized 1:1 to both
      operative approaches to test this hypothesis. The primary functional outcome measure is the
      proportion of patients with complete urinary continence (no protective pad use) at 12 months
      post operatively. Secondary functional outcome measure is the preservation erectile function
      at 12 months post operatively. Oncologic outcome measures are the proportion of patients with
      undetectable post operative prostate specific antigen levels and positive surgical margins at
      pathological examination. The direct and indirect costs of both operative approaches are
      recorded.
