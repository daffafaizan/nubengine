      novel approaches. The first is the investigation of asymmetric MT effects with respect to the
      zero or on-resonance reference point. The technique measures the difference in MT effect
      between two symmetrically positioned off-resonance MT pulses in the positive and negative
      frequency ranges. Prior research with this technique in the kidney show a difference in the
      macromolecular lineshape that correlates to a specific metabolite. The second approach,
      utilizing a subset of the acquisitions from the first approach, will test newly developed
      formulation to calculate the macromolecular fraction, or fraction of proton density that
      accounts for MT. We foresee these measurements may significantly develop our understanding of
      MT and introduce diagnostic and quantitative tools to study human tissue.
