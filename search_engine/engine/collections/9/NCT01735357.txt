      (20:5n-3). The understanding of this differential effect may be of great interest in
      populations with low EPA intake such as vegetarians, who may choose to supplement their
      dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFA in the form of DHA-rich algal oil.

      This study aimed to investigate the effect of supplementation with oils rich in either EPA or
      DHA (3g/day, 6 weeks) in healthy young males on platelet, endothelial and vascular function,
      as well as other CVD risk factors. The primary outcomes were platelet monocyte aggregates and
      endothelial progenitor cells - novel markers of platelet and endothelial function, measured
      by flow cytometry, Secondary outcomes included capillary density, measured by capillaroscopy
      to assess changes in microvascular function, pulse wave analysis, digital volume pulse and
      ambulatory blood pressure. Other secondary outcomes included lipid profiles (TAG,
      cholesterol, NEFA), glycaemic control (HOMA, QUICKI) and oxidative stress (isoprostane). The
      omega-3 index (erythrocyte EPA+DHA) was used as a marker of compliance.
