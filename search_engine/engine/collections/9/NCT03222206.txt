      Aspirin(Acetylated salicylic) is known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, also salsalate is
      widely used painkiller and anti-inflammatory without prescription in Europe and America
      through the long time and it was approved as osteoarthritis and rheumarthritis treatment in
      Korea. Especially salsalate is switched to salicylic acid(active metabolite) 15% rate lower
      than the same dose of aspirin (3.5g vs. 5g).

      Salsalate is cyclooxygenase antagonist, it make anti-inflammatory effect by hinder creation
      of variety inflammatory induction factors like interleukin-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor
      (TNF)-alpha, C-reactive protein. This anti-inflammatory reaction is known to block Nuclear
      Factor(NF)-kappaB gene action by hinder action of IkappaB kinase. Also salsalate was reported
      it has positive effect to gluco metabolism as performed role of insulin-sensitizing.
      Therefore, the above mechanism of salsalate was expected that it can be had positive effect
      to metabolic disease like diabetes and obesity, and related studies are performed
      considerably at present.

      There is no clinical trial for non alcoholic fatty acid related salsalate, and there was the
      animal study result that salsalate may reduce occurence of non alcoholic fatty acid and
      fibrosis by hinder non alcoholic fatty acid creation and inflammation mediation path.

      Therefore, this Study purpose to verify change of variety factors that the cause of
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its process through salsalate injection to
      osteoarthritis patient who has non alcoholic fatty liver
