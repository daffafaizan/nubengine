      sleep/wake cycle, and sleep deprivation is known to precipitate seizure activity. Inadequate
      or disturbed sleep and excessive daytime drowsiness is often reported by patients with
      Epilepsy due to the effects of seizures as well as antiepileptic drugs. Thus, the use of
      healthy subjects improves the certainty that any changes in sleep are related to the study
      drug and not other factors.
