      progression.

      Based on the theory that myopia was caused by the excessive accommodative, bifocal or
      multifocal spectacles for slowing the progression of myopia have been fully studied. Although
      some studies' results showed statistically significant for slowing myopia progression with
      multifocal spectacles, few had clinically meaningful, even in children with high
      accommodative lag or near-point esophoria. The investigators think that the possible reason
      for this clinical un-meaningful maybe that daily wearing bifocal or multifocal spectacles
      still not fully adjust the accommodative error in children.

      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate myopic progression in children using
      two spectacles (single-vision spectacles for distant vision, and +3.00ADD spectacle for near
      vision), compared with control subjects wearing one spectacles (single-vision spectacles).
      Myopia progression quantified by changes in axial length (AL) and cycloplegic spherical
      equivalent refraction will be monitored for 3 years. The spectacles for intervention group
      children will be adjusted based on the cycloplegic spherical equivalent and the extent of
      accommodation lag for schedule time.
