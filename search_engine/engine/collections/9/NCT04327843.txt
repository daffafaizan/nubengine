      build capacity in measure implementation, and finalize the intervention for delivery by
      healthcare workers. Finally, in a training/proof-of-concept exercise, the healthcare workers
      will implement the adapted CAE-L in a high-risk sample of Tanzanians with CPD (individuals
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have had recent medication adherence
      problems). Taken together, the proposed project has substantial public health importance. It
      will provide the prerequisite materials, training and infrastructure needed for a prospective
      trial in reducing CPD burden and improving brain health in Tanzania and other countries in
      Sub-Saharan Africa.

      The focus of this project is on feasibility, patient acceptability, and research
      capacity-building. Therefore a specific hypothesis is not being tested. The investigators
      will assess descriptive statistics and change from baseline in the primary and secondary
      measures using standard pre-post techniques.
