      to the challenge for society to prevent a future "lack of care". At the same time the number
      of people requiring healthcare is expanding rapidly, amongst others due to the growing
      percentage of older adults in the population. New means of supporting the available
      healthcare professionals are therefore urgently required.

      Modern healthcare is often implemented through "integrated care pathways". Certain steps in
      these pathways involve dialogues with patients. Speaking social robots are increasingly being
      advertised as supportive for healthcare professionals and may handle certain structured
      dialogue types, such as questionnaires. Based on previous positive preclinical experiences
      with social robots interviewing community-dwelling older subjects, the researchers want to
      investigate the implementation of a social robot in an integrated care pathway in the
      outpatient clinic.
