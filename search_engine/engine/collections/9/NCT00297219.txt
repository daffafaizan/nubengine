      calcification scores in hemodialysis patients during time (90% power with a two-sided, alpha
      error rate of 5%). Four hundred fifty-seven hemodialysis patients, taking drop-out rate into
      consideration, will be enrolled in this prospective-controlled study.The cases already being
      treated with calcium-based phosphate binder and dialysate containing 1.75 or 1.5 mmol/L
      calcium will be enrolled from eight hemodialysis centers.The cases will be randomized to two
      arms:

        1. Dialysate containing 1.25 mmol/L calcium + calcium-based phosphate binder group:
           Dialysate calcium will be reduced from 1.75 or 1.5 mmol/L to 1.25 mmol/L in this group.
           Patients will use calcium-based phosphate binder according to phosphate level.

        2. Dialysate containing 1.75 mmol/L calcium + calcium-based phosphate binder group (Control
           group): Dialysate calcium will remain or switched to 1.75 mmol/L and patients will be on
           calcium-based phosphate binder.

      The study will last for 18 months.Coronary artery calcification (Multi-slice CT), bone
      histomorphometry, and bone mineral density will be assessed in the beginning and at the end
      of the study. Coronary artery calcification and bone mineral density will be measured in all
      patients; bone histomorphometry will be assessed in 150 patients, 75 from each group.
