      Patients will be identified in the urology clinic upon their standard of care visit for AUS
      placement. The procedures that determine whether a patient is a surgical candidate are as
      follows:

        -  Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) and Urinary Incontinence Symptoms
           index (ISI) standardized questionnaires

        -  Physical examination

        -  Review of medical history that would preclude surgery

        -  Cystoscopy to evaluate and rule out stricture

        -  Uroflow/Post void residual to ensure adequate bladder capacity

      Pre surgery work up includes:

        -  Urine analysis and if indicated urine culture and treatment of urinary tract infection

        -  Flow, post-void residual if possible

        -  Cystoscopy to rule out bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture

        -  History and physical examination

        -  Treatment of men with 2 days of chlorhexidine wash to the perineum

        -  Incontinence sexual function questionaires

        -  Aminogllycoside and other abx prior to surgery

        -  24 hour pad weight

      Post-surgery follow up:

        -  Routine removal of catheter within 5 days post-op

        -  Treatment of antibiotics post-operatively to be limited to 1 week

        -  Activation of AUS at 4-8 weeks post-op

        -  Incontinence sexual function questionnaires

        -  24 hour pad weight

      Routine follow ups will be conducted at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      post-operatively, and yearly thereafter (SOC). Patient characteristics that will be collected
      include:

        -  etiology of the incontinence.

        -  pre-operative pad usage

        -  prior anti-incontinence procedures

        -  adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer such as radiotherapy, or other history of pelvic
           radiation

        -  post-operative urodynamic studies

        -  cystoscopy findings
