      cancer. P53 protein accumulation in certain tumours is associated with tumour aggressiveness.
      The role of P53 expression in Wilms' tumour is not clear; however, most studies confirmed its
      correlation with advanced stages and anaplasia.

      Ki67 is a nuclear antigen related to cell proliferation, and high Ki67 proliferation index
      (PI) is accompanied by tumour aggressiveness, distant metastasis and death. Advanced stages
      and clinical progression of WT were found to be associated with high Ki67 PI. On the other
      hand, some authors concluded that it may not be a dependable prognostic marker.

      The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have a role in transitions between cell cycle phases with
      the need of cyclins association for their activity. IHC assessment of cell cycle proteins has
      a diagnostic use in histopathology. Correlation between poor prognosis and overexpression of
      cyclin A was confirmed in different entities of human cancer such as medulloblastoma and
      ovarian carcinoma. A recent study deduced that cyclin A overexpression may be associated with
      the poor prognosis of WT.
