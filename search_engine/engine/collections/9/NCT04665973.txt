      In one of the two forms, TPE is delivered using an information booklet accompanied with a
      semi-structured oral interview (intervention group), whereas in the other form TPE is only
      delivered via the booklet (control group). The investigators hypothesize that the brief oral
      educational session of 30 minutes provided at the very beginning of cancer therapy will
      enhance the PA level of our patients for at least 6 months, i.e. during their cancer therapy.

      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome is
      the evolution in each group of the PA level (via the international physical activity
      questionnaire (IPAQ) - long form) between the start of cancer therapy and 6-month follow-up.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned either to the intervention group (TPE includes
      the information booklet + the semi-structured oral intervention provided by a
      physiotherapist) or to the control group (TPE will consist only in the information booklet).
      Patients and assessors will be blinded.

      The relative efficacy of these 2 treatment arms will be evaluated at baseline, after 3 months
      at a visit for a follow-up medical consultation set by the oncologist, and after 6 months at
      a second follow-up consultation.
