      with daily acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) therapy, either alone or coupled with
      task-specific training, on upper extremity function in individuals with chronic, incomplete
      SCI.

      Previous work already determined that breathing low levels of oxygen for short periods of
      time (also known as acute intermittent hypoxia) can improve lower limb motor function in
      persons with spinal injury. Specifically, this study is being done to determine if
      pre-treatment with intermittent hypoxia can enhance the beneficial effects of upper limb
      training on the restoration of limb function in persons with spinal injury.

      This is a blinded study, which means that the subject will not know which treatment they are
      receiving. They will either receive intermittent periods of low oxygen (hypoxia) or a session
      composed of only normal room air. They will be randomly assigned to a treatment based on
      chance. Neither the subject nor the researcher chooses the assigned group. They will have an
      equal chance of being in either group.

      The participant will receive a daily 5-day intervention with either acute intermittent
      hypoxia (AIH) therapy or room air, either alone or coupled with task-specific training, on
      upper extremity function in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI. This will be preceded
      by a baseline testing visit prior to the intervention, and followed by a 4 week follow up
      period to assess the effects of the interventions over time.

      The total duration of participation in the study intervention protocol is 1 week. Including
      the follow up period, the subjects will participate for a total of 6 weeks.
