      homeostasis of the organism as well as with certain pathologies. Specifically in the case of
      acute and chronic pancreatitis, recent studies suggest the disregulation of the intestinal
      flora as a possible determinant in the development and evolution of the disease. If this
      hypothesis is confirmed, hygienic-dietetic measures, as well as the administration of
      antibiotics, probiotics or fecal transplantation, may have therapeutic implications.

      The objective of the study is to classify and carry out a quantitative analysis of the
      different bacterial species present in the intestinal microbiota of patients with acute
      pancreatitis and determine if there are significant differences regarding healthy controls.
      At the same time, the investigators also intend to determine if there are differences
      according to the etiology and severity of the disease and if the disregulation is temporary
      or is maintained after one month of discharge.

      To carry out this purpose, it has been designed a prospective and multicentre observational
      study where samples of feces and saliva of patients admitted for acute pancreatitis of
      different etiologies and severity will be analyzed .
