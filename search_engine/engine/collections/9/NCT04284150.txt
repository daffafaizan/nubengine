      Anesthesiologists physical status Ⅰ-Ⅱ, who undergo elective surgery, were randomly divided
      into two groups (n=30) including dexmedetomidine group (group D) and midazolam group (group
      M). For comparison of the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and midazolam in the treatment of SVT,
      the following needs to be done. The patients calm down for 5-10 minutes after getting into
      the operating room, group D and group M started as a continuous infusion with dexmedetomidine
      0.5µg/kg or midazolam 0.06mg/kg using a micro-pump for 10 minutes. The alarm/sedation (OAA/S)
      score, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) and
      occurrence of SVT were recorded before the infusion (T0), 5 minutes after the infusion (T1),
      at the end of the infusion (T2), 5 minutes after the end of the infusion (T3) and 10 minutes
      after the end of the infusion (T4). In two groups, miniature electrocardiograph was used to
      monitor the frequency domain index of heart rate variability (HRV) in 5 minutes at each time
      point including normalized low frequency power (LFnorm), normalized high frequency power
      (HFnorm) and the balance ratio of sympathetic to vagal tone (LF/HF).
