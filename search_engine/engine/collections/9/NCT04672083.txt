    
      This is a single subcutaneous (SC) dose study. Doses will be administered in an escalating
      manner following satisfactory review by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) of the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data through Day 6 from the lower dose levels. 32
      healthy subjects will be studied in 4 groups (Groups A1 to A4).

      This study will comprise a placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, sequential-group
      design in healthy subjects. Each subject will participate in 1 treatment period and reside in
      the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day -1 through Day 6. It is planned for 6 subjects per
      dose level group to receive SC CPT31 and 2 subjects to receive matching placebo. Each group
      will be divided into 2 cohorts, with each cohort being dosed 72 hours apart. Sentinel dosing
      will take place in the first cohort, which will comprise 2 subjects, with 1 subject receiving
      CPT31 and 1 subject receiving placebo. The second cohort will comprise 6 subjects, with 5
      subjects receiving CPT31 and 1 subject receiving placebo. Blood samples for PK analysis and
      assessment of immunogenicity will be collected predose and up to 5 days postdose, with an
      additional immunogenicity sample taken at the Follow-up visit.
