    
      Neurogenic detrusor overactivity or "NDO" is common in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)
      and is a medical condition characterized by involuntary urinary bladder contractions. These
      bladder contractions can cause episodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary urine leakage)
      and/or high bladder pressures that can lead to poor drainage from the kidneys and urinary
      tract infections (UTIs).

      Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is most commonly treated with a medication called oxybutynin
      (Ditropan); however, this medication is associated with side effects such as dry mouth and
      constipation. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a newer medication approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of overactive bladder that does not cause dry mouth or
      constipation; however, its use in persons with SCI is investigational.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of mirabegron
      compared to oxybutynin chloride immediate release (oxybutynin IR) for neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity in individuals with SCI.
