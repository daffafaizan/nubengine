      antimalarial in human subjects with uncomplicated malaria caused by the most common and most
      important parasite in Africa (Plasmodium falciparum). This study will enroll 66 adult Malian
      males with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and randomize them to treatment with 1750 mg
      of the investigational drug (AQ-13) by mouth over 3 days or the current standard treatment,
      which is 80 mg of artemether and 480 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. The
      hypothesis underlying this study is that AQ-13 will be similarly effective to Coartem for the
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to both chloroquine-susceptible and
      chloroquine-resistant parasites.
