      as the point in time the participant feels that it is necessary to take the test product for
      relief of symptoms. When the participant decides to take the test product, they will report
      symptoms in the headache diary prior to taking the product and rate their symptoms on a
      10-point Mankoski scale. After consuming the product, the participant will complete a
      Mankoski scale at 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour after taking the product. If needed the
      participant will be allowed to take alternative medication (alternative treatment) after an
      hour after taking the product. If alternative medication is taken, the participant will
      record this in their headache diary.
