      pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. In 5-30% of cases after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy
      residual pulmonary hypertension is persisted. The technique of radiofrequency pulmonary
      artery denervation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (type I) is
      known and was assessed during clinical investigation. In this study radiofrequency pulmonary
      artery denervation technique may be applied in patients with residual pulmonary hypertension
      after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (type IV)
