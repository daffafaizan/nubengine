      who have Non-Germinal Center B-Cell-like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. This study looked at
      the efficacy of RCHOP [rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone]
      with or without VELCADE速.

      The study enrolled 206 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of the two open label
      treatment groups:

        -  RCHOP

        -  Vc-RCHOP [bortezomib (VELCADE速), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine
           and prednisone]

      Participants received treatment for up to six, 21-day cycles.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 48 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were
      followed for progression free survival and overall survival until patient withdrawal, death,
      or 2 years after the last participant was enrolled.
