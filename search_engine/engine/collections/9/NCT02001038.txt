      completed once and it includes two different scenarios of typical CMT patients (one adult and
      one child).

      The orthopaedic surgeons will be asked which surgical procedures they would apply to each
      scenario:

        -  forefoot cavus,

        -  clawtoes and

        -  hindfoot varus

      No medications or therapeutic agents are a component of this project.
