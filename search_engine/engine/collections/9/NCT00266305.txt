      Studies indicate that infants, who are fed formula without n-3 LCPUFA, have slower visual
      development than those, who receive n-3 LCPUFA in breast-milk. The mental development seems
      also to depend on whether infants are breast-fed or not. Long-term health has also been
      proposed to be affected (The infant origin of adult disease hypothesis). It is not clear
      whether these differences is due to dietary LCPUFA as comparison of breast-fed and
      formula-fed infants are complicated by the socio-demographic differences that exist between
      mother, who choose to breast-feed or not. Recent studies indicate that LCPUFA supplementation
      of formulas has beneficial effects on the visual acuity and mental abilities of infants. The
      LCPUFA content of breast-milk varies and this could potentially be of importance for infant
      development.

      Methods:

      211 pregnant women with a high (>80 percentile) or low (< mean) fish intake were recruited.
      After birth mother with low fish intake were randomized to receive 4 g/day of fish oil or
      olive oil for the first 4 months of the lactation period. 150 mother-infant pairs were
      followed for 1 year gathering information on maternal n-3 LCPUFA intake and infant
      development (growth, developmental milestones, visual acuity, cognitive functions and
      language acquisition). Milk samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 9 months and blood samples
      were taken from the mother and the infant at 4 months of age in order to determine the
      biochemical effect of the supplementation.

      The children were followed-up at 2Â½ years of age and around 7 years of age. The study is
      performed in association to the National Birth Cohort.
