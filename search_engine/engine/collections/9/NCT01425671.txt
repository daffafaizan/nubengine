      cross-sectional study design measuring brain waves, clinical symptoms, cognitive and
      functional ability, and genetic information in schizophrenic patients and normal controls.
      Subjects are expected to do a brain wave recording (EEG/ERP), role-play test designed to
      measure functionality and cognitive ability, and clinical symptom assessments. Expected
      duration of subject participation will be approximately 8 hours (about 2 visits). Outcome
      measures includes biomarkers, clinical symptoms and function, and genetic information.
