      supplements on the integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis in healthy older men.
      Briefly, participants will consume dietary protein at the RDA for the entire duration of the
      protocol (2 weeks). Participants will be randomized to consuming collagen (control - CON),
      whey (WHEY), or pea (PEA) protein supplements twice daily for one week. We will examine the
      ability of different qualities of protein supplements to stimulate integrated rates of muscle
      protein synthesis.
