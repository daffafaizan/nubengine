      ration of 2:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy
      Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Objective
      Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), . Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by
      incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the
      NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
