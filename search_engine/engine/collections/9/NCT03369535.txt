      This study based on the OmniHeart dietary intervention study, a randomized, three period
      cross-over feeding study that compared the effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids of
      three DASH-like diets: a carbohydrate-rich (CARB) diet pattern, a rich in protein (PROT) and
      a rich in unsaturated (MUFA) fat, predominantly monounsaturated fat diet (see full details of
      OmniHeart dietary intervention https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00051350).

      This metabonomic study aims to evaluate the feasibility of identifying individuals showing
      variation in clinical response to three different healthy diets, with the purpose of reducing
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based
      metabolic phenotyping approach.
