    
      In this protocol, the investigators will report the percentage of case time in hypotension
      (defined as Mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 72mmHg) during a two hours study protocol in
      critically ill patients.

      The target MAP will be set at 80 mmHg, and the definition of hypotension is a MAP < 90% of
      MAP target ( 80 mmHg - 10% = 72 mmHg)

      The investigators want to demonstrate that the closed-loop system can prevent hypotension at
      this specific set point.

      The investigators will test the system in a short series of 10-12 critically ill patients in
      the ICU setting during a two hours study protocol.

      Participants will receive standard patient care

      Fluids will be given as a baseline crystalloid administration set at 1-2 ml/kg/h
