    
      This is a prospective, randomized, interventional pilot study, which seeks to compare the
      patient experience using 30-gauge versus 33-gauge needle for bilateral same-day intravitreal
      injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept for the treatment of wet age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), or macular edema associated with retinal
      vein occlusion (RVO). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in patient
      discomfort or pain with the 30-gauge needle compared to the 33-gauge needle.
