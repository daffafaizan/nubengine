      the United States, but has been used extensively in Japan for more than 10 years. This
      protocol seeks to enroll patients in three broad categories based on histology and clinical
      scenario: primary therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), primary therapy to thoracic
      metastases, and retreatment of previously irradiated tumors or lung.

      Primary lung tumors

      Several studies have been published describing the utility of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
      (SBRT) for primary untreated lung tumors. In the United States, the most influential has been
      the experience of Robert Timmerman at the University of Indiana (7). They enrolled 37
      patients in a dose escalation trial of SBRT for T1 N0 and T2 N0 patients with Non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial began with 24 Gy given in 3 fractions and escalated to 60 Gy
      given in 3 fractions. Dose limited toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 3 pulmonary,
      esophageal, cardiac, or pericardial toxicity, or any grade 4 toxicity that was ascribed to
      the protocol treatment using the Common Toxicity Criteria from the National Cancer Institute.
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined at dose where less and 2 of 5 enrolled patients
      experienced DLT. The MTD was not determined by this trial as this criteria was not met in the
      enrolled patients. Of the 37 patients, 2 experienced Grade 3 toxicity. One patient
      experienced pneumonitis and other patient experienced hypoxemia. Both patients responded to
      therapy and made full recoveries. There were no long term complications reported from the
      treatment at a mean follow-up of 15 months.
