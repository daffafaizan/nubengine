        1. The increase in the proportion of participants who are up-to-date for CRC screening in
           the experimental group will be greater than the increase in the comparison group;

        2. The increase in the proportion of participants who intend to obtain CRC screening in the
           next 6 months in the experimental group will be greater than the increase in the
           comparison group;

        3. The increase in the proportion of participants who are aware of CRC screening tests in
           the experimental group will be greater than the increase in the comparison group;

        4. Self-efficacy is a mediator between intervention and receipt of CRC screening.

        5. Knowledge is a mediator between intervention and receipt of CRC screening.

        6. Gender is a moderator between intervention and receipt of CRC screening.

      Although the pilot project intervention was effective in both men and women, the sample was
      too small to determine if there was a gender effect. Based on the extensive literature on
      LHWO among women, the intervention may be more effective among women than men.

      Additional secondary hypotheses will apply the primary hypothesis and secondary hypotheses
      1-3 to individual CRC tests (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) rather than to the combined
      outcome.
