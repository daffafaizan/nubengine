growth hormone action on rat liver rnapolymerasethe effect of growth hormone on the activity of therna polymerase measured in this system is shown intable 2.  it can be seen that hypophysectomy of the ratresults in decreased activity of the rna polymerase andthat the injection of 1 mg of human growth hormone intothe rat 12 h before death increased the enzyme activityboth in hypophysectomized rats and in normal rats.however, the stimulating effect of growth hormone wasonly seen in the absence of high concentrations of ammon-ium sulphate; raising the ionic strength of the assaymedium abolished the growth hormone effect.  it should bementioned that addition of growth hormone in vitro in thepresence or absence of ammonium sulphate has had nosignificant effect on the labelling of the rna by thenuclear preparations.
