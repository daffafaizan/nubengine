      on pain and walking distance in the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). Each patient is his or her own
      comparator. During phase A, considered as the baseline, the patient performs the 2MWT without
      R-AFO. During phases B, considered as the introduction phases, the patient performs the tests
      with R-AFO. These tests are performed repeatedly and at regular intervals. The time of
      transition between phases has been randomized to have a minimum of 3 trials per phase.

      At the end of each test, an visual analogue scale for the pain and the walking distance
      travelled during the 2MWT were recorded.
