      treatment exist and few studies investigate treatment of atrial flutter. Mostly, guidelines
      for atrial fibrillation are followed for treatment of atrial flutter. Atrial flutter has a
      different pathomechanism as atrial fibrillation, therefore special guidelines for treatment
      are needed. Among drug treatment and ablation procedures, external electrical cardioversion
      is commonly used, especially for treatment of acute symptomatic patients. This study may help
      to further define safe and successful procedures for electrical cardioversion of atrial
      flutter.
