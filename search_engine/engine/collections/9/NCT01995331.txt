      high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days) plus CSA in a randomized trial
      of newly diagnosed adults with SAA. Both groups received CSA as part of the treatment
      regimen. However, the trial was terminated prematurely due to excessive morbidity among the
      patients treated in the cyclophosphamide arm. They documented that invasive fungal infections
      were severe among the cyclophosphamide group. Between January 2008 through May 2009, in our
      department, nine pediatric patients with a diagnosis of SAA were enrolled a study with lower
      dose of cyclophosphamide with 30mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days and combination with CSA,
      this study shows promise for children with severe aplastic anemia.Now we want explore the
      dosage of cyclophosphamide.
