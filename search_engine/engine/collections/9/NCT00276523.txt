    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic effects of PEG-interferon alfa-2b, in terms of pre- and
           post-treatment levels of microvessel density (MVD), endothelial cell apoptosis, vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
           Nuclear Factor-KappaB (NF-KB), matrix metalloproteinase/MMP-9, and NF-KB in biopsy
           specimens, from patients with resectable stage II-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head
           and neck.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgery within 3 weeks after randomization.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b as in arm II but at a higher dose.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b as in arm II but at a higher dose than
           in arm III.

      In arms II, III, and IV, patients undergo surgery within 1 week after completion of
      PEG-interferon alfa-2b.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
