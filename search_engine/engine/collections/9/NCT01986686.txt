      with extraluminal air and/or abscess as defined by CT scan following nonoperative management
      (NPO, IV antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and TPN followed by colonoscopy) to observation
      or elective resection. The primary endpoint is recurrent diverticulitis of the colon defined
      as an acute episode confirmed at CT scan and requiring hospitalization with IV antibiotics.
