464. cardiac performance in hypothermia.  an experimental study of leftventricular power, oxygen consumption, and efficiency in dogsmultiple cardiac parameters have been measuredin 30 dogs cooled to 20 c. aorticblood temperature.  the parameters have beenexpressed both as absolute valuesand as percentages of normothermic values.at normothermia, dogs with closedchest had an ascending aorta flow of 154%and a left ventricular external power of183% of the corresponding values for dogswith open chest.  both ascending aortaflow and left circumflex coronary artery flowwere reduced to 25% of normothermic levelat 20 c.  aortic arch mean pressure wasreduced to 50% of normothermic levelat 20 c.  total peripheral resistance wasincreased to 205% of normothermic levelat 20 c.  left ventricular external powerwas decreased to 11% of normothermiclevel at 20 c.  left ventricular oxygenconsumption was decreased to 31% of nor-mothermic level at 20 c.  mechanicalefficiency of the left ventricular myocardiumwas decreased to 39% of normothermic level at 20 c.
