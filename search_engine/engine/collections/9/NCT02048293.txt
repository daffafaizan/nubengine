      never been compared in a clinical setting.

      Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamic profile of the
      innovative molecule of remifentanil (group O = UltivaÂ®) and two unbranded molecules (group A
      = Remifentanil Laboratorios Chalver de Colombia S.A. and group B = Fada Remifentanilo)
      registered in Colombia.

      Methods. The investigators carried out a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The
      branded molecule of remifentanil (group O, n=29) was compared against the two unbranded
      molecules (group A, n=29; group B, n=32) during anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation
      in adult patients American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification = I
      without predictors for difficult airway. The target controlled infusion (TCI) doses evaluated
      were 6, 8 and 10 ng/ml with the Minto model. Induction was complemented with propofol 5 mg/ml
      (TCI) with the Schneider model and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The primary outcome was defined as
      the difference in mean arterial pressure and heart rate pre-intubation (TCI equilibrium) and
      post-intubation (maximum measurement within 5 minutes).
