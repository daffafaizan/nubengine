      deaths close to the incidence rate, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a public health problem
      especially since there is a significant increase in its incidence. incidence (+ 417% between
      1980 and 2012).

      Most often diagnosed late, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is managed at a metastatic stage in 60
      to 70% of cases with a very poor prognosis (8.7 to 11.1 months median survival with current
      chemotherapies). The first line of chemotherapy therefore represents a major issue in the
      management of these unresectable patients. There are few predictive markers of response to
      chemotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is conventionally evaluated by scanner every 2
      to 3 months. The response to chemotherapy is associated with a good prognosis while
      non-response has a poor prognosis and requires a 2nd line of treatment if the patient is able
      to receive it.

      A KRAS mutation is present in approximately 70-90% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Its
      research on tissue sampling (fine needle aspiration or anatomo-pathological specimen) is not
      carried out routinely because no prognostic or predictive value of KRAS mutations has been
      demonstrated. New high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques have been developed and now allow
      a blood sample to detect and quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), including KRAS
      mutations.

      Very few studies have investigated the change in cDNA levels during 1st line chemotherapy in
      unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      The aim of this study is to assess the predictive value of response to the 1st line of
      chemotherapy of mutated KRAS cDNA in unresectable metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinomas.
