      I. To assess the efficacy (progression-free survival) of regorafenib and gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in previously treated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of regorafenib in combination with gemcitabine. II. To assess
      response rate (RR). III. To assess overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
