    
      This is a Phase 3 study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of eMG 1.5 g given once daily
      (QD) compared to placebo in subjects with demonstrated remission from UC. Eligible subjects
      are randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive 1 or 2 treatments: 1.5g eMG (4
      capsules total) or matching placebo capsules QD for 6 months.

      The study consists of a screening phase (completed within 7 days prior to randomization), a
      treatment phase (6 months), and a follow-up visit (2 weeks after end-of-study [EOS] visit.)
      The treatment phase consists of 4 scheduled study visits: visit 1 (baseline/randomization
      (day 1), visit 2 (month 1), visit 3 (month 3), visit 4 (EOS (month 6).

      Primary objective:

      To compare the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate ulcerative colitis as measured
      by rectal bleeding and endoscopic mucosal appearance after 6 months of treatment with
      encapsulated mesalamine granules (eMG) of 1.5 g QD, as compared with placebo.

      Secondary objective:

      To compare the safety and tolerability of long-term dosing with eMG at 1.5 g QD as compared
      to placebo in the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate UC.
