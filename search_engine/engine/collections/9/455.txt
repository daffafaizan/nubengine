766. certain features of the haemogram in patients with pulmonary tuberculosiscomplicated by amyloidosis (russian)regression of amyloidosis in the early stagesseems possible and for this reasonrussian clinicians are exploring the possibilitiesof finding means of early diagnosisof this complication.  the author studied 300complete clinical blood analyses madein 60 patients, viz. 30 with chronic fibrocavernousand cirrhotic forms of tb com-plicated by amyloidosis and 30 with the same formsof tb without amyloidosis.  fromdetailed serial study of the haemogram in patientswith pulmonary tb it is possibleto diagnose associated amyloidosis of the internalorgans in its initial stage.  thepresence of amyloidosis of the internal organs canbe inferred from the followingchanges in the blood picture  (a) the appearance ofnormochromic and hypochromicanaemia in patients with various forms of tb (withthe exception of tb of the kidneys,intestinal tract or larynx, and of caseous lymphnodes), (b) progressive increasein the leucocyte count with a neutrophil shift tothe left not corresponding with aphase of quiescence of the main disease, (c) consistentlyhigh esr in the absenceof an active process, (d) thrombocytosis in the phase ofsubsidence of a flare-up,and also changes in the thrombocytic formula tendingtowards the appearance of de-generative forms and old and mature thrombocytes.
