      symptoms of anxiety and depression and increasing adjustment to academic and social
      responsibilities; to assess the impact of a pre-treatment motivational interviewing component
      on attrition, engagement, and outcomes (depression, anxiety, and academic functioning); to
      assess the impact of a booster session on anxiety, depression, and academic and social
      adjustment at three-month follow-up; and to assess the combined effect of including both a
      motivational interviewing component and booster session on outcomes.
