      increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Approximately 170 000 people in Norway suffer from diabetes, and diabetic foot disease is one
      of the most common complications.

      It is estimated that between 400 and 500 amputations are performed yearly in Norway, and most
      of the amputations are due to non-healing diabetic foot ulcers.

      Efficient prevention in high-risk individuals includes follow-up in specialist foot clinics
      including training in self-care, adaptation of preventive footwear and insoles.

      A randomised trial testing the use of skin temperature measurement in addition to routine
      foot care for preventing new foot ulcers showing a highly significant reduction in recurrent
      foot ulcers in the temperature measuring group, has previously been performed in USA (Lavery
      et al. Diabetes Care 2007;30:14).

      This study is planned as an open, randomised pilot study of minimum 40 patients testing the
      feasibility of implementing the use of skin temperature measurement for prevention of
      recurrent diabetic foot ulcers in a specialist clinical setting in Norway.

      If this is the case, we are planning a larger study to examine if these measurements can
      contribute to reducing the number of recurrent ulcers in clinical practice in Norway.

      We are in addition using a cognitive motivational method to examine if this model can
      increase the use of the temperature measuring device.
