      processes and structures of the nurse-led approach in the ENT and Jaw Surgery Department at
      USB. The following research questions were generated:

      Aim 1): Who are the patients captured with the algorithm, what are their risk factors, and
      how are the patient trajectories in terms of decisions, development, start, duration and
      ending of AWS and / or AWD? Specific questions asked:

        -  Which are demographic and medical characteristics of patients?

        -  How many patients are at risk for AWD / AWS?

        -  Which decisions do patients make?

        -  What is the time of onset, duration and ending of AWS and / or AWD?

        -  Were additional resources used to guarantee safety of patients?

      Aim 2): How is the prevention algorithm adhered to? Specific questions asked:

        -  How many patients were risk-assessed by a nurse at hospital admission?

        -  How many patients or those who should have been asked were eventually asked to agree to
           substitution therapy?

        -  How many patients at risk were assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal
           Assessment (CIWA)-Ar?

        -  How many times was the delirium expert consultation service contacted due to reasons
           stated in algorithm?
