      efficacy of an eye tracking sensor to detect cannabis-related impairment.

      Participants will be experienced but not frequent cannabis users without evidence of heavy
      alcohol or illicit drug use or other physical or mental health illness. Participants will
      come in for one screening visit, and those who consent, are eligible, and enroll will
      complete one experimental laboratory session involving smoking of 50% of 1 active
      (approximately 4.0% THC) cannabis cigarette. Assessments will be collected after-cannabis
      smoking up to 4 hours. Participants will be sent home from the laboratory via taxi.
