      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and could also regulate Treg cells, thus CN1 is considered to enhance
      the anti-tumor immune response and have potential antitumor activity.

      In this multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study six dose levels are planned.
      Participants will receive CN1 by IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (every 3 weeks). After
      completion of treatment cycles, the participant will be assessed by the Principal
      Investigator and/or Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).
