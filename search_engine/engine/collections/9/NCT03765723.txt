    
      Patients undergoing bilateral TKRA are recruited. The time interval between the surgery of
      each leg is within 2 weeks. Before each surgery, patients will be asked to conduct
      questionnaires of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) and Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale(PCS). In addition, the patients will have their preoperative knee pain(measured by Knee
      injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), preoperative pain in other sites, expectation of
      postoperative pain(measured by Numerical Rating Scale), and morbidity of diabetic neuropathy
      recorded. Demographic factors including age, sex, and BMI of patients will be collected.
      Twenty four and forty eight hours after completion of the surgery, each patient will be asked
      to report thier acute postoperative pain on Numerical Rating Scale.

      This study aims to find out risk factors of acute postoperative pain, including identical
      surgical history within 2 weeks, in patients undergoing bilateral TKRA.
