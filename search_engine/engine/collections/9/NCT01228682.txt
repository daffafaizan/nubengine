    
      Drug Utilisation Survey The drug utilisation analysis will describe the number of
      prescriptions, their distribution between different medical specialties, and indication for
      use as compared to the SmPC, patient age and patient gender distributions on a prescription
      level. In addition, the indication for use will be further categorised as

        -  SIADH

        -  Non-SIADH hyponatraemia

        -  Non-Hyponatraemia

      Post-Authorisation Safety Study

      Sodium levels at baseline and rate of sodium correction under therapy will be analysed.
      Safety findings will be described. The number of all non-serious and serious adverse events
      and the relative frequencies will be analysed in consideration of the risk categories below:

        -  Renal safety

        -  Aquaresis-related adverse effects

        -  Serum sodium correction rate

        -  Glucose homeostasis

        -  Cardiovascular safety and hemodynamics

        -  Respiratory system

        -  Drug metabolism and drug interactions

        -  Drug exposure during pregnancy

        -  Paediatric safety

      Subgroup analyses will be performed for all safety findings by indication subgroups (SIADH
      and other indications), subgroups according to SIADH-underlying diseases, age groups,
      hepatically impaired patients and renally impaired patients.
