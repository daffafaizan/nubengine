    
      All TB patients are to keep to their standard anti-tuberculous treatment. A standardized
      questionnaire of symptoms, side-effects and weight shall be recorded. Induced sputum and
      plasma samples from all TB patients shall be analysed for MMPs and TIMPs before and after the
      administration of doxycycline for two weeks. In addition, neutrophils and mononuclear cells
      from TB patients and these shall be stimulated with live, virulent M. tuberculosis in a
      Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. The supernatants from these cells shall be analysed for MMPs
      and TIMPs.

      Healthy volunteers shall be recruited and administered doxycycline for 2 weeks. Neutrophils
      and mononuclear cells will be isolated from blood prior to treatment, at weeks 2 and 8 and
      infected with M.tb. Cell culture supernatants and nucleic acids will be harvested. MMP and
      TIMP expression will be analysed using luminex array and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
      Intracellular signaling pathways will be examined with a human phospho-kinase array. Matrix
      destruction will be assessed using collagen quantitative fluorescent assays.
