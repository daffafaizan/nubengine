    
      This is a 12-month, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the effect of 6 months of
      treatment with teriparatide on fracture healing in participants who have sustained a recent
      low-trauma, unilateral, femoral neck fracture stabilized by internal fixation. The study has
      3 periods:

        1. A screening period that must be completed in ≤ 14 days after operative treatment of the
           femoral neck fracture

        2. A 6-month double-blind treatment period [teriparatide 20 (µg) or placebo given once
           daily by subcutaneous injection]

        3. A 6-month observation period.

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide 20
      µg/day versus placebo on the proportion of men and postmenopausal women of at least 50 years
      of age with no revision surgery 12 months after internal fixation of a low-trauma femoral
      neck fracture.

      All participants will receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D beginning at screening and
      continuing for 12 months.
