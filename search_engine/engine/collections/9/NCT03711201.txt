    
      Procedure to be Applied:

      In order to eliminate the other factors that cause essential HT, the patients' blood pressure
      due to HT should be controlled, the surgery will be planned as the first case in the morning
      and the patients will need 8 hours fasting period.

      Patients' gender, age, height, weight values, ASA scores, body mass index (BMI) values will
      be recorded. Hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and SpO2 values) will be
      recorded in the services of the patients, in the preop unit and in the operation room.
      Hypertension requiring intervention or additional medication will be excluded from the study.
      A randomized number of patients will be included in the study according to the results of
      power analysis.

      Introduction of the operating room environment (IORE): The procedure to be performed on the
      day of surgery will be simulated and accompanied by an anesthesiologist. The patient's
      hemodynamic data (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, SpO2) will be measured at the
      time of operation, between 16: 00-18: 00 hours prior to the operation, and will be brought to
      the operating room with a service nurse. The hemodynamic data of the patient will be measured
      in the preop unit and the patient will be taken to the operating room with anesthesia doctor.
      Here, in addition to the patient's hemodynamic data, the instantaneous state anxiety scale
      (ST-STAI) will be completed and the patient will be left in service again. The procedure will
      be similar to the process that the patient will experience on the operation day.
