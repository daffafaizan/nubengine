      performed within past 4 weeks. All MRI scans will be reviewed by the neurologist to evaluate
      ischemic changes. Upon detection of LA, patients (n=150) will be informed about the study
      aims. In the same time, aged- and sex-matched control group (n=150) with no detected ischemic
      changes will be recruited.

      In each group, the blood samples will be collected, to determine the concentration of plasma
      TMAO, oxidative stress markers, as well as serum endothelial dysfunction markers and
      biochemical parameters. To determine the cognitive performance psychological test will be
      carried out. The diet of all recruited participants, with special consideration on the
      choline-rich products and supplements, will be analyzed.
