      into consideration to participate in study.

      Many will however not be able to give consent. These will not be included in the study.

      Directly preoperatively urine will be collected. Color and density will be
      measured/registered.

      The pulseoximeter reading will be registered (Saturation, pulse, PI and PVI) before spinal
      anaesthesia and after spinal anaesthesia as well as during the surgery.

      Two to three days postoperatively a follow up will be performed, to register complications
      (Circulatory instability, confusion, infection, affected kidney function/creatinine rise).

      30 day postoperative mortality will also be controlled.

      These results will be compared, to see if pulse oximeter readings or urine concentration can
      predict complications.
