      exclusively at the University Hospital Center of Nancy in the Department of
      Hepato-Gastroenterology (HGE). the patient inclusion criteria were as follows: Adult patients
      with chronic hepatitis B, treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, mono-infected with HBV
      (without co-infection with HCV, HIV and HDV). For each patient included, biological, clinical
      and therapeutic data were collected retrospectively. Patients with loss of viral load on
      treatment were included in this study. Among them, patients showed either a clearance of
      HBsAg on treatment ("responders") or the control patients showed a persistence of HBsAg on
      treatment ("non-responders", control patients).
