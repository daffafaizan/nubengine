      Hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis is the major indication to have liver transplantation in
      Taiwan. After liver transplantation, prophylaxis of hepatitis B recurrence will be performed
      by anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin and anti-viral agents. Currently, lamivudine is the drug
      the investigators choose to prevent HBV recurrence for many years because it is safe for
      long-term use. However, nephrotoxicity is one of the adverse effects of lamivudine and dosage
      of lamivudine has to be reduced if patients' renal function is insufficiency. Recently, the
      studies on chronic hepatitis B patients showed improvement of glomerular filtration rate for
      those receiving telbivudine treatment. In this study, the investigators will include our
      post-transplant HBV patients who have stable liver function, receive lamivudine for
      prophylaxis of recurrent hepatitis B, and have renal dysfunction in stage II-IV. The patients
      will be randomized to receive telbivudine or lamivudine continuously at 1:1 ratio. Renal
      function will be examined at 6 months interval to determine whether renal function is
      improved. The achievement will determine whether telbivudine is better than lamivudine for
      the HBV patients with renal dysfunction.
