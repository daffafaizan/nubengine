      as to measure expression of candidate genes involved with carbohydrate and fat oxidation and
      mitochondrial function by RT-PCR, protein content by western blot, enzyme activity by
      enzymatic assays and to perform functional studies under varying conditions (for example
      before and after treatment with insulin, testosterone, serum) to quantify insulin signaling
      and carbohydrate and fat oxidation in primary human cultures.
