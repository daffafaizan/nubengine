      combination with Medication Therapy Management (MTM) in the community pharmacy setting in
      order to assess and compare the two delivery models. Using a clust randomized trial, these
      effects of these two models will be compared. Pharmacist and patient outcome measures will be
      collected by survey, interviews, and review of pharmacy records. The investigators intend to
      compare the effect of PGx alone and PGx with MTM from the pharmacy perspective (to assess
      impact on workflow/operations) and patient perspective (to assess acceptance of testing,
      understanding of results, medication adherence, and overall satisfaction with delivery
      model). In the PGx only arm, pharmacists will offer PGx testing to patients who are
      prescribed one of the 10 eligible drugs (aripiprazole, carisoprodol, celecoxib, citalopram,
      clopidogrel, metoprolol, nortriptyline, paroxetine, simvastatin, warfarin) and will return
      results to the patient and physician with any recommendations for drug or dosage changes
      based on results. In the PGx and MTM arm, pharmacists will offer PGx testing to patients
      prescribed one of the 10 eligible drugs and provide two MTM sessions: one at the time of
      testing, and one when results are returned. All patients will be surveyed before PGx testing
      and 3 months after receiving results. Pharmacists will be surveyed prior to their
      participation and following the conclusion of the study. Pharmacists will also conduct a
      chart review of patients and document all interactions with enrolled patients and their
      providers.
