      However, the source of HIV in semen is unknown. Some evidence suggests that the prostate may
      be the source of at least some of the virus in semen. This study is designed to determine
      whether the prostate may serve as the source of virus in semen by comparing the concentration
      of HIV-1 RNA in semen donated normally, in semen obtained following prostatic massage, and in
      expressed prostatic secretions. Finding a source for semen HIV would provide important
      insights into several aspects of HIV sexual transmission. Since some drugs do not enter the
      prostate well, the finding that virus is produced in the prostate might suggest the prostate
      could serve as a reservoir for HIV, leading to the development of resistance to antiviral
      agents.
