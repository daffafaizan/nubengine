      is rising exponentially, primarily among injecting drug users (IDUs). Because Vietnamese are
      highly family oriented, most young IDUs have daily family contact or live in their parents'
      homes. The burden on the family is substantial, and even greater if the IDU is HIV+. The
      investigators hypothesize that with assistance, families can be part of the solution for both
      HIV and HIV+ IDU. This family intervention in Vietnam is based on the Social Action Theory
      and Social Network Theory, aimed at increasing families' capacities to effectively cope with
      the impact of IDUs and HIV. The study provides an opportunity to test culturally-specific
      intervention content and delivery. In addition, the intervention pilot will provide an
      opportunity to obtain project implementation experience in the local settings. The study also
      provides the opportunity to pilot test outcome measures.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To document the challenges of drug use and HIV for IDUs and their family members;

        2. To examine the acceptability and feasibility of a family-based intervention for IDU and
           their family members;

        3. To examine whether the IDUs and family members in the intervention group, compared to
           those in the standard care group, will have significantly improved health, mental
           health, and quality of life outcomes, including health seeking, reduced sexual and drug
           use risk behaviors, increased HIV testing, and reduced caregiver burden; and

        4. To examine how outcomes of the IDUs and family members are mediated by family indicators
           such as family cohesion, stress and symptom management, stigma and harm reduction, HIV
           disclosure, and treatment adherence.
