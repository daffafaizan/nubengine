      I. To assess the frequency of obtaining an actionable result from the assay and to estimate
      feasibility as defined as a frequency of at least 50%.

      II. To test patient cells in a high-throughput assay against individual drugs and drug
      combinations within 21 days, to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the response rate among patients treated after physicians are presented with the
      testing results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of bone marrow aspirate and blood for high-throughput drug
      sensitivity assay and mutational analysis using next generation sequencing. Patients and
      their treating physicians receive the results of the tests. Treatment decisions are then made
      by the patients and their treating physicians.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
