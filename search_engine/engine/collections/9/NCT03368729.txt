      portion of the study will receive Niraparib by mouth on days 1-21 of each 21 day cycle as
      well as trastuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle. Blood and tissue will be
      collected at pre-specified times to enable pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and toxicity studies.
      The drug dosage will then be determined for the phase 2 portion at a dose limiting level.
      Following treatment, patients will be followed every 6 weeks for 6 months until disease
      progression or an unacceptable adverse event.
