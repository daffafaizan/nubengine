      protocol is to undertake a systematic analysis of DNA abnormalities, and of RNA and protein
      expression in prospectively collected fresh-frozen and fixed tumor samples and correspondent
      normal tissue from patients affected with this tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Perform genome-wide analysis of DNA gains and losses and RNA expression in tumor samples
           and normal tissue from patients with diffuse brain stem glioma.

        -  Identify regions of genomic gain or loss using either array comparative genomic
           hybridization or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.

        -  Investigate genome-wide expression patterns of RNA derived from tumor samples and normal
           tissue from these patients via Affymetrix gene expression profiling.

        -  Validate the results of the genome-wide analysis by conducting further evaluation of
           candidate genes or by investigating the expression of relevant gene products at the RNA
           and protein levels.

        -  Perform analysis of mutations in candidate tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes
           (including whole genome sequencing studies) using direct sequence analysis of tumor DNA
           and confirm the tumor-specific nature of these mutations by analyzing the correspondent
           constitutional DNA.

        -  Confirm genomic gains or losses identified by means of fluorescence in situ
           hybridization (FISH) performed on tissue microarray using non-neoplastic brain tissue
           from each patient as control when available.

        -  Explore protein expression patterns identified by immunohistochemistry or western blot
           and compare them to normal brain stem tissue.

        -  To obtain a follow-up (questionnaire and/or telephone interview) after autopsy with
           parent(s), legal guardian(s), or family members of research participants in the United
           States to assess aspects associated with this procedure, including potential benefits
           and drawbacks
