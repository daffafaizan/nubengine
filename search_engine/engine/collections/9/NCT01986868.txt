      coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for suspected Coronary Artery Disease. They
      will be invited to undergo a research coronary Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan with
      contrast(CMRA). Based upon the subject's heart rate, a beta blocker may be administered as
      its use has been shown to be effective in producing better images as it widens the arteries.

      Researchers will use newly developed non-invasive coronary MRA techniques to compare
      information shown on the research CMRA with the clinical CCTA. While CCTA has been
      demonstrated to be able to provide data on adverse plaque characteristics (APC's), the
      ability of CMRA to evaluate these features is not established.
