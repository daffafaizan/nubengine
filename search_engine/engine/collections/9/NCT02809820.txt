      prevention. It is known that catecholamine levels can potentiate platelet reactivity and
      beta-blocking agents may also affect platelet aggregation. This effect is mainly mediated by
      adrenergic receptors on platelets. This suggests that nonselective beta-blockers would have a
      more pronounced effect on platelet aggregation than selective beta-blockers. However, little
      is known about the effect of beta-blockers on platelet aggregation in patients with
      cardiovascular disease and, to date, nothing is known in the setting of ACS.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of selective and nonselective
      beta-blockers on platelet aggregation in ACS patients treated with dual anti platelet
      therapy.
