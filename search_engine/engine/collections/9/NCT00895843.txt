      protective analgesia for patients undergoing oral surgery under day case general anaesthesia.

      The primary objective was to investigate the efficiency of protective analgesia using
      combined effects of sustained release ibuprofen and bupivacaine nerve block in attenuation of
      postoperative pain following impacted third molar surgery under day case general anaesthesia.

      The secondary objective was to document the safety and tolerability profile of conventional
      release versus sustained released ibuprofen with bupivacaine block in subjects undergoing
      impacted third molar surgery under day case general anaesthesia.
