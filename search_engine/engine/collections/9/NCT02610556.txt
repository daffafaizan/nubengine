      with concurrent chemotherapy of docetaxel plus cisplatin or cisplatin alone. IMRT is
      delivered with a total dose of 68 Gy or higher in 33 fractions to the primary tumor.
      Concurrent chemotherapy in the experimental arm consists of docetaxel 60 mg/m², D1 and
      cisplatin 25 mg/m², D1-3 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy in the control
      arm consists of cisplatin 100 mg/m², D1 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.The primary endpoint is
      overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to the day of death from any cause.
      Secondary end points include failure-free survival (FFS), locoregional relapse-free survival
      (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and the incidence of grade 3 or higher acute
      toxicities. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the
      safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
