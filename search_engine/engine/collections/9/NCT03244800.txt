    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of different doses of MEDI0382
      administered as multiple SC doses to subjects with T2DM. Approximately 63 subjects will be
      enrolled across two cohorts.

      For cohort 1, sufficient subjects will be invited to participate in the study such that a
      maximum of 39 subjects will complete dosing. Subjects in cohort 1 will be randomised using a
      ratio of 2:1 to one of 2 treatment arms to receive either MEDI0382 or placebo. A maximum of
      26 will complete dosing in the active arm and 13 will complete dosing in the placebo arm.

      For cohort 2, sufficient subjects will be invited to participate in the study such that a
      maximum of 24 subjects will complete dosing. Subjects in cohort 2 will be randomised using a
      ratio of 3:1 to receive either MEDI0382 or placebo. A maximum of 18 will complete dosing in
      the active arm and 6 will complete dosing in the placebo arm.
