      dasatinib-gemcitabine combination therapy and single-agent gemcitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
      I. To evaluate effects on disease-free survival of the dasatinib-gemcitabine combination
      therapy compared with gemcitabine alone for adjuvant treatment of resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. II. To evaluate effects on overall survival of dasatinib-gemcitabine
      combination therapy compared with gemcitabine alone for adjuvant treatment of resected
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. III. To evaluate tolerability and safety of the two arms. IV. To
      identify potential biological correlates associated with clinical benefit to
      dasatinib-gemcitabine combination therapy compared with gemcitabine alone. OUTLINE: Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral dasatinib once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 6 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *
      Courses with dasatinib repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every
      3 months for 2 years.
