      in pre hospital cardiac arrest by a reduction of brain damage biomarkers.

      Secondary aim: prove the efficiency of early therapeutic induced hypothermia in the reduction
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Determine the number of ROSC, patients survival,
      neurological status 48 hours after cardiac arrest (GCS) and when leaving the hospital, impact
      following initial cardiac rhythm and the cooling rate of early therapeutic induced
      hypothermia.
