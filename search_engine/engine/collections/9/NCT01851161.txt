      I. Quantify the three-dimensional tumor and normal tissue (thoracic and abdominal) motion,
      deformation and volume changes with the respiratory cycle during imaging in prone vs. supine
      positioning.

      II. Quantify the three-dimensional tumor and normal tissue (thoracic and abdominal) motion,
      deformation and volume changes with the respiratory cycle and alterations thereof during a
      radiotherapy series.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo one conventional computed tomography (CT) scan and one 4 dimensional CT (4D
      CT) scan in both supine and prone positioning before undergoing radiation therapy.
