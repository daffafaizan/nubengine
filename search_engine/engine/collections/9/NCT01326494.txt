      asthma. In children, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI's) are responsible for over 80%

      The criteria for participation in this study to have 2 or more presentations to a Health
      Service centre in the past 12 months for URTI induced asthma. These patients will be followed
      and interviewed monthly over a 12 month period to investigate whether the use of Oral
      cortico-steroids upon early onset of URTI induced asthma prevents the need for presentation
      to hospital
