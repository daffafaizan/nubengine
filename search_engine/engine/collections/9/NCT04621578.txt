      cranial nerves from the brain stem. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the exact surgical
      method for the treatment of HFS, but the incidence of dizziness and postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) after MVD is extremely high. Despite the use of dual antiemetic therapy
      during the operation, the incidence of PONV within 24 hours after MVD is still as high as
      66.7%. Medication alone has limited effects on dizziness and PONV treatment after MVD.
      Meta-analysis shows that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is associated
      with the reduction of post-emetic remedies and the incidence of dizziness after general
      anesthesia, and it can be integrated into the multi-modal therapy of PONV. Therefore, the
      purpose of our study is to observe the prevention and treatment effect of TEAS on
      postoperative dizziness in patients with hemifacial spasm undergoing microvascular
      decompression surgery, and explore its possible mechanisms.
