    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare disease-free survival of patients with curatively resected stage III
           adenocarcinoma of the colon treated with adjuvant fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium
           with or without celecoxib.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival, the occurrence of new primary colon cancer, and the
           development of new polyps in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to â‰¥ 4 tumor-positive lymph nodes (yes vs no), form of adjuvant
      chemotherapy (infusional vs bolus), low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis (yes vs
      no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium IV for up to 6 courses in
           the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral
           celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily and fluorouracil and leucovorin
           calcium as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment with celecoxib or placebo continues for 3 years in the absence of
      disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,450 patients (725 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
