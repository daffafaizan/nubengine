      anti-cancer drugs. They are distinguished in monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and
      panitumumab) and EGFR (TKIs) kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, where they
      are used in the treatment of colon, rectal, head and neck, lung, pancreas and of breast.

      According to studies, the usual treatment for the prevention and treatment of skin rash
      refers to the use of antibiotics such as doxycycline, tetracycline and cortisone products
      such as hydrocortisone. It is also recommended to use moisturizing cream.

      The study of Carmine P. et al., 2011 mentions the need to investigate educational measures
      for the rash due to EGFR treatment.
