      single-segment lesions of the lower cervical spine. However, simple artificial cervical disc
      replacement is only applicable for single-segment disc herniation, but not for two adjacent
      cervical segmental lesions, concurrent with vertebral hyperplasia and ossification of the
      posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine. Traditional vertebral corpectomy and
      bone graft fusion can reduce the mobility of the cervical spine. Therefore, non-fusion
      fixation for such diseases has been a key issue to improve the efficacy of surgical
      treatments.

      To this end, the research team designed an artificial cervical joint prosthesis suitable for
      subtotal resection of the lower cervical vertebral body. Previous studies regarding cadaver
      and animal experiments have found that this artificial joint not only retains the normal
      range of physiological motion of the joint, but also has good stability. Preliminary studies
      have shown that the designed joints are sufficiently safe and stable. The titanium materials
      for joints have been verified for their toxicology in long-term clinical trials and have been
      monitored under relevant national testing agencies in China.

      To serve clinical patients faster and ensure that the trial design is safe, this study is
      designed to observe the effectiveness and safety of mobile artificial cervical vertebrae
      replacement for patients with cervical spondylosis.
