    
      This is a Phase 2, single-institution, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled trial of patients undergoing a median sternotomy for primary
      cardiopulmonary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

      78 subjects (39 per treatment arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a
      single-dose, parasternal nerve block with either 266 mg Exparel or placebo (0.9% normal
      saline solution). The nerve blocks will be performed under direct visualization at the end of
      surgery, just prior to sternal closure.
