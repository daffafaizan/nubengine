      against the genotype of the controls. The study is prospective and not retrospective, as data
      will be collected from patients with primary knee osteoarthritis as well as the control group
      from the outset. The study intends to include 200 people. The first group consists of 100
      individuals suffering from knee osteoarthritis, while the second group will include 100
      healthy controls without osteoarthritis. From each one DNA will be isolated and analyzed from
      collected blood. The prospective study allows valid data to be collected on patient
      demographics and disease severity. Due to the large number of cases of the disease, it is
      estimated that the necessary specimens will be collected within a reasonable time from the
      beginning of this thesis. The choice of the patient-control study is necessary to limit the
      influence of confounding factors (age, gender, obesity, etc.). This type of study includes
      rigorous selection of patients and controls with specific entry and exclusion criteria,
      selection of controls based on matching patient characteristics, stratification, and subgroup
      analyzes. The final result will be a comparison of the incidence of specific gene
      polymorphisms between patients with knee osteoarthritis and the normal population.
