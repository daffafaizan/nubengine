      physical activity. During the first session they bicycle in a semi-immersive (projected on a
      screen) and an immersive (with googles) virtual environment. After each bout they completed a
      questionnaire about the experience. In the second session they bicycle four times with and
      without a virtual environment using both a continous and interval mode. Their oxygen
      consumption is measured during cycling. They complete questionnaires after each exercise
      bout.
