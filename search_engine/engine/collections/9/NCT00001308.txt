      The primary objective of this protocol is to use multimodal neuroimaging combining
      complementary electrophysiological and hemodynamic methods to characterize brain-language
      relationships in healthy subjects and those with neurological disorders that affect speech
      and language. A secondary objective is to utilize these findings to develop evaluation
      measures for future treatment studies.

      Study Populations

      We will focus on four neurological disorders that affect language processing post-stroke
      aphasia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and developmental stuttering. Each constitutes a
      significant clinical problem central to the NIDCD s mission. These disorders can impair
      language at several levels - from its elementary perceptual and motor features, the
      peripheral building blocks of language, to higher levels of language formulation, including
      word, sentence and narrative processing.

      Design

      We will utilize a set of tasks designed to evaluate language at the levels at which clinical
      pathology emerges. We will combine hemodynamic (functional MRI) and electrophysiological
      (EEG, MEG) modalities to capitalize on the superior spatial resolution of the former and
      temporal resolution of the latter methods. Whenever possible the same task paradigms are used
      with both techniques. We will conduct crosssectional sub-studies, addressing specific
      questions in each of the disorders of interest; we will also conduct longitudinal sub-studies
      of recovery and neuroplastic reorganization in post-stroke aphasia.

      Outcome Measures

      Outcome measures include speech-language and psychological tests, measures of behavioral
      performance during scanning and corresponding MRI, EEG and MEG data. Relationships between
      these datasets will be evaluated using statistical analytic packages.
