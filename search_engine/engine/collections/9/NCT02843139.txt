      children obesity to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. Serum samples were evaluated in a 3
      step procedure: 1) discovery study, in which samples from obese children and healthy controls
      were pooled for miRNA sequecing experiment; 2) cross-sectional validation study, in which
      miRNAs of interest were validated in all individuals (obese children, overweight children and
      normal controls); 3) longitudinal validation study, in which the candidate miRNAs were
      estimated in newly diagnosed diabetes patients and normal glucose tolerance controls (NGT).
      The final determined miRNAs were further confirmed though primary function studies.
