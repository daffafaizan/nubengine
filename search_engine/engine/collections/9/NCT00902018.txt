      mechanism that is critical in determining platelet lifespan (Mason, Cell 2007). There is
      evidence that Bcl-xL protein expression in megakaryocytes is regulated by Thrombopoietin
      (TPO) mediated activation of Akt pathways mediated by Jak2 and Stat 5 (possibly by Stat 3 as
      well). (e.g., Kozuma et. al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis). Little is known about
      the Bcl-xL / Bak axis in patients with ITP, or the effect of TPO-R stimulation on platelet
      survival in patients with ITP. The TPO effect may be a result of stimulation of
      thrombopoietin-receptor (TPO-R) signalling in megakaryocytes altering the packaging of Bcl-xl
      into platelets, or be a direct effect of platelet TPO-R stimulation as described above.
