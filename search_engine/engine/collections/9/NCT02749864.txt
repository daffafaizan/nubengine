      population-based.

      Patients and sampling: The study population has been distributed in groups according to age
      (20-34; 35-49; 50-74 years) and sex. In order to select a representative sample of this
      overall population, three Spanish regions will be selected on the basis of their different
      HCV-related hospitalisation rates defined as follows: high, >120 cases/100,000 inhabitants
      (Madrid); medium, 90-119 cases/100,000 inhabitants (Cantabria); or low, <90 cases/100,000
      inhabitants (Valencia).

      The participants will be selected through a random, representative sample using our two-stage
      conglomerate sampling with stratification of the First-Stage Units. These FSUs are made up by
      the Basic Health Areas (Health Centers). The Second-Stage Units are made up by the
      individuals. The stratification criteria used in the first stage will be the socioeconomic
      status-rural/urban environment. The selection of sample elements will be carried out through
      simple random sampling from the healthcare card database pertaining to the selected Health
      Centers. A sequence of random, computer-generated numbers will be obtained.

      Sample size: In order to achieve an accuracy of 0.4% in the estimate of a percentage through
      a two-tailed 95% confidence interval, assuming the prevalences indicated by age strata in the
      general Spanish population (0.6%, 1.9% and 2.7% respectively), a total of 12,263 subjects
      distributed as follows: 1,456 aged 20-34 years, 4,476 aged 35-49 years and 6,331 aged 50-74
      years.

      Anticipating an uptake of 9-15%,21 following invitation via telephone, between 81,753 and
      136,255 subjects distributed over the three regions needed to be contacted at random.

      Recruitment method for randomized patients. Selected subjects will be called by phone by
      trained personnel. The subject will be invited to report for an interview in order to carry
      out a socio-healthcare questionnaire, a physical examination, and an analytical test. In the
      event the patient refuses to participate, permission shall be requested to collect minimum
      anonymous data for the subsequent study of possible screening biases. Patients meeting
      inclusion criteria and provide written informed consent to be included in the study.

      Variables in the study: socio-healthcare questionnaire includes variables such as age, sex,
      socioeconomic status, risk factors, health habits, etc. Analytical variables (blood count,
      biochemistry, serologies for HBV and HCV, etc.) are collected. A Fibroscan is also performed.
      A cost-effectiveness of screening strategies and treatment will be analysed using a Markov
      model

      Full duration: 21 months
