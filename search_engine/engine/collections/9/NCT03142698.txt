    
      Hepatic steatosis is an increasingly frequent pathology, which can lead to severe
      complications (Cirrhosis, Hepatocellular Carcinoma).

      The poor quantification of steatosis by ultrasound or scanning and the invasiveness of the
      reference method (liver biopsy) make MRI a measurement tool of choice.

      Recent techniques such as proton density measurement with several echoes or spectroscopy are
      increasingly used for the measurement of steatosis.

      At the time of the development of therapeutics to reduce fatty liver disease, the use of MRI
      seems an interesting alternative for longitudinal follow-up in these patients.

      Our study aims to ensure the reliability of these different MRI techniques for accurate
      quantification of liver steatosis and to compare them.
