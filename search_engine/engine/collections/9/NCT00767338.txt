      This will be a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the effect of varicocelectomy
      in men with infertility, an abnormal semen analysis, and a palpable varicocele. This approach
      will allow us to compare (i) the effect of microsurgical varicocelectomy on live birth rates
      after up to four cycles of alternating intrauterine insemination and four cycles of timed
      intercourse over 8 months and (ii) the relative effectiveness of intrauterine insemination
      versus timed intercourse on live birth rates. Secondary analyses will explore the effect of
      the surgical intervention on pregnancy rates, semen analysis parameters, serological hormonal
      measures in the male subjects, and quality of life measures in both the male and female
      partners.

      Treatment

      Two hundred and thirty-two couples will be randomized to the two intervention groups
      (microsurgical varicocelectomy plus up to four cycles each of alternating intrauterine
      insemination and timed intercourse or no microsurgical varicocelectomy plus up to four cycles
      each of alternating intrauterine insemination and timed intercourse).

      Timing

      We anticipate that it will take 3 years to complete the study. Enrollment will begin in year
      1 of the study. 34 couples will need to be recruited per site over the duration of the study
      to reach the enrollment goal of 232 couples. Participants will be enrolled in the study for
      one year, with the male partner undergoing periodic study assessments at two month intervals.
