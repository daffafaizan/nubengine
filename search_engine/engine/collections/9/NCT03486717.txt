      Dentistry. The first day's appointment will consist of clinically-indicated cleaning,
      radiographs and treatment planning. Toward the end of the first appointment, the participant
      will wear the virtual reality goggles for 5 minutes, in order to become familiar with the
      device. During these 5 minutes, fluoride varnish will be applied. The application of the
      varnish would occur whether the participant is in the research or not.

      At the second or third appointments, the goggles will be randomly used during the restorative
      treatment. Whether the participant uses the goggles at the second or third visit will be
      determined purely by chance, like flipping a coin. No nitrous oxide will be used, but local
      anesthesia will still be administered as standard. The participant will use a 1-10 scale at
      the end of each appointment to rate pain levels, and a research team member(the dental
      assistant) will assign a 1-4 scale value for behavior. The 1-10 scale will consist of the
      Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale.
