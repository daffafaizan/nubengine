      quesstionaire was performed to all patients. Antropometric characteristics including weight,
      height, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) and presence of comorbide diseases were
      recorded. After detailed history and physical examination performed all patients, overnight
      fasting in the morning between 08:00-10:00, blood samples from antecubital vein were
      performed and serum glucose, lipid profile, follicular stimulating hormon (FSH), Luteinizing
      hormone (LH), total testosterone, prolactin, estradiol, 25(OH)D level were analysed. Presence

      accepted as exclusion criterias from the study. After IIEF-5 score adjust as 21 point, ROC
      analyse was used to calculate the cut-off value of 25(OH)D and level of 27.32 ng/mL was
      calculated as cut-off value. Patients were divided into two group according to 27.32 ng/mL
      level as a cut off value. Serum 25(OH)D level was lower than 27.32 ng/mL in group 1 (severe
