      anterior pituitary (ACTH, LH) and adrenal hormones (DHEA and cortisol). We also plan to study
      norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), because nicotine stimulates rapid release of NE and
      E in preclinical and clinical studies. The studies will examine the acute effects of
      intravenous nicotine on the gonadal steroid hormones and the reciprocal feedback regulation
      by LH. The temporal covariance of hormonal changes with serum nicotine levels and
      nicotine-induced changes in subjective states and cardiovascular measures will be measured.
      The covariance between nicotine-induced changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular
      effects and the temporal concordance with increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels
      will be determined. Gender and menstrual cycle phase influences on the effects of nicotine on
      HPA and HPG hormones and subjective effects will be assessed.
