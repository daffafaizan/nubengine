      because of unique tumor and patient factors. Individual drugs with distinct mechanisms of
      action may induce specific genomic and proteomic changes that may be used as predictor for
      response. We plan to study serial genomic and proteomic profiles in primary breast tumor
      treated with one of two sequences of alternating adriamycin (A) and docetaxel (T),
      A>T>A>T>A>T, or T>A>T>A>T>A, at 75mg/m2 3 weekly for each drug. Pharmacokinetic analysis of
      both drugs will be performed; amplified tumor RNA will be hybridized on Affymetrix® HG-U133+2
      array; tumor proteins will be fractionated and profiled with ProteinChip® Array SELDI MS
      (Ciphergen). Tumor gene expression and proteomic changes will be correlated with treatment
      response to identify biomarkers that may predict chemotherapy sensitivity.
