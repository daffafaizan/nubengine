    
      To simulate the scenario of infant CPR, an ALS Baby trainer manikin (Laerdal Medical,
      Stavanger, Norway) simulating a 3-month-old infant. The manikin was connected with a
      fixed-volume arterial system attached to a monitor (Draeger InfinityÂ® Delta; Draegerwerk AG &
      Co. KGaA, Luebeck, Germany) via an arterial pressure transducer (Edward Lifesciences: TruWave
      Disposable Pressure Transducer; Irvine, CA, USA). The arterial circuit composed of a 50-mL
      bag of normal saline solution (air removed) attached to the manikin chest plate and connected
      to the transducer with a 20-gauge intravenous catheter and tubing. The manikin was placed on
      a high adjustable hospital stretcher. The bed was leveled to the iliac crest of each rescuer
      for standardization. The manikin was previously intubated and ventilation was performed using
      a resuscitator bag.
