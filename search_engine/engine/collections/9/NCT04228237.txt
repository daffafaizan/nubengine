    
      Diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma (BCA) is, as with most
      other oncological diseases, a complex multidisciplinary process. Due to the lack of
      information on the speed and success of the initial diagnosis, the use of the necessary
      laboratory techniques, and the individual therapeutic steps leading to cure or medical
      failure, the Czech Pneumological and Phtizeology Society (CPPS) decided to carry out
      long-term non-interventional monitoring of newly diagnosed patients.

      This monitoring is non-interventional, so the usual diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
      will be used according to the decision of the physician. All patients with bronchogenic
      carcinoma diagnosed from June 1, 2018 will be enrolled with up to 60 months of follow-up.
