        -  Determine the rates of durable full donor hematologic engraftment in patients with
           high-risk hematologic malignancies or severe aplastic anemia treated with
           non-myeloablative conditioning using fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte
           globulin followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the acute and delayed toxic effects of this non-myeloablative conditioning
           regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate and quality of immune reconstitution in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of disease relapse and incidence of post-transplantation
           lymphoproliferative disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease category (malignant vs non-malignant)
      and graft source (unrelated vs HLA-matched sibling).

      Beginning at least 4 weeks after conventional-dose chemotherapy, patients receive
      non-myeloablative conditioning comprising fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 to -2, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over at
      least 4 hours on days -2 and -1. Patients undergo filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, every 2 weeks for 3 months, monthly for 6 months,
      and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
