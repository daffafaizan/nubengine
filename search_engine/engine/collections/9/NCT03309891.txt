      week dosing regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience of daily rhGH injections and is
      under the studies designed to determine if the safety profile is comparable to currently
      approved daily rhGH products. Obviating the need for daily injections may increase compliance
      and therefore efficacy, which would be of great benefit to both paediatric and adult patients
      with GHD and other disorders with associated growth impairment and need for hGH substitution.
