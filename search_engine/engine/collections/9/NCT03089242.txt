      university hospital. We will profile microRNA expression in plasma and urine before and at
      several timepoints after surgery. We will use a preselected panel of microRNAs and lncRNAs
      for analysis. Goal is to identify microRNAs/lncRNAs that are able to predict the occurence of
      AKI in these patients.
