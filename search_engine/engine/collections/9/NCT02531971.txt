      attractive, and easy to use systems. Fentanyl patches are very popular TDDS available on the
      United States market today. Accurate determination of the rate and extent of drug release and
      absorption is crucial to ensure the safety of individuals using these and other types of
      patches. Delivery rate can be determined early in the development process by using in vitro
      skin flux permeation studies, and later in humans by accurately quantifying residual drug
      from patches post-wear and in pharmacokinetic studies. In this proposal, we will employ two
      types of evaluation to determine the rate and extent of drug release and absorption from RLD
      (reference listed drug) Duragesic Â® TDDS (transdermal drug delivery system) and Generic
      Fentanyl TDDS, namely residual drug analysis post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in
      healthy adult volunteers. In addition, we will compare the plasma drug concentrations
      following patch and intravenous administration of Fentanyl, in order to determine the
      absolute bioavailability of these patches. We will conduct residual drug analysis of TDDS
      following in vivo wear using highly sensitive validated quantification methods. Positive
      outcome of this project will identify appropriate methods to determine the rate and extent of
      drug release and absorption from TDDS, and will help regulatory agencies in the development
      of Guidances for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release and absorption
      kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products
