      plant compositions in the adolescent age segment wants to assess the satiating effect of two
      types of food supplements made with various types of fibers (inulin, maltodextrins, guar gum
      and dehydrated plums) in the subsequent intake of other foods, in satiety, and in the
      regulation of hormones (ghrelin, leptin and insulin) and other peptides involved in the
      mechanisms of satiety
