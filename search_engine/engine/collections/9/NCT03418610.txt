      of moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea. All patients will apply Azelaic Acid foam twice
      daily. At scheduled visits, high resolution equipment will be used to measure 3D
      topographical values for elevation of papules and pustules to objectively evaluate reduction
      of papulopustular lesions. Investigator and subject assessments will also be completed to
      assess the level of rosacea at weeks 4,8 and 12.
