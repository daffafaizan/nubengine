    
      This study consisted of 3 parts:

      Part 1: determination of the tolerable dose of rilotumumab in combination with panitumumab to
      be administered in Part 2.

      Part 2: Comparison of the safety and efficacy of rilotumumab or ganitumab in combination with
      panitumumab versus that of panitumumab alone. In Part 2, participants were randomized 1:1:1
      into 3 cohorts: 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 10 mg/kg rilotumumab, 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 12
      mg/kg ganitumab, or 6 mg/kg panitumumab and placebo (panitumumab alone cohort). Panitumumab
      was administered open-label, and rilotumumab and ganitumab were double-blinded.

      Part 3: Exploratory evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the rilotumumab and ganitumab
      monotherapy following treatment with panitumumab in Part 2. In Part 3, eligible participants
      who terminated panitumumab treatment in the Panitumumab Alone arm of Part 2 due to disease
      progression or intolerability could be randomized 1:1 into 2 double-blind cohorts: 10 mg/kg
      rilotumumab or 12 mg/kg ganitumab.

      Participants who permanently discontinued all the investigational products completed a safety
      follow-up visit 30 days and a follow-up visit 60 days after the last dose of investigational
      product. Participants were followed for radiographic disease progression and survival every 3
      months after the 30-day safety follow-up visit for up to 2 years after the last participant
      was enrolled in Part 2.
