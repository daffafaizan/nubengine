    
      This study is a prospective, blinded, multi-center multi-reader (MCMR) clinical trial that is
      statistically powered for non-inferiority of diagnostic image quality of synthetic MR versus
      conventional MR and collection of supporting radiologic findings and morphology data from
      radiologists that reflect anticipated clinical usage of synthetic MR technology.

      The study consists of three parts:

        1. Clinical MR acquisition,

        2. synthetic MR post-processing at a GE facility, and

        3. blinded image evaluation (BIE) of conventional and synthetic images for each subject.

      The study will enroll eligible adult subjects with clinical indications for brain MRI that
      meet applicable site MR safety criteria and are not pregnant. The study consists of one
      visit, the subject's MRI scan, without additional follow-up. Results are expected to be
      representative of expected clinical usage of synthetic MAGiC MR technology in clinical
      practice.
