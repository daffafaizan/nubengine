      squamous esophageal cancers treated by chemoradiotherapy or endoscopic resection. Endoscopic
      surveillance first started with NBI for detection and characterization of early esophageal
      cancers through observation of abnormal intrapapillary capillary loops (IPCL). Superficial
      esophageal neoplasia were diagnosed by IPCL Type IV, V1,V2 and Vn. Lugol chromoendoscopy
      would be performed subsequently and suspicious neoplasia were classified as understain or
      unstain lesions. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of NBI were compared to
      Lugol chromoendoscopy with histology serving as a gold standard.
