      orally on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week. Rituximab will be given as an
      intravenous infusion weekly during Cycle 1 and then once per month on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Subjects can receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. Blood draws and 2 EKGs
      (electrocardiograms) will be done weekly in Cycle 1 and then once in each cycle. PET/CT
      (Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) scans will be done every 2 months.

      If disease has not progressed after 6 cycles on combination of panobinostat and rituximab,
      subjects may continue on panobinostat alone for up to 6 additional months.
