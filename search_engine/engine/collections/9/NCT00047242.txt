        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of UCN-01 and
           irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors, primarily lung, ovarian, and
           gastrointestinal tumors.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the anti-tumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 and irinotecan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at
      the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-15
      months.
