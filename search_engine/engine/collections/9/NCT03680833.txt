    
      Consecutive women with stage 1a2-2a1 cervical cancer scheduled for surgery will be approached
      for eligibility by defined criteria.

      Sentinel nodes will be detected by a combined use of Indocyanine green and Tc99 radiocolloid
      ( first 75 patients) and for the continuation with either the combined use or the best
      performing of those tracers.

      Technical success rates, adverse events (related study intervention and overall) sensitivity
      and negative predictive values will be estimated.

      An interim analyse will be performed after 34 node positive patients based on the Fleming two
      stage analyse. The null hypothesis of sensitivity of 85% will be tested against an estimated
      sensitivity of 95%. At this stage the study may be closed for futility, closed as hull
      hypothesis is rejected or continued to reach another 28 node positive patients.

      As a full pelvic lymphadenectomy will be performed after detection of sentinel nodes patient
      will act ast their own controls.
