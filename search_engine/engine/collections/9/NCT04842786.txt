      The purpose is to determine the effect of twice daily topical coconut oil application on late
      onset sepsis in neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Indira Gandhi
      Institute of Child Health, Cloudnine Hospital at Old Airport Road, and Cloudnine Hospital at
      Jayanagar in Bangalore, India. The aim is to determine the effect of topical coconut oil
      application on:

        -  The incidence of neonatal late onset culture positive sepsis

        -  Neonatal skin integrity versus a no treatment control using standard skin evaluation
           methods

        -  Biomarkers of neonatal innate immune function

        -  Temperature instability, weight gain, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing
           enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and mortality.

      The investigators hypothesize that twice daily topical coconut oil application will reduce
      the incidence of late onset sepsis (LOS) in premature and full-term infants versus the
      current standard of care, i.e., no treatment. The oil treatment will increase the neonatal
      skin barrier integrity measured by validated clinical and instrumental methods. Skin surface
      biomarkers of innate immune function collected from coconut oil treated skin will indicate
      less inflammation (lower proinflammatory cytokine levels) than in untreated control skin.
