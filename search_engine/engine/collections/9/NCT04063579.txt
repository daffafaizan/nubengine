      diagnostic challenges due to its non-specific clinical manifestations. Currently,
      echocardiography serves as the main diagnostic tool, but alternatives are limited to less
      preferred invasive procedures in most clinical situations.

      It is therefore proposed to investigate HFpEF using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging
      (CMR), as an alternative non-invasive diagnostic tool which carries lower risk than invasive
      procedures.

      The study aims to: (1) access the utility of CMR-FT as a new indicator to diagnose diastolic
      dysfunction by differentiating HFpEF patients from non-HFpEF patient and normal volunteers.
      (2) Compare accuracy of CMR-FT to CMR tagging and phase contrast imaging.
