      with natural menopause, the transition typically lasts four years, with a mean age at
      menopause of 51 years. Menstrual irregularity (90%) and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (80%) are
      the most common symptoms associated with the transition. Hormone therapy has been the gold
      standard for treating VMS symptoms against which other therapies are measured. However,
      resistance to hormone therapy use due to its risks and side effects continues to fuel the
      search for safer alternatives.

      This research study will evaluate three low risk interventions (yoga, exercise, and omega-3
      supplements) compared to either a usual activity group or a placebo pill. This factorial
      design is motivated by the desire to have all women receive some intervention. Neither
      comparisons between yoga and exercise nor tests of interaction between the behavioral
      interventions (yoga, exercise, usual activity) and omega-3 motivated this design. However,
      these aspects can be examined in secondary analyses in a more rigorous fashion through this
      design than would be permitted by separate trials.
