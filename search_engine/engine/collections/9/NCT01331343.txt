      generally assesses the average/long term quality of glycemic control. On a daily basis,
      patients assess their glycemic control through finger stick measurements (SMBG), which allows
      them to adjust their therapy. A device which would provide a patient with a real-time glucose
      value, as well as high and low alerts, could aid the patient in knowing when to perform
      confirmatory SMBG tests and intervene so that dangerous glycemic excursions may occur less
      frequently.
