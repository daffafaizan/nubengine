      5-24 years old who are scheduled for haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Patients will have two MRI scans requiring them to lie in the scanner for approximately 15
      minutes. Patients unable to tolerate lying flat for this length of time or to tolerate the
      scan for any reason will be withdrawn from the study. If required a play specialist can be
      organised to help the young patients feel more at ease in the MRI department. MRI does not
      involve radiation exposure and when performed within national safety guidelines do not pose a
      significant risk. Patients with contraindications to MRI such as pacemakers, certain metal
      implants and claustrophobia will not be recruited. Every effort will be made to book scan
      appointments to coincide with clinic visits.

      Scans will be reported as per clinical procedures and data will be made available to the
      referring consultants immediately via the radiology picture archiving and communications
      system (PACS).
