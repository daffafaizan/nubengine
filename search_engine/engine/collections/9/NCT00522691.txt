      incontinence when conservative measures fail and surgical repair is not indicated. In a
      minimally-invasive approach and under local anaesthesia, an electrode is placed around sacral
      nerve root S2-4 and electrical stimulation is applied to the sacral spinal nerves.
      Effectiveness of SNS is definitively not only explained by placebo effect but the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Suggested pathways include modulation of afferent
      nerve fibres and direct stimulation of the pelvic floor and anal sphincter muscle. After
      placement of the electrode, the patient is stimulated by an external stimulator for 1-3
      weeks. During this period, the patient documents the number of faecal incontinence episodes
      or urgencies in a symptom diary. By convention, indication for permanent stimulation is based
      on a 50% reduction in the number of episodes. After a successful testing period, the
      permanent stimulator is implanted, generally in the upper gluteal region.

      Previous studies report success rates up to 80%. The only randomized trial with a proper
      sample size evaluated the efficacy of SNS after definite implantation. In this study, 63% of
      the patients felt improved during the placebo period and might not really benefit from the
      device. The real success rate of SNS is therefore likely to be considerably lower. Efficacy
      of SNS during the testing phase has never been assessed in a blinded randomized study.
