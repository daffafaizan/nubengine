      system. Numerous clinical interventions have been created to systematically address the range
      of issues caused by tinnitus. Only a few tinnitus interventions have focused on coping
      strategies. Coping strategies are cognitive, affective, and behavioral attempts to master new
      events, such as the onset of a disability or an impairment like tinnitus, that are
      overwhelming to an individual, and that because of their newness, an individual does not
      necessarily have automatic, adaptive responses. Evidence suggests that CET is effective in
      facilitating adaptive coping strategies among individuals with several types of impairments
      or disabilities. The proposed study will be the first application of CET to a tinnitus
      population.

      The present study proposes a development of a CET protocol for tinnitus and a pilot study
      that assesses the effectiveness of the CET and ACT interventions compared to the current
      clinical practice of using a CBT intervention. All 3 psycho-educational interventions will be
      compared to a usual care group. The overarching goal of the proposed pilot study is to gain
      information that can be used to provide individuals with tinnitus with the best care for
      helping them to more successfully cope with tinnitus.

      The aims of this research are to: 1) develop a CET protocol for tinnitus by means of
      information gathered from two focus groups and from CET consultants; 2) to examine whether a
      3-session CET psycho-educational intervention is more effective than a 3-session CBT
      psycho-educational intervention or a 3-session ACT psycho-educational intervention, as
      compared to a usual care, in increasing coping strategies among individuals with tinnitus.
