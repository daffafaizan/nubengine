    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will assess
      the feasibility of studying inhaled nitric oxide for the treatment of cardiogenic shock due
      to right ventricular infarction, and the dose response of the acute hemodynamic changes
      occurring with nitric oxide inhalation in these patients. Patients with evidence of right
      ventricular infarction and cardiogenic shock, and have angiographic evidence of impaired
      blood flow to the right ventricle, or if right ventricular coronary perfusion is unimpared,
      cardiac shock persists, will be eligible for enrollment. Patients will receive standard of
      care for their condition, and will also recieve either nitric oxide for inhalation or placebo
      for up to 14 days.
