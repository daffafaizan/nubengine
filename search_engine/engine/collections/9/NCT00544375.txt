      leg,arm or on the back, abdomen and the head. The actual location will depend upon the
      neonate position and size. A small soft plastic optical fibers probe will be placed to the
      select study areas and thhe time of the measurement will not exceed 1 hour.

      NIRS measurements of hemoglobin and hemoglobin saturation in tissues before and after
      red-cell transfusions in VLBW infants will determine the true effect of the transfusions, and
      develop more substantial guidelines regarding indications for transfusion. The accuracy of
      conventional (invasive) measurements of Hb and Hct could be comparison with results from the
      NIRS technique and clinical usefulness of the NIRS technique could be evaluated by comparison
      with trends in conventionally measured values taking fluid status into account.

      Near-infrared light does not ionize biological tissue and poses no significant health risk.
      Since water absorption is low within this spectral range, local heating of the tissue is also
      minimal. Burns and heat damage to the neonate are highly unlikely.
