    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in the levels of total- and free- prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free
      to total PSA (f/tPSA) ratio and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels and IGF-I/free
      PSA (fPSA) ratio, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after Sunphenon 90DCF-T (green tea extract) supplementation
      during the period between recruitment and biopsy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of oral ingestion on Sunphenon 90DCF-T supplementation during the
      period between recruitment and biopsy in the reactivation of glutathione S-transferase pi 1
      (GSTP1) (whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]); levels of antigen identified by monoclonal
      antibody Ki-67 (Ki-67), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), and M30 apopotosense in the
      prostate tissue.

      II. To evaluate the effects of oral ingestion of Sunphenon 90DCF-T during the period between
      recruitment and biopsy on histologic findings in prostate tissue such as nuclear measurements
      viz. shape, size and texture and quality of life (QOL) assessment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo active surveillance for 52 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive green tea extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
