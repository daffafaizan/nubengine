      I. Evaluate image quality and usability of the tethered capsule endoscope after repeated
      clinical use and reprocessing.

      II. Evaluate safety issues associated with the use of the device for this subject population
      - was there any noticeable difference from prior study of subjects at high risk of Barrett's
      esophagus using the same device, but without reprocessing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES;

      I. Study other specified device characteristics or device application considerations.

      II. Obtain preliminary data for use in designing a subsequent pivotal study of the device.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients swallow the tethered capsule endoscope (TCE) and undergo endoscopic examination
      while they are seated on a standard endoscopy gurney. Patients undergo standard of care EGD
      on the same day.
