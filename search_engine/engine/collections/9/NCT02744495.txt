      Control: No prophylaxis whatever risk score is. Postoperative nausea and vomiting risk
      factors were not available for practicians.

      Intervention: Preoperative collection of postoperative nausea and vomiting risk factors
      available for practicians. Prophylaxis if risk score is over 2. Prophylaxis of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting by betamethasone (4mg) and/or droperidol (0.625mg) immediately after
      cardiac surgery, depending on risk factors in the intervention arm.

      All outcomes are assessed at 48 hours of surgery:

      Primary: occurrence of postoperative nausea or vomiting Secondary: number of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting with visual assessment scale (VAS), and antiemetics used for treatment;
      postoperative pain (VAS) with number of analgesics used; postoperative discomfort (VAS).
