    
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, and cohort expansion study
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and antitumor activity of SEA-CD70 in
      adults with myeloid malignancies. The study will be conducted in up to 3 parts.

      Part A is a dose escalation cohort designed to identify the MTD or recommended expansion dose
      of SEA-CD70 in subjects with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS. Part B is an expansion
      cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS. Part C is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML.
