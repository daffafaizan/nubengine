      people who had uterine fibroids.

      The study enrolled 281 patients. Participants received relugolix placebo and leuprorelin
      acetate placebo in run in period for 3 to 6 weeks. After run-in period, participants were
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in 1:1
      ratio:

        -  Relugolix 40 mg

        -  Leuprorelin 1.88 or 3.75 mg

      Participants received relugolix tablets once daily along with leuprorelin 1.88 mg or 3.75 mg
      subcutaneous injection once in 4 weeks for 24 weeks in treatment period.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was approximately 32 to 40 weeks including run-in period of 3 to 6 weeks and a treatment
      period of 24 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final visit 4
      weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
