        -  Compare the effectiveness, in terms of incidence of graft failure and incidence of
           greater than grade 1 acute graft-vs-host disease, of ex vivo manipulation of bone marrow
           cells comprising counterflow centrifugal elutriation for T-lymphocyte depletion followed
           by CD34-positive stem cell selection using CliniMACS vs Isolex 300i in patients with a
           hematologic malignancy undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an
           HLA-identical sibling donor.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by age (< 40 vs 40-65) and
      disease status (low-risk [i.e., chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid
      leukemia in first complete remission (CR), acute lymphocytic leukemia in first CR, Hodgkin's
      or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in sensitive relapse, or multiple myeloma in CR or partial
      remission) vs high-risk [i.e., all others]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Allogeneic bone marrow cells are subjected to counterflow centrifugal elutriation
           (CCE) for T-lymphocyte depletion. The elutriation fractions are then processed over
           2-2.5 hours using CliniMACS to select for CD34-positive stem cells.

        -  Arm II: Allogeneic bone marrow cells are subjected to CCE for T-lymphocyte depletion.
           The elutriation fractions are then processed over 4-4.5 hours using Isolex 300i to
           select for CD34-positive stem cells.

      Patients in both arms then undergo ex vivo manipulated, T-lymphocyte-depleted, CD34-positive
      stem cell-selected, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      After the transplantation, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 206 patients will be accrued for this study.
