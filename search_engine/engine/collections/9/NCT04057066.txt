      promotion for this target group is needed. The internet is an attractive and feasible medium
      for physical activity promotion, however interventions have to be adapted to the special
      needs of pwMS. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week internet-based
      exercise and physical activity counseling intervention.

      26 pwMS will be enrolled in the study. All of them receive the intervention. Focus groups and
      interviews will be conducted with participating pwMS to determine acceptability of the
      intervention and to explore participants experiences. Compliance with the intervention will
      be monitored. Additionally, changes in objective physical activity, subjective physical
      activity, fatigue, walking ability and level of depression will be calculated.
