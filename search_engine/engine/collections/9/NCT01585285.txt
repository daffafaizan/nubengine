      left anterior mammary artery (LIMA) inflow directly to the left anterior descending coronary
      (LAD), but also to the other branches of the anterolateral territory thereby promoting a
      higher flow through the LIMA pedicle. It is constructed using a short saphenous vein graft
      (SVG) bridge (LSVB) interposed between the LAD and one (or more) other anterolateral targets,
      with the LIMA grafted on the hood of the SVG just above the LAD anastomosis.

      Objectives. The main objective of the prospective randomized clinical trial AMI-PONT is to
      assess whether a CABG strategy including a LSVB to distribute the LIMA outflow provides
      non-inferior patency rates compared to conventional CABG surgery with separated LIMA graft to
      LAD and SVG to other anterolateral targets.

      Methods. Two hundred adult patients undergoing primary isolated CABG, requiring grafting of
      LAD and at least one other anterolateral target, will be randomized 1:1 in two treatment
      arms: 1) CABG strategy with LSVB; and 2) conventional CABG strategy with LIMA graft to the
      LAD and separate aorto-coronary SVG to other anterolateral targets. Patients will be assessed
      clinically at 30 days, 6 months, one, five and ten years. They will undergo graft patency
      assessment at one and five years using Multi-Slice Computed Tomography. All patients will
      undergo CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients will be excluded if they have a
      contraindication to CPB or MSCT graft assessment.
