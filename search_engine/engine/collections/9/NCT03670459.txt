        -  Measure the effect of Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises on trunk kinetics and velocity of gait
           in patient with MS.

        -  Measure the effect of vestibular habituation on trunk kinetics and velocity of gait in
           patient with MS.

        -  Determine which type of vestibular exercises had more effect on the rehabilitation of
           patients with MS Cawthorne Cooksey or vestibular habituation?

        -  Determine if there was a correlation between the improvement in trunk kinetics and
           velocity of gait in patients with MS.

      Forty five patients with multiple sclerosis were selected from the Out Patient Clinics of
      Neurology and Internal Medicine in Kasr Al- Aini Hospitals, Out Patient Clinic of Neurology,
      Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University and 6th of October central hospital.

      The selected patients were divided into three equal groups:

        -  Patients in G1 will receive traditional physical therapy program (balance training) for
           twelve sessions; day after day

        -  Patients in G2 will receive Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises in addition to traditional
           physical therapy program for twelve sessions; day after day.

        -  Patients in G3 will receive vestibular habituation exercises in addition to traditional
           physical therapy program for twelve sessions; day after day.
