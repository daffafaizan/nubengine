      efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation with the Empower Neuromodulation System on reducing
      opioid craving and use and decreasing pain. Opioid prescribing for chronic pain has increased
      dramatically over the past several decades, with devastating public health consequences,
      including high rates of opioid misuse and overdose deaths. Safe nonpharmacological treatments
      are urgently needed. In this randomized, controlled study, thirty Veterans with chronic
      non-cancer pain (NCP) and opioid misuse will be recruited and randomly assigned (1:1) to
      either the Active or Control treatment. On Days 1-7, participants will undergo baseline
      monitoring, and on Days 8-21, participants will undergo daily nerve stimulation treatment.
      Pain scores, craving, and opioid use will be measured daily Days 0-21. Our goal is to provide
      an intervention that, alone or in conjunction with current treatments, reduces craving and
      reduces reliance on opioids in high-risk chronic pain patients.
