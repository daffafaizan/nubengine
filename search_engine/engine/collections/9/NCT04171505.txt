    
      A retrospective cohort study of women treated by excisional therapy due to HSIL/ CIN at
      Clínico San Carlos Hospital (Madrid) between 2012-2018. The effectiveness of prophylactic
      vaccination against HPV in women treated for HPV-linked disease will be evaluated. For this
      purpose, the percentage of lesional recurrence among a group of treated and vaccinated women
      against HPV between the years 2015-2018 will be compared with a control group of treated and
      non-vaccinated women against HPV since 2012-2015. The data will be obtained through the
      review of clinical records.

      Our protocol is explained above:

      HPV detection method:

      The detection of HPV is performed on a liquid basis by means of the CLARK PAPILOMAVIRUS HUMAN
      test that detects the presence of the HPV virus (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42,
      43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 66, 68, 70, 71.72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 and
      89). The test has a diagnostic sensitivity of 98.2% and a diagnostic specificity of 100% and
      analytical specificity: 100%. The analytical sensitivity of this test is 100% when the number
      of copies is 1,000 or 10,000 depending on the type of HPV. The Laboratory has carried out
      external quality control of the SEAP.

      Pre-surgical evaluation:

      Those patients with an abnormal cytological result and / or positive HPV tests were referred
      to the PTGI consultations of Clínico San Carlos Hospital for evaluation according to the
      Cervical Cancer Prevention Guidelines issued by the Spanish Association of Cervical Pathology
      and Colposcopy (AEPCC) in 2006 and 2014. These patients underwent colposcopy with biopsy if
      necessary +/- determination of HPV. Patients diagnosed with HSIL / CIN 2+ who met the
      inclusion criteria were submitted to cervical conization and subsequently enrolled in the
      study after signing the informed consent, approved by ethics commission.

      We will take into account the date of administration of the first dose of vaccine. The types
      of vaccines administered can be: Bivalent vaccine (includes genotypes 16/18), Tetravalent
      (includeds genotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18) both funded in the region in different years, or not
      funded (Nonavalent vaccine; includes genotypes: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58). To
      define the time of vaccination around the conization date, the administration of the first
      dose of vaccine will be taken into account.

      Surgical treatment:

      Excisional therapy was performed in the operating room on a scheduled basis under local
      analgesia and sedation. After infiltration with local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor in the 4
      quadrants of the cervix, excisional therapy with diathermic loop is performed under
      colposcopy control, obtaining the piece in a single specimen. The piece is oriented with a
      long thread at 12:00 h, it is introduced in formaldehyde and send to pathological anatomy for
      deferred study. In all cases, immediate endocervical curettage post-treatment was performed.

      Clinical follow-up:

      The first revision is made 30 days after surgery where patient is informed of histological
      results and the date on first control post-treatment based on the diagnosis.

      Following the protocol of the AEPCC, in case of non-involvement of margins and negative
      endocervical curettage, the patient comes after 6 months from the intervention to perform the
      first post-surgery control with co-test. In case of positive endocervical curettage or margin
      involvement, the first post-surgery control will be performed at 4 months with cotest +
      endocervical study and colposcopy. Persistent disease is defined as the presence of
      cytological alteration and / or HPV infection in the first post control performed at 4-6
      months after excisional therapy. These patients are excluded from the study, since only those
      in which both tests are negative will be included.

      Subsequently, a new co-test was performed at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after the
      first post-surgery control. After 3 years of negative testing, the patient is returned to the
      current cervical cancer-screening program.
