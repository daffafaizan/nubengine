      6/30/2020 will be identified through the electronic medical record utilizing ICD codes for
      HAP and VAP. Patients with respiratory culture data signifying a Gram-negative organism as
      the cause of HAP/VAP will be analyzed as described below if study inclusion criteria is met.
      Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data will interpreted per Clinical & Laboratory
      Standards Institute (CLSI) standards to determine local patterns of resistance. Multivariable
      logistic regression will be performed to determine risk factors for piperacillin-tazobactam,
      cefepime or meropenem resistant Gram-negative isolates. Project target date of completion and
      close-out is May 2021.
