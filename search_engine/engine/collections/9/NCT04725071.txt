      sample sizes and these have failed to show any large improvements in wound healing. However,
      in older populations the investigators suspect that immunonutrition supplements may have a
      larger benefit to these patients as they often present with malnutrition and are more likely
      to struggle with delayed wound healing. In this pilot study, the investigators look to assess
      the impact of immunonutrition supplements the burn wound healing of adults over the age of 65
      years with 5-15% total burn surface area (TBSA) partial thickness and full thickness burn
      injuries.

      The primary outcome objective of the study will be time to complete wound closure. The
      secondary objectives include need for surgical grafting, length of inpatient stay, and
      infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, wound infections, and blood stream
      infections.
