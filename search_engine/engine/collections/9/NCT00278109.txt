        -  Assess the potential acute and late skin and subcutaneous toxicities in women with
           resected stage I or II breast cancer treated with partial breast irradiation (PBI) and
           concurrent cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin (AC) chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the cosmetic effects of partial breast irradiation/chemotherapy (PBIC) in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the local control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo partial breast radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks.
      Patients also receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1. Treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 10
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
