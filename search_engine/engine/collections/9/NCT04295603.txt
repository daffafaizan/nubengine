      qualitative part. The treatment is assigned to one of two care units and subjects are
      allocated to the care unit not according to a randomization process but based on
      administrative basis.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the impacts of Toucher-Massage (TM) on the
      experience of patients with chronic pain hospitalized in two rehabilitation internal medicine
      services.

      The main objective is to measure the effects of TM on the global impression of change of the
      perception of pain.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Measure the effects on

             1. the severity and impact of pain

             2. anxiety/depression

             3. caregiver-patient interaction

        2. Explore the experiences of patients benefiting from TM

        3. Explore perceptions, resistance, barriers and facilitators regarding the proposed
           interventions with the health care teams of the units.

      The population is patients suffering from chronic pain in two units of the internal medicine
      rehabilitation service at Beau-SÃ©jour. The two units are similar in terms of care intake and
      populations cared for.

      The required sample size is 78 participants (39 per group)
