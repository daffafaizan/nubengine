      to detect cancer and disk displacement with temporomandibular disorders. The prevalence of
      tongue cancer may increase with ageing population. A clear MR image is indispensable for
      clinical diagnosis. However, tongue motion associated with the habitual or swallowing tongue
      movement may cause artifacts on MRI. This occurrence of motion artifact is speculated to be
      prominent with the patients without the occlusal support. The objective of this pilot study
      was to compare level of artifact while tongue at rest and in motion of dentulous subjects.
