      adults. (1) In severe cases, parapneumonic effusions or empyema may develop. In these
      patients, a transitional fibrin neomatrix constitutes part of the acute inflammatory response
      as seen in sepsis. (2) The increased vascular permeability, mediated by several cytokines,
      such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and platelet activator factor, allows
      migration of inflammatory cells, an increased fluid accumulation and bacterial invasion into
      pleural space. (3) At this stage, activation of the coagulation cascade leads to procoagulant
      activity and decreased fibrinolysis with deposition of fibrin in the pleural space. The
      activation of the fibrinolytic system produce the D-dimer and follow by increased other
      procoagulant markers like thrombin anti thrombin, fragment 1.2 (4-5) Several studies showed
      that the plasma D-dimer levels were increased even in community-acquired pneumonia patients.
      Moreover, others reported that Serum levels of AT-III, D-D and CRP at admission appear to be
      useful biomarkers for assessing the severity of CAP. However, no data exists about the
      fibrinolytic profile in patients with CAP alone in compare to CAP with parapneumonic effusion
      with and without empyema.

      Aim:

      To study the fibrinolytic activity in patients with CAP alone versus CAP with parapneumonic
      effusions with and without empyema.
