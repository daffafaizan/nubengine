      I. Determine an unknown normal immune response (T cell and B cell) to post-cryotherapy
      treatment for prostate cancer.

      II. Detect the altered immune response (T cell and B cell) post-GM-CSF (sargramostim)
      response and post-cryotherapy for the prostate cancer.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (TREATMENT): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0 and receive sargramostim
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
