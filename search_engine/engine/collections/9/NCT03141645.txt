      of postoperative nausea and vomiting during 24 hours after elective laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy in patients receiving preoperative intravenous fluid loading (group F),
      ondansetron (group O) and receiving neither fluid nor ondansetron or control group (group C).
      This study is hypothesized that the incidence of PONV in patients receiving preoperative
      intravenous fluid loading (group F) and patients receiving ondansetron (group O) will be
      similarly reduced from the control group (receiving neither fluid nor ondansetron).
