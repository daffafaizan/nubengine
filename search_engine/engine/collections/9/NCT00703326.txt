      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast adenocarcinoma that is
      metastatic or locally-recurrent and inoperable with curative intent will be randomized.
      Participants may not have received chemotherapy for metastatic or locally-recurrent,
      inoperable breast cancer.

      It is anticipated that 1113 participants will be randomized with 371 participants in the
      docetaxel plus placebo arm and 742 participants in the docetaxel plus ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)
      arm. There will be approximately 250 centers in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Middle
      East, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

      On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, participants will receive docetaxel 75 mg/mÂ² as a one-hour
      I.V. infusion followed by either ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) 10 mg/kg or placebo 10 mg/kg as a
      one-hour I.V. infusion. Each cycle is repeated every 21 days.

      Treatment will continue until there is evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable
      toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met. Participants who discontinue study treatment
      with either ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) or placebo may continue to receive docetaxel.
