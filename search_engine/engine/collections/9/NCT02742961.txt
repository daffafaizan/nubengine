      of peripheral nerve blocks on patient and health system outcomes after elective total knee
      replacement surgery.

      The investigators will develop a non-parsimonious propensity score to control for potential
      indication bias and confounding in this observational study. Using the propensity score the
      investigators will match patients who receive a peripheral nerve block to a patient who did
      not to estimate the independent association of peripheral nerve blocks with our study
      outcomes.
