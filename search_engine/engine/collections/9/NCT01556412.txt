      of the common bile duct and enlarged lymph nodes) are measured in patients with cholestatic
      hepatopathy of unknown causes via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

      This EUS of the CBD is performed from the bulbar position in the duodenum and at least 5 cm
      of bile duct had to be visualized to correctly analyze bile duct structure.

      Further diagnostic work-up of these patients is performed following current guidelines, and
      definite diagnosis is compared with results of EUS parameters measured. Thus, diagnostic
      yield of EUS in patients with suspected PSC is further evaluated.
