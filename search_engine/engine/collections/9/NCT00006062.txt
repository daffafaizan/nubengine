      solid tumors. The recommended single-agent dose of oxaliplatin in adult cancer patients is
      130 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours every 3 weeks. Hepatic metabolism is the major
      route of drug elimination for many anti-cancer agents. Although there is limited safety and
      pharmacokinetic data for oxaliplatin in patients with renal impairment, there is currently no
      data regarding its disposition in patients with liver dysfunction. This phase I and
      pharmacologic study of a single agent oxaliplatin is being conducted in adult cancer patients
      with advanced malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. Patients will be
      stratified into five groups based upon their degree of liver dysfunction as assessed by liver
      function tests. Group A will consist of patients with normal hepatic function to serve as
      pharmacologic controls. Group E will consist of patients who have received a liver
      transplant. The remaining 3 groups will start at different doses of oxaliplatin based on
      hepatic dysfunction and dose escalation in these groups will proceed in a manner in
      accordance with standard phase I trial with 3 patients per dose level until dose limiting
      toxicity is observed. Pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed in all patients on study.
      The goals of this trial are to define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of single agent
      oxaliplatin in this patient population and to determine recommended doses of oxaliplatin in
      patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment.
