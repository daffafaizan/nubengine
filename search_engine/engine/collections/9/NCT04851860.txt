      persons of general population . ARDs are triggered by exposure to allergen and includes
      allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and bronchial asthma. ARDs are associated
      with decreased quality of life and increased economic burden .

      Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only disease modifying therapy preventing the
      evolution of AR to asthma, and its efficacy has long been known since observations by Leonard
      Noon in 1911. Allergen immunotherapy for AR is currently considered when showing strongly
      suggestive symptoms of AR which interfere with daily activities or sleep, and having evidence
      of IgE sensitization to â‰¥1 clinically relevant allergen .

      The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recommends treatmentof
      children with moderate to severe AR with Allergen Immunotherapy. It includes sublingual
      immunotherapy (SLIT) and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)
      has been the gold standard, whereas sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has emerged as an
      effective and safe alternative .

      Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is the only treatment that regulates the immunological
      process during development of allergic rhinitis (AR), rather than simply treating symptoms.

      Platelet activation occurs during antigen-induced airway reactions in allergic and asthmatic
      subjects. Raised levels of platelet-derived mediators, such as the Platelet Factor-4 (PF4),
      it is observed in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of atopic individuals, and has the
      ability to activate eosinophils, increase expression of Fc-IgG and Fc-IgE receptors, and
      stimulate basophils to release histamine.
