      psychosocial and pharmacological interventions showed limited one year long-term efficacy in
      terms of relapse (only 10% of sustained remission at one-year follow-up actually) and quality
      of life due to refractoriness, observance and adverse effects. In the recent years the field
      of non-invasive brain stimulation became more mature with an increasing level of evidence
      reaching Level 1 for rTMS as curative treatment for depression in international guidelines.
      It is a safe and well tolerated treatment but with still high relapse rate at 6 month and one
      year (comparable to those former described for ECT). mTMS is a promising tool (as it was
      proven for ECT) to achieve sustained response several month after treatment in a significant
      proportion of patients. Little is known about its long-term economic and social benefit which
      is a crucial question given its time consuming nature. To date there is no large Randomized
      Clinical Trial (RCT) assessing the long-term health economic interest or adjuvant mTMS
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) alone in unipolar TRD . This study is a double-blind
      randomized controlled trial aiming at determining a 12 month cost-utility analysis, according
      to collective perspective, of two different modalities of rTMS (systematic mTMS or curative
      rTMS in case of relapse) for TRD compared to TAU alone. The secondary aims are to describe 24
      month cost-utility, longitudinal clinical issues in terms of mood and quality of life,
      prognosis factors, as well as TAU actual strategies in that population.
