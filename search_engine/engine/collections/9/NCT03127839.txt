      participate in a trial investigating the value of different exercise and education regimens.
      Patients that choose to participate will be randomized to 1 of 4 different treatment groups
      focused on strengthening of the rotator cuff and shoulder girdle muscles: eccentric
      strengthening alone; traditional strengthening alone; eccentric strengthening plus education
      focused on pain neuroscience, traditional strengthening plus education focused on pain
      neuroscience. All patients will be seen in the clinic for 4-6 sessions over a 4-week period,
      as well receive a home exercise program that aligns with the exercise group there were
      randomized to.

      One-year outcomes will be compared across all 4 groups.
