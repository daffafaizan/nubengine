    
      This is a multi-centre, single arm phase 2 study of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda™ or MK-3475) in
      treatment naïve patients with poor prognosis carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).
      Participants will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 3-week
      cycle for up to 24 months. Patients will be evaluated for response every 9 weeks. Patients
      with objective response to treatment and those with stable disease will continue to receive
      Pembrolizumab. Patients with tumor progression will be discontinued from the study. Patients
      with progressive disease (PD), but showing a clinical benefit, may continue on Pembrolizumab,
      as per the discretion of the responsible Qualified Investigator. Response will be evaluated
      as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1
