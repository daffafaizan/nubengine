      including a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation phase (the first 12 weeks of any
      treatment) and an expansion phase. Initially, up to 12 participants were to be enrolled into
      Cohort 1 in order to obtain 6 evaluable participants through the DLT evaluation period of 12
      weeks. Safety data were reviewed by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) for each cohort
      during the DLT evaluation phase before the next cohort opened. Once a new cohort was opened,
      the previously opened cohort was permitted to continue enrolling participants for the
      expansion phase for a total of 30 participants per cohort.

      Only two of the planned three cohorts enrolled participants in the study based on the SMC
      recommendation after DLTs were identified in Cohort 2.
