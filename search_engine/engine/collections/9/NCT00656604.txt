        -  To correlate data obtained by DCE-MRI and MRS in healthy women and in women who are
           undergoing surgery for breast cancer with data obtained by conventional X-ray
           mammography, tissue proteomics, and histopathology.

        -  To evaluate the impact of MRSI data on treatment planning for radiotherapy and/or
           surgery.

      OUTLINE: Healthy participants undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic (MRS) for longitudinal studies of breast imaging and spectroscopy.

      Patients with breast cancers undergo DCE-MRI and MRS prior to initiation of treatment (i.e.,
      surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy). After treatment has begun, patients then undergo
      repeat imaging (not more than 1 per month) for follow-up assessments and longitudinal
      studies.

      Breast tissue samples are collected from patients undergoing surgery. Samples are evaluated
      by histopathological and proteomic analysis for correlation with DCE-MRI and MRS findings.

      The study interventions are discontinued after definitive surgery is performed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 healthy participants and 40 patients with breast cancer will
      be accrued for this study.
