    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult volunteers, to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple ascending doses of SKI-O-703. A
      total of 24 subjects are planned to participate in 3 cohorts (8 subjects each). In each
      cohort, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive SKI-O-703 and 2 subjects will be
      randomly assigned to matching placebo. Dosing will be initiated with a 200 mg once daily (QD)
      dose cohort and escalated to 400 mg QD, under fasting conditions, for 7 days. In the third
      cohort, a 200 mg twice daily (BID) dose will be studied for 7 days. Evening dosing will occur
      12 hours after the morning dose and will be preceded by fasting for at least 3 hours. After
      all 8 subjects in each cohort have received the study drug and been monitored, the decision
      to escalate to the next dose cohort will be made.
