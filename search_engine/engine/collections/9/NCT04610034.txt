      which may even exceed that of the patient's. Partners or spouses are typically the most
      important caregiver and emotional support person for the cancer patient, but there is a lack
      of psychological interventions that specifically target caregiving partners. "Resilient
      Caregivers" is a novel 7-session group-based program aimed specifically at improving the
      participant's ability to cope with the stresses of being a partner to a cancer patient. In
      this randomized trial, the investigators aim to assess the potential efficacy of this program
      in improving the caregiver's resilience and quality of life, as well as reducing symptoms of
      anxiety, depression and distress. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and
      12-months follow-up.
