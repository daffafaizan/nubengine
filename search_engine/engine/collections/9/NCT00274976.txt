        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous alemtuzumab vs intravenous alemtuzumab
           in patients with fludarabine-refractory advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the response in patients with high-risk genetic abnormalities (unmutated
           immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain [IgVH] status, del [17p], del [11q]) treated with
           subcutaneous alemtuzumab after progression on fludarabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive alemtuzumab IV once, followed 1 week later by alemtuzumab subcutaneously
      once weekly for up to 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
