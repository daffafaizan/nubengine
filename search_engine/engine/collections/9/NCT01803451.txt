      surgery improves glucose metabolism.

      The central hypothesis guiding this project is that the reconfiguration of intestinal transit
      with the Roux-en-Y will increase the release of insulinotropic GI hormones, termed incretins
      that improve insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. The study is divided into three
      specific aims.

        1. To determine the role of incretin hormones on insulin secretion in patients with gastric
           bypass surgery using intravenous-oral hyperglycemic clamp.

        2. To compare incretin effect and glucose tolerance among patient who suffer from
           hypoglycemia after RYGB and asymptomatic surgical and non-surgical individuals.

        3. To quantify the contribution of GLP-1 to incretin effect enhancement following surgery.
