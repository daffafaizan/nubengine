    
      Scope:

      To evaluate the new technologies that have been included in the PCA-9000A PET/CT System, the
      study has the following 3 goals.

        -  Define and confirm all supported clinical protocols from Low-Dose CT, to PET acquisition
           and presentation.

        -  Verification of the quantitative accuracy of the imaging chain.

        -  Evaluate the performance and stability of the new system and its related quality control
           and calibration procedures.

      Result (Expected):

      The study is an essential step in assessing the quality of the hardware and software defining
      the new PCA-9000A PET/CT System. Several essential parameters for the acquisition,
      reconstruction, correction, filtering, and presentation will be estimated or adjusted during
      this period. The evaluation will confirm PCA-9000A PET/CT System is effective for its
      intended use.
