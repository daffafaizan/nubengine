      challenging problem, especially in complex, transsphincteric cases. The surgical treatment
      aims to avoid recurrences and also to preserve normal sphincter functions. The FiLaC
      procedure was recently reported non-invasive technique in perianal fistulas for treatment and
      preserving anal sphincter function with a good success rate. In 2018, one of our colleagues
      published a 40% complete healing rate by using only FiLaC technique in 103 consecutive
      perianal fistula patients (Prof. Cem Terzi). Some authors advocated that the closure of the
      internal orifice increasing the success rate. Therefore, the investigators decided to modify
      the surgical technique focusing closure of the internal opening associated with the FiLaC
      procedure.
