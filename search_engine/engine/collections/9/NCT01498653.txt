      study. At Visit 1 (Screening Visit) subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria will enter a two week Run-in period. Subjects will remain on their
      current ICS therapy throughout the Run-in period. At the end of the Run-in period (Visit 2)
      subjects meeting the randomization criteria will enter a 12 week treatment period and receive
      one of the two following treatments: 1) FF (200mcg)/VI (25mcg) administered once daily in the
      evening via a Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI) 2) Fluticasone propionate 500mcg administered
      twice daily via DISKUSâ„¢ Inhaler In addition, all subjects will be supplied with
      albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol to be used as required to treat asthma symptoms.

      Subjects who have not met the randomization criteria at Visit 2 will be withdrawn from the
      study.

      Subjects meeting the randomization criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups and will attend the clinic for 3 on-treatment visits at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8
      (Visit 4) and Week 12 (Visit 5). Subjects will receive treatment for 12 weeks. A Follow-up
      Visit or Contact (Visit 6) will take place 1 week after completing study medication. All
      clinic visits will take place in the morning. Subjects will participate in the study for a
      maximum of 15 weeks (Screening to Follow-up inclusive). A subject is regarded to have
      completed the study if they complete all phase of the study (Screening, treatment,
      Follow-up).
