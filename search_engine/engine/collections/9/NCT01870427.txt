    
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, investigator-sponsored clinical
      study seeks to investigate the visual outcomes of a treat and extend dosing regimen of
      intravitreal aflibercept injection for macular edema following CRVO. All patients will
      receive IAI 2 mg at baseline and Week 4. If the pre-defined extension criteria are met at the
      4-week visit, and at any follow up visit, the patient will receive a mandated treatment, and
      the next visit will be extended by two weeks. If the extension criteria are not met on a
      follow-up visit, the treatment interval will be continued to be reduced by 1 week. If
      criteria are still not met despite treatment at the reduced interval, treatment will be
      administered as usual and follow up interval will continue to be reduced by 1 week until the
      criteria are met or a 4-week interval is reached. Treatment of IAI is rendered at every
      visit.
