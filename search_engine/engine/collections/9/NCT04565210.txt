      studies have shown positive impact of music exposure such as classical western music,
      lullabies or Quran on pain and physiological parameters of preterm infants in a neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) setting. No such study have explored the effect of oriental music
      which is the main popular music listened to in the Levant and Middle East and North Afrika
      (MENA) region.

      We aim in this study to find out if the oriental music exposure in preterm infants improves
      babies' heart rate variability, physiological parameters and behavior state during their NICU
      stay.
