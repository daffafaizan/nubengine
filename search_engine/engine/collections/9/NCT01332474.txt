    
      1. In each of prospective medical institutions (where BOTOX is expected to be prescribed
           annually to at least 10 juvenile cerebral palsy patients aged 2-year or older), the
           Medical Representative will explain the objectives, subjects and methods of the
           investigation to the prospective investigator (i.e., a physician who will prescribe
           BOTOX and can comply with the protocol of the investigation) and ask for his/her
           participation in the investigation.

        2. When the physician agrees to participate in the investigation, a written agreement will
           be concluded between GSK and the head (e.g. director) of the medical institution prior
           to the start of the investigation.

        3. After the completion of the investigation period, the physician will complete the case
           report form (CRF) for the patients prescribed BOTOX by him/her during the investigation
           period. The information of the patients who developed ADRs will be collected separately
           through the spontaneous ADR reporting system on a daily basis.
