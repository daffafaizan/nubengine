      therapy with the Monarch® system. The study will be conducted at one (1) site in the US.

      The study will evaluate oscillating airflow and oscillating volume induced during therapy
      with the Monarch® system. Subjects will also rate the comfort of the therapy. Patients with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in the study.

      Therapy with the Monarch® system will be delivered using multiple frequency/intensity
      combination settings. The order of settings will be randomized for each study subject. During
      therapy oscillating flow and volume measurements will be obtained for each
      frequency/intensity combination. Following each frequency/intensity combination, subjects
      will respond to a subjective assessment of the comfort of the therapy by rating the comfort
      on a visual analogue scale (VAS).
