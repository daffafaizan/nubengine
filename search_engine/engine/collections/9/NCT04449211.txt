      Radiology Department to have a full CT-scan of both limbs to facilitate the later
      reconstruction. With the contralateral limb CT-scan data, the implant is designed with
      appropriate geometry and structures through online meetings with the scientists of CSIRO,
      Australia. Through this discussion, the supporting guides for the precise osteotomy will also
      be designed and would be 3D-printed later by 3 Dimensional Tech Vision Limited Company
      (Vietnam) with Poly Lactic Acid material. The 3D-printed metal parts will be manufactured
      using Titanium - 6 Aluminum - 4 Vanadium ELI (Extra Low Interstitial) material with Electron
      Beam Melting technology in CSIRO (Australia). Subsequently, the 3D-printed part will undergo
      mechanical tests using the Instron 5500R system (Australia) to validate its required
      mechanical properties. If this metal part cannot fulfill the mechanical requirements, the
      problematic geometry will be revised and re-designed. Another prototype will be 3D-printed
      with the same protocol and be tested until it qualified for the mechanical requirement. When
      the 3D-printed model passes the mechanical test, another 3D-printed metal part with a similar
      design will be manufactured before transferring to 3-Dimensional Tech Vision Limited Company
      (Vietnam) for post-processing, surface finishing, sterilising, packaging, labeling.
      Eventually, the implant will be sent to Cho Ray hospital. The amount of intraoperative blood
      loss and operative time will be recorded.
