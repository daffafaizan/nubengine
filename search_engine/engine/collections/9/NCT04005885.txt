      study compared the clinical performance of two daily disposable test contact lenses
      (somofilcon A and stenfilcon A) when fitted to existing wearers of comfilcon A monthly
      lenses. After a month of re-useable lens wear in the comfilcon A lenses, subjects were
      randomized to wear each daily disposable lens type for one week.
