    
      ACE-Seniors is designed as a single-site trial of four randomly assigned interventions, Tai
      Chi exercise, autobiographical writing, both Tai Chi and autobiography (dual intervention),
      and general health education. Participants are relatively healthy adults aged 70 years or
      older, who are not regular practitioners of Tai Chi or regular writers. They are without
      medical or neurological disorders that would substantially limit the ability to participate
      in study interventions, without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, relatively sedentary,
      able to walk unassisted, and able to score 4 or better on the Short Physical Performance
      Battery. Interventions are administered over a 6 month period of time, with similar exposure
      times among the four groups. The prespecified primary endpoint is derived from a composite
      neuropsychological measure, based on three tests of executive function and three tests of
      episodic memory. The planned sample size is 96 (24 per group). Intention-to-treat analysis
      will include all eligible participants who complete baseline assessments.
