    
      The objective of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-2345
      nonpreserved ophthalmic solution (latanoprost 0.005%) in comparison to Xalatan® (latanoprost
      0.005%) in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH).

      This will be a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, observer-masked study in
      approximately 380 evaluable subjects treated for 84 days. Subjects will have a history of
      POAG or OH and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and will have been adequately controlled
      (IOP ≤ 18 mm Hg) on latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution monotherapy for at least 4 weeks.

      Primary efficacy (IOP) will be assessed in the study eye at each visit by Goldmann
      applanation tonometry at all assessment visits.

      Safety will be assessed at each visit by corrected Snellen Visual Acuity, slit lamp
      examination/anterior chamber cell count and flare and adverse event (AE) collection.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint is the between-group comparison of the mean IOP values at each time
      point at each of the Day 15, 42, and 84 visits.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints include:

        -  Between-group comparison of the mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP measurements at
           all postbaseline visits.

        -  Between-group comparison of the mean change from baseline in IOP measurements at all
           times points at Day 15, Day 42 and Day 84.
