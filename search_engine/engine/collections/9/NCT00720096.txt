      biopsy. Using tissue from a CT guided core biopsy, microarray analysis will be performed to
      help predict which of the two drugs appears to be better suited to individual genomic
      factors. The results will result in being assigned to treatment with either liposomal
      doxorubicin or topotecan.

      Patients who receive liposomal doxorubicin - IV chemotherapeutic treatment will occur 3
      times, 28 days apart, weeks 1,5,and 9. At each of these visits patients will be evaluated and
      have blood work to check their liver tests and electrolytes. Every 8 weeks patients will have
      a radiologic evaluation of their tumor.

      Patients who receive topotecan - IV chemotherapeutic treatment will occur 4 times, 21 days
      apart, weeks 1,4,7, and 10. At each of these visits patients will be evaluated and have blood
      work to check levels of liver tests and electrolytes. Every 8 weeks patients will have a
      radiologic evaluation of their tumor.
