      interaction between us. Vocal cord paralysis causes dysphonia, which interferes with
      communication, causing disruptions towards social activity and daily activities. One of the
      managements for vocal cord paralysis is medialisation and augmentation of the vocal cord
      through injection laryngoplasty. Autologous fat is one of the best fillers that can be used
      in this procedure, but it is highly absorbable and can be reabsorbed very quickly when
      injected to body tissues. Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) is a biomaterial consisting of growth
      factors that are thought to improve fat tissue longevity through increase of adipogenesis and
      angiogenesis. Improvement in fat longevity will improve clinical outcomes after laryngoplasty
      procedure potentially reducing number of repeated injections needed to achieve satisfactory
      resolution to vocal cord paralysis. The study evaluates a combination of PRF and autologous
      microlobular fat compared with autologous microlobular fat alone on laryngoplasty. Subjective
      evaluation was done by using Voice Handicap Index (VHI-30) questionnaire, while objective
      evaluation was conducted via computerized acoustic analysis/Multidimensional Voice Program
      (MDVP), videostroboscopy, and maximum phonation time.
