      multisegmental degenerative disease of the lumbar spine who were suitable to undergo mono- or
      bisegmental ALIF fusion at the level L4/L5 and L5/S1 with a carbon fiber reinforced polymer
      ALIF cage filled with either NH-SiO2 or homologous bone (HB). Patients were followed 12
      months postoperatively. The primary aim was to compare postoperative disability as measured
      by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Secondary aims were to compare postoperative
      radiographic outcomes and differences in pain and quality of life between these groups.
