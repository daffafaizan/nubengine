      challenge in this surgery is to remove the tumour with free margins - R0 resection. Failure
      to achieve R0 resection often leads to recurrence, which is associated with risk of long-term
      suffering, poor quality of life and death for the patients. Achieving R0 resection is most
      difficult in advanced rectal cancer cases, where the tumour is threatening - and sometimes
      even growing into - neighbouring organs.

      Computer navigation-assisted surgery has typically been implemented where extreme surgical
      precision is necessary or in surgical fields with high anatomic complexity. In such settings,
      it contributes to preservation of vital anatomic structures close to the tumour, and ensures
      completeness of resection in cases of malignant disease.

      With this in mind, feasibility of navigation in surgically challenging rectal cancer cases
      will be investigated in this study. If found feasible, navigation could improve surgical
      management for patients who otherwise would not have the possibility of cure.
