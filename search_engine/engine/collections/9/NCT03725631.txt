      disease, non-invasive diagnosis of disease severity in NAFLD is urgently needed. In this
      study, the investigators compared hepatic fibrosis and steatosis using MR imaging and
      transient elastography (TE) and tried to find non-invasive diagnostic marker for NASH and
      advanced fibrosis.

      This is a multicenter prospective study of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. The patients
      were underwent laboratory test, liver biopsy, MRI and TE within 6 months of enrollment. MRI
      examination included MR spectroscopy (MRS), and MR elastography (MRE). TE measured liver
      stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).
