      tests. Reolysin has been studied in over 360 cancer patients to find safe doses that can be
      given and has also undergone testing in combination with docetaxel.

      Docetaxel and pemetrexed have anticancer activity in certain cancers including lung and they
      have been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given
      together with docetaxel or pemetrexed.
