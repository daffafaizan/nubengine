      bowel preparation. During this consultation, the doctor explains to the patient the bowel
      preparation, then gives the patient the prescription with the type of product and a sheet
      explaining the diet without residues.

      The time between this consultation and the colonoscopy is sometimes long. The idea of this
      study is to accompany this information on intestinal preparation with a video that details
      the different stages of intestinal preparation by MOVIPREP. Indeed, studies have in the past
      shown an improvement in the quality of intestinal preparation with the help of better
      information to patients (educational booklet, or smartphone application)
