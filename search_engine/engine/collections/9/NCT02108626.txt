      prolonged use. As such, smoking becomes more heavily based in habit, initiated by cues.
      Craving has been found to be a crucial component of continued smoking and relapse in response
      to various environmental and behavioral cues. Electronic Cigarettes (e-Cigarettes) are new
      smoking products emerging in consumer markets that often mimic conventional tobacco
      cigarettes. E-Cigarettes commonly include a cartridge, a heating element, a puff sensor, and
      a battery. When a user draws on the device, the heating element is activated and the
      cartridge fluid is vaporized. Users then inhale the aerosol containing droplets of the
      vaporized fluid. This study will empirically assess the efficacy of e-Cigarettes in
      alleviating craving by replacing the behavioral component of smoking. Using standardized
      questionnaires, intra-subject changes in cue- and withdrawal-induced craving after smoking an
      e-Cigarette without nicotine will be compared with that after either smoking a conventional
      cigarette, an e-Cigarette with nicotine, or taking a 4mg lozenge.
