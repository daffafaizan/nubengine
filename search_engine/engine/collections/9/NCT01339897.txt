    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study, in at
      least three ascending cohorts. Twenty-four subjects will be enrolled initially in the first
      three cohorts, with up to 40 subjects to be enrolled overall if additional cohorts are
      required to reach the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The cohorts will be enrolled in two
      groups of 4 each with approximately 7 days between groups to conduct safety monitoring
      committee review for approval to proceed to the second group in the cohort. Eight subjects
      will be enrolled per cohort, randomized 3:1 to N6022: placebo. Each subject will undergo
      screening (Day -28 to Day -2) and, if eligible, they will be instructed to begin a
      low-nitrate diet on Day -4. Subjects will return to the clinical site on Day -1, and
      eligibility will be reconfirmed. Eligible subjects will receive a dose of investigational
      medicinal product ([IMP], N6022 or placebo) by intravenous (IV) infusion on study Days 1
      through 7 and will be followed for safety, PK, and PD until discharge on the morning of Day
      8. Subjects will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit on Day 15 (± 1 day) and will be
      contacted via telephone on Day 28 (± 1 day) for the end-of-study safety follow-up visit.
      Participation of an individual subject may last approximately 56 days from the time of
      screening until the end-of-study follow-up visit.

      A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the safety data in each cohort after the Day
      15 Follow-up visit, before proceeding to the next ascending dose cohort, modifying the dose,
      repeating a dose, or stopping the study according to the stopping rules outlined in the
      protocol.
