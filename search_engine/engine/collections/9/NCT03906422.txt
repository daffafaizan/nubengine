      the beginning of treatment, the orthodontist must determine which initial orthodontic
      archwire to insert. Among the more popular choices for initial leveling and aligning of the
      dental arches are small-sized, round-diameter nickel-titanium archwires. Various types of
      nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires exist including stabilized martensitic wires (ie classic
      Nitinol), active austenitic wires (superelastic NiTi) and active martensitic wires
      (thermoelastic NiTi). The efficacy of these wire types has been heavily researched with no
      significant differences in the alignment timing of the dentition (treatment time to reach the
      final archwire). Pain differences from these wires has been inconclusive from conflicting
      past studies. It is of critical importance to determine whether one or more of these
      archwires leads to more discomfort for the patient than the others.
