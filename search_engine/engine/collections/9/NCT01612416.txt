      tissue in which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are injured, leading to the loss of the visual
      field.Recent studies have separately demonstrated a reduction in the macular retinal
      thickness and in the retinal nerve fibers in both POAG and NTG.It has been demonstrated that
      in early stage NTG macular GCC thickness showed a strong correlation with thickness of the
      RNFL. However there have yet to be any reports regarding the comparison of macular thickness,
      ganglion cell complex and retinal nerve fiber layer between POAG and NTG with RS-3000
      RetinaScan at early stage.
