      (at least 50% women). Participants achieving clinically significant weight loss (â‰¥5%)
      following a 3 mo. reduced energy diet and a program of PA (100 min/wk) will be randomly
      assigned to either maintain exercise at 150 min/wk. or increase exercise to 225 min/wk or 300
      min/wk. while consuming a weight gain prevention diet over a 12 mo. period. Exercise will be
      verified (combination of on-site and HR monitor) and EEEx will be measured at 5 mo. intervals
      beginning at mo. 5. In-person behaviorally based clinic meetings will be conducted weekly
      during the 3 mo. weight loss period (-3 to 0 mos.) and during the first 3 mos. of the weight
      regain prevention period. During the final 9 mos. of weight regain prevention, clinics will
      be held bi-monthly using group conference calls. We have not proposed to randomize
      participants to a true control group (i.e. no exercise or diet) following the 3 mo. weight
      loss program as published data indicates significant weight regain in individuals receiving
      no follow-up treatment after weight loss.
