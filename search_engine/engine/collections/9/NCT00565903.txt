      explain important cellular pathways with broad relevance to both sporadic cancers and human
      development. This proposal studies the cancer predisposition syndrome originally described as
      a familial form of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). PPB is a rare, aggressive lung cancer that
      affects young children. Children with PPB and/or their family members are at increased risk
      for a number of rare conditions, including Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors,
      ovarian tumors and nodular hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. In 2009, we mapped a PPB locus
      and identified germline, loss of function mutations in one copy of DICER1 as the genetic
      basis of this syndrome. DICER1 encodes a protein that performs the final critical step in
      maturation of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are an important form of gene regulation. The
      syndrome's varied nature is likely attributable to the various roles of miRNAs during
      different developmental and/or functional circumstances. This study focuses on defining the
      full phenotype of this cancer predisposition syndrome including penetrance, expressivity in
      children and adults, pathologic classification of disease and spectrum of predisposing DICER1
      mutations. Improved understanding of the clinical and genetic features of this cancer
      predisposition syndrome is essential to facilitate early diagnosis when the diseases are most
      curable, and to create genetic counseling and educational materials to guide medical care.
