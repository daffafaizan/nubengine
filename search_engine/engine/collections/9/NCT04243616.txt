      in patients with locally advanced HR+ HER2 negative or triple-negative (TN) breast cancer
      having positive PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 tumor expression will be associated with an increase in
      pathologic complete response of at least 20%.

      Primary Objectives:

      Assess pathologic responses in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cemiplimab.
