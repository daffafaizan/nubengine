      carotid endarterectomy for high or standard risk patients with symptomatic stenosis. Despite
      the routine use of embolic protection devices, numerous studies have shown that carotid
      stenting is associated with a higher degree of intracranial emboli by diffusion-weighted MRI
      of the brain. A potential solution to minimize this effect is the use of aspiration prior to
      distal embolic protection removal.
