      intensive care unit, affecting one third of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for a
      noninfectious reason. In the case of inflammation, iron retention increases in the
      reticuloendothelial system cells; hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis is reduced. It has been reported
      that the ratio of reticulocyte / hemoglobin (Ret-He) decreases in the early period in
      community-acquired pneumonia patients and may be a guide as a marker of inflammation. In
      addition, the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a parameter studied in the hemogram
      panel. It provides a clue to both the presence of infection and the focus of the infection.

      In this study, the utility of changes in the ratio of Ret-He and NLR as an early inflammation
      marker for VAP will be evaluated.
