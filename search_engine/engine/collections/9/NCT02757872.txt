      omega-3 fatty acids, or both prevent the development and progression of kidney disease in
      participants with hypertension. Persons with hypertension are at high risk of kidney disease.

      Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are promising interventions for kidney disease prevention
      and treatment, based on results of animal-experimental models and early human studies.
      Because these interventions are relatively safe, inexpensive, and widely available, they may
      offer opportunity to substantially reduce the burden of kidney disease in large populations.
      This VITAL ancillary study will test whether vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids prevent
      loss of glomerular filtration rate, over 4 years of therapy.

      In VITAL, 25,875 participants have been randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial design to
      vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily versus placebo, and to eicosapentaenoic acid 465
      mg plus docosahexaenoic acid 375 mg daily versus placebo, and followed for a mean of 5 years
      to assess effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer events. This ancillary study will
      identify and recruit a sub-cohort of VITAL participants with hypertension at baseline and
      ascertain effects of study interventions on glomerular filtration rate in this group. Blood
      samples will be collected at year 4 simultaneously for measurement of estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (using serum creatinine and cystatin C) and other relevant biomarkers. This
      VITAL ancillary study is designed to determine whether vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids
      have causal and clinically relevant effects on the development and progression of kidney
      disease in hypertensives.
