      patients will be randomized to ideally have two hundred and twenty five patients in each arm.
      Those who will have traditional paper based instructions and those who will be using an
      online system. Both groups will receive their instructions by the research assistant prior to
      leaving the office after being consented. The paper based instructions will be given as a
      handout and those in the online group will receive their bowel preparation instructions via
      an email sent by a scheduling assistant
