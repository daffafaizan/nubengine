      receptor positive breast cancer in a low-resource setting in a middle-income country
      (Guatemala). Patients will be treated with tamoxifen for four to six weeks, then have an
      on-treatment biopsy to assess Ki-67. If Ki-67 is less than or equal to 10%, the patient will
      continue on tamoxifen for a total of 4 months; if Ki-67 is greater than 10% or there is
      clinical progression, patients will be taken off study. The study will evaluate the
      proportion of patients treated with four months of tamoxifen who undergo definitive surgery
      and the clinical and pathologic response rates.
