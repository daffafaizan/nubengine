      system infection in patients with AIDS. Untreated, the encephalitis is fatal. Standard
      treatment for toxoplasmic encephalitis is associated with serious adverse effects. Thus,
      alternative treatments are needed.

      Patients with toxoplasmosis are given azithromycin at doses starting at the lowest dose for
      the first cohort, an intermediate dose for the second cohort, and a higher dose for the third
      cohort. Subsequent cohorts may receive azithromycin in increased dosage, if needed to
      determine the MTD. All patients also receive pyrimethamine. Folinic acid is also provided for
      as long as patients receive pyrimethamine. Patients are evaluated for clinical response to
      treatment at days 3, 7, and 14, and weekly for 6 weeks. Maintenance treatment with
      azithromycin continues for an additional 24 weeks. Patients who complete the study period
      without relapse or significant toxicity are offered continued therapy by the drug company and
      are followed for survival and relapse on a monthly basis for 1 year. After the MTD is
      determined, a subsequent cohort may be added for special studies.
