      from patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) that are planning to be
      treated with memantine XR-pregabalin combination therapy. The primary objective is to assess
      the efficacy of memantine XR and pregabalin in reducing neuropathic pain as measured by the
      Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-SF). Patients who agree to participate will be asked to
      complete study questionnaires prior to the start of their CIPN treatment and once per week
      for six weeks during their treatment. After this period, patients will be contacted once per
      month for three months to assess interval medical history, concomitant medications, and
      adverse events.
