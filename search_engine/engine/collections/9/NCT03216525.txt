      improving patient outcomes and cost during radical cystectomy and urinary diversion will be
      performed. A randomized trial is necessary to control for all the known and unknown
      confounders associated with instituting this novel intervention into a surgical procedure. We
      will recruit 136 subjects (63 patients in each arm of the study per sample size calculation
      below, plus additional 10 subjects to account for drop outs). A control group will be
      administered a placebo in order to directly compare if the Alvimopan intervention is
      effective.
