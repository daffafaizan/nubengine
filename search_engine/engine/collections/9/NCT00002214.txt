    
      Two separate schedules of S-1153 are administered on this study: single dose (2 dose
      levels/cohorts) and repeated dose administration over 14 days (escalation through 4 dose
      levels/cohorts). All doses are determined by body weight.

      Single-dose study (Cohort 1):

      (4 patients) low-dose po, following a standardized morning meal. (4 patients) low-dose po,
      fasting.

      Single-dose study (Cohort 2), administered during the first 3 levels of the repeated dose
      study and prior to the initiation of the 4th repeated dose level:

      (4 patients): intermediate-dose po, following a standardized morning meal. (4 patients):
      intermediate-dose po, fasted. Following treatment with S-1153, all single-dose patients
      (Cohorts 1and 2) are observed for 21 days.

      Repeated dose (escalation) study:

      All doses are administered for 14 days. Three patients are entered at the starting dose of
      S-1153. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), subsequent 3-patient cohorts are
      entered at 3 escalating doses.

      The last patient at any given dose level must be observed for 21 days prior to entry of
      patient at the next dose. If 1 of the initial 3 patients experiences DLT at a given level, 3
      additional patients will be added at that dose; if no additional toxicity occurs, escalation
      resumes. If 2 or more patients at a given dose exhibit DLT, the previous dose is declared the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 3 additional patients (6 total) are treated at that dose.
