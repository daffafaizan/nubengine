      decrease pain and improve wound healing in patients undergoing vascular or orthopedic
      surgical procedures. The investigators will administer two doses of Anakinra via an injection
      under the skin, one dose one hour before surgery and a second dose on the first postoperative
      day (24 hours after surgery). The investigators will remove fluid from the surgical incisions
      using a small plastic catheter placed under skin during surgery and measure the amounts of
      pain- causing inflammatory mediators. The investigators will also measure the amount of pain
      the participant is experiencing using questions about pain intensity and by gently touching
      the incision to determine sensitivity of the incision site.
