      anatomical measurements on patient preoperative CT-scan by case planners using dedicated
      sizing software; (ii) designing an initial custom device scheme with its positioned
      fenestrations, created by engineers with CAD software using the above cited measurements and
      (iii) validation of fenestrations position by in vitro testing using a SG prototype deployed
      inside a transparent anatomy model (3D-printed model of patient aorta and collateral
      arteries). The main limitations of this process are the costs and long SG delivery time.

      The goal of this study is to compare fenestrations positioning obtained by two different
      processes, the actual one at Vascutek and the one by numerical simulation performed by
      Predisurge company.
