      life. Therefore, successful treatment of depression is crucial in PD patients. Using deep
      brain stimulation as an antidepressant (or to augment a standard antidepressant) could be a
      promising new direction. The hypothesis to be tested in the current project is that treatment
      with deep brain stimulation will improve both the neurological and the psychiatric
      (depressive) symptoms of PD. It is further hypothesized that the improvement in depressive
      symptoms will not be a simple consequence of improvement in neurological status. Data from
      this open label study will form the basis for planning a larger scale controlled trial in
      depressed PD patients and exploratory studies in patients with major depression who do not
      have PD.

      Today, programming of DBS is based on the neurological evaluation of the motor features of
      PD. If our hypothesis is proven, i.e. parameter manipulation of DBS affects the mental
      features of PD, it is crucial to establish a valid database that will enable to study these
      effects. Moreover, such a detailed database will be the basis for the development of a
      computer-assisted decision making protocol for programming of DBS. A novel decision making
      protocol will maximize the benefits of DBS in both depressed and non-depressed PD patients.
