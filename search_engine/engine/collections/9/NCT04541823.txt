      periodï¼Œespecially in elderly patients. It is characterized by cognitive decline, inattention
      and abnormal mental status following surgery. The presence of postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction is independently associated with poor recovery, increased hospital length of stay
      and increased mortality.

      Desflurane is a widely used volatile anesthetic, associated with shorter emergence times than
      other volatile anesthetics. This study aims to access the effect of desflurane in preventing
