      have a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis before the external beam radiation
      therapy.

      For the CT scan, you will be given an enema to empty your bowel, and you will drink about 16
      to 24 ounces of water to fill your bladder

      A rectal balloon will then be inserted into your rectum and filled with either air or water.
      You will then have the CT scan. The CT scan should take about 45 minutes.

      If you agree to take part in this study, very thin (millimeter-sized) radiation detectors
      will be attached to the rectal balloon during each of two CT scans per week you will have
      while you are receiving radiation. You may have additional CT scans (without the detector)
      each week if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      The doses read by the radiation detectors will be compared to the doses that you were
      originally scheduled to receive after each radiation treatment and at the end of the study.

      You will be off study after your final radiation treatment using the rectal balloon.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
