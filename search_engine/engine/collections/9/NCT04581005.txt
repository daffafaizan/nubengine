      under-investigated. This trial aims to explore the effect of prehabilitation over the whole
      perioperative trajectory, including neo-adjuvant treatment (NAT).

      Multimodal prehabilitation includes exercise, nutrition therapy, and mental distress coping
      strategies. In the context of a multimodal approach, the two groups follow different exercise
      prescriptions: high-intensity interval supervised training prescribed accordingly
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)-derived variables, versus a home-based program. For
      both groups, multimodal prehabilitation is prescribed over the whole preoperative period,
      including during NAT.
