    
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, multi-center, placebo-controlled phase III
      clinical trial in adults aged 18~59 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the experimental SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. The
      experimental vaccine and placebo were both manufactured by Sinovac Research & Development
      Co., Ltd. A total of 13.000 subjects will be enrolled. Participant will be assigned to
      receive two doses of experimental vaccine or placebo on the schedule of day 0,14. It is
      planned that the study will be conducted with two separate cohorts. The first cohort will be
      healthcare workers in the high risk group (K-1) and the second cohort will be people at
      normal risk (K-2). After 2 doses of vaccination of 1300 volunteers are completed, safety data
      will be evaluated by the data safety monitoring board without breaking the blinding, and if
      there is no safety issue, the K2 cohort will continue to be vaccinated.1.300 volunteers,
      including 650 volunteers SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and placebo arms, will be included in the K-1
      cohort. In the K-2 cohort (normal risk group for COVID-19), 7.650 volunteers were planned to
      be included in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine group, and 3.500 volunteers in the placebo group.
