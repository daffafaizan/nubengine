        -  To determine the effect of testosterone therapy on lean body mass and muscle strength in
           patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

        -  To determine the testosterone therapy on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with
           advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age and disease stage. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation and placebo
           testosterone intramuscularly (IM) weekly for 7 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation and testosterone
           IM weekly for 7 weeks.

      Patients undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength tests, stable isotope
      metabolic studies, indirect calorimetry studies, and assessment of their physical activity
      level, and nutritional counseling. Patients also complete mood, fatigue, and quality-of-life
      questionnaires.

      Blood, muscle tissue, and urine samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies.
      Samples are analyzed for serum inflammatory biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines by
      immunoassay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
