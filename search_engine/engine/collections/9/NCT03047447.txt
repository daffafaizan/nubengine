    
      Purpose -Assessment of prolonged, physiological, dietary ketosis on pathological processes
      induced by metabolic syndrome (MetS) including a reduction in fasting triglycerides, BMI and
      body fat mass, a significant decrease and/or normalization of HgA1c and an increase in
      resting metabolic rate.

      Design - Qualitative

      Setting - Bristlecone Health, Inc., Maple Grove, Minnesota

      Subjects - 30 adults previously diagnosed with MetS randomly prescribed to one of three
      groups: a sustained ketogenic diet with no exercise, the participant's normal diet with no
      exercise, or participant's normal diet with 3-5 days per week of exercise for 30 minutes.

      Intervention - 10-week diet with controlled glycemic indices provided for ketogenic group;
      other groups maintained normal diet. Baseline triglyceride, HgA1c, VO2 max, body mass index
      (BMI), resting metabolic rate (RMR), blood ketone levels and body fat mass measurements were
      assessed for all three groups at week 0 and week 3, 6 and 10.

      Measures - ANOVA followed by tests pairwise differences using Tukey's HSD correction.

      Analysis - Five of the seven variables for the ketogenic group showed a statistically
      significant difference between week 0 and 10 data points.
