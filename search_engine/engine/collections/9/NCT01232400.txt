      of all stroke related potential years of life lost are from SAH. Outcomes are adversely
      affected by secondary ischemia from cerebral vasospasm, along with cardiac complications.
      Trials performed in patients with SAH have demonstrated benefit after the administration of
      beta blockers - reducing mortality nearly in half; but concerns over diminishing cerebral
      perfusion inhibited the widespread adoption of this therapy. Our specific aims are as
      follows: 1. To evaluate the clinical effect of esmolol treatment on cardiac systolic and
      diastolic function, along with cardiac electrophysiology; 2. To assess the effects of esmolol
      treatment on serum adrenergic and cardiac biomarkers; 3. To explore the safety of esmolol
      shortly after SAH. The primary outcome will be change in systolic function - ejection
      fraction by Simpson's rule (baseline versus Day 7 +/- 2 after SAH).
