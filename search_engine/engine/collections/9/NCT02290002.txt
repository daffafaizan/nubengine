      will be randomly scheduled into two equal groups. In group A, (Calcium Dobesilate group), 1
      cap / 8 hs Doxium ( 500mg) will be given at day of HCG injection and for 3 weeks ; while in
      group B (Coasting group), coasting (withholding gonadotrophins while maintaining pituitary
      suppression) follow up every day by measuring E2 for 3 days then either giving triggering or
      cycle cancellation is done
