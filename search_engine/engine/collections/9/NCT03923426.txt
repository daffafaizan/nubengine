    
      This observational study will include approximately 700 hospitalized patients with a
      gram-negative infection, who have received at least one dose of ceftazidime-avibactam.

      Patients will be recruited in approximately 62 sites across 12 countries in Europe (including
      Russia) and Latin America. Patients will be followed from ceftazidime-avibactam initiation
      until 60 days post hospital discharge, mortality, withdrawal from the study, or
      loss-to-follow-up, whichever occurs first.

      Data will be abstracted from medical records using an electronic case report form (eCRF).
      Baseline data include patient socio-demographics, medical history, and clinical and
      microbiological characteristics of the infection treated.

      Follow-up data will include details of treatment over time and clinical, microbiological, and
      healthcare resource utilization outcomes.

      Evaluation of clinical success will be performed in patients with at least â‰¥72 hours of
      exposure to ceftazidime-avibactam.

      Safety will be evaluated in all patients exposed to at least one dose of the product.
