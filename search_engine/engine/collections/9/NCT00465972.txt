      non-restorative sleep which is associated with diminished daytime function without any
      identifiable underlying cause. This condition is extremely common among HIV infected
      individuals and can lead to significant distress and reduction in the quality of life. The
      mechanisms for disrupted sleep in this population are diverse, including potential direct
      effects of the tat protein upon the sleep centers in the central nervous system. Insomnia has
      been documented to be one of the most common psychiatric disorders in HIV disease, but no
      trial has systematically examined the efficacy of available hypnotic agents, which are
      commonly used in this population.

      Comparison(s): Two commonly prescribed hypnotic agents used for insomnia will be compared to
      placebo over a 6 month treatment study.
