      of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRT) in oligometastatic patients with thoracic nodes
      metastases, medically inoperable, using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of
      this technique is the ability to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumour's target
      while reducing doses to normal tissue, optimizing the therapeutic window.
