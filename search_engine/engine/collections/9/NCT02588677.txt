      inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Masitinib blocks microglia proliferation and
      activation, and mast cell-mediated degranulation, the release of cytotoxic substances that
      might further damage the motor nerves.

      There are two distinct populations of ALS patients: population of "Normal progressors" and
      population of "Faster progressors". Targeted population for primary analysis is population of
      "Normal progressors".

      "Normal progressors" are ALS patients whose progression of ALSFRS-R score before
      randomization is less than 1.1 point per month.
