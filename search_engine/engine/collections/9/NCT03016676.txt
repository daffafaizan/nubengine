      region of the spine between L1 and L5 vertebrae.The HVLA thrust will be performed with the
      patient side lying in a neutral.52 They take part in 12 treatment visits, 10 to 20 minutes
      sessions of SM over 2 weeks. Light soft tissue techniques (i.e., active and passive muscle
      stretching, and ischemic compression of tender points) may be used as needed to facilitate
      the manual therapy.

      The protocol for group B included sets of exercise therapy. There are three components to the
      exercise therapy (ET) program: self education, supervised exercise visits, and home exercise.
      The overall objectives are to help patient's manage their LBP and prevent future LBP
      recurrences. Total number of visits 12 (e.g., ability to perform exercises independently).

      Outcome:

      Patient self-report outcomes will be collected at first baseline visit and its base on the
      pain intensity and quality of life will be assessed by using numerical pain rating scale and
      EuroQol questionnaire. Objective outcome measures will be collected at the first baseline
      visit and its base on postural instability and pressure pain threshold will be assessed by
      using Win track platform and digital algometer.
