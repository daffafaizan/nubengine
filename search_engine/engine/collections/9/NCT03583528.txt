    
      Each subject will have two PET/CT scans, one using 68Ga-DOTATOC and the other using
      18-Fluoride-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). The 68Ga-DOTATOC radioactive tracer is manufactured
      for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada. 18F-FDG is
      considered standard care and has been approved by Health Canada.

      After providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history
      questionnaire.

      Monitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by
      comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC. Twenty-four hours
      after 68Ga-DOTATOC administration the study coordinator will call the patient and see if they
      have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event
      questionnaire found in section 9.6.

      Follow-up Assessments

      The following information will be collected up to 3 years following the PET/CT scans:

        -  Initiation of a new treatment

        -  Laboratory results and pathology reports

        -  Results of imaging studies

        -  Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes

      The study is expected to take approximately 4 years for accrual.
