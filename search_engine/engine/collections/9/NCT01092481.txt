      FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment is not inferior to 6 months of oxaliplatin in modified FOLFOX-6
      or CAPOX treatment in terms of disease free survival in patients with stage II/III colon
      cancer. In addition, we would like to characterize pharmacogenomic profile associated with
      toxicities and gene expression profiling to predict the recurrence of colon cancer as
      parallel study.
