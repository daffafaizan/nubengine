        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral CHS 828 in patients with solid tumors.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine a safe dose of this regimen for phase II evaluation.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any antitumor activity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CHS 828 every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CHS 828 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
