    
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a type of non-invasive brain
      stimulation on the response to a behavioral intervention designed to enhance cognitive
      control over food cravings in obese and overweight women. The brain stimulation is called
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) which is a form of stimulation that delivers a
      low amplitude electrical current to the brain via the scalp (i.e. trans-cranial) to modify
      brain activity.

      All eligible participants will engage in a behavioral intervention (Go-No Go task), known to
      enhance control over food cravings, and will be randomly assigned to receive either tDCS or
      sham stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex of the brain during 8 20-min daily sessions.

      Primary outcome: score changes in eating behaviors scales (YFAS and TFEQ), scales will be
      applied at baseline and at the end of the 8 brain stimulation sessions.

      Secondary outcomes: changes in diet, brain function (brain MRI/MRS) Other outcomes: food
      cravings scales and impulse control scales and cognitive function.
