      non-palliative care physicians, aim 2) as well as healthy clinic patients (aim 3). Since
      these two arms are not randomized, they are not reported here. For additional information on
      the protocol and findings, please contact the PI, Daniel.Matlock@ucdenver.edu or the study
      coordinator, Tarah.Keech@ucdenver.edu.
