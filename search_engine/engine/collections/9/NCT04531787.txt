      the influenza season because vaccine-specific antibody may wane before the end of the
      influenza season. This recommendation was based on only a small amount of data in frail
      elderly individuals, and further examination of the evidence shows that influenza vaccine
      antibody may last much longer. The influenza immunization timing recommendation is now
      changed to immunize when vaccine is available and continue throughout the season.

      These changes led the investigators to the question of duration of influenza vaccine-induced
      antibody in lung transplant patients. No published studies of antibody persistence in this
      population could be found.

      As part of a 5-year study of influenza antibody response in lung transplant patients, in
      patients awaiting lung transplantation, and in healthy controls, serum was obtained before
      and 2-4 weeks after influenza immunization for each season. Therefore, a serum sample was
      collected on each participant approximately 11 months after influenza vaccine administration
      for each of 4 years.

      To investigate duration of influenza antibody titers, antibody concentrations to the previous
      season's vaccine antigens were measured.

      The hypothesis is that immunosuppressed lung transplant patients would maintain protective
      concentrations of influenza antigen-specific antibodies (an antibody titer of at least 1:40)
      beyond the influenza season.
