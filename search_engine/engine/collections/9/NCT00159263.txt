      agonists (LABA) is reported to have superior effects on controlling asthma symptoms to ICS
      alone; however, there is no molecular-based evidence to explain the clinical effects. Here,
      the effect of the ICS/LABA combination was compared with ICS on glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
      activation in sputum macrophage.

      In a randomised, double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled 6-visit study, 10 patients with
      mild asthma were given placebo, formoterol (Oxis(®) 12 μg), budesonide (Pulmicort(®) 200 μg
      :BUD200, or 800 μg :BUD800), or budesonide/formoterol combination (Symbicort(®)) as a single
      100/6 μg (SYM100) or double 200/12 μg (SYM200) dose. Sputum macrophages were separated by
      plate adhesion from induced sputum. GR binding to the glucocorticoid-response elements on
      oligonucleotides (GR-GRE binding) was evaluated by ELISA. mRNA expression of MAP-kinase
      phosphatase (MKP)-1 and IL-8 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.
