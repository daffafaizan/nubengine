      period, followed by 6 to 12 months of patient treatment. Patients will be followed for 1 year
      following completion of study drug treatment. During follow-up, bone marrow biopsies to
      confirm disease status should be obtained if peripheral blood blasts are present or if there
      is development of unexpected blood abnormalities to warrant suspicion of relapse, or at a
      minimum of every 6 months.
