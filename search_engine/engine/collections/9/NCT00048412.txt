      matched sibling transplants and recipients of unrelated or mismatched family donor
      transplants, although both groups will receive identical treatments.

      The following will be given to the patient after admission:

      Day - 6: Total body irradiation

      Day - 5 to - 2: Fludarabine and Campath 1H

      Day - 1: Day of rest

      Day 0: Stem cell transplant (infusion)
