    
      This is a single center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The
      study will consist of two one week treatment periods, one with tiotropium (two
      inhalations/5mcg/day) and one with placebo (2inhalations/day). A minimum two week washout
      period between treatments is required. Four visits over the course of approximately 4 weeks
      will be required to complete the study. Procedures at each visit are as follows:

      Visit 1:

      Participants will undergo consent procedures and if consent is provided measurements of FeNO,
      spirometry, airway responsiveness to methacholine, skin prick testing, skin titration
      endpoint testing and sputum induction will be performed. If participants meet eligibility
      criteria following these assessments, treatment 1 will be dispensed and the first dose
      administered. The participant will then self administer the treatment for the next six days
      (i.e. a total of 7 days of treatment) before returning for Visit 2.

      Visit 2:

      A final dose of treatment 1 will be administered. At 30 minutes post dose, FeNO testing,
      spirometry measurements and allergen inhalation challenge will be performed. Five hours after
      the allergen challenge, FeNO will again be measured and sputum induction will be performed.

      Visits 3 and 4:

      Visits 3 and 4 will be identical to Visit 1 and 2 except that no skin prick testing or skin
      titration endpoint testing will be required. At Visit 3 participants will be crossed over to
      treatment 2 and the first dose will be administered. Participants will self administer
      treatment 2 for the next six days before returning for Visit 4.

      The primary endpoint will be the EAR PD20, the amount of allergen required to induce an early
      asthmatic response (i.e. a fall in FEV1 post allergen inhalation of 20% or more) tiotropium
      versus placebo.
