      into two groups: complete and incomplete internal fistulas of the rectum. Patients of the
      first group will undergo preoperative examination in the framework of transrectal ultrasound
      in B-mode, three-dimensional reconstruction of the image with a contrast of the fistula
      course with a solution of 1.5% hydrogen peroxide. Patients with incomplete internal fistulas
      of the rectum will also undergo transrectal ultrasound examination in B-mode and with
      three-dimensional image reconstruction. The results obtained in the two groups will be
      compared with the intraoperative revision.
