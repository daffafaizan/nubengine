      studies exist demonstrating vaccine efficacy in this population. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, lower than normal humoral responses have been shown with the
      tetanus toxoid booster, oral cholera, and influenza vaccinations. It is currently uncertain
      whether women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of cervical
      dysplasia and cancer. Gardasil, a vaccine against human papilloma viruses (HPV) 6, 11, 16,
      and 18, has been approved for the prevention of cervical dysplasias and cancers in women ages
      9-26 years. However, its immune response in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients is
      unknown.

      Young women with inflammatory bowel disease who have not received the HPV vaccine will
      receive the vaccine. The vaccine is given in 3 doses over 6 months. Response to the vaccine
      will be measured 6 months after completing the vaccine series.
