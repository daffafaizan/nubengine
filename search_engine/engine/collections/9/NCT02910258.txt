      or sub-cutaneous drugs in order to reduce clinical symptoms and biological abnormalities
      belonging to these diseases.

      Pegylated-interferon is one of the better weapons that can be used in these cases. These
      treatments are well known and used from many years in french hematological centres.

      The investigators to collect clinical and biological data from patients treated with
      pegylated-interferon Î±2a (the most use) in case of PMF/SMF in order to assess efficacity and
      tolerance to this drug. The prescription of the product and the dose are under the
      responsibility of each practician.

      Clinical data collected: disease and patients characteristics at the time of diagnosis and at
      the beginning of the drug use, spleen and liver size, presence of constitutive symptoms,
      transfusion needs.

      Biological data collected: complete hemogram, CD34+ cells count, allele burden of JAK2V617F
      and calreticulin clones if DNA samples are collected.

      These data will be collected avery 3 months during the two first years and every 6 months
      after.

      The investigators also recorded adverse side effects if significative, the concomitant use of
      hematological drugs (cytoreductive treatments, ASE...), modalities of prescription of the
      drugs and the reason for stopping the drug and etiology of death if happened.
