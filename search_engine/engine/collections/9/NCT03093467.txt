      depression treatment and to improve the quality of those services. The acknowledgment of the
      complexity and chronicity of the disorder has motivated the design and implementation of
      comprehensive disease management strategies for depression. There are experiences that show
      that information technologies can help to optimize the management of depression. If ASCENSO
      is effective, it could be a useful resource to include to the mental health services for
      depression in Chile.

      The components of the ASCENSO program are:

      Emergency. Standard Information on what to do and who to contact in a crisis situation.

      Online or phone counseling. Patients can schedule a 30-minute session with a psychologist,
      which is conducted in a private text chatroom or over the phone.

      Monitoring. Patients receive a bi-weekly email with a link to the monitoring questionnaire
      and automatized tailored feedback message. If a participant reports severe impairment, the
      ASCENSO administrator receives an alert notification and then contacts the patient.

      Self-care information and blog. Web pages with basic information about depression and
      self-care recommendations.
