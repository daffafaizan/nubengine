      differences with various pathologies and age-related changes in breast tissue over a two year
      period. In the present study, we want to determine whether OBS has the ability to detect
      optical differences between women who harbor a mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility
      gene, BrCa1 or BrCa2, and their age-matched controls (non-carriers). More specifically,
      possible differences in the breast tissue at time of enrollment into the study (reflecting
      changes potentially occurring in adolescence) and in the rate of breast tissue change over
      time (reflecting rate of tissue transformation from normal to ultimately malignant state).
      The overall goal is to develop a pre-screening technique to survey or monitor the risk of
      breast tissue and to advise the earliest point when imaging techniques (e.g. MRI) should be
      initiated or when more drastic primary prevention measures are recommended.
