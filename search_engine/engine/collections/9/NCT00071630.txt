      children's lives. Evidence suggests that CBT can benefit children with anxiety disorders, but
      the causal mechanisms between therapy and beneficial outcomes have not been thoroughly
      investigated.

      Audio and videotaped sessions of children currently receiving CBT and those who received CBT
      in previous trials will be examined. Various rating scales will be used to rate therapeutic
      alliance, child involvement, and therapist flexibility for each session of CBT. To evaluate
      potential process variables that contribute to participant drop-out, this study will compare
      the early process variables for children who complete treatment and for those who discontinue
      treatment.
