      reeducation in autistic children at a CAM university health center with regard to the
      following:

        1. To measure the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy for the autism
           spectrum disorders

        2. To measure the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy and neuromuscular
           reeducation for the treatment of the autism spectrum disorders

        3. To begin to establish or debunk debated SMT treatment for autism

        4. To evaluate, gauge, and improve current autism assessment tools by exploring face
           validity of the measures as indicated by ongoing data collection
