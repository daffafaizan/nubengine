      document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of the combined
      therapy using irreversible electroporation（IRE）and nature killer（NK） cells for advanced
      pancreatic cancer.

      The efficacy will be evaluated according to relief degree,progress free survival(PFS) and
      overall survival(OS).
