    
      Methylation detection of circulating free DNA and FFPF samples from patients with ovarian
      endometriosis, ovarian cancer and other benign ovarian cysts will be performed to select
      markers for ovarian endometriosis diagnosis. The markers will be validated in patients with
      ovarian cysts found by ultrasound. The diagnosis accuracy of the markers will be evaluated by
      comparing with the pathological diagnosis.
