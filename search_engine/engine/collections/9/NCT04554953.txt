    
      This study is designed as a non-interventional, multicenter, prospective observational study
      for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. If a patient voluntarily provides written
      consent to provide information for this study, the enrollment number will be assigned to
      subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and follow-up will be conducted for
      approximately 12 weeks. Pre-specified study-related data will be collected in the case report
      form during the observation period.

      This is an observational study, and the number or interval of subjects' visits to the
      hospital is determined by the investigators' clinical judgment under actual medical
      circumstances in principle. Whether to participate in this study will not affect the
      patients' treatment (physician's prescription or diagnostic, therapeutic decisions).

      The follow-up time points specified below indicate the time points of data collection. That
      is, the schedule of subjects' visits is freely determined by the investigators based on the
      medical condition of the subjects regardless of the follow-up time points specified in this
      protocol, but data that are generated during the study period and are deemed necessary in
      relation to the study may be collected in the case report form.
