      anti-anxiety, sedation, and modest analgesic effects. In a retrospective cohort study of
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, perioperative dexmedetomidine administration was
      associated with decreased risk of 1-year mortality. Theoretically, perioperative
      dexmedetomidine may exert the following favorable for cardiac surgery patients: (1) reduces
      perioperative opioid consumption and thereby mitigates opioid-induced immunosuppression, (2)
      dampens hyper-inflammatory response induced by surgery, and (3) improves postoperative sleep
      quality. However, prospective studies investigating the long-term effects of perioperative
      dexmedetomidine in cardiac surgery patients are still lacking.

      In a previous randomized controlled trial, 285 patients of 60 years or older who were
      scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery and/or valve replacement surgery
      were randomized to receive either perioperative dexmedetomidine administration (0.6
      microgram/kg in 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion at
      a rate of 0.4 microgram/kg/h until the end of surgery, then a continuous infusion at a rate
      of 0.1 microgram/kg/h until the end of mechanical ventilation) or placebo (normal saline,
      administered in the same rate or volume for the same duration as in the dexmedetomidine
      group). The results showed that perioperative dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of
      pulmonary complications and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation after surgery.

      The purpose of this 2-year follow-up study is to investigate the effects of perioperative
      dexmedetomidine on the long-term outcomes in elderly patients after cardiac surgery.
