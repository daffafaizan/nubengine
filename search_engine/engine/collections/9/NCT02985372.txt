    
      All patients were treated with decitabine of 15 mg/ m2 intravenously over 4h for 5
      consecutive days (day 1-5) for priming combined with cytarabine of 10 mg/m2 q12h for 10 days
      (day 4-13).

      Hydroxyurea was permitted as rescue medication if white blood count (WBC) was >20×109/L and
      but was discontinued at least 24h before decitabine treatment.

      Supportive care including blood product transfusions, G-CSF, antiemetic medications,
      antiviral and antifungal medications, or empiric antibiotics may be used at the clinical
      discretion of the investigator.

      Curative effect was evaluated after two cycles:

        1. <5% blast in the marrow, enter into maintenance therapy (Group A)

        2. ≥5% blast in the marrow, continue induction therapy two cycles,

           ① <5% blast in the marrow, enter into maintenance therapy (Group B);

           ② ≥5% blast in the marrow, dropped out of the study (Group C)

        3. marrow blast decline <60%, dropped out of the study (Group C).

      Maintenance therapy regimen:

        1. Ara-C 1g/m2/d iv drip d1-4 1 cycle

        2. DEC 15mg/m2/d iv drip d1-5 1 cycle
