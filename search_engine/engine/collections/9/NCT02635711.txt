      skeletal development and motor proficiency in pre-pubertal children with developmental
      coordination disorder (DCD).

      Hypothesis: The TKD group participants will have improved skeletal development and motor
      proficiency outcomes after adapted TKD training compared with the controls.

      Design and subjects: In this prospective, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial,
      approximately 104 children with DCD (6-9 years old) will be randomly assigned to either the
      adapted TKD group (n~52) or the control group (n~52).

      Interventions: Subjects in the intervention group will receive adapted TKD training for 3
      months (one supervised session/week plus daily home training, 1 hour per session), while
      subjects in the control group will receive no TKD training during the study period.

      Study instruments and outcomes: Primary outcome measures: delay in skeletal development and
      motor proficiency will be measured by an ultrasonic bone age system and the Movement
      Assessment Battery for Children, respectively. Secondary outcome measures: eye-hand
      coordination and standing balance will be measured by a computerised finger pointing test and
      the Sensory Organisation Test, respectively (pre-, post- and follow-up measurements).

      Data analysis: Data will be analysed via repeated-measure analysis of (co)variance followed
      by post-hoc tests, if appropriate (alpha = 0.05).

      Expected results: Based on the results of our pilot study, the investigators expect that the
      subjects in the adapted TKD group will have improved skeletal development and motor
      proficiency outcomes after TKD training compared with the controls.
