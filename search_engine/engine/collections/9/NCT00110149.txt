      Primary

        -  Determine 12-week overall and complete response rate in patients with indolent
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan as
           first-line treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Determine 1-year event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to progression and time to next antilymphoma therapy in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the molecular response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the hematological and non-hematological toxicity of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV followed, no more than 4 hours later, by indium In 111
      ibritumomab tiuxetan (for imaging) IV over 10 minutes on day 1. If biodistribution is
      acceptable, patients receive rituximab IV followed, no more than 4 hours later, by a single
      dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 7, 8, or 9 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weeks 6, 10, and 14, every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
