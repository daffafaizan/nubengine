    
      This is a Phase II Study of Tarceva plus Temodar during and following radiation therapy in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and gliosarcoma. The efficacy and
      safety profile of Tarceva in combination with radiation therapy plus Temodar will be studied.
      In addition, correlations between response to treatment and epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) status as well as other molecular markers of tumor prior to treatment will be
      explored. Patients will be stratified according to enzyme inducing anti epileptic drug
      (EIAED) use. Group A (not on EIAEDs) will take 100 milligrams (mg) Tarceva/day during
      radiotherapy and start with a dose of 150 mg Tarceva/day two weeks after radiotherapy. Group
      B (on EIAEDs) will take 200mg Tarceva/day during radiotherapy and start with a dose of 300 mg
      Tarceva/day two weeks after radiotherapy. Both groups will take 75 mg/m^2 Temodar/day during
      radiotherapy and 200 mg/m^2 Temodar/day x 5 two weeks after radiotherapy. Intrapatient
      Tarceva dose escalation may occur every two weeks after radiotherapy until the appearance of
      a particular rash severity. The maximum dose allowed is 200 mg for group A and 500 mg for
      group B.
