    
      Two-stage Phase 2 study in 3 separate gynecological cancer cohorts, with an additional set of
      participants in the ovarian cohort randomized into 2 different treatment regimens. The study
      is divided between a Primary Treatment Phase and a Maintenance Phase with each phase
      supported by a separate database.

      Part 1 - Three parallel cohorts of participants with ovarian (Cohort A), endometrial (Cohort
      B), or cervical (Cohort C) carcinoma were enrolled.

      Part 2 - Based on the observed tolerability and efficacy profile in the ongoing ovarian
      cohort (Cohort A), 2 additional treatment schedules will be explored to optimize the dosing
      schedule in a participant population with ovarian carcinoma.
