    
      This is a two-part protocol. This protocol is for Part A, the specific aims of which are to:

        1. Determine the optimal dose (21 mg or 14 mg) and duration (24 hours or 16 hours) of
           nicotine replacement using the nicotine transdermal delivery device for African-American
           pregnant women who smoke, and

        2. Determine the implications of the nicotine replacement studies for treatment with the
           nicotine replacement patch of African-American women who smoke during pregnancy.

      Additional aims are to:

      1. Collect DNA for exploratory analyses regarding genetic causes of differences in metabolism
      of nicotine and cotinine.

      Latina/Hispanic women will not be included in this study because a) few smoke, and b) few are
      seen in the clinical sites from which participants will be recruited.
