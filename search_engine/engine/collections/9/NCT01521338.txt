    
      -  Blood Collection: Blood will be collected to be kept for research in the future and to
           measure the number of blood cells called neutrophils. A small needle will be used to
           collect blood from a vein in your arm. About 7-9 teaspoons of blood would be collected.

        -  Sweat Collection: Your sweat will be collected with a special sweat collection machine
           to test the amount of salt in your sweat.

        -  Spirometry: You will be asked to take a test that measures how well your lungs are
           working. You will be asked to take a deep breath and then blow into a mouthpiece as hard
           as possible and for as long as possible. This is the same test that is done when you
           come to clinic.

        -  Urine Collection: Urine will also be collected to be kept for research in the future.
           You will be asked to pee in a cup.

      â€¢ Induced Sputum Collection: If you say "yes" to collecting a sputum sample, you will be
      asked to breathe in a salt water solution to help you cough out sputum. If you cannot breathe
      in the salt water solution to cough out sputum for the last study visit, you will be asked to
      cough mucus into a cup
