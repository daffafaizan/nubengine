    
      At the initial session, consent will be obtained and eligibility will be determined.

      Eligible participants will undergo a structural MRI as part of the screening process, then be
      randomized and have 5 consecutive daily, 40 minute stimulation sessions.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: sham stimulation,
      individualized alpha-tACS (usually 8-12 Hz), or individualized theta-tACS (individualized
      alpha frequency minus 4 Hz). Participation will include 1 to 11 visits.

      Neurophysiological measures will be taken before and after the stimulation sessions on the
      first and fifth days of the intervention, as well as the 2-week follow-up and 4-week
      follow-up visits. Psychiatric clinical assessments will be performed at baseline (Day 1 of
      stimulation), Day 5 of stimulation, and at both follow-up visits using the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Inventory of
      Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), and the Comparative Pain Scale Chart. All
      participants will also complete 2 blood draws and cheek swabs to assess for the presence of
      Bartonella spp. bacteria.

      Participants will also be asked to complete self-report surveys via REDCap at a 3-month time
      point measured from completion of the intervention.
