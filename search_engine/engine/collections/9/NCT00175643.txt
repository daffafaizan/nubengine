      keratoses on the head to reduce the size of lesions. The objective is to analyze the effect
      of dose cycling with respect to the complete clearance rate when imiquimod 5% cream is
      applied 3 times per week for 4 weeks in 1 or 2 cycles. The complete clearance rate is defined
      as the proportion of subjects with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area at
      the end of cycle 1 or the end of cycle 2.
