      compare time to determine LTBI status in patients in clinics using QGIT and TST and those
      with TST only. The investigators will take advantage of the excellent HIV services provided
      in South Africa and link QGIT with CD4 blood collection and provide the first evidence of an
      operational comparison between QGIT and TST in HIV-infected patients in a country that
      accounts for one-third of the HIV-related TB in the world. The QGIT study will contribute to
      the understanding of QGIT performance and implementation in HIV-infected individuals. Careful
      evaluation of the implementation and operational aspects of the program will provide useful
      knowledge for future scale-up in this and other HIV clinic settings.
