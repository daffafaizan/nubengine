      building residents in select low-income senior apartments. The eligibility criteria include a
      self-report of one or more falls in the preceding 12 months, a fear of falling, or
      unsteadiness while standing or walking. The investigators will screen residents and determine
      their risk for falling. Residents who are high risk will be referred to licensed occupational
      therapy practitioners for baseline assessments and home hazard removal. Residents will be
      re-assessed at 3 months. All assessments will be conducted in the residents' apartment
      buildings. Outcomes (falls, program evaluation) will be collected by our community partner.
