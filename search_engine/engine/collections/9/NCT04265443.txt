    
      Patients who diagnosed significant coronary artery disease and treated by 2nd generation DES
      with post-PCI physiologic evaluation would be enrolled.

      Invasive physiologic assessment including recording of resting pressure trecing would be
      required at the baseline and at the end of index PCI procedure. PCI procedure would be
      performed upon local routine. Any available 2nd generation DES could be used. Web-based
      electronic-case record form (CRF) system will be used for collecting data. All data will be
      handled and analyzed by blind fashion at independent core lab. 2-year clinical outcome after
      index procedure will be analyzed.
