    
      The primary goal of the current study is to determine the effect of combination therapy
      targeting phenotypic traits on OSA severity. Specifically, the investigators will assess the
      effect of combination pharmacological therapy on OSA severity as measured by the
      apnea-hypopnea index and the arousal index (co-primary outcome variables).

      The investigators will also estimate the effects of the interventions on the physiological
      traits responsible for OSA using polysomnography, namely:

        -  Pharyngeal anatomy and its propensity towards collapse

        -  The ability of the upper airway dilator muscles to activate and reopen the airway during
           sleep (i.e. neuromuscular compensation)

        -  Arousal threshold from sleep (i.e. the propensity for hypopneas/apneas to lead to
           arousal and fragmented sleep).

        -  Stability of the ventilatory control system feedback loop (i.e. loop gain). Baseline
           traits will be used to examine whether patient characteristics influence the responses
           to each combination of interventions (i.e. muscles, muscles plus loop gain, muscles plus
           arousal threshold).
