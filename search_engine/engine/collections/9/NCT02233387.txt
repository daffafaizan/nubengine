      tumor cells are usually more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and more likely to
      develop metastasis. In Cervix cancer, tumor hypoxia is known to be an important prognostic
      factor for long term survival. [18F]HX4 is being developed as a diagnostic
      radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging to find a marker for hypoxia that can be used in standard
      clinical practice. Current hypoxia tracers lack reliable image quality and kinetics. Because
      of the short half life and clearance, the investigators expect that [18F]HX4 will have a
      higher tumor to background ratio than current nitro-imidazole hypoxia markers such as
      [18F]-misonidazole. In a recent phase 1 clinical study from van Loon et al, PET-imaging with
      [18F]HX4 was feasible without any toxicity. The clinical use of a reliable, non-invasive and
      easy to use hypoxia imaging agent could allow selection of patients most likely to benefit
      from hypoxia modifying therapies.
