      chemotherapy at the hospital day care for an adjuvant breast cancer. The tracking of the
      eligible patient will be done during the registration for the schedule.

      The filling of the questionnaires will occur at the 4 first courses (C1 to C4). The Touch
      Massage will be offered for the 3 first courses of chemotherapy (C1 to C3). The patient can
      refuse the TM but she will have to fill the questionnaires.

      At each moment, the patient can withdraw from the study, the TM can be offered according to
      the availability of the team and of the choice of the patient during the course of
      chemotherapy.

      The questionnaire collection will be done in the patient's room. The quality of life will be
      evaluated based on the questionnaires EORTC, QLQ C30 and BR23 at C1 and C2. The evaluation of
      the quality of life at the fourth course will allow to estimate the quality of life after 3
      complete courses of chemotherapy. Alongside, the anxiety will be evaluated with the anxiety
      scale STAI from C1 to C3, when the patient just arrives in the service and before she leaves.
      At the fourth course, the questionnaire will be filled only at the arrival.

      After the filling of the questionnaires, the patient will be seen by the medical doctor of
      the service and the nurse who will take charge of her for the chemotherapy.

      According the availability of the service, the patient will receive the TM if she wants. A
      member of the nursing staff formed to the TM (formation dispensed to the ICO) will perform
      the TM. It will be done during the chemotherapy, during the perfusion of ENDOXAN, which takes
      an hour. The TM will last 20 minutes. In this way, the TM will not delayed, prolonged and
      disturb the treatment. At C4, there will not be a TM.
