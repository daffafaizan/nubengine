    
      This was a PII single-arm design to determine whether the regimen looked promising for
      further study.

      Primary Objective

      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of an alternating regimen of Rituximab-Bendamustine and
      Rituximab-Cytarabine (RB/RC) using the CR/Cru rate.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess safety.

        -  To estimate the rate of complete remission (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), partial remission
           (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD).

        -  To estimate the rate of successful stem cell mobilization after RB/RC in responding
           patients.

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients who can successfully complete the regimen and
           proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

        -  To estimate the rate of neutrophil and platelet engraftment after ASCT.

        -  To estimate the CR/CRu and PR rate for patients with blastoid variant MCL.

        -  To estimate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity at treatment
           completion.
