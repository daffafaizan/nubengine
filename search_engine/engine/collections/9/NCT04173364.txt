    
      It's a prospective monocentric randomized controlled clinical trial in 2 parallel groups in
      double blind.

      the study concerns patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery with ISB. The study
      seeks to show that interscalene injection of a small volume (<8ml) of ropivacaine at a low
      concentration (0.1%) reduces the frequency of hemi-diaphragmatic paresis compared to low
      volume injection at the standard concentration (0.5%) in patients undergoing arthroscopic
      shoulder surgery with ISB.

      Randomization in one of the two arms:

        -  Experimental group: <8ml ropivacaine 0.1%.

        -  Control group: <8mL of ropivacaine 0.5%.

      Evaluation of diaphragmatic stroke by ultrasound and ventilatory function by spirometry and
      snip test before performing the ISB, then after installation of the ISB.

      Performing the surgical procedure under general anesthesia assessment of postoperative
      analgesia and patient satisfaction during the following 48 hours.
