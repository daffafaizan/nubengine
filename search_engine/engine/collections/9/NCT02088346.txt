      stroke patients was extremely low in China. It has been demonstrated that telestroke may help
      to increase the rate of intravenous thrombolysis and improve the stroke care quality in the
      local hospitals. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      decision making of intravenous thrombolysis via telemedicine consultation system for acute
      ischemic stroke patients in China This trial network consists of one hub hospital (Xijing
      Hospital) and 14 spoke hospitals in the remote area of Shanxi Province. The telemedicine
      consultation system is an interactive, 2-way, wireless, audiovisual system based on portable
      hardwares--tablet computer or smartphone. Before this study, we have been investigating the
      usual stroke care quality in the spoke hospitals without the guidance from the hub hospital,
      which will be used as the historical control of this study. After that, the teleconsultation
      system will be introduced.
