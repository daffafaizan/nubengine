      Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and is a
      mediator to the development of hyperparathyroidism and mineral bone disorder. Phosphate is
      usually obtained by food intake, and it can be removed by hemodialysis. However, the efficacy
      of removal is limited, so that dietary education and proper intake of phosphate binder is
      essential.
