    
      The aim of this clinical study is to compare the benefits and complications after minimally
      invasive spinal procedures in patients with acute lumbosacral radicular syndrome caused by a
      herniated disc compressing the spinal neural structures.

      The study only works with patient data provided by the outpatient clinic for research
      analysis in the EPCS IV clinical study. All patient data are encrypted during collection and
      evaluation during the study, and stored in an encrypted database. The data will be evaluated
      by an independent institution - The Institute of Measurement of the Slovak Academy of
      Sciences.
