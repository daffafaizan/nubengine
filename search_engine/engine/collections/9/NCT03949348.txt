      affect quality of life. Some clinical trials reported that the lifetime risk of a woman
      undergoing surgery for SUI is increase in up to 15%. The midurethral synthetic sling is the
      most common surgery performed for female SUI. This procedure has high efficacy and low
      perioperative morbidity.

      Although many clinical trials have demonstrated that synthetic mid-urethral slings are safe,
      effective and recommended by several guidelines (e.g. Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic
      Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction/American Urogynecologic Society and American Urologic
      Association), the safety and efficacy of surgery for SUI using mesh devices has been
      questioned by a community of patients and clinicians. After Food and Drug Administration
      notification on mesh use in pelvic surgery, many patients and providers begin to search of
      different surgery without synthetic mesh alternatives in SUI. Recently, female patients in
      England formed the campaign group "Sling the Mesh" to protest the synthetic mesh.

      Several options such as the autologous pubovaginal sling, biologic grafts, or urethral
      bulking agent injection have some problems related to morbidity or efficacy. The autologous
      pubovaginal urethral sling is associated with a higher risk of postoperative voiding
      dysfunction.

      The investigators aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an autologous transobturator
      urethral sling to avoid the related problems of synthetic mesh placement and the increased
      rate of voiding dysfunction with pubovaginal sling placement.
