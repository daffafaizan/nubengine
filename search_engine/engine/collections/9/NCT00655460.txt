      least 4 adult and at least 4 pediatric ICUs and if necessary we will modify the bedside tool.
      The computerized bedside tool will be considered refined if >90% of the generated
      instructions are accepted and if the percent of glucose values in the 70-110 mg/dl range are
      equivalent to our pilot experience rate of 55%, and if the rate of glucose values less than
      or equal to 40 mg/dl is less than 0.5% of glucose measurements.
