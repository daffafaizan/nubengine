    
      Multicentre, multidisciplinary (3 gastroenterology units; biostatistics department;
      cooperation with general practitioners), prospective study is focused on examination of
      individuals with average colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (asymptomatic, age 50-75 years).

      In years 2017 - 2019, there will be 230 persons with positive semi-quantitative
      immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (FIT; QuikRead, Orion Diagnostica Oy, Finland) with
      cut-off level 75 ng/ml involved. Every person will be examined by second generation colon
      capsule endoscopy (CCE2) and optical colonoscopy afterwards.

      Main objective is to show that the negative predictive value (NPV) of the CCE2 applied in
      patients with positive FIT results is sufficient to include this method in the National CRC
      screening as filter test with aim to reduce the necessity of subsequent optical colonoscopy.
