      Canada. A total of approximately 60 physician practices will be stratified into single (1
      PCP) or group (>1 PCP) practices and randomized 1:1 into two arms each consisting of
      approximately 30 Primary Care practices forming the Interventional arm and the Control arm.
      The study population will include approximately 600 male and female adult participants living
      in Canada; who have been diagnosed with T2D; who are being treated for this condition by
      their PCP; who do not have clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whose eGFR is ≥
      60ml/min; who are receiving metformin at a dose of ≥1500 mg/day as monotherapy for T2D; who
      are not at the target for glycemic control and whose most recent A1C level is between 7.1 %
      and 9.0 %. Participant enrollment may be adjusted to ensure balanced distribution of glycemic
      values at entry across this range between study arms.

      All physicians in both arms will receive training on the most current Diabetes Canada 2018
      Guidelines for pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes and the role of DPP-4 inhibitors
      or SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy to metformin. Physicians in the Interventional arm will
      receive additional training on specific individualized management for adding DPP-4 inhibitors
      or SGLT2 inhibitors to metformin. The nature of the additional training will be described
      separately in a physician training manual. To avoid contamination, only physicians who have
      been randomized to the Interventional arm will be given access to the physician training
      manual during the operation of the study, while those physicians randomized into the Control
      arm will continue to follow their routine clinical practice for utilizing DPP-4 inhibitors or
      SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on to metformin according to the current Diabetes Canada Practice
      Guidelines.
