      gainful employment as well as forge and sustain meaningful social relationships. Current
      antipsychotic medications are largely ineffective in treating these symptoms. The proposed
      protocol aims at utilizing Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) and cognitive behavioral
      training to enhance core perceptual impairment in marking time that may contribute to both
      social and nonsocial cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

      Cognitive behavioral training along the line investigators propose has no reported adverse
      effects.The transdirect current stimulation (tDCS) is a very safe method with encouraging
      results in previous works in which no severe adverse events where found. There are a few
      minor side effects including skin irritation, a phosphene at the start of stimulation,
      nausea, headache, dizziness, and itching under the electrode. A recent study of over 500
      subjects using the currently accepted protocol reported only a slight skin irritation and a
      phosphene as side effects. Patients can benefit from a significant improvement of invalidant
      symptoms but also of their quality of life. To ensure safety, patients will be accompanied
      throughout the protocol by professionals trained in the management of their disease. Besides
      the protocol procedure, patients will be supported, in all centers, according to the
      international recommendations in terms of safety and practice. Patients receiving placebo
      procedure after randomization will pursue pharmacological treatment and usual health care.
