      include lifestyle modifications, insulin sensitizers, vitamin E, antioxidants and
      cytoprotective agents. Glitazones are insulin sensitizing drugs and act by stimulating the
      PPAR gamma receptors. The drugs like Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone have shown conflicting
      results in the NAFLD trials. Dual PPAR stimulators (PPAR gamma and PPAR alfa) are known as
      the "Glitazars" and are useful in simultaneously controlling the hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia
      and insulin resistance. Saroglitazar is the first drug approved in the investigators country
      for the management of diabetic dyslipidemia. The investigators plan to study the efficacy of
      this drug in comparison to Pioglitazone in patients of NAFLD over a period of 24 weeks.
