      into 2 groups. In one group after the stapling and section of the stomach with stapling
      devices (EndoGIA, Covidien, USA), a staple line inversion with hemostatic and aims will be
      performed. Staple line inversion will be performed with a running suture of Polypropylene
      2/0. In the second group, the gastric section will be performed with a stapler with preloaded
      buttress material (EndoGIA with reinforced reload, Covidien, USA).

      Postoperative nausea and vomits during the first 24 hours after surgery will be investigated.
