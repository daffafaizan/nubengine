      Vorinostat is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

      Study Drug Dose Level:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will begin receiving
      vorinostat. The dose you receive will be based on how many participants have been enrolled
      before you, and on the safety data available. The first group of 3 enrolled participants will
      be given low doses of vorinostat. If no intolerable side effects occur, the next group of 3
      will be enrolled at a higher dose level. The study doctor will tell you what dose you will be
      receiving and how it compares to the doses other participants have received. Up to 3 dose
      levels will be tested.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On each day that you receive radiation, you will take vorinostat (as a capsule taken by
      mouth) in the morning with food.

      Radiation:

      You will receive radiation once a day on Monday through Friday, except for holidays. This
      schedule will be continued for 5 1/2 weeks or 28 doses total. Each radiation treatment will
      usually last about 10-15 minutes.

      Surgical Evaluation:

      After completing radiation therapy, you will come back for a follow-up visit about 6-12 weeks
      later.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for up to 5 1/2 weeks. You will be taken off-study early if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available. The
      use of vorinostat for pancreatic cancer and in combination with radiation is investigational.
      At this time, this combination is being used in research only.

      Up to 37 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
