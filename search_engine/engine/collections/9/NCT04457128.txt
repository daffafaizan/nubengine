      intervention for men and women living in Alabama and determine its feasibility, acceptance,
      and limited efficacy. Community-based Participatory Research methods will be used to adapt an
      evidence-based curriculum. The adapted curriculum will be delivered via print-based materials
      and a mobile phone app developed by an external collaborator.
