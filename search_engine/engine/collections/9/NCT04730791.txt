      short hypothetical scenarios of patients with chronic pain. The vignettes will feature
      patients with and without Central Sensitisation (CS). Initially, two experts will evaluate
      and characterize which vignettes concern patients with CS.

      Next, a team of physiotherapists with knowledge of chronic pain and CS will evaluate
      vignettes twice: 1) according to their clinical reasoning and 2) according to the algorithm.
      There will be an interval of at least 2 weeks between the two measurements. One month later,
      the evaluation according to the Algorithm will be repeated. The investigators will design an
      Android application "Algo (s) rithm" to enter the questions of the algorithm. In the second
      phase, Algo (s)rithm app will use to evaluate patients with chronic pain (including patients
      with fibromyalgia) and healthy. The investigators will compare the result with PPT
      measurements in the same population.In the present study the inter-rater and test-retest
      reliability, criterion validity, construct validity will be examined.
