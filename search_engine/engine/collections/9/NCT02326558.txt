      Recently, a technique of laparoscopic microwave ablation-assisted renal tumor enucleation was
      developed, but the experience was preliminary. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility,
      safety and efficiency of this technique, particularly its role in the preservation of renal
      function, in comparison with conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
