      25% of hemiplegic stroke patients discharged from rehabilitation have significantly impaired
      use of the affected hand with consequent dependence in dressing, grooming and feeding
      themselves. The poor outcome can be attributed in part to a lack of focus by therapists on
      the negative signs of stroke (weakness and lack of dexterity) as well as too little time
      (around 10 minutes per day) being devoted to retraining of the arm. Presently there is a very
      limited evidence base to guide the content of clinical practice. Results from both animal and
      human studies suggest that specific post-lesion training modulates physiological changes that
      take place in undamaged tissue. It is probable that this training induces use-dependent
      patterns of neural activity that can selectively drive the reorganization of the undamaged
      cortical areas and thereby improve the functional outcome for the arm and hand. We have
      developed a task-specific training program for the upper limb that is unique in a) the focus
      on performance of functional tasks, and b) the intensity of practice, with patients
      practising the tasks both during and outside of therapy sessions.

      Comparisons: A 3-week daily task-specific training of the affected upper limb compared to a
      control intervention that does not involve upper limb training. Both interventions are
      additional to the standard rehabilitation program.

      Outcomes measured pre- and post-intervention and 3 months follow-up. Outcome measures
      include: variables grip and pinch force, dexterity, arm use and quality of life. Severity of
      stroke, classified according to the upper arm sub-test of the Motor Assessment Scale, will be
      used as a covariate.
