      The primary objectives of this study is:

      - To investigate possible mechanisms and patterns of weight loss with exenatide treatment,
      especially among individuals who have robust early weight loss (greater than 5% weight loss
      in 12 weeks) with exenatide.

      Secondary Outcomes

      Our secondary objective is to identify metabolic characteristics that predict robust response
      to exenatide treatment.

      Outcome measurements:

        -  Weight

        -  Body composition

        -  Resting energy expenditure (REE)

        -  Mixed meal test

        -  Thermic effect of food

        -  Serum metabolic parameters

        -  Hunger/Nausea/Satiety visual analog scales (VAS)

        -  Physical activity monitoring

      Study Population

      The study population will be generally healthy, non-diabetic women age 18-70 years with BMI
      28-48 kg/m^2.
