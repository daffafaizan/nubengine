      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on the disease progression in patients
           with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

        -  To determine the feasibility of losartan potassium as a possible treatment for
           radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

      Secondary

        -  The evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on the degree of dyspnea, and lung
           function (FEV_1 and FVC) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral losartan potassium once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo assessment of pulmonary function (e.g., gas movement, lung capacity, and
      diffusion of gases) by spirometry and dyspnea by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline
      and at weeks 12 and 24.
