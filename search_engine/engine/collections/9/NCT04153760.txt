      larger randomized controlled trial to determine whether low-dose aspirin is efficacious and
      safe at preventing postpartum venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women at increased risk of VTE,
      compared to placebo.

      Given the large sample size needed to adequately power a large multicenter trial that
      assesses the efficacy of aspirin 81 mg versus placebo, the investigators first need to
      determine if it is possible to recruit enough women. If the pilot trial is successful and
      there are no major changes to the study design, then the secondary clinical outcomes
      collected in the pilot trial will be used in the analysis of the full multicenter trial.
