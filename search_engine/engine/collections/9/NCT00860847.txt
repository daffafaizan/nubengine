      Outcome Measures Primary - Rate of change in total coronary calcium scores by CT The Agatston
      score was calculated by multiplying the lesion area (mm^2) by a density factor. The density
      was measured in Hounsfield units, and score of 1 for 130-199 HU, 2 for 200-299 HU, 3 for
      300-399 HU, and 4 for 400 HU and greater.

      Secondary Change in blood values and endothelial function over 6 and 12 months:

        1. Plasma lipids: total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, LDL-Cholesterol,
           HDL-Cholesterol, and VLDL-Cholesterol determined by the precipitation method;

        2. Endothelial markers and inflammation: C-reactive protein and Homocysteine, as well as
           GSH
