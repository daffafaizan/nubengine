      still shows a rising trend. Postoperative hepatic failure remains a major reason of liver
      resection's failure.

      â€¢ As broad spectrum of enzyme inhibitors, Ulinastatin has the valid therapeutical effect of
      hepatic failure and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal experiment. And it restrain
      inflammatory mediator to release. But it's lack of clinical evidence that Ulinastatin reduce
      the incidence of postoperative hepatic failure in HCC patients The purpose of the study is to
      assess the effort for comparing Ulinastatin's drug protection in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) for postoperative hepatic failure and to evaluate that Ulinastatin can
      improve survival in HCC patients or not.
