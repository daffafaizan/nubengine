      infections including tuberculosis (TB) are not strongly suspected. However, the value of this
      practice has been poorly defined. Unnecessary bronchial cultures of bacteria may lead to over
      treatment in patients without clinical evidence of infections and may increase the drug
      resistant strains.

      In areas with a high prevalence of TB, routine bronchial cultures may detect clinically
      unsuspected TB in an appreciable proportion of cases. However, in population with a low
      prevalence of TB, routine culture of bronchial aspirates may incur an unnecessary expanse and
      may lead to over diagnosis and over treatment of patients with non pathogenic atypical
      mycobacteria detected by acid-fast bacillus strains.
