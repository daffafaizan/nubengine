      stimulation triggered on the detection of apneas and hypopneas (treated night ) and the other
      without kinesthetic stimulation (non-treated night ). Comparison of apnea and hypopnea
      indices (AHI) and of oxygen saturation between the treated and non-treated night will be
      taken as indicators to quantify the performance of this potential new therapy.
