      evidence, however, has surfaced regarding the characteristics of HIV-infected pregnant women
      and the current standard of care during pregnancy. This chart abstraction study is designed
      to define, more accurately, the pertinent characteristics and general numbers of women in
      these trials.

      In this medical chart abstraction study, pertinent information is collected on all
      HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants who receive primary or consultative care at
      PACTG 367 study sites. Part A profiles all HIV-infected women who received care or
      consultation at study sites and who had a pregnancy outcome between January 1, 1998 through
      July 1, 1998. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/12/02: Part A is closed to enrollment.] Part B profiles
      HIV-infected pregnant women who receive primary or consultative care and a pregnancy outcome
      following July 1, 1998.
