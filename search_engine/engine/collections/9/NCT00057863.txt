      I. To determine the objective response rates for the combination of paclitaxel and
      oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent cervical cancer.

      II. To determine the toxicities and recovery from toxicities of patients with cervical cancer
      receiving paclitaxel and oxaliplatin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed ever 3 months.
