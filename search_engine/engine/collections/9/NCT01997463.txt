      if they are monitored at school to make sure they take their inhaled steroid medication (ICS)
      every day and take the medication the right way. All of the children with asthma in the
      school will be asked to participate. In the first year in one-half of the schools, children
      and school staff will participate in a standardized asthma education program presented by the
      American Lung Association (ALA). Children will have daily monitoring of their inhaled asthma
      medication. The other half of schools will continue with the usual treatment of children with
      asthma. In the second year of the study, all schools and children will have the asthma
      education program and monitoring. Parents will be queried quarterly for information about
      their child's asthma.
