    
      This is a non-interventional study in which eligible patients are prospectively followed-up
      until death or the end-of-study, whichever happens first.

      Patients are enrolled after mCRPC diagnosis and before or within the 6 first months of
      starting a first-line treatment with any approved survival-prolonging agent for mCRPC. First
      and subsequent treatment lines will be chosen according to the patients and their treating
      physicians preferences and will not be dictated by this study.

      A whole blood sample for germline DNA extraction as well as any available archival prostate
      cancer tissue samples will be collected at baseline. Optional plasma, serum and whole blood
      samples will be collected at baseline and at different time points along the evolution of the
      disease. A sample will be collected within the last 6 months of life.

      Survival and treatment outcomes including biochemical, radiological and clinical progression
      with standard approved agents abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel and
      radium-223 will be prospectively collected.

      Primary aim is to evaluate the prevalence and impact of DNA repair germline mutations in the
      BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and PALB2 genes on cause-specific survival from mCRPC. Secondary aims will
      include the correlation of additional germline alterations in DNA-repair with survival and
      treatment outcomes; the analyses of the survival and treatment outcomes impact of somatic
      alterations in these genes and the role of germline and somatic defects in the clonal
      evolution of prostate cancer.
