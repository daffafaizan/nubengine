      documentable cause, are considered as minor disorders for which patients do not receive
      adequate attention. These disorders may represent extra-esophageal manifestations of
      gastro-oesophagea reflux. Accurate diagnosis and gastro-oesophageal reflux therapy have been
      proved as useful to improve patients' quality of life.

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in first diagnosed patients presenting with
      upper symptoms associated with GERD, the effect of a 6-week treatment with a combination
      based on CS, HA and aluminium hydroxide (Gerdoff®), co-administered with a treatment with
      PPIs, compared to treatment with PPIs as monotherapy, i.e. to verify, in patients treated
      with the combination of the two products, the reduction in symptoms frequency by means of a
      Likert questionnaire and the severity of upper symptoms by means of the Reflux Symptom Index
      (RSI) questionnaire, and to collect safety data. After 6 weeks of treatment, patients
      included in the two groups were then classified as responders or non-responders. Responder
      patients were defined as those patients that, at the 6th week of treatment, reached a RSI
      score decreased for at least 50% compared to baseline and an absolute value < 13.

      Furthermore, the maintenance of the effect of treatment on the extra-oesophageal symptoms was
      evaluated after a period of follow-up lasting 12 weeks, which could be entered only by
      responder patients randomised in the Gerdoff®-PPI arm. Patients included in the follow-up
      period were randomised to receive Gerdoff® or no treatment (control group). Safety data were
      also evaluated in the group of patients that continued in the follow-up period.
