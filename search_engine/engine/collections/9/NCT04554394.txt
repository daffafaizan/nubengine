      warts, excluding the face, with each wart lesion not exceeding 10 x 10mm. One of the warts
      for each subject will be untreated and will serve as the subject's internal control.
      Macrophotography of all study warts will be captured along with Investigator assessments
      using the Wart Measurement Scale (WMS) and lesion measurements for wart reduction. All
      subjects will be followed at 7, 30, 60, 90 and 120-days post-initial CellFX treatment. All
      wart lesions are eligible for re-treatment up to 3 times over the course of the study.
      Adverse events will be documented.
