      are replaced by abnormal fibrous tissue. PFD may occur alone or as part of the McCune
      Albright syndrome (MAS). We have previously identified a somatic activating mutation in the
      gene encoding the alpha-subunit of Gs, the G protein which mediates the action of hormones
      that work by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), in
      affected tissues from patients with PFD and MAS. The objectives of this study are to
      determine how activating mutations of the Gs alpha-subunit lead to the changes of PFD, and to
      determine if interventions that block the biochemical effects of the activating mutation in
      in vitro and in vivo animal model systems could prevent some of the cellular changes
      characteristic of PFD. To carry out these studies, we plan to obtain pathologic bone tissue
      from patients with either isolated PFD or PFD in the context of MAS. In one phase of the
      study, archival pathology specimens of affected bone will be retrospectively analyzed using a
      variety of immunohistochemical techniques. In the second phase of the study, specimens of
      affected bone will be obtained prospectively from patients undergoing clinically indicated
      orthopedic procedures. Specimens will be placed in primary culture, cultured cells will be
      analyzed for the Gs alpha-subunit activating mutation, and the mutant-bearing cells will be
      studied by a variety of cell biologic and pharmacologic techniques.
