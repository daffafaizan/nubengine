      receive BT 11 1000 mg or placebo. Each of the treatment arms will comprise 75 subjects. The
      randomization will be stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy for CD (yes/no;
      exposed population limited to 50% of total sample) and corticosteroid use at baseline
      (yes/no).

      The study will consist of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction period, an 18-week
      maintenance period, and a 2-week posttreatment safety follow-up period.

      Subjects who are nonresponders at Week 12, or who lose response during the maintenance
      period, or who complete the Week 30 study will be eligible for a separate open-label
      extension (OLE) study.
