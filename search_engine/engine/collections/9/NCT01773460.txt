      different signaling cascades including the PI3K/akt/mTOR pathway results in cell growth
      stimulation and results in resistance to endocrine therapies. One way to restore endocrine
      sensitivity is the inhibition of the mTOR pathway in combination with endocrine therapy
      leading to an increase in PFS compared with endocrine therapy alone. Guidelines recommend the
      sequential treatment with different endocrine therapies. It therefore appears reasonable to
      explore if sensitivity can be restored by changing the subsequent endocrine combination
      partner of Everolimus in case of failure of a combined endocrine-everolimus therapy.
