      also neuronal and structural changes in duodenal submucosal ganglia have been described in FD
      patients. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the first-line therapy in FD patients and are
      recently shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in FD. However, the exact mechanism of
      their anti-inflammatory action is unknow and their effect on duodenal nerve signalling remain
      unclear.

      In this prospective interventional study, FD patients will undergo study procedures before
      and after treatment with pantoprazole (PantomedÂ®) 40mg twice daily during 4 weeks, with a
      baseline comparison to healthy volunteers.

      This study aims to provide an in-deep characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate in the
      duodenum of FD patients, and to unravel the effect of PPI-therapy on neuronal signalling,
      duodenal inflammation and neuro-immune interactions in FD.

      Novel insights in the pathophysiology of FD, including the duodenal mucosal inflammation and
      impaired neuronal functioning, can provide a better understanding of this commonly and costly
      disorder. Moreover, these results will help to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effect of PPI,
      which will contribute to the discovery of predictive markers for therapeutic efficacy of PPI
      in FD.
