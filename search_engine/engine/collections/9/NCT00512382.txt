      same patient by chance alone. Research reveals increased incidence for both to coexist
      leading to suspect a temporal association and possible causality. Therefore we conducted an
      observational study To determine the primary cause (RS or GER)using for the first time both
      PH-Impedance as measurements of GER and Wheezy monitoring (WEEM) that records simultaneously
      wheeze and cough noises. Both modalities will be recorded for 12-24 hours. If GER precedes
      cough/wheeze recordings it points to GER being the possible precipitating factor.However, If
      cough/wheeze precedes GER recordings it points to cough/wheeze being the possible
      precipitating factor. The recordings will be investigated 1 minute before and one minute
      after each event.
