      intervention with three main goals: 1) to assess the magnitude of improvements in memory,
      language function, and cognitive function following computer training, 2) to investigate the
      neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such neuropsychological improvements, and 3) to
      demonstrate the feasibility of using this kind of computer-based therapy in older
      populations.
