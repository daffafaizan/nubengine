      postpartum hemorrhage and received an intrauterine balloon tamponade.

      Patients who are candidates for study enrollment will be identified on Labor & Delivery or in
      the Maternal-Fetal Care Unit. Patients who give consent will be randomized by random number
      generator to receive either antibiotics (Group A) or no antibiotics (Group B).

      If the patient is randomized to Group A, she will receive a 24-hour course of antibiotics.
      The primary antibiotic of choice will be cefazolin 1 gm iv q8 hours. If the patient has
      contraindications to the use of cefazolin including cefazolin allergy, hypersensitivity, or
      severe beta lactam allergy, then clindamycin 900 mg iv q8 hours will be used instead.

      If the patient is randomized to Group B, she will not receive antibiotics as part of the
      study, though if at any time her provider chooses to administer antibiotics either
      prophylactically or for treatment she will not prohibited in any way from this or any other
      treatment as appropriate.
