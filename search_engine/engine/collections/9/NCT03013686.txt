      appendectomy with follow-up MRI in patients with initially successfully treated
      periappendicular abscess.

      Periappendicular abscess is generally initially treated conservatively with antibiotic
      therapy and if necessary, drainage. Operative treatment in the acute abscess phase is
      associated with increased morbidity and thus complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular
      abscess is initially treated conservatively. However, there is debate on whether interval
      appendectomy is required.

      After initial successful conservative treatment of a CT- or MRI-diagnosed periappendicular
      abscess, patients enrolled in the PeriAPPAC study are randomised either to interval
      appendectomy or to follow-up with MRI at two months after the initial treatment. All patients
      also undergo a colonoscopy, appendectomy patients prior to surgery and MRI patients after the
      MRI (outpatient visit at endoscopy unit with information on the MRI).

      The primary endpoint is the treatment success in both treatment arms. In the interval
      appendectomy evaluated as possible morbidity related to appendectomy and in the follow-up
      treatment arm as possible recurrence of the appendicitis and/or abscess during a one-year
      follow-up.

      The PeriAPPAC study is a multi centre trial and the participating hospitals are Turku
      University Hospital, Oulu University Hospital, Tampere University Hospital, Kuopio University
      Hospital and Sein√§joki Central Hospital.
