      and hurry clinical environment, and interfered by the well-known confounding whitecoat
      effect. As such, unattended automated office BP monitoring (uAOBP) has been proposed as an
      effective solution and further promoted by Canadian physicians.

      Nonetheless, out-of-office BP, home BP and ambulatory BP, remains the methodology of
      recommendation for the detection of whitecoat effect, and its prognostic value has been
      demonstrated to be superior to the traditional office BP. Home BP monitoring, with its
      ability to detect morning and masked hypertension and a better tolerability than ambulatory
      BP monitoring for long-term use, can therefore be considered as a strategy of choice to
      replace office BP monitoring for guiding hypertension management.

      Moreover, BP measurements in the peripheral arteries cannot serve as direct substitutes for
      their central counterparts because of the long-recognized differences of blood pressure (BP)
      waveforms and values between the central aorta and peripheral arterial system. Thus, if the
      decisions on medication adjustment are made solely based brachial BP, there could be a
      considerable risk of over- or undertreatment.

      Considering that there are many better strategies for guiding hypertension management than
      traditional office BP, there is an apparent need for investigating their comparative
      effectiveness and safety in the management of hypertension. The investigators hypothesized
      that home BP may be non-inferior to AOBP and central BP-guided intervention in reducing
      ambulatory BP and designed the present randomized controlled trial.
