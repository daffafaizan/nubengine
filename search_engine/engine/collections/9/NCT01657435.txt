    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized study of the 28mm Ceramic on Ceramic (COC) device. This
      study will follow each subject through 10 years postoperatively and will consist of:

        1. a clinical follow-up phase and

        2. a clinical outcomes phase.

      Radiographic and clinical follow-up exams will take place at six-weeks, six-months and then
      annually through year 5 for each subject. For years 6 - 10, a communication will be sent to
      each subject in order to collect survivorship and general health information. This
      communication will ask whether the COC device is still in vivo and, if not, when the revision
      surgery took place, why, and which components were removed, if applicable. In addition,
      subjects will be asked to complete a SF-12 Health Survey at each 6 to 10-year follow-up
      interval. A self-addressed, stamped envelope will be provided to facilitate information
      return and privacy.
