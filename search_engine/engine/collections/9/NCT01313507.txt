      infusions started at a rate of 0.01 mL/kg/min (60 mg/kg/h) for the first 30 minutes followed
      by 0.03 mL/kg/min (180 mg/kg/h) for the next 15 minutes. If tolerated, further increments
      were made at predefined patterns with the following maximum rates: 0.10 mL/kg/min (600
      mg/kg/h) in the first infusion; if this was tolerated, 0.12 mL/kg/min (720 mg/kg/h) in the
      second infusion; if this was tolerated, 0.14 mL/kg/min (840 mg/kg/h) in all subsequent
      infusions.

      If an adverse event occurred during an infusion, the rate was reduced to half the rate at
      which the event occurred or the infusion was interrupted until symptoms subsided. The
      infusion was then resumed at a rate tolerated by the patient.
