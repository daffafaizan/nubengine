      an epidural catheter on the labor floor and what is considered to be essential is
      controversial. Recognizing this, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA), the
      leading authority on regional anesthesia, established a task force to examine and establish
      guidelines for aseptic practice. Their findings highlighted the lack of good quality studies
      to support specific recommendations. This is especially true in regards to the use of sterile
      gowns during the performance of the procedure.
