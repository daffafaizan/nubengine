    
      This is a randomized trial of preoperative breast MRI in patients deemed eligible for breast
      conserving surgery by conventional clinical criteria will provide important information about
      the clinical and biologic relevance of occult disease identified by MRI alone. Patients will
      be assigned to standard pre-operative breast cancer disease assessment without the addition
      of MRI prior to breast conserving surgery or standard pre-operative breast cancer disease
      assessment with the use of MRI prior to breast conserving surgery.

      The primary objective is to compare the rates of local-regional recurrence (LRR) following
      attempted breast conserving therapy in a cohort of women with triple negative or HER-2
      amplified breast cancer randomized to preoperative staging with mammography (control arm) or
      mammography plus breast MRI (MRI arm).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the re-operation rates following attempted breast conserving therapy between
           women assessed preoperatively with breast MRI to those assessed without the use of
           breast MRI

        -  To compare local recurrence rates between women who undergo BCT on the control arm to
           women who undergo BCT on the MRI arm

        -  To compare the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins or
           poor cosmesis within the first 6 months of attempting BCT (prior to the administration
           of RT) between women assessed preoperatively with breast MRI to those assessed without
           the use of breast MRI

        -  To compare the contralateral breast cancer rates in women randomized to preoperative
           breast MRI to those not receiving pre-operative breast MRI

        -  To compare the disease-free survival rates between women assessed preoperatively with
           breast MRI to those assessed without the use of breast MRI

        -  To compare breast cancer specific and overall survival outcomes of women assessed
           preoperatively with breast MRI to those assessed without the use of breast MRI

        -  To estimate the rate of MRI-guided localization assisted surgery

        -  To estimate the rate of multi-centric disease in the index breast for women in the MRI
           arm

        -  To evaluate the accuracy of index lesion characteristics and other factors in predicting
           multi-centricity in the cohort randomized to breast MRI

        -  To assess the positive predictive values (PPV) of MRI in detecting ipsilateral
           multi-centric disease and contralateral disease in women with breast cancer undergoing
           preoperative breast MRI

        -  To estimate the false positive rate for detection of multiple foci of breast cancer by
           MRI

      All registered patients will be monitored for relapse and survival for 5 years from the date
      of surgery. Patients will be followed a minimum of every 4 months for the first 2 years from
      diagnosis and a minimum of every 6 months during years 3-5. Patients will be monitored for
      local, regional, distant relapse and vital status.
