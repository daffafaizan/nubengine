      art and clinical care by photographing and videotaping patients with brain tumors before,
      during and after pet therapy sessions. This exploratory scholarship has two equally
      compelling goals. First, the artistic component of the project aims to create compelling slow
      motion video portraits of patients' willing to share their experiences of what it is like to
      confront such a grave illness. The goal is to put a human face on disease and share the
      endurance of the human spirit through art. Second, the scientific component will assess the
      potential of using facial video portraits as a novel and innovative way to measure Quality of
      Life (QOL) in lieu of questionnaires in brain tumor patients. In addition, the project will
      evaluate the effects of pet therapy on the QOL of these patients.
