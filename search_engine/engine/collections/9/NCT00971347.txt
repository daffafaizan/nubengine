      randomly assign 200 overweight or mildly obese, but otherwise healthy adults (men and women,
      ages 19 to 50), to one of two groups: 1) a control group, which will receive printed
      information on optimal diet and increasing physical activity only, or 2) an intervention
      group, in which participants will be instructed to chew gum following meals and in place of
      snacks for a minimum of 90 minutes per day, in addition to receiving the same information on
      optimal diet and increasing physical activity as the control group. In this 8-week
      intervention, the primary outcome will be change in body weight, and secondary outcomes will
      be changes in body mass income (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure. Outcome
      measures will be assessed in both groups via clinic visits at baseline, 4 weeks
      post-randomization, and 8 weeks post-randomization. Adherence to the gum chewing protocol
      will be assessed at the clinic visits, as well as during telephone contacts at 2 weeks and 6
      weeks post-randomization. The effects of the chewing gum intervention will be assessed by
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), wherein treatment assignment is the independent variable;
      the outcome measures described above will serve as dependent variables; and pre-randomization
      factors such as age, sex, and baseline BMI will be used as covariates. Our hypothesis is that
      those randomized to the intervention group will lowe more weight than those randomized to the
      control group.
