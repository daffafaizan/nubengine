    
      This was an exploratory, randomized, subject- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group, proof-of-mechanism study in COPD subjects with eosinophilia, on standard of
      care therapy. Standard of care (SoC) treatment in subjects with COPD typically includes a
      regimen of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus one or more long acting bronchodilator
      (long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or long-acting antimuscarinic antagonist (LAMA)).

      The study consisted of a screening period (including an optional pre-screen visit) during
      which the subject's phenotype and eligibility for the study were assessed. All subjects who
      met the eligibility criteria after the screening visit were to undergo induction of their
      sputum to examine the baseline sputum cell counts. Subjects were required to demonstrate both
      blood and sputum eosinophilia to be eligible for participation in the study.

      Eligible subjects were randomized 3:2 to active (fevipiprant 450 mg oral daily) vs. placebo
      arms. Randomization was stratified by current smoking status (current vs. ex-smoker).
      Subjects were to continue their COPD standard of care and other medications during the entire
      course of the study. Subjects were to receive multiple doses of fevipiprant or placebo for
      six weeks.

      Sputum induction was to be repeated at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the
      study (approximately 4 weeks after the last dose).

      The primary purpose of the proof-of-mechanism study was to determine whether fevipiprant
      (QAW039), when administered to COPD patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation on
      standard of care therapy, reduced the burden of sputum eosinophilia. Data from other trials
      did not confirm efficacy of fevipiprant and did not warrant the continuation of treatment in
      this study. As a result, this study was terminated early.
