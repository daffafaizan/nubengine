      evident in our previous retrospective study. This prospective study including all endoscopic
      ultrasound procedures performed for further evaluation of biliary dilatation in the setting
      of bilirubin <2 mg/dL will enable accurate measurement of common bile duct and pancreatic
      duct diameter using endoscopic ultrasound and identification of other non- obstructive
      factors which may modulate biliary dilation (i.e. age, cholecystectomy status, duration and
      type of opiate used).

      We believe this work will be of great interest to gastroenterologists, as it provides
      additional data for interpretation of isolated common bile duct dilation in asymptomatic
      patients.
