      Neck Cancer. 26 participants will be treated with the study drug Zalutumumab at 4 different
      doses. Zalutumumab will be given at day 0, day 14, day 21 and day 28. Blood samples (for PK
      and to check the participant's safety) will be taken before drug is given. Blood samples for
      PK only will be taken directly after drug is given at all treatment visits and also at +3hr
      and +12hrs on day 0 and day 28 which may require an overnight stay.

      Blood samples for PK only are also taken on days between treatments. After treatment on day
      28, eight more blood samples will be taken over 3 weeks. On day 49 participants may enter an
      optional extended treatment period receiving the drug weekly until it is no longer
      appropriate for the participant (doctor/participant decision or cancer has advanced).

      Dosing in the extended treatment period will start at 16mg/kg. The correct dose for the
      participant will be checked at each visit by looking for the presence and severity of skin
      rash. This is a common side effect of medicines like Zalutumumab which block the Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor. The severity of the skin rash is used as a guide for dosing. A mild
      rash could mean more medication is needed, a severe rash will mean the participant needs a
      break from the medication. End of study is 8 weeks after the last dose of Zalutumumab and
      blood samples will be taken +4weeks and +8weeks after the last dose of drug.
