      fish oil components) affects immune and mood responses to examination stress. This study will
      examine these outcomes in medical students during academic examination periods as well as
      less stressful non-exam periods. Participants will take fish oil supplements or placebo pills
      for approximately 3 months during which time relevant mood, endocrine, and immune measures
      will be assessed.
