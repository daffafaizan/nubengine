      as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, 2000IU Cholecalciferol and 1000mg of
      calcium, both per oral (PO), over a three month period will improve their metabolic picture,
      and possibly hormone profile.

      Over the course of the trial, after the first 5 subjects had completed 3 month
      intervention,we observed that daily 2000IU D3 dosing regime was inadequate in normalizing
      vitamin D status in the study population; the dosing regimen was therefore modified to
      include weekly supplementation with 50,000IU D2 in addition to daily dosing with 2000IU D3.
