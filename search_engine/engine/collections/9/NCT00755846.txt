      diabetes mellitus, 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of type 2
      diabetes mellitus varies among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to increase
      with age, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity.
      Over the next decade, a disproportionate increase in the elderly population will result in a
      marked increase in diabetic patients, placing an ever-increasing burden on families and the
      health care system.

      In response to this problem, Takeda Global Research & Development Center, Inc. is developing
      SYR-322 (alogliptin), a selective, orally available inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo
      degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely
      glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 14 Weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include blood collection, urine collection,
      vital signs including sitting and standing blood pressure and pulse, body height and weight,
      physical examinations and electrocardiograms.
