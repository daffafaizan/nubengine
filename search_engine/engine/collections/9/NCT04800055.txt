    
      An open-label two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design will be used
      comparing ATSB + LLINS vs LLINS alone (standard of care). A cluster trial design is indicated
      given the intended community-level effect of ATSBs on malaria transmission. Universal LLIN
      coverage will be ensured in both arms prior to start of the study and will serve as the
      standard of care. Arm 1 will receive ATSBs for two years. Arm 2 will receive the standard of
      care of universal LLIN coverage.

      Sixty clusters will be used for the trial per site, with 30 clusters allocated to the ATSB
      intervention plus universal LLIN coverage arm, and 30 clusters allocated to the control with
      standard of care arm, universal LLIN coverage. Restricted randomization will be used to
      randomize the 60 clusters to intervention and control arms. The incidence cohort and
      cross-sectional household surveys will each be powered to detect a 30% reduction in the
      malaria outcome over two years.

      Primary aim:

      â€¢ Quantify the efficacy of ATSBs for reducing P. falciparum clinical case incidence, parasite
      prevalence, community infection incidence, and health facility confirmed malaria case
      incidence.

      Secondary aims include:

        -  Quantify the efficacy of ATSBs for reducing target malaria vector density, altering the
           population age structure by reducing longevity, and reducing sporozoite and
           entomological inoculation rates (EIR).

        -  Assess the durability of the ATSB.

        -  Assess community acceptance of ATSB.

        -  Identify barriers to high and effective ATSB coverage.

        -  Understand the impact of ATSB deployment on LLIN use.

        -  Document cost and cost-effectiveness of ATSB deployment.
