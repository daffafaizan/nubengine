      range of patients with diverse and complex anatomies. Nevertheless, there is a subgroup of
      patient with large aortic annulus (diameter > 27 mm), in whom the implant of a transcatheter
      valve is not possible because there is no valve suitable for such as aortic annulus size.

      With the introduction of the CoreValveTM EvolutionTM R 34mm, patients with an aorttic annulus
      dimension up to 29 mm in diameter have become eligible for TAVI. However, there is a lack of
      information regarding the number of patient with AS and this particular anatomy of the aortic
      annulus. Italian and Dutch registries have reported a prevalence between 6.5 to 12.3% with
      large aortic annulus requiring the previous CoreValveTM 31mm. Yet, there is no reported data
      regarding this population of patients in Spain. Also, the clinical use of this larger
      prosthesis covers a wider range of aortic rings and may enchance the procedural challenges,
      such as a little margin for proper valve placement, more likelihood of interference with
      mitral valve function and damage to the cardiac conduction system during the prosthesis
      deployment.

      So far, no studies regarding clinical experiences with the CoreValveTM EvolutionTM R 34mm
      have been published. The scarce information currently available with this new device may be
      distant from those found in its daily clinical use in non-selected patients. The results of
      this Spanish nationwide registry will help to answer a scientific need of information
      regarding acute procedural results and mid
