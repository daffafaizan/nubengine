      American College of Cardiology/ The Obesity Society Guideline (AHA/ACC/TOS) for the
      Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults for its effectiveness at reducing body weight
      and decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors. An implication of this focus on total quantity
      of calories consumed is that macronutrient composition of dietary intake and its effects on
      the hormonal milieu that regulates adipose accumulation in the human body do not play a
      significant role in weight loss. Such recommendations and the results of limited previous
      studies have led to the advice that all weight loss diets regardless of macronutrient
      composition will produce the same degree of weight loss if adherence to the diet is similar.
      In contrast, our previous studies have shown that despite comparable adherence to dietary
      goals, participants losing weight on a moderately carbohydrate-restricted, adequate protein
      regimen have improved cardiometabolic indicators as compared to those restricting fat. The
      RENEWAL trial will provide unique data on the efficacy of the Ideal Protein method (moderate
      carbohydrate restriction and adequate protein) for weight loss and improvement in
      cardiometabolic risk factors. The interventions will include a significant proportion of
      African-Americans, a group with very high rates of obesity which is often under-represented
      in trials examining the effects of weight loss diets. Findings from this trial may offer new
      evidence for the recommendation of specific macronutrient and behavioral approaches to the
      reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors.
