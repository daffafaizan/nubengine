        -  To genotype the genomic DNA from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated on
           COG-AAML0531 clinical trial for CD33 (and PgP and SOC3) single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs).

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD33, PgP,
      and SOC3 genes by Sequenome platform. Results are then compared with patients clinical
      outcomes, including minimal-residual disease levels post induction I (chemotherapy and
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin), complete remission rates, refractory disease with various levels of
      bone marrow blasts, development of CNS/persistent disease, event-free survival, overall
      survival, and toxicity.
