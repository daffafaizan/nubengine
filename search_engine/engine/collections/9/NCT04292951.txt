    
      Objective: To compare postoperative clinical outcome in adult patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Primary outcome: Postoperative inotropic/vasoactive drugs reqirement.

      Secondary outcome: ICU stay.

      Methods: Eligible patients will be randomized to 2 groups. Both groups will be managed
      intraoperatively in the same way, except fluid and inotropic/vasoactive drugs management
      protocol. EGDT group will be managed according to information derived from FloTrac/EV1000
      system, i.e., control stroke volume variation (SVV) 10-13% and give fluid when SVV > 13%,
      give inotropic to maintain cardiac index (CI) 2.5-4 L/min/m2, and give vasoactive drugs to
      maintain systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) of 1,900-2,400 dynes-sec/cm-5/m2 . Control
      group will be managed using central venous pressure (CVP) protocol, i.e., control CVP 8-12
      mmHg and give fluid when CVP < 8 mmHg, give inotropic/vasoactive drugs according to blood
      pressure and heart rate as well as clinical signs at the discretion of attending
      anesthesiologists.

      Outcome analyses: Postoperative number of inotropic/vasoactive drugs requirement as well as
      ICU stay of both groups will be compared using unpaired Student-t test or Mann-Whitney U
      test.
