    
      Statin-naive patients and those on statin therapy with ACS who are admitted to the cardiology
      ward of our public (National Health Service) hospital and are scheduled for early invasive
      strategy receive immediately on admission, always before angiographic procedure, high-dose
      statin therapy. Either atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg is administered at the
      discretion of the physician. During hospitalization various pertinent cardiac and renal
      parameters, including hematological, angiographic, clinical data are registered in a
      dedicated database. Clinical follow-up and hematological analysis are done 1 month after
      discharge. A second follow-up, either clinical or by telephone, is done 1 year after
      discharge.
