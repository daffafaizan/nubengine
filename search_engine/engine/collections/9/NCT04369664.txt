      of atherosclerosis) in T2D, this project will reveal mechanisms behind the platelet mediated
      increased cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D by focusing on the platelet transcriptome
      in those with clinical progression and subsequent cardiovascular events versus those without
      clinical progression. A prospective clinical study will investigate platelet activity and
      transcriptome before and after significant cholesterol reduction to better understand
      mechanisms of increased residual risk observed in patients with T2D, even when cholesterol is
      not elevated. By combining prospective studies on the platelet phenotype in humans with T2D,
      mechanistic mouse models of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis in the Fisher, Basic
      Project, and the human plaque and genomic data available data from the Giannarelli,
      Population Project, the investigators believe the research will fill an important and
      clinically significant gap in the understanding of how diabetes attenuates cardiovascular
      repair and to identify new treatment and prevention strategies.
