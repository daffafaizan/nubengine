      increased incidence and severity of clinical events. Inflammation, particularly in diabetes,
      plays a central role in the cascade of events that result in plaque erosion and fissuring.
      There is emerging evidence that the methylase system might be involved in both initial stage
      and progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the methylase system might be involved in
      inflammatory/oxidative stress pathway, involved for activation of nuclear factor kappa B
      (NF-KB), and other proteins linked to over inflammation/oxidative stress. Although it has
      been demonstrated that diabetes may up regulate these inflammatory/oxidative pathway, still
      no evidence exists about the potential role of methylase system in the evolution of
      atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic patients. Conversely, less data have been reported about
      the possible modulation of these pathways by hypoglycemic drugs as oral metfromin. However,
      in the present study authors hypothesized that by increasing methylase activity, diabetes may
      enhance the inflammatory potential of atherosclerotic plaques favoring instability.
      Therefore, authors designed this study to identify differences in inflammatory infiltration
      as well as methylase activity between carotid plaques of asymptomatic diabetic and non
      diabetic (normoglycemics) patients. Because experimental and pathological studies suggest
      that activation of methylase system might control inflammation/oxidative stress, the present
      study also evaluated the effect of the metformin on methylase activity in carotid plaques of
      diabetic patients.
