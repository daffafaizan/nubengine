      dead (39 liver-related deaths) and 16 patients had liver transplantation. Overall survival
      was 91.7% and survival without liver-related death 94.4%. Survival was significantly
      decreased in patients diagnosed with severe fibrosis, whatever the non-invasive method used.
      All these methods were able to predict a shorter survival in this large population. Patients
      had their prognosis decreased as liver stiffness increased. By multivariate analysis, only
      FibroTest > 0.74 (OR 4.41, 95%CI 1.62-12.01, p=0.004) was associated with overall survival,
      and liver stiffness > 9.5 kPa (OR 4.71, 95%CI 1.06-21.01, p=0.04) associated with
      liver-related death.
