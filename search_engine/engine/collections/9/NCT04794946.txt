    
      -  Study population: Group 1: Liver Cirrhosis Group 2: Control Group (Healthy controls)

        -  Study design: A Phase III, Single Centre, Interventional Study

        -  Study period: 1 year, Enrolment Period: Mar 2021 to Aug 2021

        -  Sample size with justification:

      Considering that cirrhosis patients might have lower seroconversion rates than the healthy
      volunteers, we assumed that seroconverstion rates 28 days after second dose to be around
      65±5%. Sample size needed for a confidence interval of 99.9% is 985. Assuming 10 % dropout
      rate, the sample size is around 1100 cirrhosis patients. Similarly 1100 non-cirrhotic
      patients will be enrolled as controls.

        -  Intervention:

           2 IM doses (0.5 mL) of AZD1222(Covishield) at Day 0 and Day 28

        -  Monitoring and assessment:

      SARS CoV2 serum IgG Levels and neutralizing antibody titers:

      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Post vaccination will be screened for
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by commercially available chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) SARS-CoV-2
      IgG (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA)on VITROS ECi/ECiQ/3600 automated
      instrument. Results will be expressed as reactive with Serum/cut off ratio ≥ 1, and
      non-reactive with < 1 S/Co ratio.

      All reactive samples will be further processed to measure the neutralizing antibody titer
      utilizing a surrogate virus neutralization test ELISA based commercial assay (sVNT)(GenScript
      cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit) to look for neutralizing antibody
      response to the spike protein of the virus.

      Real Time PCR for SARS CoV-2 infection:

      A diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 infection will be confirmed by performance of Real Time reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the combined nasopharyngeal and oral swab
      collected in Viral transport medium and by detection of at least 2 specific gene targets of
      the SARS CoV-2 virus (E and RdRP genes).

      Primary IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4
      weeks/28 days after first dose and just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second
      dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40
      weeks (or 36 weeks after second dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) will be
      collected. Primarily, cellular responses will be assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay to enumerate antigen-specific T cells. In brief,
      PBMCs will be isolated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation, immediately
      cryopreserved in 90% fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and transferred to liquid
      nitrogen for storage.

      IFN-γ ELISPOT assays will be performed using cryopreserved PBMC. Briefly, unfractionated PBMC
      will be thawed, resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM medium, and will
      be plated at 100 μl/well (1 × 105 cells/well) in 96-well, nitrocellulose-backed plates
      (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) previously coated with a PBS solution of anti-IFN-γ monoclonal
      antibody (1-D1K, 5 μg/ml; Mabtech Technologies, Nacka, Sweden). Along with negative control
      as, different cell stimuli (PMA; phytohemagglutinin 1 μg/ml and Ionomycin ) will be used in
      as positive controls., Plates will then incubated at 37°C for 40 h, and then will be
      harvested and read in ELISPOT reader. A vaccine-induced response will be defined as a ≥3-fold
      increase over the baseline response to the individual epitope peptide.

      T cells Functionality:

      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Immune response measurements will be
      assessed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at all time points.

      To investigate the CD4 and CD8 T cell functionality PBMCs will be cultured in 96 well plate
      in RPMI media containing 10% FBS, with or without PMA / Ionomycin (positive control) (PMA 2
      ng/mL; ionomycin 1 μg/mL; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 µg /ml LPS (Merck, Darmstadt,
      Germany ) at 37°C ,5% CO2 for 6-7 hours. After 1 hour of incubation, 1 μg/mL brefeldin A (BD
      Pharmingen, USA) will be added to all the wells. After incubation, cells will be surface
      stained for 25-30 minutes with anti-CD3FITC, anti-CD8BV421 and anti-CD4 PE/cyanine5.5 (Cy5)
      followed by 10 minutes permeabilization with 100 µL of permeabilising solution( BD
      Biosciences, USA) and will be washed twice with 500 µL 1x cytoperm. After washing, cells will
      be stained for intracellular expression of IL-2, IFN- γ and IL-17 with anti-IL2 APC,
      anti-IFN-γ PE, anti-IL-17 PE- Cy7 (BD Biosciences and Pharmingen, USA) and will be incubated
      for 25-30 minutes followed by washing with PBS and fixing the cells in 0.1 % PFA before
      acquiring on a BD Verse flow cytometer. Data will be analyzed using FlowJo software version
      10.

      Switching of monocyte Phenotype and functionality:

      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Vaccine will induce an increase in
      proinflammatory cytokine production, which is dependent on trained immunity in innate immune
      cells. We will characterize the phenotype and functionality of monocytes before vaccination
      and after vaccination using flowcytometric analysis.
