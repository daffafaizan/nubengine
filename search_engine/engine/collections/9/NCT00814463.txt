      Primary

        -  To estimate the rate of recurrence at the surgical site in patients with brain
           metastases treated with adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with
           historical data documenting recurrence at the surgical site after surgery and whole
           brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the rate of salvage WBRT, SRS, or surgery in patients treated with adjuvant
           SRS alone.

        -  To estimate the rate of new brain metastases outside of the adjuvant SRS site.

        -  To estimate patient quality of life after adjuvant SRS alone.

        -  To assess the effect of surgical intervention and SRS on the preservation of
           neurocognitive functioning in these patients.

        -  To determine the clinical significance (if any) of locally recurrent brain metastases at
           the time of their occurrence (mass effect, cognitive functioning, and other symptoms) in
           these patients.

        -  To estimate the rate of death due to neurologic causes, defined as death attributable to
           the progression of neurological disease.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-90 minutes.

      Quality of life and neurocognitive function are assessed periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
