      show different response patterns than tumors treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tumor
      manifestations treated with targeted therapies often show only minor measurable changes in
      tumor size despite inhibition of tumor proliferation. Decrease in tumor size fulfilling the
      criteria of a partial remission according to RECIST may occur at a delayed stage of treatment
      after several months (PMID 19620483). Sometimes, even an initial increase of maximum tumor
      diameters may be observed although those patients are treatment responders with respect to
      'hard' study endpoints like overall survival or progression free survival. As a result,
      patients often are misclassified too early as non-responders. As a consequence, successful
      treatment is not recognized or decisions towards a less effective second-line therapy are
      made.

      Dual Energy CT (DECT) is a new and robust CT method that allows to exactly quantify the
      intra-tumoral amount of intravenously injected iodinated contrast material PMID 21822784).
      Thus, the technique can be considered as a simple and reliable surrogate of tumor Perfusion
      (PMID 21822784, 21934517, 20498609, 18677487). Initial studies have demonstrated a high
      accuracy of DECT in the differentiation of benign and malignant tumors in the kidney or lung
      (PMID 20498609, 18677487, 18796658). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the amount of
      iodine in lung tumors correlates with tumor glucose metabolism (PMID 21822784). These
      findings confirm the results of previous studies that have demonstrated the relationship
      between tumor perfusion, tumor microvessel density and glucose metabolism (PMID 15304661).

      The hypothesis of the study is that DECT is the more accurate diagnostic tool to evaluate
      immediate therapeutic response in patients with GIST undergoing TKI inhibitor therapy (in
      most cases Glivec Â®) than evaluating by RECIST, World Health Organization (WHO) and Choi
      criteria.
