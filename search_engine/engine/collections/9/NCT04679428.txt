    
      The immunogram (quantitative TBNK immunophenotipisation) will be performed by flow cytometry,
      the antibody response will be determined by IVD ELISa.

      Clinical biochemical and immunochemical (ECLIA) tests (including IL-6) will be performed on
      Cobas analyzers. Hemogram with differential blood picture will be performed with a hematology
      analyzer Sysmex XN 3100, examination of blood smears with CellaVision system or. microscope.
      Coagulation tests will be performed on BCS XP analyzers.

      An in-house system for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus fusion inhibitors on human cells will
      be used to detect the ability of antibodies from patients' serum to neutralize the virus and
      thus potential protection against re-infection. The system is quantitative, meaning that the
      titer of such antibodies could be determined, and thus the potential level of protection
      would be evaluated.
