      solar exposure, with cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D by photoconversion of
      7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to pre-vitamin D3. Latitude, altitude, season, skin
      pigmentation, and age are recognized factors that influence how much vitamin D can be made by
      solar exposure. Surprisingly, Vitamin D deficiency has been described in people dwelling in
      southern Florida and in surfers in Hawaii. We hypothesize that genetic variations in vitamin
      metabolism accounts for these differences.
