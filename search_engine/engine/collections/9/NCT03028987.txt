    
      This is a study of up to 20 healthy monozygotic (MZ) twins, 18-49 years old, that are
      participants from past Stanford-LPCH Vaccine Program trials and who have been identified as
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR1501+ or DR0701+ by lab assay results. Volunteers will be
      contacted to assess interest in participating in this study. Both twins in the pair must be
      willing to participate in the study. All participants will be randomized within the twin pair
      to receive either the seasonal live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or the seasonal
      quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). Immunization will be at Day 0, blood
      samples for immunogenicity assays will be collected prior to immunization and at Days 7 (6-8)
      and 28 (24-32).

      This study was halted due to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decision not to
      recommend use of LAIV.
