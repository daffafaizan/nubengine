        1. Resolution measured by Urgency Perception Scale (UPS). Resolution of urgency will be
           assessed with the UPS. The numbers of women with a Level 3 UPS score (hold and finish
           task) will be compared using Chi square test in patients treated with cystodistension vs
           non cystodistension arms.

        2. Change in quality of life status determined by quality of life questionnaires will
           ismilarly be comapred between the 2 arms of the study.

        3. Change in urinary symptoms defined by Patient's Perception of Intensity Scale. Change in
           uregncy scores will be compared between the 2 arms of the study.

      patients with refractory OAB 2. To identify whether urinary cytokines are present in a higher
      proportion of patients with OAB.
