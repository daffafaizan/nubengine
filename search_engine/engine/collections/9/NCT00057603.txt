      patients fail to improve significantly following years of conventional and experimental
      interventions. For some patients, stereotactic neurosurgery is the only promising option
      available. Although this procedure has relatively few side effects in the majority of OCD
      patients and may lead to enduring benefits, its effects on brain tissue and function are
      irreversible. Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable and partially
      reversible procedure that may be a more effective treatment for patients with OCD. This study
      will determine the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of DBS in patients with
      treatment-refractory OCD.

      Participants receive DBS treatment for 30 months. Obsessive Compulsive scales, depression
      scales, neuropsychological evaluations, and surveys are used to assess participants.

      Participants are monitored for 2 years after DBS treatment.
