    
      The phase Ib is designed as 3 + 3, with primary objective feasibility and toxicity.

      Of Note: endpoints must be reached in all 6 patients of cohort 1 and 2, before start of the
      next cohort.

      The phase II is designed as a single arm design with primary endpoint efficacy.

      In phase Ib, two cohorts will be used (cohort 1: nivolumab only and cohort 2: nivolumab and
      ipilimumab neoadjuvant to surgery) to define which neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimen will be
      taken towards the expansion cohort 3.

      Thirty-two patients will be treated with nivolumab (240 mg flat dose, week 1 and week 3,
      twice in total) as a single agent OR the combination of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) + nivolumab
      (240mg flat dose) in week 1, and nivolumab 240mg flat dose in week 3, neoadjuvant to SOC
      (surgery with or without adjuvant (C)RT).
