      causes of generalized edema are heart failure, renal failure, nephrotic syndrome,
      glomerulonephritis and chronic liver failure. In some cases, edema is treated by management
      of the underlying disease. However, in some other cases edema may persist and become more
      severe that needs adjuvant treatments. Because use of diuretics such as furosemide and
      hydrochlorothiazide is not completely effective in treating severe refractory edema, use of
      some other diuretics is also recommended. In this double-blind clinical trial, weight and
      some lab data including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, serum sodium, serum potassium,
      serum albumin, urine sodium, urine potassium, 24-hour urine volume, 24-hour urine protein and
      24-hour urine creatinine of 20 random adult patients with nephrotic syndrome who have
      refractory edema and GFR>60 ml/min/1.73m2 and are referred to nephrology clinic of Shiraz
      University of Medical Sciences will be measured; the patients should not have hypokalemia and
      other causes of edema such as heart failure or cirrhosis. Then the patients are divided into
      2 groups with 10 members in each. The first group will be prescribed 40 mg of furosemide and
      50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and the second one will receive 250 mg of acetazolamide and 50
      mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily for 1 week. Then, weight and mentioned lab data will be
      measured again. After that, all the patients will have 40 mg of furosemide daily for 2 weeks.
      Then, weight and mentioned lab data will be measured for one more time.
