      adulthood.and higher risk for retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and even blindness.
      In Taiwan, myopia macular degeneration is the first place of irreversible blind cause in the
      elderly. The evidence based medicine shows atropine is the most effective treatment for the
      progression of myopia so far, but the side effects including photophobia and near blurred
      vision often disturbing patients and resulting poor compliance and high drop-out rate.

      Recently, the studies from Taiwan and Singapore showed that low concentrations of atropine
      (0.05% or 0.01%) can effectively inhibit the myopia progression, reduce the symptoms of
      photophobia, and to achieve favorable myopia control. Previous study found that myopia and
      allergic conjunctivitis and inflammation were related. The investigators designed a
      prospective and randomized study to investigate the effect of myopia control in myopic
      children with ultra low concentrations of atropine eye drops and/or low concentrations of
      anti-allergic and inflammatory eye drops. Due to environmental factors such as near work,
      after school class and outdoor activity are also great associated with myopia, the
      questionnaires also are collected in this study.
