      Namely, there is minimal evidence to mitigate the impact of shoulder instability with
      non-surgical interventions. The presence of shoulder instability can drastically decrease
      upper extremity function and lead to subsequent shoulder pathology. While there is
      observational and retrospective evidence to support the use of specific, guided, therapeutic
      exercise interventions to treat shoulder instability, there are only two randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) investigating the effects of these types of interventions. While
      current evidence demonstrates that rehabilitation interventions are capable of decreasing
      pain and improving self-reported function in individuals with MDI, these investigations
      include heterogeneous samples and lack thorough investigation of the biomechanical effects of
      these interventions. The results of this study will allow direct observation of treatment
      effects designed to mitigate the effects of symptomatic shoulder instability with
      gold-standard biomechanical techniques. These results will facilitate the optimization of
      future treatments and interventions. Further, the results will contribute to the current
      field of musculoskeletal medicine by enhancing biomechanics-based treatment interventions and
      promote patient-reported outcomes research. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to
      expand to investigations of treatment effectiveness to more diverse populations and a broader
      range of movement-related shoulder dysfunctions.
