      participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who take TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 122 participants. Participants will be assigned to:

      â€¢ TAK-659 60 mg to 100 mg

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study in a 28-day cycle.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy,
      France, Canada, Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 48
      months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and progression during the PFS
      follow-up every 3 months after end of treatment (for participants who discontinue due to
      reasons other than disease progression) and OS follow-up every 3 months from the last dose of
