    
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, historical-controlled clinical evaluation of the
      Trident® X3 Polyethylene insert. The device is commercially available in the United States
      where the study is being conducted. The study device, the Stryker Orthopaedics Trident® X3
      polyethylene insert, is used for the replacement of the bearing surface of the acetabulum to
      relieve pain, instability, and the restriction of motion due to degenerative bone disease,
      including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or failure of other devices. The
      control device, the Stryker Orthopaedics N2VAC polyethylene insert, is also used for the
      replacement of the bearing surface of the acetabulum to relieve pain, instability, and the
      restriction of motion due to degenerative bone disease, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, trauma, or failure of other devices.
