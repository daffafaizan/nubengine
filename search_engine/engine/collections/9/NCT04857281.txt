      explain how to properly handle the device. Treatment can only start after eligibility has
      been fully checked and all data collected at screening have been keyed into the trial
      database.

      The patient will be instructed to use the nVNS in place of the rescue medications. When the
      nauseas gets bad enough that they feel to use a rescue medication they will first use the
      device on one side of the neck for two 2-minute stimulations and wait fifteen minutes to
      check if the stimulation works. If this does not help either, they will stimulate with an
      additional 2 stimulations and wait for another fifteen minutes. If there is no improvement
      rescue medication will be used. nVNS can be used up to, but no more than, 8 times a day.
