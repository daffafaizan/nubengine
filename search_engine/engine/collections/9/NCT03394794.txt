    
      Fecal incontinence is a prevalent condition with a major impact on quality of life. Currently
      four treatments are being used in clinical practice: Kegel exercises (K), biofeedback (BF),
      electrostimulation (ES) and transcutaneous neuromodulation (NM). Results in the literature
      are discordant and lack methodological rigour making scientific evidence weak.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of these four treatments on
      community-dwelling women and their impact on anorectal physiology, on clinical severity and
      on QoL.

      This is a randomized control trial. Patient physiology was studied with anorectal manometry
      and endoanal ultrasonography; clinical severity was assessed with Cleveland and St. Mark's
      scales, and QoL with the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) and the EuroQol's EQ5D
      questionnaires. Urinary incontinence (UI) was also evaluated by means of International
      Consultation on Incontinence (ICIQ) score. Patients were randomized and assigned to K
      (control), BF+K, ES+K or NM+K, given active treatment for a 3-month period, and then
      evaluated again with identical tests and parameters to identify changes.
