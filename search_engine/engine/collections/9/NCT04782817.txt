      patients following cardiac surgery. HFNC is routinely employed by providers in the
      cardiovascular intensive care unit and is selectively employed in patients who are judged by
      the provider to be high-risk, along with other therapies: bi-level positive airway pressure,
      non-rebreather masks, among others. Currently, no high-quality clinical data exist to
      demonstrate that HFNC may decrease the risk of reintubation in this critically-ill adult
      population.

      To guide a future, larger, multicenter randomized controlled pragmatic clinical trial, a
      pilot study in a single, high-volume cardiovascular intensive care unit will be performed.
      The prospective, randomized, pragmatic pilot clinical trial will compare HFNC to provider
      choice of standard care in these high-risk patients.

      Randomization will occur at the time that the patient is deemed ready for extubation by the
      attending physician in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. Randomization will include two
      standard care options: HFNC or provider choice of standard care therapy. Reintubation and
      outcome data will be collected until patient discharge.
