      patients would follow the next process: assessment of blood loss intrapartum and 2 hours
      postpartum; laying the Bakri Balloon; assessment of blood loss, uterine contraction and
      complications after Bakri Balloon tamponade; further conservative surgical measures (uterine
      placation (B-lynch suture), arterial embolization; artery ligation; cervical cerclage) or
      even hysterectomy if necessary; recording the puerperium infection and involution of uterus.

      Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean Â± standard
      deviations or median with interquartile range. Differences between groups were assessed by
      Student's unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate.
      Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation method. To identify
      independent relationships and adjust the effects of covariates, multiple linear regression
      analyses were performed. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
