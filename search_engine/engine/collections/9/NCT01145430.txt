      I. To determine the recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib) given in combination
      with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) (PLD -
      40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) in patients with ovarian or breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the ABT-888 plus PLD combination. II. To determine
      the effects of ABT-888 on the pharmacokinetics of PLD. III. To determine the efficacy of
      ABT-888 plus PLD in ovarian and breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
