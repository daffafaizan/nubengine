      tolerance as compared to healthy age-matched individuals. In this controlled trial, patients
      with cTF will be randomized to either interval training, continuous training, or usual care.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of interval vs. continuous exercise training
      on:

      i) exercise capacity ii) vascular function iii) arrhythmogenic potential iv) parameters of
      inflammation, hemostasis and heart failure severity v) health-related quality of life adults
      with cTF
