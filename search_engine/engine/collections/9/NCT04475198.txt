    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult males
      and females of non-child-bearing potential to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ST-2427. This trial will include careful assessments of treatment
      effects on vital signs including cardiac and respiratory function and body temperature over a
      range of doses of ST-2427, administered as single doses. SiteOne Therapeutics, Inc. plans to
      use the safety, tolerability, and PK findings from this study to inform the doses and study
      design for Phase 2 clinical studies in subjects with acute post-operative pain.

      Approximately 18 subjects, 6 subjects into each of 3 cohorts, will be enrolled in this study
      at a single clinical site.

      Subjects will be randomized 4:2 to receive a single dose of ST-2427 or placebo in a Single
      Ascending Dose (SAD) design. The Study will evaluate 3 dose strengths of ST-2427, one dose
      level in each of 3 cohorts of subjects.
