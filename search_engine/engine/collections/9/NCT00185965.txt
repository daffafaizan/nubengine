    
      This is a single institution phase 1-2 trial to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy
      of CpG injections (4 intratumoral injections followed by 6 peri-tumoral injections) combined
      with local irradiation in patients with recurrent low-grade lymphomas.

      Patients will receive low-dose radiotherapy to a single tumor site on days 1 and 2 (2 Gy each
      day). CpG injections will be administered into the same tumor site within the 24 hours before
      and the 24 hours after the radiation, and on days 8 and 15. Weekly doses of CpG will be then
      administered subcutaneously in the region of previous injections for 6 additional doses.
