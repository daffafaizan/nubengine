      alveolar crest. In a recent radiographic study employing cone-beam computed tomography, a
      high prevalence of intraosseous defects 83% has been reported. Treatment of intraosseous
      defects is clinically challenging, as they often require complex regenerative periodontal
      therapy. Current regenerative techniques often employed in treatment of intraosseous defects
      demonstrate variation in improvement of clinical outcomes and degree of periodontal
      regeneration achieved.
