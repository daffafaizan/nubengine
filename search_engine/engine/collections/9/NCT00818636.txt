      has been associated with health improvements, reductions in symptoms of emotional distress,
      and one preliminary study found reductions in alcohol misuse among college students. Data
      suggest that expressive writing is a technique to facilitate emotional processing that can
      influence a number of clinical outcomes by facilitating cognitive restructuring (Hunt, 1998;
      Pennebaker, 2004). In addition to examining cognitive content change following expressive
      writing, we believe the effects of emotional writing on mood and drinking may involve two
      additional processes that have been found significant for both depression and alcohol misuse,
      namely experiential avoidance and ruminative thinking. We hypothesize that expressive writing
      will lead to less drinking and enhanced mood by reducing: (1) negative thought content, (2)
      experiential avoidance of unpleasant private events (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings,
      bodily sensations), and (3) ruminative thinking.
