      Calculation of sample size was done to detect a 15% difference in the VAS score between two
      groups detected that at least 27 patients were needed at an Î± error of 0.05 and 80 % power of
      the study. The number will be increased to 30 patients to avoid a 10% dropped out patients.

      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be done by Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences (SPSS) v25 (IBM Inc., Chicago, USA). Normality of data will be checked with
      Shapiro-Wilks test and histogram. Quantitative variables will be presented as mean and
      standard deviation (SD) and will be compared by unpaired student T test. Categorical
      variables will be presented as frequency and percentage (%) and will be analysed by the
      Chi-square test. P value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
