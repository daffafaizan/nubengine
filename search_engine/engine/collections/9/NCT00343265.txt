      part. Women will be randomized to get either vaginal progesterone gel or a placebo gel daily
      from study entry until 35 6/7 weeks. Women can enter the study between 16 - 20 6/7 weeks. Two
      hundred women will be recruited to take part. Data will be collected on the women and their
      infants to see if the active medication prolongs pregnancy.
