    
      The objective of this study is to conduct a double-blind prospective randomized control trial
      to determine if individualized hCG titration based on a patient's serum hCG level above or
      below the predetermined serum hCG level improves IVF outcomes, primarily sustained
      implantation rates. Patients who fall below the desired serum hCG threshold will be
      randomized to either maintaining their current dose of low dose hCG or being increased.
