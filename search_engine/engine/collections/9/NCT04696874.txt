      cryptorchidism. They may affect fertility following orchiopexy.

      Material and Methods: Data was collected retrospectively from six centers providing care for
      patients with undescended testicles from September 2017 to February 2019. All patients whose
      congenital anomalies of the epididymis or vas deferens were discovered incidentally during
      operative intervention for cryptorchidism and where photographs of the anomalies were taken
      were included.
