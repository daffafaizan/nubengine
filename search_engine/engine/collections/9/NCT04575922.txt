      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of ipilimumab
      and nivolumab for metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer but they have been
      approved for other uses.

      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both genetically-engineered antibodies. An antibody is a protein
      that can attach to specific molecular targets. Ipilimumab and nivolumab work by activating
      the immune system, which can help to fight certain cancers. This trial explores whether
      radiation therapy may increase the benefit from immune activation with ipilimumab and
      nivolumab.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will be in this research study for as long as the study interventions are safe
      and beneficial. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.

      Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by
      providing funding for this study, including the two study drugs.
