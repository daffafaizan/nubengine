      circulate in the blood as discs with an average volume of about 7.5 fimtolitre , 14 times
      smaller than erythrocytes. Platelets count in premature infant is slightly lower than that of
      healthy term infant but is still within the normal range (150,000 to 450,000 unit/ litre ).

      The most common risk factors for thrombocytopenia are

        1. Sepsis: Thrombocytopenia is a frequent problem in neonatal sepsis and is among the most
           predictive, independent risk factors for sepsis-associated mortality

        2. Low birth weight: It is recorded that thrombocytopenia was more common among the
           smallest patients; 85% incidence among those ⩽800 gram, 60% among those 801 to 900 gram,
           and 53% among those 901 to 1000 gram

        3. Perinatal asphyxia: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 31% of neonates with asphyxia versus 5%
           of matched non asphyxiated controls admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit

        4. Prematurity: In a normal pregnancy, the fetal platelet count reaches adult levels
           (150-450 × 106/ millilitre) by the second trimester of pregnancy. Thrombocytopenia ,
           defined as less than 150,000/ millilitre, occurs in 18 to 40% of all preterm neonates
           (gestational age <37 weeks) admitted to neonatal intensive care units
