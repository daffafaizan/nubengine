    
      Rationale:

      The study is designed as a prospective monocentric phase II trial. The choice of the
      therapeutic concept is governed by the risk group that the patient falls into. Risk groups
      are defined according to the classification by D' Amico.

      The following concepts will be used:

      HDR brachytherapy: 19,0- 38 Gy / 2-4 fractions (2-4 x 9,5 Gy)

      PDR brachytherapy: 35-70 Gy / 50 --100 pulses(1 puls/h, 24 h/d)

      Dose painting the timorous areas as seen in HistoScanning as covered with a dose
      Dref2>130-150%

      External beam radiotherapy will be used in addition to brachytherapy for intermediate and
      high risk patients. The following concepts will be used 50,40 Gy / 28 fractions at 1.8 Gy
