      design. Fifteen clinical centers will treat patients by inserting and immediately loading
      implants with two different surgical protocols. Each patient will receive two identical
      implants: after randomization, the test site will be prepared by ultrasonic microvibrations
      and the control site using twist drills. Both implants will be loaded with a provisional
      crown within 48 hours after surgery. For each inserted implant, collection of experimental
      parameters will be required up to 2 years after surgery.
