    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a 2-week
      run-in period with blinded CGM, followed by two 8 weeks study periods during which subjects
      will monitor daily glucose levels either with real-time CGM or SMBG in random order. Subjects
      will wear a blinded CGM for a 3-week period during the Control phase. A total of up to 40
      subjects (aiming for 30 completed subjects) aged 16 to 24 years with T1D will be recruited
      through diabetes clinics and other established methods in participating centres. Subjects who
      drop out of the study within the first 2 weeks of the first intervention period will be
      replaced.

      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the use of real-time CGM. Subjects will have
      regular contact with the study team during the study.

      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by
      CGM. Secondary outcomes are the HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above and below target,
      as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Measures of subject's responses in terms of
      daily diabetes management, diabetes distress and diabetes technology use and acceptance will
      also be evaluated in this study.
