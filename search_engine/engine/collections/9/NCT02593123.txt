      irradiation and rabbit ATG to facilitate stem cell transplantation (SCT) with HLA matched
      related and unrelated donors. Based on the hypothesis that early treatment interventions have
      significant late effects in allogeneic SCT, a simple intervention, varying the duration of
      intense immunosuppression following SCT, will be investigated in this study. This may allow
      more robust recovery of donor immune system cells in the first two months following
      transplantation and eventually result in lower risk of cancer relapse, while maintaining
      effective graft versus host disease (GVHD) control. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive GVHD prevention therapy using one of two different immunosuppressive regimens with
      tacrolimus & mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Patients assigned to the investigational group will
      receive MMF for 15 days following SCT with growth factor support using granulocyte macrophage
      colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) beginning on post-transplant day 4. Patients randomized to
      the standard treatment group will receive MMF for 30 days following SCT with cytokine support
      using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) beginning on post-transplant day 4. If
      one of these treatment groups demonstrates an improvement in donor immune cell recovery,
      there may be a slow increase in the likelihood of patients being assigned to that more
      successful treatment group. Eventually the two groups will be compared with respect to the
      likelihood of either relapse or GVHD developing.
