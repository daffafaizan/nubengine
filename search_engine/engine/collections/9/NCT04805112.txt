      western Kenya. The study will evaluate the impact of the provision of oral HIV self-testing
      on uptake of testing among partners of adolescent girls. We will randomize about 300 sexually
      active AG to either an intervention group that receives multiple oral self-test kits that
      they can choose to offer to their sexual partner(s) or to a control group that will be given
      multiple referral coupons that their partners can use for HIV testing at pre-selected HIV
      testing services (HTS) sites. We will collect data on whether the kits were offered, to whom
      they were offered, if they were accepted, if they were used and with what results, if known,
      and if the partners who obtained HIV-positive results sought confirmatory testing. We will
      also conduct in-depth interviews with a sub-set adolescents to explore their experiences in
      offering HIV self-testing to their male partners.

      This study has 4 specific aims: i) determine whether adolescent girls can safely offer oral
      HIV self-tests to their partners; ii) assess whether oral self-testing improves uptake of HIV
      testing among partners of adolescent girls; iii) document adverse events associated with
      offering oral self-testing to sexual partners of adolescent girls; and iv) qualitatively
      explore the experiences of adolescent girls when offering self-test kits to their partners.
