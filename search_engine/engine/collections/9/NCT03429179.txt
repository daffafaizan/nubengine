      orthopedic procedures under spinal anesthesia were included in this study. Patients were
      divided into two groups based on pre-operative anxiety score evaluated by the Amsterdam
      pre-operative anxiety and information scale before the surgery. And intramuscular midazolam
      0.05mg/kg as a premedication in preoperative room was given to patients before shifting into
      operation room. Patients in each group were randomly divided into butorphanol group and 0.9%
      saline group. The sedation score, the duration of reaching adequate sedation state and
      postoperative recovery were recorded.
