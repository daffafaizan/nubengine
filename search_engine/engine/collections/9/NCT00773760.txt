      of pain experienced (pain intensity and duration of pain) and in the degree of pain relief
      from analgesics. In experimental settings, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) at the MOR
      and COMT genes have been found to alter the response to opioids in in vitro models and in
      human.We will collect clinical data on one hundred patients undergoing surgery. We will
      obtain DNA extracted via PCR techniques from the patients' blood and we will identify SNPs at
      the mu opioid receptor and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes. We will analyze the data to
      search for correlation between clinical patterns of postoperative pain and opioid effects and
      SNPs.
