      Research has shown that these mothers, in particular, need better coping skills and ways to
      relieve depressive symptoms. Helping mothers of ill children achieve better mental health may
      also be beneficial to their children. Studies have shown that psychotherapy is an effective
      treatment for depression, and often results in long-term improvements in depressive symptoms.
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of MI-IPT-B in treating depression in mothers
      who bring their children to a child mental health clinic for psychiatric treatment.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either MI-IPT-B or
      facilitated referral to treatment as usual (F-TAU). Participants in both groups will undergo
      the same screening procedures following assignment to an intervention. The MI-IPT-B group
      will also receive one session of motivational therapy at the time of the initial screening
      procedures. Participants assigned to receive MI-IPT-B will report to the study site once
      weekly for therapy. This type of therapy will focus on improving the participants'
      relationships with their peers and the way that they perceive themselves. The F-TAU group
      will receive a referral for standard mental health care within the community health system.
      Both treatments will last 8 weeks. All participants will return to the study site at Week 14
      and Month 6 for follow-up assessments of depressive symptoms.
