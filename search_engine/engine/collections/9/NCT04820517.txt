      University's faculty of nursing.The data were collected using the Bergen Social Media
      Addiction Scale from 384 nursing students who accepted to participate in the study between 09
      January 2020 - 09 March 2020.From the scale developed by Andresan et al in 2017 and adapted
      to Turkish by Demirci in 2019, 110 nursing students who scored 3 or more out of at least 4
      out of 6 items or scored 18 or more out of the total score constituted the sample of the
      study.110 nursing students were assigned to the experimental and control groups (55
      experimental and 55 control groups) by block randomization.7 separate focus group sessions
      were held online between 01 September 2020 - 01 October 2020 with 55 student nurses in the
      experimental group. Using the literature and data obtained from the first stage of the study
      (analysis of focus group sessions), a strengthening program based on the Roy Adaptation Model
      was made.The necessary corrections and additions were made to the program by obtaining expert
      opinions from field experts regarding the program created. Empowerment program based on Roy
      Adaptation Model will be applied to 55 student nurses in the experimental group between 01
      February 2021 - 01 May 2021 through online group sessions. The Bergen Social Media Addiction
      Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale, which were applied
      as a pre-test in the first session of the application, will be applied as a post-test in the
      12th session.
