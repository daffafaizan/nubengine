        -  Determine the rate of complete and partial remission, remission duration, and relapse
           free survival after treatment with rituximab in patients with refractory or recurrent
           hairy cell leukemia who previously received cladribine.

        -  Determine the acute and long term toxicity of rituximab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over several hours once a week for 4 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
