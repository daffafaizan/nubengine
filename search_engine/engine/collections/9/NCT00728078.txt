      resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the recurrence rates after RFA were
      relatively high. Adjuvant therapies maybe reduce the recurrence rate. Phase 1 and 2 studies
      showed that thalidomide was a safety and effective treatment for HCC, especially for small
      HCC with liver cirrhosis. So we proposed that low-dose thalidomide adjuvant therapy will
      improve the disease progress free survivals and overall survivals after RFA for HCC.
