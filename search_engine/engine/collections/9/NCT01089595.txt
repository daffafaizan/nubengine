      implicated in imatinib resistance include: target resistance due to new KIT or PDGFRA
      mutations or over expression of the KIT protein; target modulation due to activation of an
      alternate receptor tyrosine kinase protein with loss of KIT oncoprotein expression;
      functional resistance due to KIT or PDGFRA activation without a secondary mutation; and
      alterations in imatinib uptake by P-glycoprotein.

      This study seeks to test nilotinib alone and nilotinib in combination with imatinib in
      patients that have progressed on imatinib.

      Nilotinib is a new synthetic second-generation inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that
      competes for the ATP-bindings sites of BCR-ABL. A completed phase I trial assessed the
      activity of nilotinib alone and in combination with imatinib in patients that have progressed
      on imatinib in a population of patients with imatinib refractory and intolerant patients.
      There were rare responses, but stable disease was observed in grater than 50% of patients.

      This study is aiming to treat patients with advanced or metastatic GIST who have disease
      progression on imatinib dose escalated up to 600 mg or greater. The rationale for exploring
      Nilotinib in this setting is to determine if it has therapeutic efficacy, with potentially
      less toxicity than the current standard of care for second line therapy. In addition, since
      it is not uncommon to see progression of some metastatic GIST lesions on imatinib, while
      others remain controlled, adding nilotinib may treat the progressing lesions while imatinib
      continues to control the areas without disease progression.
