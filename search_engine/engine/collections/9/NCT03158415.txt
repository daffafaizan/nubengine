      partnership with their parents, who are tasked with providing support and guidance. At this
      time, however, no structured education program exists for these parents. In addition, little
      is known about their learning needs, levels of distress, and readiness to provide appropriate
      guidance for their emerging adult children. This represents a gap in the literature and an
      opportunity to undertake exploratory research to learn more about this population so that
      meaningful education and support can be provided.

      Aim 1. To describe the lived experience and diabetes-specific educational needs of parents of
      young adults with type 1 diabetes who are transitioning to independence.

      Aim 2. To measure the effect of a mobile diabetes education program on diabetes distress
      levels of parents of young adults ages 18 to 25 years who are transitioning to independence.
