      VAMC or Emory University) with a primary complaint of dizziness will be recruited to
      participate in this study. Before beginning the study, the presence of normal vestibular
      function will be measured directly using standard vestibular function tests. Individuals will
      be randomly assigned to the vestibular exercise group (VR) or to the control group (CON).
      Data will be collected prior to the initiation of physical therapy and at the completion of
      the 6-week intervention period.

      The VR group will perform vestibular exercises plus balance and gait exercises. The CON group
      will perform saccadic eye movements without targets against a blank wall, as well as balance
      and gait exercises. The balance and gait exercises for each group will be based on identified
      impairments and functional limitations, as is the standard of care in physical therapy. All
      subjects within a group will follow the same exercise progression for the vestibular or eye
      movement exercises. Subjects will be seen in the clinic on a weekly basis to review and
      modify the exercises according to a standard protocol and to reinforce compliance.
