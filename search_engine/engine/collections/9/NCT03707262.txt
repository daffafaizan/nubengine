      improving the quality of life of patients with end stage renal disease, it is still hampered
      by the risk of graft rejection and the need for lifelong immunosuppression. Researchers have
      sought to circumvent these challenges through the use of combined kidney and hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation to induce immune tolerance. This study will build upon published
      reports showing favorable results for the TLI/rATG regimen in HLA-matched living donor
      transplant recipients. The investigators seek to confirm that patients treated with total
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) followed by human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant can be
      withdrawn from immunosuppressive drugs while maintaining normal renal function after renal
      transplantation. At serial time points, (1) graft function will be monitored, (2) chimerism
      will be measured in recipient white blood cell subsets, and (3) protocol biopsies of the
      graft will be obtained. An attempt will be made to discontinue tacrolimus at 12 months if the
      following conditions are met: (1) chimerism (defined as ≥5% donor type cells among the T
      cells, B cells, Natural Killer [NK] cells, and granulocytes) is detectable for at least 180
      days after CD34+ and CD3+ cell infusion, (2) stable graft function without clinical rejection
      episodes is maintained, (3) there is lack of histologic rejection on protocol biopsies, and
      (4) there is no evidence of graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Recipients in the proposed study
      will be given a target dose of ≥ 5 x106 CD34+ cells/kg and 5x106 CD3+ cells/kg with the goal
      of achieving durable mixed chimerism.
