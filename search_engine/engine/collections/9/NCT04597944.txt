      swelling; it can be disabling and disfiguring and the attacks affecting the larynx can be
      life-threatening.

      The clinical symptoms depend on accumulation of bradykinin (BK), a vasoactive peptide
      responsible for vasodilation and increase of vascular leakage. BK formation depends on
      activation of the kallikrein-kinin cascade leading to uncontrolled generation of plasma
      kallikrein and subsequent proteolysis of high molecular-weight kininogen (HK).

      Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, thereby
      preventing BK production; it represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for BK-AE
      prophylaxis.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the kallikrein inhibition by assessing the levels of
      cleaved HK and the immunogenicity of the lanadelumab.
