      randomly allocated to receive either a multi-ingredient, pre-workout supplement (PREW) or
      maltodextrin (CHO). Thereafter, the participants will take a 5-day microcycle, involving
      three resistance training sessions (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) intercalated with two
      endurance training sessions (Tuesday and Thursday). After the first interventional
      microcycle, and the 2-week washout period, the participants will switch to the other
      nutritional condition for continuation with the second 5-day identical microcycle.
      Assessments of muscle contractile properties via Tensiomyography on Vastus Medialis, Biceps
      Femoris Long Head and Anterior Deltoids will be taken before and after each resistance
      training session. Measurements of strength (Isometric Mid Thigh Pull) upper and lower body
      muscular power (Medicine Ball Throw and Vertical Jump) will be performed immediately after
      each resistance training workout. The supplements will be ingested 15 min before each
      training session, just before completing an energy feeling questionnaire. In addition, the
      perceptual response to training will be assessed during and 20 min after the completion of
      all workouts. The contribution of carbohydrate and fat metabolism will be estimated using a
      gas analyzer via the calculation of respiratory exchange ratio the (RER) during each
      endurance training session.
