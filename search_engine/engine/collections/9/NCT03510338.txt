      kinetics and extent of dispersion of the immediate release portion of the N4S001 tablet in
      the oral cavity, and to measure sildenafil and its main metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil,
      in the blood plasma. The study will comprise an open-label, four-treatment crossover study in
      up to 12 healthy male volunteers. All subjects will receive four treatments throughout the
      study. The initial fast onset release portion of each N4S001 tablet will be radiolabelled to
      enable the dispersion characteristics of this part of the formulation to be investigated
      in-vivo. The immediate release portion of the N4S001 tablet will be radiolabelled to contain
      approximately 4 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) at time of dose (TOD). Blood samples will be taken
      at pre-defined times to allow pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of drug absorption of the
      N4S001 tablet and of the reference product, Viagra 50 mg film coated tablets. Blood pressure
      will be recorded at set time intervals to assess the effects of the N4S001 tablet against the
      reference product. Subjects will also assess the taste acceptability of the N4S001 tablet
      using a 7-point categorical scale and oral examinations will be completed to assess any local
      oral effects of N4S001.
