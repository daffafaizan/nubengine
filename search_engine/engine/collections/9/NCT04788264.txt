      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of physical activity promotion in patients with head and
      neck cancer, which is defined as a clinically significant increase in the number of days per
      week that patients engage in physical activities.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate a satisfactory patient participation rate in the physical activity
      promotion of head-and-neck cancer patients.

      II. To demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in several detailed physical
      performance of patients, measured at baseline, 6-week (if applicable) and 12-week.

      III. To demonstrate a change in patient body weight as well as several biomarkers from
      baseline to 12-week.

      IV. To summarize patient responses in various patient questionnaires concerning patients'
      acceptability, feasibility and quality of life.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the difference in the magnitude of physical activity improvements between
      the immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 1 week prior to start of intervention, patients receive a Fitbit to monitor
      physical activity for 13 weeks. Patients receive consultation and personalized exercise
      prescription from a physical therapist at baseline, and attend exercise training sessions
      with a physical therapist during weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients also attend behavior
      modification sessions with a behavioral therapist that focus on goal setting and healthy
      behavior changes during weeks 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days.
