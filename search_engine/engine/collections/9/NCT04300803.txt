    
      This program is intended to provide access to patients with relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL
      who had at least one prior anti-CD20 containing regimen. Patients with primary refractory
      disease and double/triple hit status are also eligible. Patients considering this access
      program should have no other therapeutic option, and are not eligible for other clinical
      trials. The expanded access program (MOR208N001) is currently available in the United States
      only.
