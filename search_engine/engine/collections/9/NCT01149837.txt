      determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of HTLV type assignment using
      well-characterized samples from the NIH-funded HTLV Outcomes Study (HOST). The second
      sub-study will compare automated reading and interpretation of test results with manual
      reading and interpretation using a sub-set of samples tested in the initial study. The third
      sub-study allows for use of the InnoLIA HTLV I/II Score as a supplemental test for whole
      blood and HCT/P donors testing repeatedly reactive with an FDA-approved donor screening test
      for anti-HTLV-I/II.
