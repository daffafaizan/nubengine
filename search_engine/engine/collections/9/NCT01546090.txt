      in a double-blind manner, identical capsules of either 0.50 mg alprazolam or placebo 45
      minutes before the administration of a conventional IAN block. Access is begun 15 minutes
      after completion of the IAN block, and all patients profound lip numbness. Success is defined
      as no or mild pain based on visual analog scale recordings during access preparation and
      initial instrumentation.
