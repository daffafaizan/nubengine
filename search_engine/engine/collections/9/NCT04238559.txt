      2016 to assess subjective swallowing difficulties with medication intake and their practical
      consequences in ambulatory patients, the SWAMECO questionnaire. It consists of 30 items
      divided into 5 sections Complaints, Intensity, Localization, Coping strategies, and Adherence
      to medication. It was validated in people suffering from systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare
      multisystem autoimmune disease that often leads to swallowing problems with food and liquids
      with progression. The aim of this study is now to validate the questionnaire in the general
      population. Patients presenting in the community pharmacy with a prescription of at least 3
      different medications for a minimum of 3 months will fill in the questionnaire on site.
