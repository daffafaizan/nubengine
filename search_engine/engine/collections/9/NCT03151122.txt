      program as well as exam its impact on neurodevelopmental health of preterm infants.

      Research hypotheses:

        1. Compared to control group, the preterm infants in the interventional group will
           experience significantly better performance on neuromotor, cognitive and
           social-emotional function at corrected age of 3 month;

        2. In comparison with those receiving routine support, parents receiving nurse-led
           continuous support will have significantly higher parental self-efficacy and exhibited
           better psychological well-being;

        3. Maternal parenting self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between nurse-led support
           and preterm infant neurodevelopment.
