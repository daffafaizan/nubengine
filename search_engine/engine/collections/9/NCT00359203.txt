      ISSUE-2, an observational trial, showed that pacemaker was effective in reducing the 1-year
      first syncope recurrence rate from 33% rate before implant (ILR phase 1) to 5% rate after
      implant (phase 2). Moreover, the control non-asystolic group still continued to have a 41%
      recurrence rate after the first recurrence of syncope, thus supporting the conclusion that
      the reduction with pacemaker was due to the beneficial effect of pacemaker itself and not to
      other factors. However a formal controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings.
