      Chitosan that can help reduce AGE (advanced glycation endproducts) levels in patients with
      prostate cancer. Chitosan is a naturally occurring substance found in shellfish. This study
      will be using Chitosan prepared from the shells of cold-water shrimp. Chitosan is approved by
      the FDA for use in wound dressings and has been used in published clinical trials for weight
      loss but is not approved for the purposes of this study. AGEs are a type of metabolite, or
      substance, found in food and produced in the body. The researchers helping conduct this study
      have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. Participation in this study will
      require three study visits over the course of about 3 months. During these visits subjects
      will be asked to provide blood and stool samples as well as complete surveys about their
      quality of life.
