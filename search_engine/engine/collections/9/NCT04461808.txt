    
      This is a companion study of the other Italian studies on tomosyntesis as primary screening
      test for breast cancer: RETomo (NCT02698202), PROTEUS (NCT02590315), IMPETO (NCT03587259).
      The investigators conduct a randomized trial in three centres with a protocol that is similar
      to that of the other three studies. As for IMPETO and differently from the RETomo and PROTEUS
      studies, the intervention will be tomosynthesis + synthetic 2D.

      In the three centres about 8000 women will be recruited (4000 in the experimental arm and
      4000 in the control arm).

      The study will compare the performance of tomosynthesis plus synthetic 2D vs digital
      mammography in respect to incidence of advanced cancers (interval and following round) and
      interval cancers. Women 50 to 65 years old will be screened once according to randomization
      arm for one round, then all will be screened with digital mammography after two years.

      The investigators also will measure detection rates, specificity, interval cancers, advanced
      cancers occurring as interval cancers or at subsequent screens and allowing to estimate
      excess overdiagnosis comparing overall cumulative incidence after two or three rounds of
      screening.

      Women will be asked for informed consent when they attend the mammography. If they accept
      they will be randomised to one of the two arms.

      All examinations will be read by two independent radiologists, in case of discordance a third
      reading is asked.
