      intubation, the patients are randomized to receive rocuronium either 0,6 mg/kg or 1,2 mg/kg.
      BIS, Entropy and the biosignal collected with the Entropy strip are collected on a computer.
      The visible biosignal on the anaesthesia monitor is recorded with a video camera. BIS,
      Entropy, biosignal and video clip of the anaesthesia monitor will be analyzed in detail.
