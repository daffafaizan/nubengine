      study in patients with well-controlled celiac disease. Patients with confirmed CD diagnosis
      (biopsy) will be recruited to participate in the study. Informed consent must be obtained
      prior to performing any screening procedures. Patients who meet Visit 1 protocol enrollment
      criteria will be enrolled and begin the screening period. Patients that fail to meet
      screening period eligibility will be discontinued from study participation at Visit 2. At
      Visit 2, eligibility will be confirmed, adverse events will be documented at Visit 2.
      Patients who continue to meet eligibility requirements at Visit 3 will begin the treatment
      phase. During the treatment phase patients will self-administer treatment and gluten daily
      with their evening meal. At the end of the treatment period, Visit 4, patient eligibility
      will be confirmed and adverse events will be documented. The final visit, Visit 5, will be a
      safety follow-up visit.
