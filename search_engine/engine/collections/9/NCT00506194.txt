      Hyperglycemia may aggravate these defects, a feature known as glucose toxicity. Previous
      studies have shown that acute correction of hyperglycemia in subjects with long-standing type
      2 diabetes gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after discontinuation of
      insulin. The current study attempts to identify any characteristics of patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose >300mg/dL) who would have a long-term benefit, in
      terms of glycemic control, from a brief course of insulin therapy.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with severe
      hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dL or random blood glucose >400 mg/dL) will be
      hospitalized and treated with intensive insulin injection for 10 to 14 days. Oral glucose
      tolerance will be performed after one week of intensive insulin treatment. After discharge,
      patients will be randomized to receive insulin injection or oral anti-diabetic drug for
      further management. Patients will be followed in our clinics and adjust their medication
      according to their blood glucose levels. Oral glucose tolerance test will be repeated 6
      months later, whereas the insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function will be evaluated again.

      EXPECTED RESULTS-We will respect that short-term intensive insulin therapy can induce
      lone-term glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia.
