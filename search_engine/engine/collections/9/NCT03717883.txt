      worldwide. Progression of ADPKD is characterized by the proliferation of fluid-filled kidney
      cysts. Development of these cysts is progressive and can lead to end-stage renal disease and
      ultimately, renal failure in many patients. The most common extra-renal complication of ADPKD
      is the formation of liver cysts, which can vary from minor to extensive. Hepatic cysts can
      develop from medium-sized bile ducts and complications (i.e., cyst rupture, infection,
      obstruction of bile ducts, and compromised portal venous flow) can arise from increasing
      cystic burden. Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of endogenous molecules such
      as bile acids in ADPKD may indicate altered transporter function. Other endogenous molecules
      such as coproporphyrin (CP) I and III may be used as probes to assess hepatic transporter
      function.

      The objective of this study is to investigate and quantify ADPKD-associated alterations in
      endogenous molecule profiles (e.g., bile acids, CP) relative to subjects with non-ADPKD renal
      disease and healthy individuals, and to investigate specific hepatic transporter
      polymorphisms that may be related to the alterations. This is important because subjects with
      ADPKD may be predisposed to adverse reactions associated with some medications that require
      hepatic transporters for excretion.

      Potential study participants will be pre-screened over the phone and then scheduled for a
      2-hour study visit. All urine samples within the 2-hour interval will be collected from all
      participants along with clinical, physical and questionnaire data. Fasting blood samples will
      be collected at time 0 and 120 min.
