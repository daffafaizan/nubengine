      and preliminary efficacy of a guided imagery intervention to reduce RT-related symptoms of
      anxiety and depression in patients with HNC relative to treatment as usual. Treatment as
      usual contains no psychological interventions to aid in distress, however participants will
      have access to the psychosocial supports at the cancer center available to all patients.
      Patients will be randomized to either condition, and surveys of their well-being will be
      conducted throughout the study.
