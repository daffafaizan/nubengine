    
      The goal of the study is to develop an academic EF intervention, Teaching Academic Skills to
      Kids (TASK), for high functioning (i.e., IQ score â‰¥80) middle-school youth with ASD and EF
      deficits.

      Aim 1: Develop the TASK intervention targeting academic EF skills for middle school youth
      with ASD that is tailored to the unique needs of these individuals (e.g., content specific to
      ASD EF deficits, incorporate evidence-based teaching principles and methods for ASD). A
      methodologically rigorous, well-integrated iterative and collaborative design process with
      input from multiple stakeholders, including school mental health professionals, teachers,
      parents, and youth with ASD, will be utilized.

      Aim 2: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of TASK in 3 open trials including the
      feasibility of: 1) implementing the measurement protocol, 2) operationalizing intervention
      delivery, 3) assessing both trained and untrained areas of functioning, 4) assessing whether
      improvements in academic EF skills (proposed mechanism of treatment) are related to
      functional educational outcomes (e.g., homework behaviors, grades), and 5) exploring the data
      for potential treatment moderators (e.g., gender, severity). It is hypothesized that TASK
      will be feasible, acceptable (attendance, satisfaction), and will result in improved academic
      EF skills associated with reduced academic impairment and homework problems.
