      the gold standard for the differential diagnosis of an adrenal neoplasia. Thus we will only
      recruit patients scheduled for surgery for an adrenal mass of uncertain origin. Patients will
      be eligible for the trial when an adrenal mass has been discovered and standard imaging (CT
      and/or MRI) has not led to a clear characterization of the malignant potential of the lesion
      (Hounsfield units in unenhanced CT â‰¥10). In addition, patients with adrenal neoplasia will be
      only recruited when a hormonally active lesion has been excluded and surgery is planned
      because of a perceived risk of malignancy. Patients will be evaluated by both
      [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT. Computed tomography will be
      performed as low dose CT of the adrenal region. Imaging can be started with either
      [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT or [18F]fluoro- deoxyglucose PET/CT and can be performed at two
      consecutive days. The time interval between [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and
      [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT should not exceed 6 weeks. Patients will have a follow up
      visit 2-4 weeks after [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (or
      immediately before surgery, if earlier than 2 weeks post imaging). Thirty days after surgery
      patients will be contacted by phone for assessment of adverse events related to surgery.
