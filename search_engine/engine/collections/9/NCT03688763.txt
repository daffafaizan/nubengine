      for individuals with insomnia and has recently been rolled-out throughout the Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA; Manber et al., 2012). CBT-I includes behavioral (sleep restriction,
      stimulus control, relaxation exercises), cognitive (cognitive restructuring, mindfulness
      exercise), and psychoeducation (sleep hygiene) components. While CBT-I has been demonstrated
      to be a highly efficacious and effective intervention, it is a specialized intervention that
      can be costly and is in limited supply based on the level of training required and number of
      providers available. For this reason, digital administration of CBT-I has been examined and
      research has demonstrated initial efficacy among community samples (Ritterband et al., 2009;
      Vincent et al., 2009; Espie et al., 2012), with one platform, Sleepio, demonstrating efficacy
      compared to a placebo intervention (Espie et al., 2012; Espie et al., 2014). For this reason,
      the current study will utilize the Sleepio platform which provides an interactive, customized
      and tailored delivery of CBT-I.
