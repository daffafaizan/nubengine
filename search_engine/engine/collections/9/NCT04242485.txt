      performed during a competitive match may indicate incomplete recovery and prolonged
      fatigue.Therefore, the implementation of effective interventions aimed at favoring a faster
      recovery of athletes' cardiovascular homeostasis in the aftermath of a competitive match may
      be beneficial for greater adaptations to subsequent training and enhanced overall
      performance. In this regard, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a form of
      non-invasive manual treatment that uses a set of touch, manipulation and mobilization
      procedures to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness or injury. In the present study, the
      investigators sought to explore the efficacy of a single session of OMT in restoring
      alterations in cardiovascular parameters at rest and in response to an orthostatic challenge
      in trained adult male athletes long after (18-20 hours) a rugby union match.
