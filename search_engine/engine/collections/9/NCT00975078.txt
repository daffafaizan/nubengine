      dexamethasone-suppression-test will predict the development of adrenal insufficiency after 14
      days treatment with 0.5mg/kg of body weight prednisone in healthy volunteers. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects with a more suppressed cortisol level after
      dexamethasone will be more likely to develop adrenal insufficiency after 14 days intake of
      prednisone o.5mg/kg/body weight than subjects with less suppression of their cortisol levels
      after dexamethasone.
