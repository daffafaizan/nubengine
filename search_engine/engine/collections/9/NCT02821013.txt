      agents known as PD-1 inhibitors, or also with the names anti-PD-1 therapy, immunotherapy and
      checkpoint inhibitors. PD-1 inhibitors turn on the immune system, so that it can fight the
      cancer cells in the body. Clinical trials have shown that PD-1 inhibitors (such as
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab) can shrink tumours and extend the life of patients with
      melanoma.

      To-date, PD-1 inhibitors have been given to patients with melanoma continuously (non-stop),
      for as long as they remain beneficial, for up to a total duration of 2 years. The 2 year
      duration was chosen because doctors thought it was reasonable, and has been adopted as the
      standard or usual duration because it was shown to work in clinical trials. However, some
      recent observations suggest that PD-1 inhibitors may work just as well if they are given for
      a shorter time and/or in an intermittent schedule. Intermittent means to take breaks from
      receiving the drug when, and for as long as, the melanoma is better.

      The investigators doing this study are interested to find out whether patients with melanoma
      live as long when the PD-1 inhibitors are given continuously (non-stop) or in an intermittent
      schedule (taking breaks). If the two ways of giving the treatment were to be shown to be just
      as good, benefits of an intermittent schedule may include less clinic visits and side
      effects, better quality of life, and less cost over time for the Health Care System. However,
      this is not known at present.
