      of melanoma. There is also evidence that immune reactions are altered after UV exposure in
      the skin (locally) and perhaps throughout the body (systemically). Additionally, while the
      role of vitamin D and melanoma development has not been fully established, UV-B exposure is
      essential for vitamin D production in the skin. Increased sun exposure is also related to the
      presence of solar elastosis, which might protect (1) or improve survival from melanoma. Thus,
      melanoma represents a unique model for studying UV exposure, the immune system, and vitamin
      D. Malignant melanoma is an antigenic cancer; therefore, the role of UV exposure-induced
      immunosuppression and vitamin D production in the recognition, destruction and growth
      inhibition of cancerous melanocytes is worth further study.

      To underscore the importance of this project, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the
      Melanoma Research Foundation and the Steering Committee of the Society of Melanoma Research
      have indicated a need to collect more human data on the host immune response mechanisms in
      melanoma and also to focus on the skin as a whole microenvironment, moving away from only in
      vitro experiments.
