    
      Rationale: The size of the common bile duct (CBD) may influence the type of stent used and
      the type of the procedure performed in cases of EUS-guided biliary drainage. However, no data
      of the size of the CBD in patients with jaundice presenting with a pancreatic head mass or
      with a distal cholangiocarcinoma/ carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater are available.

      Objectives: To evaluate the size of the CBD in a large cohort of patients with jaundice
      secondary to pancreatic head or distal bile duct malignancy undergoing diagnostic EUS for
      tissue acquisition or evaluation of resectability and to establish factors associated with a
      dilation of the CBD greater than 15mm.

      Study design: International prospective observational multicenter trial. Study population:
      Patients â‰¥18 years old, referred for EUS-guided tissue sampling or evaluation of
      resectability of a pancreatic, a distal bile duct lesion or a carcinoma of the ampulla of
      Vater determining obstructive jaundice.

      Intervention: EUS examination Main study parameters/endpoints: measurement of the CBD in
      patients with an obstructive distal biliary mass. Determine the factors associated with a CBD
      greater than 15mm Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation,
      benefit and group relatedness: Measurement of the CBD during EUS examination does not add
      additional risks to the procedure.
