      corneal epithelial disorders that directly affect the epithelia.

      A Phase 1 study, Study SJP-0035/1-01, was conducted in healthy volunteers to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution, and to
      determine the appropriate dose to be evaluated in patients with moderate to severe corneal
      epithelial disorders. A Phase 2a study, Study SJP-0035/2-01, was conducted in patients with
      corneal epithelial disorders to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SJP-0035.

      This Phase 2a study (Study SJP-0035/2-02) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of 2 doses of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution in patients with corneal epithelial
      disorders. The study will evaluate if SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution is able to promote corneal
      epithelial wound healing in patients with corneal epithelial disorders using 2 doses of
      SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution (0.0002% and 0.001%) that are lower than what was used in the
      previous Phase 2a study (Study SJP-0035/2-01; 0.005%).
