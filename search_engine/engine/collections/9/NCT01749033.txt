      ELLIA technique involves gently lifting the patient's laryngeal structures (throat) while
      placing the LMA to oppose the force of gravity. Whereas the traditional method of placement
      involves guiding the LMA through the pharynx with a finger inserted into the pharynx, the
      ELLIA method avoids this step. General anesthesia will be maintained at the discretion of the
      Anesthesiologist throughout the surgical procedure. At the end of the case, as would normally
      occur, the LMA will be removed from the patient's airway and the patient will be taken to the
      PACU, where he or she will be cared for as usual. At one and two hours postoperatively,
      blinded research assistants will assess the patient for sore throat, hoarse voice, and
      difficulty swallowing. Finally, at 24 hours the patient will receive a telephone call from a
      blinded research assistant assessing for the same outcomes. These data will be collected and
      presented.
