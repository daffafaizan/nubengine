      issue. It has been estimated that upwards of 50% of antibiotic use is inappropriate. With
      this backdrop, a national strategic goal has been set by the United States White House to
      decrease inappropriate antibiotic use by 20% and 50%, respectively for inpatient and
      outpatient settings. In order to decrease inappropriate use, drivers of incorrect use must be
      identified at each local setting. The actual drivers of confirmed inappropriate use have been
      difficult to identify except when using time and resource intense chart reviews. Even the
      largest contemporary antibiotic consumption studies have not assessed appropriateness as it
      was 'outside of study scope'. Further, there is no consensus or agreement on what constitutes
      inappropriate use. These apparent omissions underscore the difficulty and complexity in
      attributing appropriateness of use for antimicrobials. Importantly, this study will focus on
      the MOST inappropriate use, which are defined as 'never events'. Previous work has shown that
      antibiotic use clusters over time. It is hypothesized that never events also cluster over
      time. Using electronic data capture strategies, an algorithm will be developed to quickly and
      accurately identify areas of antibiotic use concern. Secondly, a framework will be developed,
      utilizing antimicrobial consumption data and captured signals of inappropriate antimicrobial
      use to provide targets for antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
