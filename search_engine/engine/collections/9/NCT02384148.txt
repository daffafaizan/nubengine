      fibroblasts from healthy, obese and T2D subjects. Does circadian oscillator profile and its
      parameters (phase, period and amplitude) will differ between healthy individuals and obese/
      T2D patients? Skin biopsy will be performed in order to collect and culture skin fibroblast
      cells.

      In vivo bioluminescence recording will be performed in primary human skin fibroblast cells.
      The profiles obtained from 10 subjects in each group will be compared to their healthy
      counterparts.

      Bmal1and Per2 are clock genes. Lentiviral transduction of Bmal1-luciferase or Per2-luciferase
      in fibroblasts allow observation of circadian oscillations using bioluminescence assay.
      Phase, period length and amplitude are used to characterize the circadian rhythm.
