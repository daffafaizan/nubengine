      diabetes mellitus. Subjects in this non-commercial, monocentric, interventional study undergo
      autonomic function tests, a maximal ergospirometry and three questionnaires about the quality
      of life (EQ-5D-3L), the capacity to do physical activities (IPAQ) and the experience of
      possible symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in daily life (SCOPA-AUT). In this way the
      influence of type 1 diabetes mellitus on the quality of life, the exercise capacity and the
      autonomic function can be studied.

      The primary aim of this study investigates the potential correlations between the severity of
      diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) and both the quality of life and the
      exercise capacity. As a secondary aim, the influences of gender, age, number of years since
      diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, VO2 max predicted, maximal heart rate during exercise,
      minimal heart rate in rest, maximal RER (Respiratory exchange ratio) and relevant interaction
      terms are studied.

      In total 52 test subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 27 matched control subjects are
      selected to participate in this study.
