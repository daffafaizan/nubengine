      at least 3 months after the surgery despite healing of the operation area.

      However, it is still uncertain if the underlying physio-pathologic mechanism is due to
      intraoperative direct nerve injury or it is resulting from indirect nerve injury caused by
      inflammatory mesh. Post-operative chronic pain restricts the daily activities, causes anxiety
      and depression, increases use of analgesics and imposes a serious economic burden by
      increased use of health services and medical treatment. For this reason, today post-operative
      chronic pain is considered as an important complication of surgery. Researchers can list the
      risk factors of pain development as; age, weight, preoperative and postoperative pain,
      surgical method, recurrence, anesthesia method. Various oral non-steroid and/or opioid agents
      have been used in chronic pain treatment but nowadays interest in regional anesthesia
      approaches is increasing due to increased systemic side effects. Aim in this study is to
      evaluate the effects of postoperative ilioinguinal block implementation on chronic pain in
      patients who will undergo inguinal hernia operation with spinal anesthesia.
