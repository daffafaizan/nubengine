      immunohistochemistry. 24 hours after surgical procedure, 3 and 12 months of following, kidney
      function, complications and graft survival were registered. During surgical procedure, 3
      months and 12 months of following, biopsies were obtain to performed histopathological
      analysis of scale of Banff

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
