    
      To determine whether withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD in general
      practice effects:

        -  the frequency of exacerbations compared to a control group

        -  differences in health status compared to a control group

        -  differences in lung function compared to a control group

        -  changes in unscheduled care compared to a control group

        -  Direct and indirect costs compared to a control group

      Hypothesis

      The withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids from patients with COPD identified in primary care
      will cause an increase in frequency and severity of exacerbations and is not cost-effective.
