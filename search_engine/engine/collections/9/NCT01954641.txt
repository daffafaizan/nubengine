        1. Quality Improvement / Race specific feedback for providers regarding breast and lung
           surgery and adjuvant treatments.

           appointments

        3. Health Equity Training for cancer center staff at quarterly intervals

        4. Accure Navigation (based on special training regarding trust, culturally appropriate
           communication, and Kleinman's Patient Model of Illness)

        5. Additional efforts will be made to collect information on symptoms and side effect
           management from patients and medical charts.
