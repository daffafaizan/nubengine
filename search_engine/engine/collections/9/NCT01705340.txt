    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of MK-2206
      (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in combination with trastuzumab and lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate)
      in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer;
      two schedules of lapatinib administration will be examined-continuous daily dosing and
      pulsatile dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary assessment of the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 administered
      in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 blockade via trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in adult patients with a locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or
      gastric tumor.

      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in patients with advanced HER2-positive solid tumor.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in HER2-positive solid tumor patients with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway
      activation events, e.g., phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and other related gene mutations and
      expressions; to compare the HER2 and PI3K-PTEN mutation status of the primary tumor to
      metastatic tumor biopsy when available.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and lapatinib ditosylate.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15; lapatinib ditosylate
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 or on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17; and trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
