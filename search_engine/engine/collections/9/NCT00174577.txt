      augmentation in patients with major depression who failed to respond, or only partially
      responded, to an adequate trial of an antidepressant medication. Patients who met this
      criteria received adjunctive risperidone (1- 3 mg.) for an additional four-week treatment
      trial.

      Subject Population: A total sample of 84 patients completed the study at two sites (Rhode
      Island Hospital/Brown University, n=42, Emory University, n=42).

      Methods/Design: Patients who met criteria for unipolar depression and failed to respond, or
      partially responded, to an adequate trial of antidepressant medication were randomized to
      risperidone or a placebo for an additional 4 week treatment trial while continuing on the
      same dose of their antidepressant medication. Randomization was at a 2:1 ratio of risperidone
      to placebo.

      Data Analysis: Patient outcome (recovery status) of the two treatment conditions were
      compared using a MADRS rating < 10 to denote remission while improvement was defined as a 50%
      decrease from baseline to end of study. Odds ratio were examined to see if risperidone
      augmentation significantly affected the chance of recovery from depression at the end of 4
      weeks of treatment.
