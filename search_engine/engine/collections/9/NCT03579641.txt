    
      Subjects will be followed for approximately 12 months after the baseline visit to collect the
      required number of clinical events to support the study objectives. These events are called
      Reviewable Clinical Events, and include all-cause hospitalizations and Heart Failure
      outpatient visits.

      Clinical event definitions are as follows:

        -  Hospitalization (all-cause): the subject is admitted to inpatient hospital care and
           discharged on a different calendar date.

        -  Heart Failure Hospitalization: the subject is admitted with signs/symptoms of congestive
           heart failure and receives unscheduled augmented Heart Failure therapy with oral or
           intravenous medications, ultrafiltration therapy or other parenteral therapy.

        -  Heart Failure Readmission (30-day): the subject is admitted for an unplanned
           hospitalization for any cause within 30 days post discharge from a Heart Failure
           hospitalization.

        -  Heart Failure Outpatient Visit: the subject has signs/symptoms of Congestive Heart
           Failure, and receives unscheduled intravenous decongestive therapy (e.g., Intravenous
           diuretics, Intravenous inotropes, Intravenous vasoactive drugs, ultrafiltration) in a
           setting that does not involve a hospitalization (e.g., emergency room, Heart Failure
           clinic, primary care clinic, etc.).
