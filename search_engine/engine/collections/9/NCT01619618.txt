        -  To evaluate the frequency of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2
           (ABCG2), met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) (c-MET), and v-Ki-ras2
           Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) polymorphisms or mutations in this
           study population and the predictiveness of these polymorphisms on survival, time to
           progression, response rate, and toxicities.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells are analyzed for the
      frequency of ABCG2, c-MET, and K-ras polymorphisms or mutations by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR). Results are then correlated with patients' clinical outcomes and toxicity.
