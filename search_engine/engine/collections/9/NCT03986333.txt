      over-handicap for these children, because it causes many complications and may lead to a
      decline in self-esteem and to social isolation, altering the quality of life for patients and
      families. The therapeutic arsenal for the management of drooling includes rehabilitation
      techniques, oral drug treatments, local treatments or surgical treatments whose effectiveness
      is variable. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these therapies, standardized and valid
      assessment tools must be used. The Drooling Impact Scale (DIS) developed by Dr. Sue Reid's
      team in Melbourne in 2008, shows good validity and sensitivity to change, especially after
      botulinum toxin injection. It is commonly used in English-speaking studies, but no validation
      in French is available yet.

      The aim of this study is to present the French translation of the Drooling Impact Scale
      (DIS-F) and to explore its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change in a group of
      children with CP.
