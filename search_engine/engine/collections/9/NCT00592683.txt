      and/or DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) may play a therapeutic role in the management of mood
      disorders. EPA is an essential fatty acid, which can be metabolized to DHA and is a component
      of the human diet if fish is consumed. Aripiprazole is a novel second general antipsychotic
      that seems to function as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT 1A
      receptors as well as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor. Since it has a
      favorable adverse event profile in adults, it is an attractive choice for the treatment of
      youth with bipolar disorder if proven efficacious. Although pilot research showed that
      omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy treatment resulted in improvement of manic symptoms, the
      improvement is less dramatic than that observed in trials of antipsychotics. We will test the
      safety and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo as an adjunctive treatment to
      open-label aripiprazole in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.

      The proposed study includes 1) the use of a 12-week design to document the response rate 2)
      careful assessment of safety and tolerability
