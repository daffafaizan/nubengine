      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effect of ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) on time
           to clinical progression in patients with prostate cancer that has progressed on primary
           hormonal therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the objective response frequency in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Investigate the safety of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral ketoconazole three times daily and oral hydrocortisone twice daily on
      days 1-28 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 15-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
