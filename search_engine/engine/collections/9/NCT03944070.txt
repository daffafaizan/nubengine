      patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially in the era of
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Furthermore the issue of optimum
      treatment regimen that should be used in the peroperative period has never been addressed.
      Since the human life expectancy gradually increases, the number of patients who are under
      anti-VEGF intravitreal injections for wet AMD will be increasing accordingly. Cataract
      surgery in such patients, despite guarded prognosis has been proved to improve their visual
      function and quality of life. On the other hand, it has been shown that cataract surgery
      induces anatomic changes based on optical coherence tomography analysis, suggesting a
      subclinical susceptibility to postoperative cystoid macular edema or exacerbation of
      choroidal neovascularization. Therefore it is highly important to identify the optimum
      treatment regime, pursuing the best anatomical and functional postoperative results.
