      know if a similar prolongation of analgesia occurs when a local anesthetic is given
      neuraxially in combination with low dose intravenous dexamethasone. This project will
      investigate the efficacy of low dose intravenous (IV) dexamethasone in prolonging the
      duration of post operative analgesia provided by an intraoperative caudal injection of local
      anesthetic. All patients will be enrolled in the study the day of surgery, in the
      preoperative waiting area. The study will be explained by an anesthesiologist with extensive
      knowledge of the protocol. Computer randomization will occur for each patient. Randomization
      will not increase the risk to either group as all medications and techniques utilized for
      this study are commonly accepted for routine care for these patients.
