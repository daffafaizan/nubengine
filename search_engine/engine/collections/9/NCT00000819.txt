      insufficiency, and distinct nephropathologic changes. The syndrome most often occurs in
      patients with advanced HIV disease. Little is known about the effects of corticosteroids on
      the progression of HIV disease. In light of the possible beneficial effects of
      corticosteroids on HIV-associated nephropathy, a controlled trial using prednisone is
      warranted.

      Patients are randomized to receive prednisone or placebo for 11 weeks, followed by 13 weeks
      of observation.
