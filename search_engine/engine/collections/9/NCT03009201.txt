      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in
      subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

      II. To characterize the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ribociclib.

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily on days 1-7, and doxorubicin hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients without disease progression after 6 cycles receive ribociclib PO daily
      on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every
      12 weeks for 12 months.
