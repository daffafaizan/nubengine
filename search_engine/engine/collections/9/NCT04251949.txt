    
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment of radio- or
      radio-chemotherapy-induced early stage mucositis (stage 1 and 2) by photobiomodulation using
      LED lamp (PLED) in terms of controlling the mucositis assessed at the end of radiotherapy or
      radio-chemotherapy treatment.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  To assess the pain evolution over-time, both overall over the evaluation period until
           the end of radiotherapy and at each session

        -  To assess the needs of level 3 analgesics (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone)
           during the PLED protocol.

        -  To assess the quality of life variation between inclusion and the end of treatment by
           radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy.

        -  To estimate the frequency of radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy treatment (temporary or
           permanent interruption, dose modification), and eventually, the reason of this
           modification.

        -  To assess the feasibility of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in this context.

        -  To assess the tolerability of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in a short term.

        -  To assess the frequency of the needs of nutritional support by nasogastric tube or
           gastrostomy tube during the PLED protocol.

        -  To assess the weight and general condition variation during the treatment.
