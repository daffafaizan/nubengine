    
      Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSP) is a chronic, debilitating painful condition
      affecting quality of life in 20%-50% of persons living with HIV. Treatments prescribed to
      manage DSP pain, such as nonnarcotic and narcotic analgesics, antidepressants and
      anticonvulsants, are largely ineffective. Effective management of DSP pain is an unmet
      therapeutic need for this population. This study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial of the efficacy of Acupuncture/Moxibustion (Acu/Moxa) for HIV DSP
      pain/discomfort.

      Subjects with HIV-related lower limb DSP pain are randomized to one of four Conditions: 1)
      Standard (fixed) protocol Acu/Moxa, 2) Individualized (tailored) protocol Acu/Moxa, 3) Sham
      Acu/Placebo Moxa (control), or 4) WaitList (control). Subjects attend six weeks of twice
      weekly treatment sessions and 3 non-treatment follow-up sessions at weeks 9, 11, and 15. All
      subjects are assessed by a blinded diagnostic acupuncturist (DA) and those assigned to
      Conditions 1, 2 and 3 receive treatments by an unblinded treating acupuncturist (TA).
      Specific Aims are: #1 determine group differences in weekly average pain (Gracely Pain Scale)
      at the end of treatment (Tx) and end of follow-up (F/U); SA#2 determine group differences in
      improvement in specific sensory symptoms (Subjective Peripheral Neuropathy Screen and
      neurological sensory testing (NST)) and patient-rated effectiveness (Clinical Global
      Improvement, NIH PROMIS Pain Intensity and Health-Related Quality of Life (MOS-HIV)) at Tx
      and F/U; SA#3 determine group differences in safety profiles; and SA#4, explore how baseline
      measures, TCM diagnoses, NST and pain medication use predict response to treatment.
