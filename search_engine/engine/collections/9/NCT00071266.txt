    
      This is a Phase 3, 32-week, double-blind, diet-intervention, randomized, parallel group,
      ten-arm, multi-center, multi-national, dose titration study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of NL in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NL in patients with
      IC. The primary efficacy analysis will be the percent change from baseline in Peak Walking
      Time (PWT) calculated from the natural logarithm of the ratio of the time walked on treadmill
      at the Week 32 Visit divided by the time walked at baseline. Other efficacy measures will
      include Claudication Onset Time (COT) percent changes from baseline to Week 32 , changes in
      Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), Quality of Life (QoL) percent changes at Weeks 20 and 32, lower
      limb amputations, composite of cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, and vascular death), and
      coronary and peripheral artery revascularizations. Safety variables will include serum
      transaminases, routine chemistry parameters, hematology, and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic
      analyses will be conducted as well.
