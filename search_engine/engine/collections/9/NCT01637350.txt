      cancer with type 2 diabetes. Subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction and total
      gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction may help to improve glycaemic control which
      includes fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, C
      -peptide and body weight of gastric cancer patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The investigators will observed fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, C -peptide and body weight of the patients preoperation, 14 days
      postoperation 3 month and 6month postoperation. The investigators will observed the effect of
      blood glucose to different digestive tract reconstruction after gastrectomy of gastric cancer
      with type 2 diabetes
