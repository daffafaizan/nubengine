      to determine whether external ear-size is non-inferior to weight for LMA size selection in
      pediatric surgical patients.

      INTRODUCTION:

      The Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is widely used in pediatric population. The manufacturer
      recommends the size of LMA to be used in children should be based on actual body weight.
      However, this method has several limitations, the range of weight for a particular size is
      very wide, it may not be appropriate for overweight or underweight children as it is based on
      actual body weight rather than ideal body weight, in emergency situations where weight of the
      patient is unknown the correlation between weight and size of LMA is impossible, and finally
      weight based recommendation may not be suitable as development of the child's oropharyngeal
      cavity is related to height and age rather than weight. All these factors may lead to
      inappropriate size selection, which may result in larger sized LMA causing trauma/injury to
      the airway and smaller ones causing obstruction or insufficient ventilation. To overcome
      these concerns various alternatives to weight based technique have been tried by different
      researchers in both adult and pediatric patients, one of them is external ear size.
      Literature revealed differences in external ear size dimensions in different ethnic
      population and the investigator's literature search failed to reveal any local data/study in
      Pakistani pediatric patients where external ear size was compared or used for size selection
      of the LMA. The investigators therefore would like to know whether the external ear size
      based method can be used for LMA size selection in pediatric surgical patients in Pakistan.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      External ear-size based technique is not inferior to weight based technique for LMA selection
      in pediatric population.
