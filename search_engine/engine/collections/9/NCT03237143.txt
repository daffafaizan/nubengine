      vascular ED, of more than three months and with an erection hardness score (EHS)(17) of three
      or less, treated between April 2014 and February 2015 in the Boston Medical Group male sexual
      health clinics of twelve cities in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Coruña,
      Bilbao, Malaga, Zaragoza, Murcia, Alicante, Cordoba and Jerez) and four in Mexico (Altavista,
      Reforma, Monterrey and Naucalpan), were reviewed. The researchers excluded patients with ED
      caused by side effects from drugs or spinal cord injury; situational ED (obvious
      psychological origin); lesions, loss of skin or penile implant; and patients who did not
      adequately complete the LI-ESWT (Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy).

      After the initial assessment and diagnosis consultation, each patient received a treatment of
      5 sessions (1 session per week) of 20 minutes of LI-ESWT, carried out with the DUOLITH SD1
      (Storz Tägerwilen, Switzerland). They received 3,000 impulses per session at 0.1 mJ/mm2,
      divided over six sites, four on the penis and two on the crura. All sessions were outpatient
      visits and no anaesthetic was used. The EHS for all patients was measured at three stages:
      before the first session, at the end of the last session (5 weeks after the first session)
      and one month after the last session. When patients were receiving concomitant drug treatment
      for their dysfunction, they were asked to indicate their perception free of the effect
      thereof. All the clinical information was recorded by qualified physicians on a standardised
      form using centralised software on a secure server.
