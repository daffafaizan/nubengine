      Insomnia exacts health and economic consequences well beyond inadequate and non-restorative
      sleep. It increases healthcare costs, causes or adds to medical and psychiatric
      comorbidities, cognitive impairments, accidents, absenteeism and reduced quality of life.
      Treatment of insomnia is difficult and usually needs a multimodal approach incorporating
      various cognitive and behavioral approaches in addition to medication treatment. TMS and
      other neurophysiological studies have shown presence of a diffuse cortical hyper-arousal in
      patients with chronic insomnia. High frequency TMS (>1 Hz) has been shown to be activating
      whereas low frequency TMS (<1Hz) has been shown to be inhibitory in clinical and
      neurophysiological studies. TMS has been approved as a treatment of depression in patients
      who have not responded to a trial of at least one antidepressant medication. The goal of this
      study is to translate the knowledge learned from neurophysiological studies of insomnia to
      the clinical treatment of insomnia using TMS as the primary modality.

      Aim: Compare the change in insomnia scores between baseline and end of treatment with
      bifrontal low frequency TMS stimulation in 20 patients with primary insomnia using daily
      stimulation of 3 weeks (15 week days).
