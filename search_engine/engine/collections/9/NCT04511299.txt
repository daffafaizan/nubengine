      nutrition for at least 3 days. Subjects are classified into two groups. Group 1 received
      standard IVFE and group 2 received ω-3-enriched IVFE. The type of intravenous standard and
      omega-3-enriched fat emulsion used in this study are Lipofundin 20% and SMOFlipid 20%,
      respectively, both administered for three consecutive days after surgery (72 hours) in 1-4
      gram/kilogram/day dosing. The inflammatory response (IL-1β and IL-8 levels) and fatty acid
      composition are checked from blood plasma. Blood examination is done before the surgery and 3
      days after the surgery.
