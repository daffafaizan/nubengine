    
      This study is a randomized, prospective interventional study of pregnant patients presenting
      to the emergency department with complaints of pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding. This
      study will be conducted at 4 sites across the United States. Patients who are eligible and
      consent to participate will be randomized to one of two conditions; 1) a pelvic ultrasound
      that is performed by a certified emergency department attending or physician, or 2) a pelvic
      ultrasound that is performed by a certified radiology technician (standard-of-care). The time
      to diagnosis and emergency department length of stay between the two groups will be compared.
