      recruit post-menopausal female patients with solid stool fecal incontinence. The
      investigators hope that subjects taking a daily fiber supplement will experience reduced
      episodes and symptoms of fecal incontinence, measured through quality of life questionnaires
      and daily stool and food diaries. Subjects will undergo 2 anorectal manometry procedures.
      Stool samples will also be collected for metabolomic and metagenomic analysis.
