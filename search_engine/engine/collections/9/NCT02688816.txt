    
      This is a cross-sectional study taking place at cervical cancer prevention clinics in Lusaka,
      Zambia to determine the test performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value, and negative predictive value) of (1) visual inspection with acetic acid,
      (2) Xpert HPV, and (3) OncoE6 for the detection of CIN2+ among HIV-infected women. All
      cervical screening tests will be evaluated against a gold standard of histopathology obtained
      from cervical biopsies.
