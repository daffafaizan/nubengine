      contraction with delayed left ventricular activation, interventricular motion abnormalities,
      and worsening of left ventricular ejection fraction. His pacing is preserving a synchronous
      contraction and may prevent a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction.

      The aims of our crossover, double-blinded, randomized study is to evaluate the feasibility
      and long-term safety of permanent His pacing and to compare the effects on left ventricular
      ejection fraction of permanent His pacing with those of conventional right septal stimulation
      after 12 months treatment in patients with 2nd or 3rd degree AV-block.
