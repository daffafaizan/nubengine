      assessed weekly for any side effects they may be experiencing.

      Patients will have follow-up visits 4 weeks after proton therapy ends, at 6 months, 12
      months, and then every year for up to five years after treatment. Follow-up visits will
      include a physical examination, radiological imaging (if necessary), echocardiogram, and
      laboratory tests.
