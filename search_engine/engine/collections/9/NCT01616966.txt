      the hypothesis, that sevoflurane would cause less vocal cord injuries than an intravenous
      anaesthesia with propofol. Sixty five patients were randomly assigned to the SEVO group
      (anaesthesia with sevoflurane) or TIVA group (anaesthesia with propofol). Vocal cord injuries
      were examined by stroboscopy before and 24 and 72 h after surgery; hoarseness was assessed up
      to 72 h.
