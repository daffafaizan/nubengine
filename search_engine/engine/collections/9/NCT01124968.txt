      and it could lead to a lower quality of care and less job satisfaction. Not all primary care
      demands need a face to face encounter so incorporating new technologies into daily practice
      care such as communication doctor/nurse-patient through a website could be part of the
      solution. So we designed a study in order to assess the impact of the use of virtual
      consultation on frequency of attendance and the satisfaction of patients and professionals
      with the service.

      It is a before after quasi-experimental multi-centre study with no control group. Agreed
      voluntarily to participate 13 primary care centres, 20 primary care physicians, 17 nurses
      them having 16.720 reference adult patients. We designed a website where participants can
      access the internet and consult their doctor/nurse, who will answer within 48 hours at
      maximum. The intervention will last 6 months.

      We believe that the site can be useful by both patient and professional. For some types of
      patient, the use of the site may increase its accessibility, reduce face to face
      consultations and improve satisfaction, while the professional makes a more efficient
      practice.
