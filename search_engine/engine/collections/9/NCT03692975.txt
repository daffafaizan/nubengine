      suggestive of MS called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Cognitive impairment concerned
      several cognitive domains including episodic memory, attention, working memory and executive
      functions. It is recognized the negative impact of cognitive impairment on quality of life
      and vocational status in patients living with MS. Slowness of information processing speed is
      the main cognitive dysfunction observed in MS seen at the earliest stage of the disease.
      Recently an international group of MS experts has explain IPS and episodic memory as the
      minimal cognitive assessment in patients with MS. Visuospatial and verbal episodic memory
      deficits have been observed in 18 to 28% of patients assessed after a CIS.

      Memory disorders could be preceded by microstructural abnormalities without visible atrophy
      in hippocampus. A recent MRI imaging of diffusion called NODDI (Neurite Orientation
      Dispersion and Density Imaging) can measure specifically microstructural abnormalities and
      map the axons in white matter and dendrite in the gray matter. No study has used the NODDI in
      CIS patients and very few studies have been conducted in MS.

      The hypothesis is that the dentate gyrus is the anatomical substrate of early episodic memory
      dysfunction in patients included after a CIS.

      The identification of predictive MRI biomarker of memory impairment would be a useful and
      clinically relevant prognostic marker at the early stage of MS. This biomarker could
      contribute to determine the prognosis of the disease and could help for the monitoring of the
      patients in clinical practice and clinical trials.
