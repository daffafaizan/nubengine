    
      Thirty-five heart-failure patients will be included in a prospective, monocentric,
      active-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study with randomized sequence of treatments
      sacubitril+valsartan or valsartan alone. After open-label dose finding and washout patients
      will be randomly assigned to the treatment sequence [sac+val --> val] or [val --> sac+val].
      The two treatment periods of 4 weeks duration will be separated by 2 weeks of washout. At the
      end of both treatments the state of the cardiovascular system and its control will be
      measured.
