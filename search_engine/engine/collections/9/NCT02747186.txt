    
      Specific Aims:

      Compare clinical depths of pulpal anesthesia for maxillary molar and canine teeth at 30min
      intervals post injection after maxillary field block anesthesia with buffered 1% lidocaine
      with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000
      epinephrine.

      Hypotheses:

      No differences exist in anesthetic depth for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral injection for
      maxillary field block anesthesia between buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as
      compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine.

      Study Time Frame: 6 months: Month One Recruit 24 volunteers as subjects, Prepare case-books.
      Months Two-Three Clinical Study. Months Four-Five Analyze Lab data. Month Six Prepare
      Abstracts, Papers Methods: Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design, Recruit subjects with
      Institutional Review Board approved consent at University of North Carolina. Subjects will
      serve as their own controls in a cross-over AB/BA study design which is uniform within
      sequences, uniform within periods, and balanced. Randomized subjects to be injected orally
      for maxillary field block (Posterior alveolar, Anterior alveolar, Palatal sensory nerves)
      alternatively with 4cc of buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine and 4cc
      non-buffered of 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine.

      Assessment: pre, and post-anesthetic administration for pulpal anesthesia with cold,
      electronic pulp test at maxillary molar and canine at 30 minute intervals.
