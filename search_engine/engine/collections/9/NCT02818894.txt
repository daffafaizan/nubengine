      telephone questionnaires after randomization to lidocaine or bupivacaine spinal anesthesia to
      see how they are feeling after their total hip arthroplasty (THA). Transient neurological
      symptoms, urinary retention, timing of full mobilization, incidence of hypotension, and
      length of hospital stay will be recorded for both methods of spinal anesthesia for
      comparison.
