    
      Primary Objective To determine how rapid vitamin D supplementation affects biomarkers and
      submaximal exercise capacity in systolic HF patients with low vitamin D status.

      Working Hypothesis 1: HF patients when supplemented with vitamin D for 6 months will have
      lower measures of inflammation and extracellular-matrix remodeling compared with placebo.

      Working Hypothesis 2: HF patients when supplemented with vitamin D for 6 months will have
      longer 6-minute walk length compared with placebo.

      Secondary Objectives To establish a relationship between the CYP2R1 variant and surrogate
      markers in systolic HF patients.

      Working Hypothesis 3: HF patients with the CYP2R1 G allele will have higher measures of
      inflammation and extracellular-matrix remodeling compared to AA subjects. This relationship
      will also be seen in subjects with the CYP2R1 TagSNP variants.

      Working Hypothesis 4: HF patients with CYP2R1 variant alleles will have shorter 6-minute walk
      length compared to subjects without these variants.

      To genotype HF subjects for the VDR variants and additional tag SNPs, to ascertain the
      relationship between VDR genetic variation and surrogate markers in systolic HF patients.

      Working Hypothesis 5: HF patients with VDR variants will have greater measures of
      inflammation and extracellular-matrix remodeling compared to subjects without VDR variants.

      Working Hypothesis 6: HF patients with VDR variants will have a shorter 6-minute walk length
      compared to subjects without these variants.
