    
      90 minutes after combined epidural spinal catheter insertion, three different volumes (5 mL,
      10 mL, and 20 mL) are administered with a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) device
      through the epidural catheter. For each group, 0.625% bupivacain + 2 Î¼g/mL fentanyl, is
      administered.

      The visual analog scale, first analgesic demand time, the number of PCEA requirement per
      hour, morphine requirement, nausea-vomiting, itching, motor block, hypotension, and total
      consumed analgesic, and ephedrine amounts of the patients are recorded in the recovery room
      and at postoperative 2, 4, 6, 12 hours.
