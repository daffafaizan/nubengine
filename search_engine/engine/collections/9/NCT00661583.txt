      to reduce intraocular pressure, is scarring of the opening. This scarring prevents fluid
      drainage and interferes with the proper functioning of the bleb. MMC (Mitomycin C) is usually
      administered intraoperatively, to reduce scarring and increase filtration. However, the
      failure rate of trabeculectomy remains high. Anti-VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor)
      agents have been used successfully in cases requiring bleb needling. The purpose of the study
      is to determine the safety of the combination of ranibizumab and MMC vs monotherapy MMC in
      patients with glaucoma.

      This is an open-label, Phase I/II safety study of 30 patients randomized to either treatment
      with ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreally injected (n=10), combination ranibizumab 0.5mg
      intravitreally injected and MMC (0.4 mg/ml for 2 min) in eyes after trabeculectomy (n=10) or
      MMC therapy alone (n=10).

      For the ranibizumab groups, a repeat injection of ranibizumab 0.5mg may be given PRN (as
      needed) at 1 month if hypervascularity or neovascularization of the conjunctiva exists.
