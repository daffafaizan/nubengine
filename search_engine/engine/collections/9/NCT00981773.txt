    
      To assess the safety, changes in platelet reactivity, plasma cardiac biomarkers and metabolic
      parameters in HIV 1 infected subjects undergoing a switch in ART from a nucleoside containing
      regimen which includes abacavir and / or didanosine to a maraviroc containing regimen.

      40 HIV-1 infected subjects currently receiving stable antiretroviral therapy consisting of a
      boosted protease inhibitor and two NRTIs including abacavir and / or didanosine will be
      recruited. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two arms:

      Arm 1 (immediate switch in antiretroviral therapy)

        -  Continue current boosted protease inhibitor

        -  Switch NRTI backbone to maraviroc 150 mg bid

      Arm 2 (continue current antiretroviral therapy)

        -  No change to current antiretroviral therapy for twelve weeks

        -  After twelve weeks switch therapy as per Arm 1

      Subjects will be followed up for 48 weeks and will attend for clinic visits at screening,
      baseline, weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48. Platelet reactivity, inflammatory and cardiac
      biomarkers and markers of T cell activation will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week
      24.

      Following completion of the study subjects may continue their study antiretroviral regimen or
      switch to an alternative regimen at their clinician's discretion.
