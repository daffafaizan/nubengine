      and intermittent opportunity to maintain skills in managing delivery complications and acute
      newborn and pediatric conditions. Interventions like effective resuscitation assistance at
      the time of birth are lifesaving. Every 30 second delay in establishing effective
      resuscitation at birth increases the risk of death by 16%. The purpose of this study is to
      test whether medical simulation can improve acute care skills and confidence related to
      maternal and pediatric care emergencies.

      A solid body of evidence now supports simulation-based learning as superior to didactic
      teaching and problem-based learning for the acquisition of critical assessment and management
      skills, particularly for clinical emergencies. Simulation-based training promotes skill
      acquisition and retention, enhances teamwork, and increases knowledge and understanding of
      key procedures. Simulation-based learning is now the norm in medical, nursing and paramedical
      training in most high income settings. There remains a critical need to operationalize
      simulation-based learning in resource-constrained settings
