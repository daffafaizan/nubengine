    
      This is a single-center, open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study
      investigating the effect of abiraterone acetate on levels of testosterone and
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in bone marrow plasma of patients with metastatic CRPC and
      evaluating the difference in bone marrow androgen levels between patients with and without
      serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline. Approximately 60 medically or surgically
      castrated male patients with metastatic CRPC will be enrolled. The study will consist of
      screening, treatment, and follow-up periods. Patients will be treated orally (by mouth) with
      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice a day until clinical disease
      progression. Follow-up will continue until the patient dies, is lost to follow-up or
      withdraws informed consent. Bone marrow aspirates will be collected at Week 1 (predose), Week
      9, and the final study visit. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
