    
      This is a Phase 2, single arm study of a tailored immunotherapy approach with nivolumab in
      adult (â‰¥ 18 years) subjects with previously untreated (1st line)* or pretreated (2nd and 3rd
      line), surgically unresectable or metastatic TCC (further designated "advanced TCC"). The
      study targets to recruit 130 untreated (1st line) and 120 pretreated (2nd / 3rd line)
      patients, respectively. Tumor tissue obtained at least 2 years prior to screening must be
      available for a central pathology assessment. Subjects must have advanced (not amenable to
      curative surgery or radiation) or metastatic TCC, and must not have received more than two
      prior platinum-based chemotherapies for the treatment of advanced TCC.

      [*Update from Jan-2020: First-line cohort was stopped and the inclusion of these patients was
      terminated. According protocol v.5.0 80 2nd/3rd-line patients need to be included]
