        -  Compare the efficacy of doxorubicin with or without ranpirnase in patients with
           malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma.

        -  Compare the safety profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to disease histology (epithelioid vs nonepithelioid) and CALGB groups
      1-4. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive ranpirnase IV over 30 minutes weekly followed by doxorubicin IV.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression. Patients demonstrating evidence of clinical response or stable disease may
           continue on maintenance therapy with ranpirnase as a single agent until disease
           progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin as in arm I for up to 6 courses. Quality of life is
           assessed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
