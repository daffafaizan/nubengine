      use particulate graft devices.The purpose of this study is to examine whether coral particles
      of 300-450um in comparison to coral cones of 4-5mm wide and 8-10 mm long will preserve
      alveolar ridge of maxilla or mandible when grafted immediately after tooth extraction.

      Methods: 10 patients adults that are diagnosed for extraction of same tooth number ,each on
      different side of jaw. A non traumatic extraction will be performed, on both sides, sometimes
      not on same date. After extraction, coral device 'CoreBone500' sterile particles will fill
      the extraction site. Usually 0.3cc will be used. On the other side of same jaw 'CoreBone'
      Cone sterile of 4-5mm width and 8-10mm height will be placed in socket. Sutures will be
      placed and efforts will be put in covering the opening by soft tissues. Follow up of the
      alveolar ridge preservation will be performed using CT at time of grafting and 6 month later.
      Measurements during follow ups will be performed by caliber the width and height of alveolar
      ridge 2 weeks, 3month and 6 month follow up. A clinical follow up of healing soft tissues
      after grafting and patients complaints of pain will be addressed. If any unusual complaints
      from patients appears the study will be terminated immediately. From our preclinical studies
      no adverse effects were found. The analysis of data will be statistically analysed and
      compared to published data. We expect that CoreBone Cones are more effective in ridge
      preservation.
