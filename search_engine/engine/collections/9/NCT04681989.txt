      care to reduce impairments and improve confidence to manage impairments. The research team is
      positioned to pilot test MOVE-ABC to address (a) self- management of breast cancer-related
      impairments via patient-centered booklet and video each impairment identified by our breast
      cancer survivors; (b) instruction on self-management of impairments with the "Moving On"
      booklet and video (Attachment 4.1); and (c) weekly follow-up (up to 1 month after the end of
      breast cancer treatment) to answer questions, concerns and review "Moving On". This research
      also supports a small but growing number of studies that point to self-management
      interventions informed by rehabilitation as a means to fill this gap in usual care. The
      investigator has already piloted the "Moving On" intervention among surgical candidates for
      breast cancer surgery. The question remains whether "Moving On" is acceptable and feasible
      for breast cancer survivors who have already completed their breast cancer treatment and are
      just beginning to execute their breast cancer survivorship plans.
