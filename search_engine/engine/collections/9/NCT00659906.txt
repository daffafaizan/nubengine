      body composition (bone, muscle and fat). Treatments disrupt normal bone and energy balance
      resulting in bone and muscle wasting and fat gain. Premenopausal women are at greatest risk
      for these declines because most are thrust into early menopause from chemotherapy. Hormone
      manipulation therapy (i.e., tamoxifen or arimidex) may further affect these tissues. Exercise
      can prevent bone and muscle loss and promote fat loss. However, the ability of exercise to
      reverse unfavorable changes in all components of body composition in women experiencing early
      menopause from breast cancer treatment has not been specifically studied.
