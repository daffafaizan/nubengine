      patients where appropriate doses to patient weight gradually increasing ketoprofen will be
      used in seeking the minimum effective dose.

      Four groups will be determined by randomization. In all these groups, analgesia will be
      supplemented by a systematic standard self-administered treatment with morphine and
      paracetamol.

        -  Group 1 : Placebo group (P). 0 mg/kg ketoprofen IV every 6 hours for 48 hours (or 0
           mg/kg every 24 hours) for 48 hours.

        -  Group 2 : "Ketoprofen quarter dose" (K ¼). 0,125 mg/kg ketoprofen IV every 6 hours (0,5
           mg/kg every 24 hours) for 48 hours.

        -  Group 3 : "Ketoprofen half-dose" (K ½). 0,25 mg/kg ketoprofen IV every 6 hours (1 mg/kg
           every 24 hours) for 48 hours.

        -  Group 4 : "Ketoprofen full dose" (KPD). 0,5 mg/kg ketoprofen IV every 6 hours (or 2
           mg/kg every 24 hours) for 48 hours.
