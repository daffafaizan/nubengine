      Pobres" were randomly divided into three groups: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation
      (PNFG), Pilates (PG) and Control(CG). Intervention: A training program (50 minutes session)
      was performed with the PNFG and the PG, 3 times a week, for 4 weeks. The elderly in CG
      suffered no intervention and continued with their daily activities. Main Outcome Measures:
      The stabilometric parameters, Berg Balance Scale score, functional reach test and Timed Up
      and Go test (TUG test) were measured before and one month after, in all participants.
