      subject eligibility for the study will be determined. During Phase 1, qualified participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two elimination diet therapies--the 1FED or the 4FED.
      Participants will remain on the assigned dietary therapy for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks
      of therapy, esophageal biopsies from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine
      care) endoscopy will be evaluated to determine disease status. Participants whose EoE is in
      remission (i.e. <15 eos/hpf) will be done with the study.

      Participants whose EoE is still active (i.e. â‰¥15 eos/hpf) will continue into Phase 2 of the
      study. During Phase 2, participants who were on 1FED in Phase 1 will receive 4FED therapy for
      12 weeks, and participants who were on 4FED during Phase 1 will receive swallowed
      glucocorticoid therapy for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks of therapy, esophageal biopsies
      from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine care) endoscopy will be evaluated
      to determine disease status.
