    
      The primary objective of this study is to establish the natural history of Morquio B
      (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB, MBD) disease through the collection and analysis of
      retrospective and prospective data on patients diagnosed with Morquio B. Because of
      significant overlap in clinical presentation, patients with late-onset GM1 will also be
      included.

      Upon consent, data from clinical, laboratory, functional and quality of life studies, and
      data from review of medical records will be collected and analyzed descriptively. In
      addition, the samples of blood, urine and fibroblasts will be collected and stored at BC
      Children Hospital Research Institute Biobank for future research. The prospective follow up
      will include two clinic visits, one year apart. The following data will be collected during
      the prospective observational part of the study (as per study protocol) and retrospective
      part (whether such data are available from the medical chart):

        -  Medical history: Morquio B / Late-onset GM1 gangliosidosis diagnosis, presentation,
           treatments and symptom progression

        -  Physical exam, including neurological and ophthalmological assessments

        -  Standard Grip Strength Evaluation

        -  Range of motion

        -  Six-minute walk test (6MWT)

        -  3-Minute Stair Climb Test

        -  Gait and Motion assessment

        -  Pulmonary function testing

        -  Hearing test

        -  Echocardiography

        -  EKG

        -  X-ray (lumbar spine, upper & lower limbs, hip)

        -  DXA scan

        -  Brain MRI

        -  Laboratory tests (GAGs assay and pro-inflammatory cytokine panel)

        -  Blood, urine and fibroblast samples for biobanking

        -  Genetic test (if not done per standard of care)

      Additional assessments and evaluations:

      â€¢ Patient-reported outcomes: quality of life SF-36, MPS HAQ and the interview on personally
      meaningful outcomes
