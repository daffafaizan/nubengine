      I. To evaluate the effect of a 2-week course of rifaximin on clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) in
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of a 2-week course of rifaximin.

      II. To evaluate changes in stool microbiota by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene
      (16S) sequencing.

      III. To evaluate changes in gammopathy as assessed by changes in clonal Ig and/or plasma
      cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rifaximin orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 1-14 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8 weeks.
