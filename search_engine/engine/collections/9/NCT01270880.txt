      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) achieved with STA-9090 (Hsp90 inhibitor
      STA-9090) in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have received prior
      docetaxel based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the percentage change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from baseline to 12
      weeks.

      II. To assess overall safety and tolerability of STA-9090. III. To evaluate overall survival
      (OS) outcome in metastatic CRPC who have received prior docetaxel therapy.

      IV. To investigate the association of progression-free survival (PFS) and PSA response rate
      with primary and secondary target markers.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential markers for predicting drug response or efficacy, blood samples will
      be used to collect the serum and extract messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from mononuclear
      cells and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once weekly in weeks
      1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks.
