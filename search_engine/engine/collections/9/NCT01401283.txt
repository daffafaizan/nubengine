      index trending via a radial arterial line versus standard care in general surgical patients
      Clinical outcome of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery is explored in two different
      groups. In one group hemodynamic management is guided by the internal standard of the
      anesthesiological department. In the other group fluid management is goal directed by by
      continuous cardiac index trending via a radial arterial line and pulse pressure variation.
