    
      This is a prospective, randomized study to evaluate the diagnostic yield of SOC compared to
      cWGS in each participant. Throughout this study, each participant will receive SOC testing as
      determined by the site clinical team. After the physician orders SOC testing during standard
      clinical practice, the subject will be introduced and invited to participate in the study. On
      Day 180, the participant will receive a cWGS result and the participant will continue to be
      followed for an additional 180 days. A blood sample from each enrolled participant will be
      collected and shipped to the Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory ("ICSL"), which is
      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American
      Pathologists (CAP)-accredited. ICSL will conduct cWGS testing with the TruGenome Undiagnosed
      Disease Test ("TruGenome Test"). The TruGenome Test cWGS results will be provided to the
      Principal Investigator (PI) or designee who will evaluate each participant's test outcome
      based on aggregate medical information.
