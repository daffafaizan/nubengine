      of prophylactic perioperative administration of antibiotics for the reduction of bacterial
      concentration in burn wounds. Subjects who meet enrollment criteria will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either perioperative prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics or
      institutional standard of care, consisting of no antibiotic therapy. This with be a single
      center study.

      Following randomization, patients will receive their assigned treatment (antibiotics or
      standard of care) after induction of anesthesia, no more than one hour prior to incision.

      Patients weighing 120 kg or less will receive 2 grams of intravenous cefazolin, with those
      weighing > 120 kg receiving 3 grams intravenous cefazolin. Re-dosing will occur every 4 hours
      that the patient remains in the operating room.

      For patients with a documented beta-lactam allergy, Clindamycin 900 mg will be given
      intravenously with re-dosing every 6 hours that the patient remains in the operating room.
      Patients with allergies to both agents will be excluded from the study.

      Biological samples will be obtained at three primary time-points: intraoperatively, at the
      time of the initial postoperative dressing take-down (within six hours), and at the time of a
      single follow up visit (10-28 days postoperatively).
