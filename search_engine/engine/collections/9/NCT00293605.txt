      Charnley stem implants. Patients will be clinically evaluated pre-operatively and randomised
      to one of the three implants. Post-operatively, patients will be clinically reviewed for 2
      years using bone mineral density scans, radiological review, blood and urine analysis for
      bone markers and validated questionnaires to assess clinical data (Oxford Hip and Harries
      Hip). Patients will be assessed for prothesis migration using the EBRA methods.
