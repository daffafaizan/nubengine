      single dose, limited field radiation therapy (XRT) will prevent post-traumatic heterotopic
      ossification (HO) after open reduction internal fixation of intra-articular distal humerus
      fractures and fracture-dislocations of the elbow and to assess function of the elbow after
      XRT and no XRT. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups(XRT/treatment or
      no XRT/control) by a computer-generated randomization schedule. Assignment will be in a ratio
      of 1:1 in a complete block design of 10. Each clinical site will be provided with a separate
      randomization assignment for each study participant. The treating surgeon and patient will be
      blinded to group assignment until after operative treatment. Clinical and radiographic
      assessments at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively will be performed. The primary
      clinical outcome will be the Mayo elbow performance score which measures pain, stability,
      function and motion. Motion parameters (flexion, extension, pronation and supination) will be
      performed at each data collection point. Primary radiographic outcome will be the presence of
      heterotopic ossification by plain radiographs of the elbow in the antero-posterior and
      lateral planes at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-operatively. Further imaging
      (radiograph or CT) will be obtained past the 6-month interval if deemed necessary by the
      treating physician,or if fracture union was not achieved at 6 months. The presence of HO will
      be quantified by radiograph. All adverse events will be documented. The trial will be
      monitored periodically by the Safety Monitor at least twice a year to ensure protocol
      compliance and address safety issues.
