    
      This study is an open-label, randomized, cross-over design with three single-dose treatment
      periods and a washout of at least 10 days in between each treatment visit. The study period
      consists of 5 visits to the study centre: Visit 1 (enrolment), Visit 2 (first single-dose
      treatment), Visit 3 (second single-dose treatment), Visit 4 (third single-dose treatment) and
      Visit 5 (follow-up).

      Target subject population is healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20-45 years. Following an
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 4 g AZD0585 will be administered on 3
      separate occasions (fasting, before meal, and after meal) in a randomized crossover fashion
      with different food restrictions.
