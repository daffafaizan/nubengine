    
      Primary Endpoint: Incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days. MACE is
      defined as a combined endpoint of death, acute MI (Q-wave and non-Q wave), revascularization
      procedures (percutaneous or surgical), and peri-procedural complications (that is, left
      ventricular perforation with hemodynamic consequences requiring pericardiocentesis, and
      stroke).

      Incidence of MACE at 3, 6 and 12 months

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina classification score from
           baseline to 12 months

        -  Changes in the quality of life, as assessed according to the Seattle Angina
           Questionnaire

        -  Change in exercise duration and exercise tolerance using standardized treadmill exercise
           testing from baseline, to 6 months and to 12 months

        -  Cumulative number of hospitalizations for coronary ischemia and congestive heart failure
           at 12 months following treatment.

        -  SPECT-chances in global and regional radionuclide perfusion at rest, peak stress, and
           redistribution for baseline to 1, 6 and 12 months

        -  Change in angiographic collateral score at 6 months

        -  Change in global and regional myocardial contractility (assessed by echocardiography) at
           baseline, 6 and 12 months.
