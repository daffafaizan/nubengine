        -  Compare the efficacy of temozolomide vs procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine, in
           terms of overall survival, in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare progression-free survival at 12 weeks in patients treated with two different
           schedules of temozolomide.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with two different schedules of
           temozolomide.

        -  Compare toxic effects of two different schedules of temozolomide in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I:Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment schedules:

             -  Schedule 1: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5.

             -  Schedule 2:Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment on
                both schedules repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 9 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive oral lomustine and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral procarbazine
           on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
