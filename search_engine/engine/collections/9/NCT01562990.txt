    
      This study is a multicenter, phase Ib/II, open-label, single arm trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of R-CMC544 alternated with R-GEMOX in patients with CD20 and CD22
      positive DLBCL in relapse after/refractory to 1st or 2nd line treatment, who are no
      candidates for autologous transplant.

      The study consists of 2 phases. In part 1 (potential dose de-escalation phase) subjects will
      be enrolled at a fixed dose of CMC544. In case of occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT),
      cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will evaluate a de-escalating dose of CMC544 in combination with
      set doses of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in order to obtain the MTD or recommended
      dose of CMC544 in this regimen. In part 2 (dose expansion phase) further safety and
      preliminary efficacy data of the proposed combination will be analyzed.

      All patients will receive two 56 day induction cycles of alternating R-CMC544 (given on day
      1) and R-GEMOX (given on day 29 and 43). Patients who obtain CR or PR, will then go on a
      consolidation of another two 56 day cycles of alternating R-CMC544 (given on day 1) and
      R-GEMOX (given on day 29 and 43).
