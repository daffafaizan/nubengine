      are stratified according to ethnicity (Caucasian vs African-American vs Hispanic).

      Patients are examined at baseline and then every 6 months thereafter in order to determine
      the relative impact of genetic, sociodemographic, and behavioral-cultural factors on disease
      outcome. Patients are assessed for the following outcome variables: disease activity by the
      Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM), disease damage by the Systemic Lupus International
      Collaborative Clinics Damage Index (SDI), and physical and mental functioning by the Medical
      Outcomes Study 36 Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients are also assessed for
      independent variables belonging to the following domains: socioeconomic-demographic,
      clinical, immunogenetic, and behavioral-cultural. Patients undergo genetic analysis utilizing
      polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis to further study the immunogenetic domain and
      genetic markers that may be related to disease. Specifically, patients' blood is analyzed for
      tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor beta, mannose binding protein,
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and bcl-2.
