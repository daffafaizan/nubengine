      decades. Unstable angina is a clinical syndrome intermediate in severity between stable
      angina and acute myocardial infarction with high morbidity and mortality. Standard drug
      therapy and invasive revascularization are effective in decreasing progression to infarction,
      reducing symptoms and multiple hospitalizations, in most cases without a decrease in the
      long-term mortality rate. However, there are still many patients with persistence or
      recurrence of angina despite standard medical therapy and/or revascularization. Wen Xin
      granule, as a Chinese herbal medicine has shown great effect in patients with unstable angina
      in our clinical. However, there is still insufficient evidence on his specific efficacy and
      safety. Therefor, we'd like to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Wen Xin granule in
      patients with unstable angina through this multi-center, double-blind, randomized
      placebo-controlled trial.
