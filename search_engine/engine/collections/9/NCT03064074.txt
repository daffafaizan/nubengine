      with OI may have broken bones with little or no trauma, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and,
      in adult years, hearing loss. It is seen in both genders and all races. OI can range from
      very severe to very mild. Individuals with the most severe type of OI may die at birth.
      People with severe OI who survive may have bowed arms and legs, very short stature and be
      unable to walk. People with the mildest form of OI may only break bones occasionally and have
      normal height and lifespan. Breaks can occur in any bone, but are most common in the arms and
      legs. The current standard-of-care for severe types of OI involves the use of IV medications
      (bisphosphonates) and surgery to put rods in bones to strengthen them. These therapies,
      although often life-saving, are new and very little is known about their long-term effects on
      bone and other body systems.

      TGF-β is a protein important in bone formation. Studies have shown that increased TGF-β
      activity leads to lower bone mass and strength and increased fractures. Fresolimumab is an
      antibody that can silence TGF-β . In studies with mice with OI, it has been shown that
      silencing TGF-β can lead to higher bone mass, quality and strength.
