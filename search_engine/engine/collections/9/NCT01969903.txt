      sedation, analgesia and sympathetic activities, which translate into hemodynamic stability
      and anesthetic dose reduction. Recent several experimental works had demonstrated
      prolongation of peripheral nerve block with addition of dexmedetomidine. One human study
      substantiated this fact when 100µg of dexmedetomidine was added to levobupivacaine during an
      axillary approach brachial plexus block. This study also showed that dexmedetomidine used in
      this fashion resulted in lower systolic and diastolic pressures and heart rates as compared
      to those patients who did not receive the drug. Bradycardia requiring treatment with atropine
      occurred in 7 out of 30 patients (23%).

      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to determine the optimal dose of
      dexmedetomidine added to lidocaine for infra- and supra-clavicular brachial plexus block. The
      investigators plan to establish a dose response relationship using 0.3µg/kg and 0.6µg/kg of
      dexmedetomidine added to lidocaine, epinephrine and bicarbonate mixture during infra- and
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block for upper extremity surgery. The doses to be used in
      this study are substantially lower than 100 µg dose used with levobupivacaine previously.

      The investigators hypothesis is that dexmedetomidine added to lidocaine at these doses will
      shorten the onset and prolong the duration of brachial plexus block without significant
      hypotension or bradycardia.

      Significant hypotension will be defined as 25% reduction of mean arterial blood pressure from
      the baseline or reduction of mean arterial blood pressure below 60 mm Hg.

      Significant bradycardia will be defined as 25% reduction of the heart rate from the baseline
      or a heart rate less than 50 bpm.
