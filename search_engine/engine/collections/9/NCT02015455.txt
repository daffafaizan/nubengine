      potential to substantially reduce unnecessary and expensive care for back pain patients.
      Importantly, this approach could be applied to a wide range of other conditions and other
      diagnostic tests (e.g. other imaging tests, laboratory tests, genetic testing). If this study
      is positive, adding epidemiologic benchmarks to diagnostic test reporting could become the
      dominant paradigm for communicating all diagnostic information.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to conduct a pragmatic cluster, randomized
      controlled trial, randomly assigning primary care clinics at four large health systems to
      receive either standard lumbar spine imaging reports or reports containing epidemiological
      benchmarks for common imaging findings. The investigators will use a novel stepped wedge
      randomization scheme that temporally randomizes sites, allowing within-site before/after
      comparisons in addition to between-site comparisons, while assuring that all sites will
      eventually receive the intervention. The primary outcome will be a metric of back-related
      intervention intensity. The primary analysis will occur at the clinic level and not the
      patient level.

      This pragmatic trial will demonstrate both the feasibility of randomly assigning clinics
      within large health systems as well as the feasibility of passively collecting outcomes data
      up to two years after enrollment using the robust electronic medical records systems
      available at each health system.
