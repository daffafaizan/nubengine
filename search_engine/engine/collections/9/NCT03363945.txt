      immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. These
      medications carry substantial side effects. In addition, these medicines often do not
      completely control damage to the kidney from the recipients' immune system, ultimately
      causing the kidney to fail.

      Medeor Therapeutics is developing a novel cell-based therapy to reprogram the recipients'
      immune system to accept a transplanted kidney without the need for long term use of
      immunosuppression drugs.

      The purpose of the current Phase 3 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MDR-101
      for the induction of transplant immune tolerance in a prospective, randomized, multicenter
      clinical trial. MDR-101 is intended to induce mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism and donor
      specific immune tolerance in order to preserve transplant kidney function, avert transplant
      kidney rejection, and eliminate the cumulative and serious side effects associated with
      immunosuppressive drugs.
