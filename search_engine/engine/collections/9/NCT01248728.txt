      (FDA) for this disorder, and specifically for irritability associated with autism, although
      not all patients with autism respond to risperidone. No pharmacologic treatments have been
      approved for use in preschool children, although it is clear that early intervention is
      associated with improved outcomes. Behavioral and educational therapies play a significant
      role in the management of autistic symptoms. The history of alternative treatments in autism
      is notable for the exaggerated benefit of a variety of supplements, such as high dose
      vitamins (e.g. B6, magnesium), and secretin. The current widespread use of
      alternative/nutritional supplements to patients with autism without scientifically
      demonstrated efficacy, underscores the necessity for scientifically sound studies to be
      conducted. Complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM) are commonly employed by
      families of autistic children. Recent surveys have estimated the prevalence of such use to be
      between 30% and 95% (1,2,3). Omega-3 fatty acids were reported to be used in 28.7% of
      patients (1). However, only two small case series and a very small randomized study have been
      reported in this population to date. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids in preschoolers with ASD.
