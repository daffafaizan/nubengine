        -  Compare the duration of survival of patients with stage IV transitional cell carcinoma
           of the urothelium treated with cisplatin and gemcitabine with or without paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the duration of progression-free survival, response rates, and duration of
           response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, WHO performance status (0 vs 1), and presence of
      metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
           cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 or 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of
           6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 followed by cisplatin
           IV over 1 hour on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for at least 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 610 patients (305 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.04 years.
