      lead to a limited range of motion and muscle weakness. We hypothesized that latent MTrPs
      might decrease gluteus medius muscle strength in healthy individuals. Forty-eight healthy men
      will be included in the study. Trigger point examination for the gluteus medius will be
      performed bilaterally. Subjects with one or more trigger points on the dominant side and
      those without any trigger points will be assigned to two groups. Muscle strength for gluteus
      medius will be assessed with a manual muscle tester using the "break test" technique on both
      sides. The subjects and the examiners will be blinded. For statistical analysis, the
      independent sample t-test was used to compare the intergroup differences.
