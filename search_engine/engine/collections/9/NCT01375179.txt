    
      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, proof of concept
      study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KRP203 in subjects with moderately
      active refractory ulcerative colitis subjects. In total, approximately 72 subjects will be
      randomized into the study.

      After 30 patients have completed the 8 week treatment period with KRP203 or placebo, there
      will be an interim analysis to determine preliminary efficacy. The study will consist of up
      to 28 day screening period (day -35 to -8), baseline period (day -7 to day -1), treatment
      period (day 1 to day 56), follow-up period and study completion.
