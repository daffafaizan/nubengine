      have shown several advantages of using intravenous acetaminophen perioperatively. However,
      due to its relatively high cost and limited clinical data concerning its efficacy compared
      with other agents, physicians are hesitant to use intravenous acetaminophen in the
      perioperative period.

      174 adult patients from the orthopedic surgeons undergoing total knee replacement with spinal
      anesthesia will be enrolled. The study will be double blind, randomized; placebo controlled
      comparing oral and IV acetaminophen to each other and a control (placebo). At the time
      patients arrive in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), Group 1 will receive IV 1 gram
      acetaminophen, and PO placebo; Group 2 will receive PO 1 gram acetaminophen and IV placebo;
      Group 3 will receive IV placebo and PO placebo.

      The primary outcome that will be assessed is pain scores, which will be recorded by using the
      numeric rating scale 1-10 every 15 minutes. Secondary outcomes include time to rescue
      analgesia (measured in minutes), time to PACU discharge (measured in minutes), and the total
      amount of hydromorphone (PO or IV) consumed within 6 hours postoperatively for adequate
      analgesia (total measured in milligrams) will be collected.

      The difference in pain scores will be assessed by a chi-square test. A multivariable
      regression model will be performed with the clinical and statistically significant variables
      to remove confounding.
