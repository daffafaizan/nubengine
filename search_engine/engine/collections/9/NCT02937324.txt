    
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition, which when treated can result in
      fluctuating motor activity - sometimes too much movement, sometimes too little.

      A series of tests, run on a smartphone, will be used to evaluate the motor signs of
      Parkinson's and related to a clinical evaluation based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale. 60 participants will be recruited.
