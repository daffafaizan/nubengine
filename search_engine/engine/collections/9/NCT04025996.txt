      dysfunction and heart failure. More recently diabetic microvascular disease has been
      recognized to play a key role in the development of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure
      with preserved ejection fraction. A new paradigm in diabetic heart disease centers on
      microvascular endothelial dysfunction involving the intra-myocardial capillaries and leading
      to cardiomyocyte dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. This is analogous to the
      microvascular dysfunction well-described in the diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. Yet,
      whereas diabetic retinal screening for retinopathy and screening for microalbuminuria are
      routine, diabetic cardiac screening for microvascular dysfunction is practically
      non-existent. The retinal vasculature may represent a window of opportunity to detect
      concurrent microvascular disease in the heart and kidneys before the onset of clinical
      symptoms. However, there are limited studies that directly attempt to correlate retinopathy
      to diastolic dysfunction and microalbuminuria. Hence this study aims to examine the
      cross-sectional relationships of retinopathy with indices of left ventricular diastolic
      function, coronary flow reserve and urinary albumin excretion, among diabetic patients.
