      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and activities.
      Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to
      these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics
      were reported in subjects with PDD, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics which
      have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the
      atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a
      need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and
      adolescents with PDDs. The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether
      aripiprazole is effective and well tolerated for irritability in children and adolescents
      with PDD not otherwise specified (NOS) during an 8-week acute phase and whether the
      effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole is maintained during a 16-week continuation
      phase.
