      treatment for women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Specific study objectives
      include:

        1. To assess the efficacy and tolerability of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for treatment
           of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in 25 women.

        2. To describe the population pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily in
           treatment of young women with acute pyelonephritis.

        3. To identify urine proteins associated with the inflammatory response of acute
           pyelonephritis, and characterize the time course of resolution of these proteins
           following initiation of treatment.
