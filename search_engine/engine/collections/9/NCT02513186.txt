        -  A period to assess eligibility (screening or baseline period) of up to 3 weeks for VCDI
           cohort, up to 28 days for VRDI cohort;

        -  for patients in the VCDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 12 induction
           treatment cycles (50-week duration).

        -  for patients in the VRDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 4 induction cycles
           (24 week duration).

        -  Following induction, both cohorts have maintenance periods consisting of 4 week cycles
           until progression, unacceptable AE, or patient willingness to discontinue and an
           end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of treatment.

        -  Patients that discontinue therapy for reasons other than progression will have follow-up
           visits until progression or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy,
           whichever is earlier.
