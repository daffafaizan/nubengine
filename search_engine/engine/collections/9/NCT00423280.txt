      the lining of all blood vessels) has been shown to contribute to atherosclerosis. NO has
      multiple beneficial effects on vascular function. Endothelial function can be measured in
      humans via a number of methods, and endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be a strong
      adverse predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality.

      Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is essential for the production of NO in endothelial cells. 6R-BH4
      is a synthetic version of naturally occurring BH4. We aim to investigate the effects of oral
      6R-BH4 supplementation on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease.
