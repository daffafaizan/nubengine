      relatively common complaints. It is generally assumed that most women with these complaints
      have a vaginal infection, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or vulvovaginal candidiasis.
      However, investigators suggest that there is a large population of women who complain of odor
      with or without complaints of discharge, and in whom no clear cause can be found. For these
      women, there are currently no treatment options.

      Anecdotal evidence suggests that stainless steel used with just water has an effect in
      reducing odors and is so used to reduce odors on hands by chefs. The Water Works速 Douching
      Device is a light-weight (1oz) stainless steel douching device that was developed to aid in
      the treatment of vaginal odor. Additional anecdotal evidence suggests that douching with the
      Water Works速 Douching Device had little or no affect on the vaginal Eco-System (e.g. good
      bacteria, Lactobacilli).

      This study (ARG105B) will compare the Water Works速 Douching Device to a commercially
      available over the counter douching device for the ability to reduce or eliminate abnormal
      odor (with or without complaints of discharge) in women with this subjective complaint, but
      no objective findings of a vaginal infection. The study will also compare the Water Works速
      Douching Device to the commercial device with respect to the adverse effect of the vaginal
      Eco-System.
