    
      The study is a multi-center, prospective single-arm design without controls. All subjects
      will be assigned to treatment for 11 days of sensor wear. Each subject will wear 4 Guardian
      Sensor (3)s, and each will be connected to a Guardian Link (3) Transmitter and/or Guardian
      Connect Transmitter. Subjects will not use sensor glucose values for diabetes management.

      On days 1, 3, 5, and 6, subjects will be asked to measure blood glucose (BG) using a home
      glucose meter approximately every 20 minutes for 5 hours. Subjects will be asked to take one
      gram of acetaminophen orally on days 3, 5, and 6 of sensor wear.

      On day 11, devices will be removed, data uploaded from the study meter and transmitter or
      recorder, skin assessment will be performed, and the subject's participation in the study
      will be completed.
