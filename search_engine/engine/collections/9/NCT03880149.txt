      attention, there is no consensus among clinicians and researchers as to which injury-causing
      factors are dominant. It has been suggested that increased training load may be the leading
      cause of sports injuries, since tendons are sensitive to changes in load, making them
      vulnerable to injury. Inflammation is one of the reversible risk factors to sports injuries,
      and there are numerous methods which are used to treat inflammation. It has been recently
      suggested that inflammation reactions are affected by Omega-3 status and that omega-3
      deficiency may increase the risk of sports and tendon injuries. The omega-3 fatty acid may
      act as a regulator of membrane structure and function, intracellular signaling pathways,
      transcription factor activity, and gene expression and reducing inflammation. Due to these
      functions, omega-3 may influence exercise-induced injuries/inflammation in athletes, thus,
      may influence their health and allowing training.
