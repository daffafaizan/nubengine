    
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of foot pain, affecting an estimated 2 million
      people per year.1 Although there are large numbers of people seeking medical attention for
      this condition, there remains some confusion among health care providers as to the most
      efficacious treatment and some authors conclude that no data solidly supports effectiveness
      of treatment.2

      Several randomized control studies have been published with respect to treatment of PF with
      ultrasound. The current literature on the effectiveness of US in individuals with PF is
      largely inconsistent in the parameters. One study by Crawford and Snaith,3 found the true
      ultrasound was no more effective than sham ultrasound and the authors concluded that future
      studies need to clarify ultrasound parameters. In contrast, a recent study that utilized
      different parameters,4 concluded that the US group showed significant changes in pain and
      function. Strengthening and stretching exercises are well documented through the literature
      to improve function and decrease pain in patients with PF.5-8 It has been reported within the
      literature that patients with PF have subtalar, tarsometatarsal, and first metatarsalphangeal
      (MTP) joint hypo mobility into dorsiflexion, which reduces dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM)
      and places the windlass mechanism at a mechanical disadvantage which has been theorized to
      place increased stress on the plantar fascia.9-12 A variety of studies have explored the
      effects of manual therapy in conjunction with exercises to address the limitations in ankle
      dorsiflexion ROM.9-12
