    
      This is an observational study aiming to gain insight into brain structure and the neural
      networks that control taste and eating behaviour in patients with severe obesity undergoing a
      primary sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or a lifestyle intervention for weight loss compared with
      normal weight individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Drops of liquid
      foods and a control solution will be delivered to the participants' mouth during fMRI
      scanning. Body weight, gut hormones from serial blood samples, appetite scores and taste will
      be assessed at each study visit.
