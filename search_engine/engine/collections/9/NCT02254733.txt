    
      Assertive community treatment (ACT) is one of the most well-validated treatment models for
      people with severe mental illness, and ACT is one of the few evidence-based practices that is
      widely implemented in community mental health programs; however, existing ACT approaches have
      little impact on functioning. The ACT model provides a unique opportunity for implementation
      of recovery-oriented EBPs throughout community mental health programs in the US. This project
      will examine the incremental effectiveness of implementing cognitive-behavioral strategies
      and social skills training in ACT relative to ACT, alone. The investigators will begin to
      examine a potential mechanism of change involving defeatist performance beliefs that can
      interfere with performance of community functioning behaviors, and will use qualitative
      methods to identify barriers and factors that contribute to successful implementation.
