      ongoing or recurrent pain, lasting beyond the usual course of acute illness or injury, and
      which unfavorably affects the individual's well-being. The Institute of Medicine (2011)
      estimates that 116 million American adults experience chronic pain with direct and indirect
      costs to the US economy totaling in excess of half a trillion dollars annually. Current
      treatments for chronic pain are only partially effective, especially when used alone. There
      is a critical need to develop new and more effective treatments for chronic pain.
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) may be helpful as an additional treatment for
      patients with chronic pain.

      Doctors and scientists conducting this research study want to evaluate the effectiveness of
      an investigational device (tDCS) that delivers a form of brain stimulation as an additional
      treatment to standard of care in the Menninger Clinic's Pain Management Program. Stimulation
      with tDCS as an adjunctive to medication-based treatments as well non-medication treatments
      options (such as physical therapy and psychotherapy) may improve an individual's ability to
      tolerate the physical and emotional distress associated with chronic pain. Therefore the
      investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial of adjunctive tDCS for chronic pain,
      restricting enrollment to the population receiving services in the Pain Management Program.
