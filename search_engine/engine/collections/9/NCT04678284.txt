      collaborative care intervention using motivational interviewing and behavioral activation
      alongside education and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence tailored to the
      experiences of people experiencing homelessness and diabetes (DH). Our team's central
      hypothesis is that medication adherence and diabetes self-care (and eventual glycemic
      control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique
      context of DH.

      This work builds upon part 1 during which we completed Aim 1 activities to develop the
      initial Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) treatment manual through focus groups
      with DH at various levels of glycemic control and interviews with their multi-disciplinary
      providers. Data from this phase has identified barriers and strategies for medication
      adherence, patient values regarding medication, and treatment preferences and informed
      development of this part 2 application.

      This protocol addresses Aim 2, to test patient perceptions of the feasibility and
      acceptability of study procedures and refine the D-Homes treatment manual through test cases
      (n=15). With a hypothesis that the D-Homes manual and study procedures will be feasible and
      acceptable to DH as measured by self-report and post-treatment interview.
