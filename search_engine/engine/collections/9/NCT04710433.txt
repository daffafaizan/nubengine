      the study and potential risks of neuromodulation, all included patients and next of kin give
      written informed consent to the study.

      At baseline, patients are classified to one of the two predefined subgroups: either medical
      and behavioral therapy is extended and optimized or neuromodulatory treatment is started with
      non-invasive sacral nerve stimulation via single current and two external adhesive
      electrodes. Within 12 weeks, treatment success is evaluated in routine clinical check-ups
      (week 4/8/12) and via specialized questionnaires and bowel movement diaries. Quality of life
      is evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment.
