      sex-matched normal control subjects to see if phenylbutyrate can increase the removal of
      alpha-synuclein from the brain into the bloodstream. All subjects will receive 20 grams/day
      of phenylbutyrate in the liquid form phenylbutyrate-triglyceride taken as one teaspoonful
      three times per day with meals. Blood will be drawn on two days prior to starting
      phenylbutyrate to measure alpha-synuclein concentrations. Phenylbutyrate-triglyceride will
      then be started and the change in plasma alpha-synuclein will be measured on day 1, 7, 14,
      and 21 days while taking phenylbutyrate. After 21 days, the drug will be stopped and a final
      blood sample will be measured at 28 days to see if plasma alpha-synuclein has fallen to its
      pre-phenylbutyrate level. No effects on Parkinson symptoms are expected during this short
      trial. Please note that although taking any type of Parkinson's drugs for symptomatic
      treatment disqualifies you, if you and your neurologist are willing and able to have you off
      Parkinson medication for six weeks before and during the trial, you may be eligible to
      participate.
