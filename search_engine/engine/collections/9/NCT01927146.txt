    
      It's a single site, retrospective study by review of medical records and tissue testing.

      Eight hundred gastric adenocarcinoma patients with integrity medical record and regular
      survival follow up who received gastrectomy in the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University
      between January 1996 to December 2006 were retrospectively studied.

      Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were retrospectively tested by
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Lauren classification status. Her2
      positive was defined as: immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH) +; or IHC 3+.

        1. After HER2 status and lauren classification identifying, population used in overall
           survival (OS) comparison between Cohort 1(HER2 positive) and Cohort 2 (negative group)
           were carried out. According to Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, OS were to be
           compared between cohorts by different stages.

        2. Correlate histopathological characteristics with HER2 status and lauren classification
           were performed in the total 800 patients. Meanwhile, independent prognostic factors
           identification was to be confirmed in clinicopathological features, including gender
           (male or female), age at diagnosis, tumor size (â‰¤5cm or >5cm), location of primary tumor
           (proximal or distal), histology subtypes (well + moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma
           or poorly + signet ring cell differentiated adenocarcinoma), lauren classifications
           (diffuse type or intestinal type or mixed type), anemia (yes or no), angiolymphatic
           invasion (yes or no), the TNM staging system (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
           7th edition), and HER2 status (negative and positive).
