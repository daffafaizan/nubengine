      Hashimoto symptoms like tiredness,increased need of sleep, pain in musculature and joints and
      dryness in eyes and mouth. It is necessary that the total thyroidectomy is meticulously
      performed. We have proven the effect on the antibodies, and we have also proven that the
      operation procedure can be performed without more complications like recurrent nerve damage
      and hypocalcemia. Neutrality is secured by randomization done by a neutral institution,
      laryngoscopy by neutral doctors and instructions filling out the QoL-schemes performed by
      non-biased study nurses.

      The study runs for at least 18 months with controls every 6 months. Blood samples are taken
      and international approved QoL-schemes are filled in. In addition to the randomised main
      group a side group of patients fulfilling 2 of the 3 inclusion criteria are followed in
      parallel in order to elucidate the spontaneous development of the disease and showing
      critical values of antibodies making the symptoms turn up.
