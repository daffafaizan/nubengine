      is present in some foods, albeit at very low concentrations, but which is also commercially
      available) may possess up to 5-times the activity of native vitamin D3 in food. Thus, in
      theory, each micogram of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consumed in the diet could boost vitamin D
      status up to five times most effectively compared to each microgram of native vitamin D in
      food. It is worth noting, however, that estimates of potency range from 2 to 5, depending on
      approach used, and that the real potency needs to be confirmed in a human study. This study
      aims to examine the biological activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (i.e., its potency relative to
      vitamin D3) as well as its effect on selected functional markers in a randomised,
      double-blind, human intervention trial in older adults.
