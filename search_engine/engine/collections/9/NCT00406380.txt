      with Idiopathic Ethiology by clinical signs and Fluorescein angiogram (FA)findings we treated
      patients with Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab (2.5mg/0.1ml). We performed a complete
      ophthalmological evaluation and at baseline and follow-up (1 and 3 months) we evaluate ETDRS
      Best Corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiogram (FA) and Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT)findings. We found an improvement in visual acuity and reduction of FA
      leakage and decrease retinal thickness in OCT.
