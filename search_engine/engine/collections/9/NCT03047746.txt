    
      This is a single arm pilot study using TCR alpha/beta+ T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem
      cells (PBSC) from closely matched unrelated donors or partially matched/haploidentical
      related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with acquired and
      inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Previously established, disease-specific
      transplant preparative regimens will be administered based on the specific underlying BMF
      condition. Mobilized PBSC will be processed using the CliniMACS system for TCR alpha/beta+ T
      cell depletion plus CD19+ B cell depletion. The study will determine efficacy of this
      strategy in terms of engraftment, rates of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease
      (GvHD), and one year overall and event-free survival.
