      study will include a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. Upon determination of
      the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will be
      opened. The Dose Expansion Phase will include cohorts in ovarian, pancreatic, triple negative
      breast cancer, glioblastoma and CD36-high patients in order to confirm the tolerability of
      VT1021 against specific tumor types.
