    
      Patients must be at least 18 years of age with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (and/or ARDS)
      confirmed per World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and evidence of pulmonary
      infiltration (by chest X-ray and/or CT scan), including a virological confirmation of severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) of any specimen; e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid.

      At the time of enrollment, patients have to fulfill criteria of the local recommendations for
      the treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ): hypoxemia (defined as arterial oxygen partial
      pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio ≤300 mmHg and/or peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93%) regardless of the oxygenation method including low-flow oxygen
      administration on nasal cannula or mask with oxygen flow rate of > 12 liters per minute,
      high-flow oxygen through nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) whatever the modalities
      of ventilation, invasive ventilation through tracheal intubation or tracheostomy, and
      extracorporeal oxygenation, despite being on standard of care (SOC), which may include
      anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, antimalarials and supportive treatment and care.

      Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent
      and inevitable within the next 24 hours, will be excluded from the study. Patients with
      active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection
      (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.

      Patients will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg i.v., with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and
      SOC treatment according to local guidelines (hydroxychloroquine or/and lopinavir/ritonavir
      or/and remdesivir).

      If the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or
      at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one
      additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo may be given, after more than 12
      hours per local protocol.

      The study assessments to be conducted include the following: physical examination, vital
      signs, oxygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, presence and absence of respiratory
      support, adverse events, concomitant therapies, clinical laboratory tests, and nasopharyngeal
      swabs.
