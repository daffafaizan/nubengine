      10-18 years with a BMI greater than 95th percentile and their healthy siblings.

      Specimens will be collected at 3 time points over a seven month period. Healthy siblings will
      provide just one blood and stool sample. Samples will be maintained at the Duke Medical
      Science Research Laboratory.
