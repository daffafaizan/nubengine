      4 periods. All the planned formulations in this study will have a bosutinib amount equal to
      200 mg in each taste assessment. Session 1 consists of bosutinib POS, sorbitol base in water
      (A); bosutinib POS, mannitol base in water (B); and bosutinib capsules to be opened into
      water (C). Session 2 consists of bosutinib POS, mannitol base in low % (D) and in high % (E)
      sodium saccharine sweetener vehicles, respectively; bosutinib POS, mannitol base in low % (F)
      and high % (G) strawberry flavour vehicles, respectively. Session 3 consists of bosutinib
      capsules to be opened into low % (H) and high % (I) sodium saccharine sweetener vehicles,
      respectively; bosutinib capsules to be opened into low % (J) and high % (K) strawberry
      flavour vehicles, respectively. Session 4 consists of bosutinib capsules opened onto apple
      sauce (L); bosutinib capsules opened onto full fat natural yoghurt (M); and bosutinib
      capsules to be opened into water (N). Participants will be assigned to one of the treatment
      sequences available for each session. Except at session 4 for treatments L and M, each
      formulation will be presented to the participants in a blinded fashion.

      Participants will be required to not swallow, rather to only swish the bosutinib containing
      liquid in their mouths for approximately 10 seconds, after which the liquid will be spat out.
      Each participant will record the sensory attributes at timed intervals of 0 (immediately
      after dosing), 5, 10 and 20 minutes after spitting using a Bosutinib Taste Assessment
      Questionnaire.
