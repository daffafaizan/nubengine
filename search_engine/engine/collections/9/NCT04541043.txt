    
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Nefecon treatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study
      Nef 301 and continue to be treated with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or
      ARBs). Patients who previously received Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment,
      whereas patients who previously received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be treatment na√Øve to
      Nefecon. During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Investigators will remain blinded to
      treatment given in Study Nef-301.

      During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon for a 9-month period. The dose may be
      reduced if clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) develop during the 9-month Treatment
      Period that the Investigator considers related to the study drug and that mandate dose
      reduction.

      Patients will remain on a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout
      the study. The patient will come for a follow-up visit at 12 months after first dose.
