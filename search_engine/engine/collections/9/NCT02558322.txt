      for health policy in Germany for the last 15 years. Concerning primary care, this especially
      relates to an undersupply of rural GPs (general practitioners). But there also seem to be
      other relevant regional differences, e.g. a lower number of house calls in larger cities, a
      greater number of psychiatric (co-)morbidities in the cities, a greater spectrum of services
      offered by rural doctors, and a difference in accessing primary and secondary care between
      the rural and the urban areas. Despite these results, differences between rural and urban
      areas have not been studied extensively in Germany. Therefore this study aims to explore
      regional variation of patient populations and their reasons for accessing primary care.

      The study is based on standardized interviews with 240 GPs and approximately 1.200 patients
      in Northern Germany. Questionnaires are based on a preliminary qualitative study and were
      pretested. The GP's questionnaire comprises characteristics of the GP and the practice,
      patient types, reasons for consultation and services offered. The patient's questionnaire
      includes sociodemographic data and past medical history, quality of life, access to the GP,
      specialists and hospitals, perceived social support, health behaviour and the reasons for
      their consultations. Data will be analysed by descriptive statistics and different regression
      modelling strategies adjusted for possible confounders and the GP-induced cluster structure.
