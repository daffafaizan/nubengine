      therapy for HIV infection. The rationale of CsA therapy is to decrease T cell activation in
      patients with early HIV infection. Activation of T cells leads to translation and
      transcription of provirus, release of viral progeny, and ultimately cell death. T cell
      activation also leads to increased cell death via apoptosis. CsA is capable of inhibiting
      both these events and thus may lead to decreased CD4 cell turnover.

      This study has 2 arms of 15 patients each. Patients in Arm I receive placebo. Patients in Arm
      II receive CsA. Each arm is further divided into 2 strata. Stratum 1 patients are not allowed
      to receive antiretroviral therapy. Stratum 2 patients must receive 1 of the following 4
      stable nucleoside analogue combinations:

        1. Zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC)

        2. ZDV plus didanosine (ddI)

        3. Stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC

        4. d4T plus ddI.
