      oblique Quadratus Lumborum block (QLB) and the Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) to determine
      their level of spread and their value in controlling postoperative pain in patients scheduled
      for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy surgery. We hypothesized that quadratus lumborum is not
      inferior regarding the duration of analgesia when compared to erector spinae in patients
      undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy under general anesthesia.
