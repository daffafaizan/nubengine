      to nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). Partial nephrectomy (PN) constitutes the reference standard
      treatment for small renal masses according to international guidelines. Open PN ist still the
      predominant apporach in Germany, but the use of minimally-invasive surgery has continously
      increased over the last decades. Specifically, robotic surgery is on the rise and may
      facilitate the adoption of a minimally-invasive PN approach even in more complex renal
      tumours. Real world data on the outcomes of PN according to the surgical approach are
      limited. Data from cancer registries and health insurance databases usually lack important
      information an key patient und tumour characteristics, such as tumour complexity.

      The G-NESS registry database aims at prospectively collecting such clinical and outcome data
      from patients undergoing PN. Data collection includes perioperative variables on patient
      characteristics, tumour location and complexity, surgical approach, intra-/postoperative
      complications, and kidney function. Follow-up based on questionnaires is conducted after
      predefined intervals (i.e. 30 days, 12 months, 24 months, and 60 months) in order to receive
      information on long-term kidney function, comorbidities, and survival. The information
      received from the database can help to better define the optimal surgical care for patients
      with renal masses.
