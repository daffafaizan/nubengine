    
      After notification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 July 2013, Celgene
      agreed to discontinue the lenalidomide treatment for all patients due to an imbalance in the
      number of deaths in patients treated with lenalidomide versus patients treated with
      chlorambucil. No specific causality for this imbalance has been identified to date.
      Investigators were instructed to immediately discontinue all participants from experimental
      lenalidomide treatment and inform their patients accordingly. Participants on the
      Chlorambucil arm may continue up to 12 months (13 cycles) with the last participant
      completing in March 2014. All randomized participants will continue to be followed for
      overall survival and secondary primary malignancies.
