      activation protein (FAP) as a biomarker for the tumor microenvironment and to explore the
      dynamic interaction between proliferating tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our
      long term goal is to develop new drugs that will target the tumor microenvironment as novel
      therapeutic and chemoprevention strategies.
