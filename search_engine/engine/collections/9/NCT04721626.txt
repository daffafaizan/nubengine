      of topical antisepsis on upper aerodigestive tract and reconstructive surgery in head and
      neck cancer patients. The primary hypothesis is that topical antisepsis will significantly
      decrease oral bacterial load and the presence of pathogenic organisms. Secondary outcomes
      will include identification of the source of the infectious bacterial organisms, surgical and
      non-surgical site infections, serious topical antisepsis-related complications, serious
      adverse events, and hospital revisits. The study populations will include head and neck
      cancer patients age 18 or greater undergoing head and neck reconstructive surgery in which
      there is a communication between the upper aerodigestive tract and the cervical skin which
      requires a planned vascularized reconstruction, either a regional pedicled flap or a free
      tissue transfer. The accrual goal will be 25 patients. Data collection will occur in both the
      inpatient and outpatient settings. Patients will be enrolled during their preoperative clinic
      visit. Each patient will be followed for study outcomes until 30 days postoperatively.
