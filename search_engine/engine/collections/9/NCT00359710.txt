      genetic components of diseases demands a better understanding of patients' conceptions of
      these identifiers and how they impact their health. The lived experiences of multiracial
      individuals can provide valuable perspectives on questions of race and ethnicity, the
      collection of ancestral information in assessing health history and communication of racial
      or ethnic specific disease risk. Understanding patients' beliefs and experiences will provide
      important data for developing ways to communicate how human genetic variation is related to
      self identified race and ethnicity. We aim to conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews
      with adults at least 21 years of age who identify as having a multiracial background with
      African and European ancestry. The study will include participants from the Atlanta, Georgia
      and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. This preliminary study uses qualitative methods to
      capture the personal stories of identity, ancestry and clinical experiences from a population
      that has not been adequately researched.
