      investigators propose the following two aims:

        1. To determine the effect of a medium dose glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist
           preparation (250 μg fluticasone plus 50 μg salmeterol) administered for 3 weeks on
           inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG induced vasodilation in the bronchial artery, as
           assessed by ΔQaw in stable glucocorticoid-naïve COPD patients, and to re-assess the
           responses after a 3 week glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist washout period.

        2. To determine inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG-induced vasodilation (ΔQaw) before,
           and 30 min and 120 min after a single medium dose of an ICS (220 μg fluticasone) in
           stable glucocorticoid- naïve COPD patients.

      For both aims, the protocol design will be placebo-controlled and double-blind. For the
      second aim, only fluticasone pretreatment will be possible because the salmeterol component
      of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination preparation could influence albuterol
      responsiveness irrespective of any glucocorticoid effect. The timing of the endothelial
      function measurements in the long-term glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist protocol and
      single dose ICS protocol is based on the past experience with ICS on airway vascular
      function. Single dose effects were seen within 15-30 min and waned by 90 min (25,26), while
      long-term treatment effects were no longer seen 3 weeks after ICS withdrawal (16).
