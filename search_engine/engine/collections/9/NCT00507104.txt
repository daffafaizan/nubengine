      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, most of these
      studies referred to retrospective evaluations. There are only few prospective data, and no
      longitudinal study routinely taking into account the assessment of anterior pituitary
      function in the acute phase after TBI or SAH so far.

      We prospectively evaluate pituitary functions in patients in the acute phase after TBI or SAH
      and a control group of patients with trauma not involving the brain. Endocrine data included
      basal anterior pituitary lobe hormone, IGF-1 and testosterone serum levels (Immulite 2000)
      within the first 8 hours after TBI or SAH. Further endocrine evaluation was performed by
      means of either a combined GHRH-arginine-CRH-LHRH test or an insulin-induced hypoglycemia
      test after 4 months and 12 months. To rule out an assay related bias with regard to GH and
      IGF-1, all hormone levels were cross-checked by a supersensitive assay in another laboratory.
