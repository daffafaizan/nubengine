      regulatory control and that novel non-pharmacological interventions, such as tDCS can
      modulate this system and, consequently, reduce pain intensity. Widespread pain in FM is
      thought to represent enhanced pain sensitivity that is maintained by central mechanisms. This
      suggests changes in the descending pain control mechanisms and a possible relationship with
      the central sensitization phenomenon. Recent evidence has suggested that pain inhibitory
      pathways are affected in FM; thus, further understanding these pathways' role can
      significantly change how the treatment of this condition. In this study the investigators
      will test the effects of two interventions -tDCS and aerobic exercise - on the modulation of
      the endogenous inhibitory pain system in fibromyalgia.
