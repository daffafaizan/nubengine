      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent primary CNS non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with rituximab, temozolomide, and methylprednisolone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Induction therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 and oral temozolomide daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. After day 28, patients with
      stable disease or better proceed to consolidation therapy.

      Consolidation therapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses. Patients achieving a complete remission proceed to
      maintenance therapy.

      Maintenance therapy: Patients receive methylprednisolone IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      13.3 months.
