      disseminating effective treatments, but the problem of high attrition rates and treatment
      noncompliance. This study will compare the effects of a motivational intervention with a
      "services as usual" orientation group on program retention, treatment compliance, and
      long-term outcomes in families with histories of child maltreatment.
