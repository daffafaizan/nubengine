      transplantation) studies, link particular changes in microbiota with overall survival and
      post-transplant disorders, especially GvHD. According to limited data, further evaluation of
      associations between the alterations in microbiome composition and toxicities. Detail
      investigation of both the microbiome and host immune system may help to find microbiome
      markers useful for very early identification of patients at risk for major transplant-related
      complications. This might bring the possibility to modulate the gut microbiota in patientÂ´s
      specific manner to achieve optimal therapeutic outcome and follow-up, while avoiding severe
      post-transplant complications.

      This is prospective, single center, non-randomized, hypothesis generating study. Patients
      will be asked to provide a sample of blood, urine and stool. This blood will be used for
      plasma and serum banking for further analysis, including micro RNA (miR) and chemokine
      detection. Stool will be used for microbiome studies - isolation of total DNA/RNA and 16S
      (RNA component of the small subunit of a prokaryotic ribosome) rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic
      acid) gene sequencing for bacterial taxonomic classification. Furthermore, metagenomic
      sequencing and subsequent taxonomic and functional classification of microbial genes will be
      used including characterization of potentially clinically relevant features of the microbiome
      such as antibiotic resistance and microbial virulence factors.
