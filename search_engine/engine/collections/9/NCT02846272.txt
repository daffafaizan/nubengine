      helpful to better understand and diagnose intractable epilepsy in children. All enrolled
      children will undergo standard preoperative and postoperative MRI imaging, plus a 15 minute
      set of functional connectivity and diffusion tensor sequence with no additional sedation.
      This imaging data will be stripped of identifiers and be processed to provide both
      quantitative analysis, resting state functional connectivity changes and three dimensional
      modeling of white matter tracts adjacent to epileptogenic foci. This study is being done to
      determine if diffusion tensor and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging are
      helpful to better understand and diagnose intractable epilepsy in children.
