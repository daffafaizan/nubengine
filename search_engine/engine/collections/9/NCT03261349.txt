      between HCV and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), the direct evidence of the
      HCV-associated-NHL remains uncertain. Direct antiviral agents (DAA) have been shown to have a
      higher cure rate, less side effects, and a shorter duration of therapy for chronic HCV
      infection. Whether DAA treatment can cure HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL remains unclear?
      If yes, a direct evidence of HCV-associated lymphomagenesis will be approved. Because DAAs
      are more potent and efficient than pegylated (Peg) interferon plus ribavirin and
      well-tolerated for the treatment of HCV infection, it is reasonable to use DAAs as the
      frontline treatment for HCV-positive patients with indolent B-cell NHL, such as MZL, LPL, and
      low-grade FL, who do not require immediate cytoreductive therapy. The aim of this proposal is
      to assess whether Harvoni® (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) could eradicate HCV and lead to
      durable complete remission of HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL.

      In the translational part, we will assess the expression pattern of BAFF-related canonical
      and non-canonical NF-κB signaling molecules by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and
      t(11;18)(q21;q21), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
      pre-treatment tumors samples of patients in prospectively predicting the antiviral
      responsiveness of HCV-positive indolent B-cell NHLs. The serum cytokines and chemokines,
      IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and CXCL13, BAFF level, and HCV RNA load before
      and after DAA treatment in HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHLs will be examined. The genotype
      of the HLA class II, and cloning followed by sequences of the VH region of the immunoglobulin
      gene derived from pre-treatment tumor samples will be assessed.
