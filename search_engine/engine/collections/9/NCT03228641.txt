    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind, bilateral paired study
      evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary effectiveness of a micro-coring device
      for removal of excess skin using 2 needle gauges (22G, 24G,) at densities (percent of skin
      removed per 1cm2) of 2.5-10% in subjects with mid- and lower- face skin laxity manifested by
      moderate-to-severe mid and lower cheek wrinkles, deepening of the nasolabial folds at rest;
      prominence of marionette lines at rest; downturn of the oral commissures at rest, sagging of
      the skin at the jawline at rest. Subjects are blinded to needle gauge and density.

      There will be two cohorts of subjects: one group of subjects will receive a single treatment
      and the second - multiple treatments. All subjects will be followed for 180 days with several
      intermediate visits at 3, 7, 30, 60, and 90-days.
