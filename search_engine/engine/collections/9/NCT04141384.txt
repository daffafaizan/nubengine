      balance of young people under different external stimuli, and hope to understand the balance
      control ability by objectively collecting the physiological signals of the Center of Pressure
      (COP).

      The change, and the use of the Berg scale as a benchmark for the assessment of balance
      ability, and then return to the issue of balance ability training.

      Therefore, this study divides the experiment into two major stages. The first stage will
      focus on healthy young people, and explore how external stimuli affect balance, and then
      assist balance ability training to find the most appropriate adjustment of body posture
      control.

      The second phase explores the appropriate exercise training for stroke patients, such as the
      use of Modular Interactive Tiles System (MITS) training, to track the effectiveness of
      external stimulus impact balance training.
