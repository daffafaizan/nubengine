      surgically removed or shrinks spontaneously. We hypothesize that the risk of persistent pain
      is modified by common variations in genes related to inflammation and pain processing. We
      propose to collect blood for DNA analysis from up to 500 patients who have been followed for
      10 years after the onset of severe sciatica in the Maine Lumbar Spine Study. Based on the
      pain research literature, Human Genome databases, and gene studies in NIAAA's Laboratory of
      Neurogenetics, we will prioritize approximately 100 candidate genes with variants that affect
      the function of their proteins. We will type patients' DNA for these variants and compare
      their clinical data with their genotype at each candidate gene to see if common variants
      increase or decrease the risk of chronic pain. The primary phenotype variable will be the
      amount of persistent leg pain one year after pain onset, Identification of such associations,
      if replicated in future studies, may help to prioritize targets for drug treatments or
      identify genetic tests that can predict the prognosis of acute sciatica and assist in
      treatment choice.
