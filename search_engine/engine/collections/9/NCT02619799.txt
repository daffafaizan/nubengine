      anaesthetics via intrathecal and epidural routes and are effective in augmenting the quality
      of block and prolonging post-operative analgesia.

      Noxious stimulation leads to the release of glutamate and aspartate neuratransmitters which
      bind to various sub-classes of excitatory aminoacid, including the NMDA receptor. Intrathecal
      magnesium potentiates neuraxial anaesthesia by blocking NMDA receptors with out causing
      significant side effects as reported in various studies.

      Intrathecal Midazolam produces antinociception at spinal cord-level through benzodiazepine
      GABA-A receptor complex which are present abundantly in the lamina 2 of spinal cord.
      Midazolam also releases endogenous opioid acting at spinal delta receptors and also enhances
      adenosine release which also augments analgesia.
