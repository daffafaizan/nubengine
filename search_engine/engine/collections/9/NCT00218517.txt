      marijuana dependence than behavioral therapy alone. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase-B
      inhibitor. It increases dopamine activity in parts of the brain that are involved in
      dependence on addictive drugs such as nicotine, cocaine, and marijuana. Selegiline has been
      effective in treating nicotine dependence, but has not yet been studied in treating marijuana
      dependent individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      selegiline in treating marijuana dependent individuals. Specifically, this study will
      determine whether selegiline reduces marijuana craving and withdrawal symptoms, thus leading
      to reduction or abstinence in marijuana use.

      Participants in this 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly assigned
      to receive either selegiline (10 mg/day in two 5 mg pills) or placebo. Study visits will
      occur twice each week. At each study visit, participants will complete self-reports and urine
      toxicology tests. Throughout the study, participants will receive weekly individual
      counseling. The counseling sessions will last 15 minutes. Reduction in marijuana use as well
      as the number of weeks of consecutive marijuana abstinence will be evaluated.
