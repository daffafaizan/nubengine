    
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is limited by a high proportion of non-responders.

      Pacing activation from proximal area with a left quadripolar lead might improve the
      depolarization pattern.

      To explore the effect of CRT pacing on cardiac activity, the investigators will enroll
      approximately 180 patients who already underwent CRT-D implantation with a quadripolar LV
      lead.

      After implant, as clinical practice, the device will be programmed with distal LV pacing
      configuration, after 6 months in patient non-responders to CRT therapy the pacing
      configuration will be changed (proximal configuration).

      After 12 months in patients non-responders will be changed the pacing configuration again,
      choosing, if it is possible, a multi point pacing (pacing activation from multiple separated
      left ventricular (LV) sites).
