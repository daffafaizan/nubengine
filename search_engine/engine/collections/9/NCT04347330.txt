      least another cardiovascular risk factor. The trial aims to compare the effects of
      randomization to a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal (target home SBP <120mmHg) with
      randomization to a treatment program of a standard goal (target home SBP <135mmHg). The
      primary hypothesis is that cardiovascular event rates will be lower in the intensive arm.
      Participants will be recruited over a 3-year period at approximately 100 to 150 clinical
      centres and the first patient will be followed for up to 5 years.
