    
      In this open-label, dose-escalating, Phase IIa trial, subjects with locally advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma will receive intratumoral (ITU) NanoPac® (Sterile Nanoparticulate
      Paclitaxel) via endoscopic ultrasound-guided direct injection.

      Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac® at escalating doses, at a volume
      based on up to 20% of calculated tumor volume (with a maximum injection volume of 5 mL per
      subject). Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting
      at the lowest concentration. Following DSMB review of the cohort data, the next cohort may
      begin enrolling, an additional three subjects at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the
      first dose does not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted.

      The dose determined to be most suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose
      with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile as determined by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), will be the dose used in the second phase of the study which will
      enroll 22 additional subjects who will receive two injections of NanoPac® at the same dose
      one month apart. In the third phase of the study, up to 30 subjects will receive up to four
      injections of NanoPac at the same dose, one month apart.

      Plasma samples will be taken at various time points on the day of NanoPac® injection as well
      as once at each of the study visits, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      intratumoral NanoPac®.

      Subjects will be followed for 12 months after NanoPac® injection for safety, overall survival
      (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), CA-19-9 levels, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels,
      reduction in pain, and tumor response to therapy (as shown by imaging).
