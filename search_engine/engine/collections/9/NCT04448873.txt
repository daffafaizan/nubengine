      children. KHE is characterized by sheets of spindle cells with an infiltrative pattern in the
      dermis, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. It is locally aggressive and can cause Kasabach-Merritt
      phenomenon, a serious life-threatening coagulopathy characterized by profound
      thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia. Sirolimus, one of the mTOR inhibitors, has become a
      new and very effective treatment, which is especially reliable for KHE with KMP and has
      acceptable side effects. However, there is yet no strong evidence on the best practice of
      treatment length of sirolimus. This randomized controlled trial aims to compare guided
      discontinuation with maintenance treatment in pediatric patients with KHE in order to provide
      a basis for the optimal treatment duration of sirolimus, as well as the clinical
      characteristics of pediatric patients who can safely reduce the dose till withdrawal.
