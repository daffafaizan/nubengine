      variety of ways and will complete all baseline and post-intervention assessments via
      specially designed electronic platforms, including REDCap and digital eHealth assessments.
      There will be no in-person, on-campus interaction between the members of the study team and
      research participants.

      Convalescent COVID-19 subjects with persistent (i.e. > 3 months) decreased sense of smell,
      and a score on the UPSIT consistent with decreased olfactory function (< 35 women, < 34 men)
      will be offered enrollment. This will be a 2 x 2 factorial double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of two nasal saline lavage interventions through a
      randomization schedule developed by the Study Pharmacist. The package and detailed
      instructions will be shipped directly to the subject from pharmacy. Subjects will be
      requested to rinse each nasal cavity once daily for 12 weeks and to keep track of their daily
      use through a paper dairy or specially created app to track compliance.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of two olfactory training interventions through a
      randomization schedule prepared by the Study Pharmacist. The smell training intervention will
      be shipped directly to the subject. The subject will be expected to complete the smell
      training for 12 weeks as instructed. Subjects will be asked to record their daily training on
      a specially created app and make observations on their smell or taste function at the end of
      every week.

      Outcome assessments will be performed immediately upon completing nasal saline lavage and
      olfactory training (Week 12) and follow-up (Week 24).
