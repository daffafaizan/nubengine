      individuals with PKU consuming PKU Sphere, a GMP-based medical food.

      The sponsor developed PKU Sphere in response to growing interest in GMP medical foods for the
      purpose of improving adherence and quality of life by offering an alternative to amino acid
      based medical foods. PKU Sphere is a powdered, low phenylalanine medical food containing a
      balanced mix of casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) isolate, essential and non-essential amino
      acids, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals and the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid
      (LCP); docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). PKU Sphere has been designed for use in the dietary
      management of Phenylketonuria. It is available in two flavors, Red Berry and Vanilla,
      packaged in individual serving sachets of 35g and containing 20g protein equivalent (PE).
