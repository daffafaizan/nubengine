      and emotional expression between intimate partners who have experienced recent domestic
      violence. In addition, it will provide some basic laboratory findings on differences in
      distress tolerance between perpetrators and victims of domestic abuse. Specifically, using
      the proximal change experimental design, couples will engaged in a 7.5 minute conflict
      discussion while being videotaped and having their autonomic responding monitored. Then they
      will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a communication skills training
      exercise, a mindfulness condition, or a placebo control. Next, ,couples will engaged in
      second 7.5 minute conflict discussion. It is hypothesized that those in both the
      communication skills training and mindfulness condition will display more positive and less
      aggressive behavior in their second conflict discussion as compared to their first. It is
      also expected that they will administer less aggression (as measured by delivery of a loud
      noise) to their partner after both of the active interventions. In addition, multiple
      measures of distress tolerance will be administered to both partners. It is expected that
      couples with a characterologically violent perpetrator, he or she will evidence decreased
      distress tolerance and the victimized partner will evidence increased distress tolerance
