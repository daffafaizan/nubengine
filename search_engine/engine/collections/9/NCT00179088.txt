      and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are offered the informed consent process.
      Those consenting are randomized following surgery by flip of a coin into one of two groups:
      Weight Bearing as Tolerated or Toe Touch Weight Bearing Only. Each patient is followed for
      two years, and is seen at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year and two years. Questionnaires are
      completed including the Harris Hip Score and the SF-36. Patients complete a compliance survey
      to determine behavior related to their study group assignment and compliance with their study
      group. Radiographs are obtained at each post-operative interval and subsidence is evaluated
      and recorded. Range of motion and ambulation are assessed and recorded also.
