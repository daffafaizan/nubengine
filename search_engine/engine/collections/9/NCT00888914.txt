      compared to vehicle applied as a single, bilateral topical application in at least 60
      subjects with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines. Subjects will be randomized to one of
      the five treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Follow-up visits are scheduled through 28
      days post-treatment. The safety and efficacy of Cohort 1 (through the Day 14 visit) will be
      assessed prior to the decision to enroll subjects into Cohort 2 if additional doses or
      treatment regimens need to be evaluated.
