      G1:ClinproTM White Varnish, G2:ClinproTM XT Varnish, and a G3:placebo (where the application
      of a product was only simulated). Recruitment of the 121 volunteers were based on their
      self-reported complaint of dentin hypersensitivity, which confirmed with the use of an air
      blast from a triple syringe. Then, he/she showed in the VAS scale (which varies from 0=no
      pain to 10=the worst pain possible) the value that best describes the pain sensation. The
      subjects that present at least one tooth with a value of 4 and above in the VAS scale (if
      more than one hypersensitive tooth was present, the mean VAS values obtained were used, for
      each patient) was randomly allocated into the experimental groups. Two weeks before the study
      started, the volunteers went through a wash out period, where they used only the oral hygiene
      products donated by the researchers, which were used up to the end of the study. The
      in-office treatments were performed after prophylaxis, according to the manufacturer´s
      instructions, by one trained researcher, which was blind to the treatments. DH evaluation was
      performed 15 min after the application of the treatments, by a different researcher, which
      also blind to the treatment, and which used the same methodology described early for the
      detection of initial pain. The volunteers were recalled for the DH evaluation after one and
      four weeks of the treatments. DH evaluation was also performed after 12 and 24 weeks of the
      treatments, except in the placebo group, which received the proper DH treatment after the
      first four weeks of the study. Data was analyzed with the appropriate statistical methods
      (α=0.05).
