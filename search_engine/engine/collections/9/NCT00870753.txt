      countries (Daubenmier, 2005). Yoga has shown good effects on increasing muscle strength,
      flexibility and stability, in addition studies have found reduced stress level, improved mood
      and breathing (Astin et al., 2003; Gimbel, 1998b; Granath et al., 2006; Lavey et al., 2005;
      Manjunatha et al., 2005b; Netz & Lidor, 2003a; Telles & Naveen, 1997b; Yadav et al., 2005b).
      Previous research have shown a tendency for persons practicing yoga improving body awareness
      and body sensitivity, and reduction of body dissatisfaction (Daubenmier, 2005). In addition,
      two studies have examined yoga in treatment of binge eating disorder (Daubenmier, 2005;
      Gimbel, 1998a). Results showed reduction in number of binge eating episodes in the
      intervention group compared to the control group. No available studies have examined effect
      of yoga in treatment of the eating disorders types Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa.
