      receive either MCI-196 for up to 52 weeks. The study is in two periods. The initial period
      allows flexible dosing for a period of 8 weeks. This will allow subjects to achieve
      individually optimised doses. After 8 weeks, subjects will continue flexible dosing with
      MCI-196 but with titration intervals every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks. Subjects
      previously exposed to MCI-196 will end the study at Week 40.
