      In an earlier open and non-controlled study in 10 patients with PPS, Xepol was given during
      three days. The patients showed improvements in muscular strength and co-ordination and a
      decrease in pain. The aim of this study was to investigate if these findings can be confirmed
      in a larger, double-blind, randomised and placebo controlled study.

      There are no simple clinical findings and specific laboratory changes that can be used to
      indicate the severity and progress of PPS. Different self-reporting questionnaires and
      objective measures of disability have often been used in clinical studies including SF-36
      questionnaire, muscle strength measurement and walking test. The primary and secondary
      variables in this study were based on the clinical experience and literature reviewed.
