    
      Prospective cohort study of HIV-negative participants who will receive voluntary counseling
      and testing (VCT) for HIV-antibody in conjunction with questionnaires on risk behavior,
      willingness to participate in HIV vaccine trials and other HIV prevention trials at 4 month
      intervals for a period of 1 year. This study will follow 1000 HIV-negative volunteers with an
      expected minimum of 15-20 incident HIV-infections based on a minimum incidence rate of
      1.5/100 person-years. Weighted incidence estimates will be calculated with exact 95%
      confidence intervals.
