      and symptoms of BPH. 4mg Silodosin twice daily has been approved in Asia including Japan and
      Korea. In US, 8mg Silodosin once daily with the FDA approval is already available. Korea has
      newly adopted 8mg Silodosin once daily. Against these backdrops, this clinical study is
      designed to demonstrate that the newly adopted dose is not inferior to the existing dose in
      its efficacy and safety. The study used double-blind, random assignment in Korean men with
      signs and symptoms of BPH for 12 weeks.
