      years. The maturity status was assessed using a self-assessment of stage of pubic hair based
      on the criteria of Tanner. Body composition and maximal voluntary knee extension torque (KET)
      were determined using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer and a static myometer, respectively.
      Sprint velocity was measured by a non-motorized treadmill. Jump height was calculated from
      the following equation; g × (flight time)2 × 8 × 10-1. The flight time during jumping was
      measured by a matswitch system.
