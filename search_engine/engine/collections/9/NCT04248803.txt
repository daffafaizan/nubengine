    
      The primary objective of this study is to observe the effect of gluma desensitizer
      application in controlling the post-treatment sensitivity in posterior occlusal composite
      restoration in molar teeth using 2 adhesive bonding strategies.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the difference in the post-treatment sensitivity on
      application of Gluma desensitizer either prior to or after acid etching.

      The different adhesive gluma desensitizer application groups are randomly divided into 6
      groups,

        1. Total etch control group (No gluma desensitizer application)

        2. Total etch group Gluma (Kulzer GmbH, Germany) desensitizer application prior to acid
           etching

        3. Total etch group Gluma (Kulzer GmbH, Germany) desensitizer application after acid
           etching

        4. Self etch control group (No gluma desensitizer application)

        5. Self etch group Gluma (Kulzer GmbH, Germany) desensitizer application prior to acid
           etching

        6. Self etch group Gluma (Kulzer GmbH, Germany) desensitizer application after acid etching
