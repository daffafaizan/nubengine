      ALI); 3.Chest X-ray showed that the double lung texture increased, the increase of crude,
      fuzzy, visible diffuse patchy infiltration shadow with compensatory emphysema, for the most
      early performance; B. double lung field large sheet, asymmetric, edge fuzzy infiltration
      shadow, the most dense in the lung；4. Echocardiography, left atrial hypertension; 5.The
      gestational age >35 week, have maternal age cholestasis (severe), sepsis or meconium
      aspiration syndrome (MAS) understanding of history, and with the exception of the primary
      pulmonary surfactant (PS) lack of.

      ARDS :Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury caused by
      pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma.Diagnostic criteria: 1.Acute onset；2.FiO2/ PaO2< 26.7 kPa
      (200mmHg, ARDS); 3.Chest X-ray showed that the double lung transparent brightness is
      generally lower, the glass sample, with bronchial inflatable sign, and even double lung field
      common density increased, the heart shadow is not clear, a white lung, as the most important
      performance；4. Echocardiography, left atrial hypertension; 5.The gestational age >35 week,
      have maternal age cholestasis (severe), sepsis or meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)
      understanding of history, and with the exception of the primary pulmonary surfactant (PS)
      lack of；6.Need to use a ventilator.

      Control group: Patients with mechanical ventilation due to external causes of the lung, no
      ALI-ARDS performance,FiO2/ PaO2< 40.0 kPa (300 mmHg), such as premature apnea or HIE.
