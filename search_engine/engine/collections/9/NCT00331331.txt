      studied. We do not have a clear picture as to what lymphokines/chemokines are present in the
      vitreous or anterior chamber fluid of patients with active intraocular inflammatory disease
      as well as other disorders with a proposed inflammatory component such as age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) and diabetes. Further, no studies have been yet performed evaluating the
      proteome of the vitreous or anterior chamber fluid in the uveitic, AMD and diabetic state.

      This is a natural history study with specimens taken after indicated surgery for patients
      with uveitis and other studies. Specimens of anterior chamber fluid and vitreous will be
      evaluated for 32 cytokines and the proteome using systems permitting the evaluation of small
      amounts of material. A serum sample will be taken at the same time to compare with the
      lymphokine profile found in the vitreous. Previously, patients participating in the MUST
      (Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment) study, a randomized study evaluating an ocular
      steroid implant versus standard immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of intermediate
      and posterior uveitis, were enrolled. However, as the MUST study is complete; we are
      currently only accepting participants from the NEI or other intramural NIH studies where
      permission is obtained from the patient to allow such evaluations to be done.
