      depression will be randomized to receive either escitalopram 10mg/day or placebo tablets for
      a period of 6 weeks. It is hypothesized that patients receiving medication will experience a
      greater normalization of their emotional instability and a greater reduction in their
      depressive symptoms at the end of the six-week trial than those who are not receiving
      medication.
