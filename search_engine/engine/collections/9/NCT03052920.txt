      evaluating the efficacy and safety of cochlear implantation in patients with asymmetric
      hearing loss. A repeated-measures analysis will be employed whereby patients will act as
      their own controls. Participants will be recruited from surgeons and audiologists in
      Otolaryngology departments at the participating sites.

      Participants will be evaluated at multiple intervals using a variety of test measures
      (addressing sound localization, understanding speech in noise, understanding speech in quiet,
      and quality of life).

      Prior to receiving a cochlear implant (CI) in the poor hearing ear, participants will be
      evaluated as follows:

        -  Hearing aid (HA) in the better ear alone

        -  HA in the poor ear alone

        -  Bilateral HAs

      Participants who have not previously used a poor-ear hearing aid or BiCROS hearing aid will
      complete a 1-2 week trial and be evaluated at the end of the trial. If performance is better
      with the alternate therapy (bilateral hearing aids or BiCROS hearing aid) than the better ear
      alone performance and the participant prefers the alternate therapy, the participant will not
      continue in the study.

      Participants who do continue in the study will be evaluated at several post-implant
      intervals. Post-implant evaluations will occur at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial
      stimulation of the CI. Participants will be evaluated as follows:

        -  HA in the better ear alone

        -  CI in the poor ear alone

        -  HA and CI together
