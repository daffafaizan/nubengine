      Clermont-Ferrand University hospital (one for medical students and one for the general
      population) will be asked to be included in the present study. They will be randomly assigned
      to either supervised self-swabbing followed by conventional swabbing led by a healthcare
      professional or the other way round.

      All the subjects will have to complete a brief questionnaire including demographical
      characteristics (age, sex, height, weight, eye color), potential symptoms (asthenia, fever,
      anosmiaâ€¦) anticipated pain and discomfort and previous nasopharyngeal swabbing experience.
      Pain, discomfort and overall acceptability of the procedure will be completed just after
      completion of the swabbing.
