      patients need extraction of upper first premolars followed by anterior segment retraction and
      maximum anchorage.

      The patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups; either Friction or Frictionless
      group. In friction group, Nickel Titanium coil spring will be used for retraction of anterior
      segment while in frictionless group, T-loops will be used for retraction. All the patients
      will receive two miniscrews , one on each side to achieve maximum anchorage during
      retraction.

      The patients will be seen on a monthly basis for follow up visit for activation of the
      appliance to maintain constant force during the study. An impression will be taken for the
      patients every visit, poured into stone for fabrication of dental models. The models will be
      used to monitor the rate of retraction of anterior teeth.

      Every patient will be asked for lateral cephalometric radiograph before and after complete
      retraction. After data collection, two assessors will carry on the measurements blindly and
      independently. Statistical analysis of the data will be done and the results will be compared
      to evaluate the effectiveness of both techniques for en-masse retraction.
