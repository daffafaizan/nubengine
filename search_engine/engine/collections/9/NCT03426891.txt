      Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The main purpose of Part 1 is
      Dose-Escalation. "Dose-Escalation" means that different dose levels will be tested at
      different times during the study to find the best dose level that is safe and well tolerated
      in participants. In this study investigators will determine the best dose of Vorinostat that
      can be given with pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The dose of temozolomide and
      radiotherapy will be the same as standard treatment.

      Part 2 (Dose Expansion), all participants will receive the same dose of vorinostat with
      pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      Maintenance Phase: During the maintenance phase, participants will receive Temozolomide (for
      the first 6 months), vorinostat (for 12 months), and pembrolizumab (for 12 months).
