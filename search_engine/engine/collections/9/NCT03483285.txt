      Open heart surgery patients are more prone to hemodynamic variability. In addition, they have
      increased possibility for difficult intubation The heart rate and blood pressure increase
      impaired the oxygen consumption. This was previously shown that Videolaryngoscopes minimaly
      effects the vital signs in normal patients. Videolaryngoscopy inreased the rate of success in
      normal and difficult airway. This study aimed to compare two laryngoscopes regarding
      hemodynamic parameters and intubation times in coronary bypass surgery.

      Material and methods: 50 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery enrolled in this
      prospective.randomized study. Demogaphic variables and airway characteristics of patients
      were recorded. Glottic visulisation and intubation time were recorded. Systolic blood
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded 2
      minutes intervals before intubation, after intubation during 10 minutes.
