        -  Within-day experiment feeding myco-protein (quorn) versus chicken at lunch resulted in
           an 18% reduction in evening meal ad libitum intake following the quorn meal (Burley, P.
           Blundell, 1993, Eur J Clin Nutr, 409-18).

        -  Feeding casein, soy, pea, wheat gluten, egg albumin, gelatin as part of a mixed meal had
           no influence on post-lunch satiety (Lang et al.,1998, Am J Clin Nutr., 1197-204).

        -  Varying protein source (soy, caseine, gelatin) at breakfast meal at 1.8 and 3.6MJ/meal
           had no impact on 24 hour energy or macronutrient intakes (Lang et al., 1999, Eur J Clin
           Nutr, 959-65).

        -  Comparison of mycoprotein and tofu to a chicken preload before lunch indicated that the
           vegetarian sources were associated with lower food intake at lunch (Williamson et al.,
           2006, Appetite, 41-8).

        -  Addition of 25g protein in a liquid format (whey and soy) led to suppression of food
           intake (pizza meal) 1 hour later, in comparison to water and whey preload.

      It is noted that all of these studies, (i) were conducted over a short time period (within
      day), (ii) none were high-protein weight loss diets (low calorie, high protein), (iii) none
      compared mixed meat versus vegetable source. It is of interest from both a scientific and
      public health point of view whether meat and vegetarian sources of protein similarly impact
      on motivation to eat.

      The diets for this study:

        -  The maintenance diet (MTD) (day 1 - 3) will consist of 15% protein, 30% fat and 55%
           carbohydrate fed to 1.5 x RMR (resting metabolic rate)

        -  The high protein (HP) weight loss diet will be fed to 100% resting metabolic rate (RMR)
           on a 5 day rotation menu, fed as three meals a day, 30% protein, 30% fat and 40%
           carbohydrate; the meat version will be based on chicken and beef meat; the soya version
           based on soya protein or soya-tvp (textured vegetable protein).

      Soya protein is now widely available as milk (ALPRO), margarine (PURE), enhanced bread
      (BURGEN), sausages (GRANOSE), bacon (GRANOSE), burgers (GRANOSE), mince (GRANOSE), powered
      isolate, cheese, cream (SOYA DREAM), yoghurt (ALPRO), chicken-style fillets (GRASSINGTONS).
