        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of daunorubicin when combined with imatinib
           mesylate, vincristine, and prednisone in patients with lymphoid blastic phase chronic
           myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response of this patient population treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of daunorubicin.

      Patients who have not previously received imatinib mesylate receive oral imatinib mesylate on
      days 1-35. Patients who have previously received imatinib mesylate for at least 28 days
      receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 22-35. All patients receive daunorubicin IV over 2-3
      minutes on days 1-3, vincristine IV over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and oral
      prednisone on days 1-28. Patients with more than 5% residual blasts in bone marrow on day 28
      receive a second course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of daunorubicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
