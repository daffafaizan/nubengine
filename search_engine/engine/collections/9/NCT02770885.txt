      diabetes mellitus and given his properties as a natural satiety hormone, the GLP-1 analogue
      liraglutide was recently approved by the FDA for weight management.

      In studies related to the influence of GLP-1 and -analogues in controlling food intake a
      concomitant reduction of fluid consumption has been observed.

      The investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 analogues not only modulate appetite and provide
      satiety but also reduce fluid intake and thirst sensation in humans - especially in those
      with excessive thirst perception (patients with primary polydipsia). In view of future
      therapeutic options for these patients we aim to investigate the influence of the long-acting
      GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide on fluid intake, thirst perception and quality of life in patients
      with primary polydipsia compared to placebo.
