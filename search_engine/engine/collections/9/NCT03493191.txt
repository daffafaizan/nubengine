      a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 receiving SHR0410 and 1 receiving placebo) will be dosed
      first (1:1 ratio). If no drug related adverse events occur in the sentinel participants, the
      remaining 6 subjects in a cohort will be dosed on the next day or later in a 5:1 ratio (5
      subjects receiving SHR0410 and 1 subject receiving placebo). SHR0410 will be diluted in
      saline and administered as a 15 min constant dose IV infusion at a rate of 20 ml/hr on Day 1.
