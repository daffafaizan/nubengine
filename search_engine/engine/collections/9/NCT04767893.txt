      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) manifestations. Patients with SIRS as those with trauma
      or stroke have the same classic infection signs such as fever and elevated leukocytic count,
      as long as the microbiological diagnosis is the ultimate diagnostic method, but it has poor
      sensitivity with delayed results. New biomarkers such as sTREM-1 and sUPAR can be used for
      rapid diagnosis of sepsis and differentiating it from non infectious inflammatory syndromes.
      Also these soluble biomarkers can be used for predicting the prognosis of sepsis patients
