      that interventions to raise Vitamin D levels might be preventive of these diseases.
      Investigators have completed studies of the effects of weight loss and exercise interventions
      in approximately 400 older women and men over the last 15 years, many of whom are obese.
      Investigators have data on glucose tolerance, blood pressure and bone density in these
      studies and stored plasma in which investigators can analyze Vitamin D levels. Vitamin D may
      be an important risk factor for these metabolic diseases and the availability of these
      samples for Vitamin D analysis will allow investigators to perform a cross-sectional study to
      address relationships of Vitamin D levels to glucose intolerance and diabetes,
      hypertension/blood pressure status, bone mineral density, the degree of obesity, and physical
      activity status measured as maximal aerobic capacity and accelerometry in these older men and
      women.

      The results of this study have the potential to impact clinical practice in the prevention
      and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. This would circumvent
      the current dilemma for prevention of these chronic diseases through treatment of obesity, as
      these data would provide immediate prospects for changing the recommended doses of Vitamin D
      beneficial for reducing risk for these diseases.

      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in obese,
      older men and postmenopausal women and 2) the association of Vitamin D levels to glucose
      tolerance, blood pressure, bone mineral density, and hyperlipidemia, as well as association
      with Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms affecting metabolic responses to Vitamin D.
