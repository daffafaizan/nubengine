      preparation before surgical abortion at 13 to 16 weeks' gestation. This blinded randomized
      trial compared 400 mcg misoprostol administered 3 hours and 600 mcg administered 1.5 hours
      before abortion. The investigators analyzed results for the primary outcome (procedure time)
      using a non-inferiority limit of 3 or more minutes. The investigators tested two separate
      non-inferiority hypotheses each powered at 95% (2.5% confidence interval) for two gestational
      age groups: 13.0-14.3 and 14.4-15.6 weeks. Assuming 10% withdrawals, the investigators
      required 118 participants. Secondary outcomes included mechanical dilation, complications,
      provider satisfaction, and patient side effects and acceptability.
