      University of Catalonia. The sample was made up of children between 3 and 13 years old.
      Baseline pain status, functional limitation, edema and lesion diameter were evaluated. The
      treatment lasted 4 days. The parents recorded the intensity of the pain and the number of
      pills provided daily. Statistical significance was accepted with pâ‰¤0.05 and a 95% confidence
      interval.

      A total sample of 33 patients, 11 boys (33 %) and 22 girls (67 %) was obtained. The average
      age of the children was 7.8 years (SD: 1.41). Numerical variables referring to pain,
      inflammation and edema presented statistically significant improvements (p-value <0.05).
      Healing efficacy was demonstrated in 13 cases (39 %) and only 3 cases (9 %) reported poor
      taste acceptability.
