    
      Patients with allergic rhinitis with or without asthma were selected for a randomized
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and distributed into three groups: DPT (Dpt allergen
      extract, n=34), DPT+MRB (Dpt allergen plus mixed respiratory bacterial extracts, n=36), and
      Placebo (n=32). Clinical evaluation and immunological analyses are being carried out before
      and after 12 and 18 months of treatment, including rhinitis/asthma symptom and medication
      scores, skin prick test (SPT) to Dpt, and measurements of Dpt-, Der p 1-, Der p 2-specific
      serum IgE, IgG4, IgG1 and -specific salivary IgA.
