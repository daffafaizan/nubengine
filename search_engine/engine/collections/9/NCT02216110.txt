      the detection rate of EGC has increased with mass screening for the prevention of gastric
      cancer-related death. EGC is defined as mucosal or submucosal cancer, regardless of regional
      lymph node metastasis. The presence of lymph node metastasis has been reported to range from
      2% to 18%. For this reason, radical gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was considered as
      the only curative treatment. In EGC patients, surgical outcome demonstrated excellent 5-year
      survival rate above 90%.

      In 2000, EGC subgroups with negligible risk of lymph node metastasis were proposed on the
      basis of large scale retrospective data. Thereafter, the result was adopted as expanded
      criteria for endoscopic resection of EGC. ESD is useful technique to dissect the tumor along
      the submucosal layer using various endoscopic knives. Compared to endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR), ESD achieved a higher complete resection rate and a lower local tumor
      recurrence rate.

      Although curative resection is pathologically achieved by ESD, post-resection surveillance is
      needed to confirm the presence of nodal metastasis. Recently, several studies reported that
      5-year overall and disease-specific survival rate were highly favorable in EGC patients who
      underwent curative ESD. However, there is no comparative study about long-term outcomes after
      ESD and gastrectomy. Therefore, this protocol aims to evaluate overall survival rate, tumor
      recurrence, development of metachronous cancers between ESD and surgery groups.
