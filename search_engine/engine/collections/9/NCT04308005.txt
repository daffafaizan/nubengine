      self-concept, anxiety, attitude, or conflict.

      Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate children's drawing as a measure of dental
      anxiety in a dental setting.

      Design: Seventy- eight children, aged 6-12 years, were enrolled in this study. Pulp therapy
      and/or restorative treatment was performed during the first therapeutic session for all
      participants. Sound, Eye, and Motor (SEM) and Frankl scales were used as an objective
      assessment of dental anxiety during treatment. After the treatment session, the children were
      instructed to draw a picture of a person at a dental clinic. Children's drawings were scored
      by a paediatric dentist and a psychologist using Child Drawing: Hospital (CD: H) scale and
      emotional indicators of Human Figure Drawings (HFD). The findings were compared with Frankl
      and SEM scores.
