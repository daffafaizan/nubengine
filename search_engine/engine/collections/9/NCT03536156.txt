      using an intra-oral optical camera, would scientifically measure the labile aspect of the IEP
      and improve the procedure of registration of peri-implant soft tissues.

      The main objective is to study the effect of removal of a healing abutment on the closure of
      the EIP volume at 5 minutes.

      This non-interventional study is a prospectively recruited research of the participants and a
      cross-sectional measure of the judgment criteria (during a single visit). The study is
      mono-centric, it will take place in the odontology department of Toulouse Hospital.

      The question is to know if the decrease in the volume of the PEI is significant during the
      preparatory phase of the implant impression where the PEI is no longer supported by the
      healing screw over a period of 5 minutes.

      Optical impressions are designed to record adjacent implant site teeth and peri-implant soft
      tissue PEI using a Optical Camera. The optical camera works like a camera and does not come
      into contact with the patient's mucous membranes or teeth. The images obtained are saved in
      STL format on an anonymized file.
