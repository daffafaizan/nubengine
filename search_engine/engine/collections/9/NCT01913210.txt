      1970s observational study, suggesting that ginseng may adversely effect blood pressure.
      Despite these early findings, extensive research has since suggested that ginseng may have a
      positive effect on blood pressure. The current study will help clarify present uncertainty on
      the effect of ginseng on blood pressure control.

      This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
      Reviews of Interventions. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms. Intervention trials that
      investigate the effect of ginseng on blood pressure in humans will be included.
