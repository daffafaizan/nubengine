      changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with
      increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels. Possible gender and menstrual cycle phase
      influences on the effects of nicotine on anterior pituitary (ACTH, FSH, LH) and adrenal (DHEA
      and cortisol) hormones have not been clearly delineated. Accordingly, these clinical studies
      will compare the acute effects of nicotine in men (studied previously) and women, and to
      study women at the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.
