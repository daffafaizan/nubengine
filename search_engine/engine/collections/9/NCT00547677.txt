        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in
           patients with hepatic metastases.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery in these patients.

        -  To assess the tumor response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-5 fractions of stereotactic radiosurgery over 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 9-13 patients receive escalating doses of stereotactic radiosurgery until 60 Gy is
      reached or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which > 33% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
