    
      This study is a randomized, interventional case series. A total of 10 patients, seen in the
      Retina Division of the Wilmer Eye Institute, will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized to
      either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, which will be performed
      monthly for 3 doses. Further monthly injections are at the discretion of the examiner, and
      may be withheld if there is lack of continued improvement (defined as lack of improvement of
      at least 5 letters on an eye chart compared with 2 previous consecutive visits or lack of
      decrease of the retinal center point thickness of at least 50 microns compared with 2
      previous consecutive visits) or complete success (defined as visual acuity of 20/20 or better
      or retinal center point thickness <225 microns).
