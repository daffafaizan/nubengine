      accurate prognostic prediction may be the key to make clinical decision and improve survival
      rate. Liver volume, non-invasively reflects the balance of structural collapse with hepatic
      regeneration, predicting the prognosis of liver diseases. However, there is no idea whether
      the liver volume is an indicator to predict the mortality of HBV-ACLF patients. The present
      study evaluated the difference of liver volume between 28-day survival group and
      non-survivals and developed a new prognostic model based on liver volume . This study
      highlighted the significance of liver morphology in predicting the outcome of HBV-ACLF for
      the first time.
