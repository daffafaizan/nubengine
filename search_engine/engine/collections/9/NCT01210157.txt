      Heart failure can be either caused by vascular disease (i.e. cardiomypathy (CMP) due to
      coronary artery disease ("ischemic/ICMP")) or by myocardial conditions (i.e. dilated
      cardiomyopathies (DCMP) resulting from other causes like familial disposition, drug toxicity,
      etc.). Gold standard for the diagnosis of CMPs is the coronary angiography in conjunction
      with left ventricular angiography and myocardial biopsy, non-invasive markers include
      C-reactive protein (CRP) for ICMP and brain natriuretic protein (BNP) for DCMP. We have
      previously identified G3BP to be overexpressed in foam cells and plasma-derived
      microparticles, both potentially important in formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Galectin-3
      binding protein (G3BP) is a secreted protein that is involved in cell adhesion and immune
      activation. The purpose of the current study is to test, whether G3BP plasma levels (a) are
      able to non-invasively differentiate causes of CMP and (b) are a suitable means for future
      risk assessment in CMP patients.
