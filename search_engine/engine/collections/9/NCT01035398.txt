        -  Examine the role of several genetically-determined factors in combination with cigarette
           smoking and diet in the etiology and prevention of esophageal cancer.

        -  Identify polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes (e.g., phase I or II metabolism [GSTM1,
           GSTT1,CYP1A1, CYP3A5, mEH, NQO1, GSTP1], DNA repair [XRCC1, ERCC2], free-radical
           formation [MPO, MnSOD], inflammatory genes [ IL1-beta], metastatic potential [MMP1], and
           cell cycle or tumor suppression [p21, p53]) and related path genes of susceptibility for
           esophageal cancer.

      OUTLINE: Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected. DNA purified from these samples is
      analyzed using DNA-based assays to determine polymorphisms in various related gene pathways.

      Patients complete questionnaires concerning environmental, smoking and diet habits.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 tissue samples from patients and healthy participants
      (750 patients and 250 healthy participants) will be accrued for this study.
