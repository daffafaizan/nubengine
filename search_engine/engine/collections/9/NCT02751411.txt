      infants-children with a diagnosis of chronic functional constipation according to the
      definition of Criteria of Rome III. The enrolled subjects will be randomized according to an
      electronically generated randomization list in 2 groups: one group will receive micro-enemas
      of PromelaxinÂ® (Group A) while the second group will receive Macrogol 4000 per os (Group B) .
      Children will receive the dedicated treatment for two weeks and then undergo a follow-up
      period of a maximun of 6 weeks.

      The hypothesis is that the protective micro-enema will help achieving regular evacuation by
      its local antinflammatory non-pharmacological action. This hypothesis is based on the finding
      that local anal inflammation can cause functional constipation due to discomfort and pain
      during evacuation or by influencing reflexes.
