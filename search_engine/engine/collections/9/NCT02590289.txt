    
      This is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-way crossover, 4-sequence study to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) and food effect of BBI-5000 capsules in healthy adult subjects.

      Participating subjects will receive a single oral dose of BBI-5000 followed by a washout
      period of 7-14 days between doses. The treatment period will be followed by 5-10 day
      follow-up period.

      PK and PD will be assessed by blood sampling through 72 hours postdose.

      Safety will be assessed through collection of vital signs, adverse events, physical
      examination, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests.
