      developed countries. Obesity is associated with diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular
      disease, hypertension, and certain cancers. Modest amounts of weight loss (e.g., 5% to 10% of
      initial body weight) significantly improve health and improve disease status. Recent evidence
      suggests that the use of supplements or meal replacements promotes greater weight loss than
      isocaloric food-based diets. In addition, diets that are high in protein are associated with
      greater ratings of satiety and reduced food intake, as well as greater weight loss, compared
      to lower protein diets.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effect of a partial supplement diet on body
      weight, body composition, and biomarkers for disease compared to an isocaloric diet that
      consists of a traditional food-based meal plan. Overweight and obese (BMI 25 to 35)
      participants will participate in this six-month study. The primary outcome variable is body
      weight loss and the secondary outcome variables include body composition, blood pressure,
      lipids, and subjective ratings of satiety.
