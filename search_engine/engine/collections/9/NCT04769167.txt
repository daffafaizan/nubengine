      of stool and blood from a prospective cohort of 225 women with diabetes (and 225 without) and
      sequence the amplicons, and (ii) perform ELISA (IgM and IgG) analysis of sera collected
      concurrently. They will assay IgM/IgG positive samples for neutralizing antibodies. To
      determine prevalence in pregnant women (i) the investigators will perform PCR analysis of 1st
      trimester stool and blood from a prospective cohort of 450 women with diabetes (and 450
      without diabetes) and sequence the amplicons, and (ii) perform ELISA (IgM and IgG) analysis
      of sera collected at 1st and 2nd or 3rd trimester. They will assay IgM/IgG positive samples
      for neutralizing antibodies.

      The investigators will also perform a comprehensive virome analysis using metagenomic shotgun
      sequencing with ViroCap enrichment, a method developed by co-PI, on 1st trimester stool
      samples from a subset (~4-500) of women (both EVB positive and negative) enrolled in Aim 1.
      The investigators will complement this data with VirScan® analysis of blood collected from
      the same women at 1st and 2nd/3rd trimester. VirScan® is a revolutionary new technique for
      comprehensive profiling of sera for antibodies against ~400 species and strains of pathogenic
      viruses.
