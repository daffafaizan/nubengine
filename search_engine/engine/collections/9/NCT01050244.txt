      to a high degree of variability between patients. To address this issue, we are implementing
      a unique methodology using a series of N-of-1 or single subject randomized, double blind,
      controlled studies. With this, we will explore the role of soy protein supplementation in
      neuropathic pain patients. Each patient will be exposed in 3-week intervals to soy protein
      and a control, milk protein, in three paired treatment periods for a total of 18 weeks. This
      method allows for the measurement of treatment efficacy in individual distinct patients and
      has the potential for immediate and continued medical benefit using a simple and readily
      available dietary ingredient.
