      caregivers of young children in primary care, (2) assess the acceptability and feasibility of
      implementing a parenting intervention for depressed caregivers of young children in primary
      care, and (3)to explore differences in depressive symptoms, parenting stress, parent response
      to child behaviors, social support, child developmental and behavioral functioning, and
      completion of mental health referrals among depressed caregivers who receive the intervention
      or control condition. Two Philadelphia City Health Centers and the five Children's Hospital
      of Philadelphia (CHOP) Primary Care Practices in Philadelphia, and the Early Head Start site
      at CHOP will be recruited to participate in the study. Incredible Years Parents, Babies and
      Toddlers Program, a validated group parenting education program has been adapted for use with
      depressed caregivers by inclusion of psychoeducational depression materials and by
      recommendations from a study steering committee composed of parents of young children,
      behavioral health specialists, and early childhood educators. Caregivers attending their
      12-30 month old child's well-child visit at participating practices will complete the Patient
      Health Questionnaire-2, a brief validated depression screen. Caregivers who screen positive
      (score>2) for depression treatment will receive mental health resource materials and be
      invited to participate in the study. Caregivers who enroll in the study will be consented and
      randomized to receive enhanced mental health referrals and either (1) attend the parenting
      intervention immediately (immediate intervention) or (2) after participating in the study for
      three months (wait list control). Parents in both study arms will complete measures of
      depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II), parenting stress (Parenting Stress
      Index-Short Form), parent response to child behaviors (Parenting Scale), social support
      (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and child functioning (Infant and
      Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment [ITSEA] and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
      development Screening Tool) at baseline, three-four months, and six-seven month study visits.
      In addition, parents will be contacted monthly to assess follow through, barriers to and need
      for assistance with mental health referrals. Information on the feasibility (proportion who
      enroll in the study and proportion who attend at least one intervention session), and
      acceptability (proportion who attend 4 or more intervention sessions and overall intervention
      satisfaction) of this intervention and its measures will be used to design future studies to
      test effectiveness of parenting interventions for depressed caregivers in pediatric primary
      care practices. If proven effective, such interventions could be disseminated to other
      pediatric practices to assist them in caring for depressed caregivers.

      In order to better understand the barriers and facilitators to conducting depression
      screening of parents in primary care practices, we are conducting interviews with clinicians
      who performed depression screenings as part of the quality improvement initiative to
      implement depression screenings for caregivers of young children in primary care practices.
      After assessing clinician responses to the interview questions, we will identify perceptions
      of parental depression, screening procedures, referral procedures, and barriers and
      facilitators to screening in primary care and disseminate the results to better inform future
      depression screening initiatives in the primary care setting.
