    
      Total 36 normal healthy adult male subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 240 mL of water in each period as
      per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to dose
      administration and for at least 4 hours post dose. Standardized meals will be provided in
      each study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour Predose and 2 hours
      Post dose in each period. A total of 24 blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic
      profiling. The whole blood concentrations of Cyclosporine will be measured by a validated
      LC/MS/MS analytical method. Ratio analysis will be performed for untransformed and log
      transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-72, AUC0 inf. ANOVA will be performed on
      log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-72, AUC0-inf and 90% confidence
      interval will be constructed for the ratio of geometric least square mean of the Test and
      Reference products, obtained from the log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded
      if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence interval, both falls within the
      acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax, AUC0-72 and AUC0-inf.
