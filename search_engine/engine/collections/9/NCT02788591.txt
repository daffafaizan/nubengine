      treatment between patients with normal endomicroscopy findings compared with patients with
      abnormal endomicroscopy findings. The researchers will compare two different drug regimens
      for the NERD subjects to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing NERD-related symptoms. In
      addition, the researchers will be testing the function and effectiveness of the confocal
      endomicroscopy procedure to be used during the study. Researchers will be continuing to
      assess the status, symptoms, and any changes associated with the symptoms subjects are
      experiencing.

      The confocal endomicroscopy procedure utilizes a powerful microscope that is used during an
      endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure that allows us to scope/view the inside of the
      esophagus and stomach using a camera in precise detail.

      An endoscopy procedure and measurements of acid in the esophagus have been used to determine
      if the investigators think acid is causing the symptoms. Traditionally, acid blocking
      medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs such as Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole,
      Omeprazole, and Pantoprazole), or medications such as Sucralfate have been used to treat the
      symptoms of NERD.

      The medical community believes that these symptoms are due to increased spaces between the
      cells that make up the esophagus. They can directly see those spaces using the confocal
      endomicroscopy.

      Patients are asked to participate in this study if they are 18 years of age or older and have
      typical symptoms for patients diagnosed with NERD that have not responded to the first
      attempted medication.
