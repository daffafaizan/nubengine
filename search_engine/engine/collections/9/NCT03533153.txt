      radicals, trigger inflammatory reaction, and ultimately lead to myocardial remodeling and
      irreversible cardiac function decline. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and haemorrhage are
      common pathological alternations in myocardium post primary PCI, which provide strong
      prognostic information for STEMI patients. Till now, there is no treatment to be used in
      clinical practice to reduce myocardium MVO and haemorrhage. With the deep research on stem
      cells, it is found that the benefits of MSC transplants for myocardium infarction may be
      achieved by its paracrine effect. Meanwhile, the immunoregulatory effect of MSC has been
      widely reported in multiply immune disease. Therefore, the applicant proposed the hypothesis
      that MSC can play an effective role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory response,
      inhibiting microvascular obstruction and haemorrhage. Intravenous injection of MSC will be
      used in patients with STEMI within 12 hours post primary PCI. The primary endpoint and safety
      endpoint are recorded in the one year follow up to assess the clinical outcome of intravenous
      MSC treatment.
