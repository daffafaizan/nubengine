      other anti-cancer agents. Combination 1 will combine niraparib with the anti-programmed cell
      death protein (PD)-1 monoclonal antibody cetrelimab, in participants with mCRPC. Combination
      1 has 2 parts: in Part 1 (dose selection), participants will be enrolled to establish RP2D
      doses of niraparib and cetrelimab; and Part 2 (dose expansion) will evaluate the combination
      therapy in an expanded number of participants into 2 cohorts (biomarker positive or biomarker
      negative). Combination 2 will combine niraparib with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone
      (AA-P) in mCRPC participants with DNA-repair gene defects (DRD). Combination 3 will evaluate
      the relative bioavailability (BA) of niraparib and AA in combination. In a pharmacokinetics
      (PK) assessment phase, niraparib and AA will be administered, and in an extension phase,
      niraparib and AA-P will be administered. Combinations 1 and 2 will have 4 phases: A
      Pre-screening Phase, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase; Combination
      3 has 3 phases: A Screening Phase, A PK Assessment Phase, and an Extension Phase. Study
      evaluations will include efficacy, PK, PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and
      tolerability.
