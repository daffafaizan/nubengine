      can contribute to colon cancer, and how it may change due to colon cancer. In addition, we
      are going to study the features of the microbiome that can help predict recovery after colon
      resection. To do this, we are going to compare the microbiome from subjects with colon cancer
      to subjects without colon cancer.

      Study participation involves collection of stool samples before and after your surgery, as
      well as samples of residual (left-over) colon tissue from your surgery. We would also like to
      collect optional samples from your follow-up colonoscopy. You may be in the study for up to 5
      years.
