      health problems within the United States Department of Defense (DoD). There are limited
      evidence-based suicide prevention interventions that have been developed for military
      personnel and veterans who are experiencing suicide ideation or who have made a suicide
      attempt.

      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the Safety Planning for Military (SAFE MIL) on
      suicide ideation, suicide-related coping, and attitudes toward help seeking for hospitalized
      military personnel at high suicide risk.

      Methodology: To test the efficacy of the adapted intervention, the investigators will
      randomize 186 patients to one of two conditions: Safety Planning for Military (SAFE MIL) or
      Enhanced Usual Care (E-CARE). The SAFE MIL condition (intervention) will consist of the
      Safety Planning Intervention to help the suicidal individual with a collaboratively generated
      personal plan to mitigate or prevent a future suicidal crisis. The E-Care will consist of the
      usual care patients receive at an inpatient facility during their hospitalization in addition
      to assessment services provided by independent evaluators who work directly with our research
      team. Primary outcomes include suicide ideation, suicide-related coping, and attitudes toward
      help-seeking [acceptability and initiation of services]. Patients in both conditions will be
      assessed on the dependent measures at the time of hospital admission (i.e., baseline), at the
      time discharge (Follow-Up Interval 1 [FU-1]), at 1-month (Follow-Up Interval 2 [FU-2]) and at
      6-month (Follow-Up Interval 3 [FU-3]).
