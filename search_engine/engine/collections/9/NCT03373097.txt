    
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or
      expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed High Risk and/or
      relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma will be enrolled in the study.

      After completion of the phase I portion of the study, a small cohort of patients with
      GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.

      Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which will be
      manufactured to obtain the autologous CAR T product GD2-CART01, a GD2-targeting CAR T
      product. Briefly, the patients will be treated with a lymphodepleting regimen containing
      conventional chemotherapic agents and subsequently will receive a single infusion of
      GD2-CART01. Moreover, the product contains a suicide gene safety switch (namely inducible
      Caspase 9): in case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in
      order to activate the apoptotic pathway in the infused T cells.

      After infusion of CAR T cells, the patients will enter a 5-year active follow-up period.
