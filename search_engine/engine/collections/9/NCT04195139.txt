      Participants will be allocated to either experimental or control group in a 2:1 ratio by
      chance (randomly). Patients assigned to the experimental group will receive a course of
      nivolumab via intravenous infusion (240 mg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days for cycles 1-4;
      then 480 mg day 1 every 28 days for cycles 5-6) in addition to the standard regimen of
      Temozolomide (TMZ) tablets and radiotherapy. Patients assigned to the control group will
      receive the standard treatment of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200mg/m2 days 1-5 every 28 days)
      for 6 cycles and standard radiotherapy treatment (40 Gy administered in 15 fractions).
