      combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP),
      which is an important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to
      know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at
      which a drug is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased
      therapeutic effects.

      Patients take AZT every 4 hours and/or SMX/TMP every 12 hours by mouth for 4 days as
      outpatients and then come into the clinical research center for 2 days of studies. On day 5
      the final dose of medicine is given orally (SMX/TMP) or by intravenous infusion (AZT). Blood
      samples are drawn 10-20 times over a period of 12 hours and urine is collected for 36 hours.
      Concentrations of the drugs in the blood and urine samples are determined. This sequence is
      repeated twice, so that each patient takes AZT alone, SMX/TMP alone, and the combination of
      AZT and SMX/TMP over a period of about 3 weeks. Patients may be included in the study if they
      are asymptomatic, or have been diagnosed with ARC or AIDS, but not if they have PCP or any
      other severe opportunistic infection.
