      and compromises globally the physical capacity of the patients. Despite new advances in
      pharmacological therapy, physiotherapy and exercise remain essential in the treatment of AS.
      However, the literature lacks studies showing which types of exercises are more effective in
      patients with AS.

      This is a randomized controlled trial with the objective is to evaluate the effects of
      aerobic training on functional capacity, mobility, disease activity, cardiopulmonary capacity
      and cytokine levels (TNF, IL10, IL6 and IL1) in patients with AS.

      The duration of the trial is 24 weeks with the first 12 weeks reserved to exercise programs.
      The participants will be divided in two groups. The intervention group (IG) will perform
      walking for 50 minutes plus global stretching 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The control group
      (CG) will do only stretching exercises 3 times a week for 12 weeks.
