      (NHLBI) to investigate several treatments for severe asthma. PrecISE will enroll 800 adults
      and teenagers (ages 12 years and older) with severe asthma who have symptoms that are not
      well-controlled on high dose of inhaled corticosteroids including those who have frequent
      asthma attacks. Each person who agrees to enroll in the PrecISE study will receive several
      treatments for research purposes based on their type of severe asthma.

      The goal of PrecISE is to understand how to treat different types of severe asthma, by using
      precision medicine. Precision medicine is an approach that targets treatments to defined
      subgroups of patients who share similar characteristics, for example, patients with a certain
      genetic variation or patients with high number of blood eosinophils.

      Researchers from over 30 locations across the US, as well as sites in Canada and the United
      Kingdom, are involved in PrecISE.
