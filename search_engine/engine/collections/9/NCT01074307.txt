    
      Subjects with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) will be enrolled in this study after
      proper evaluation of NT-proBNP, global assessment of CHF, 6-minute walking test and
      improvement score of New York Heart Association (NYHA) and echocardiogram (left ventricular
      chamber size and ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each subject will be orally administered
      bisoprolol for 6 months starting at 1.25 mg at the Week 0 and titrated up to 10 mg during the
      6 month period if the persistent standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than (>)
      90 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) and there is no symptom of hypotension at the current dose
      medication (syncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness when standing up).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the effect of bisoprolol (between low dose and high dose) on surrogate markers
      of heart failure in Korea

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate bisoprolol for the effects on clinical improvement of heart failure in
           Korea:

             1. New York Heart Association (NYHA),

             2. 6-minutes walking test

             3. Echocardiogram (left ventricular chamber size and LVEF)

        -  Hospitalization due to heart failure

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bisoprolol

        -  Global assessment of CHF
