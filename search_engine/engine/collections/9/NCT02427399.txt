      in cervical cancer screening outreach in a randomized controlled trial. It will also be one
      of the few randomized controlled trials to directly compare different outreach media
      directly, as opposed to different variations within a single medium (e.g. two different types
      of letters). Lastly, given the unique patient demographic makeup at Fenway, including a
      significant number of lesbian, bisexual and transgender patients, secondary subanalyses have
      the potential to significantly add to the investigators' knowledge of what media work best in
      conducting cervical cancer screening outreach with sexual and gender minorities, who are
      disproportionately underscreened compared to heterosexual cis-gendered women.
