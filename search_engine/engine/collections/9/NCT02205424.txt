    
      Our primary outcome measure was total brain volume (TBV) change between the 3-month and
      3-year time-points compared between stroke patients and controls.

      Secondary outcome 1 was TBV change between 3-months and 3-years comparing CN and CI stroke
      participants. TBV at 3-months will be adjusted for CCI scores, and years of education; the
      latter as it is correlated with cognitive performance and post-stroke dementia risk, but not
      for stroke lesion volume as no conclusive evidence for an effect has been demonstrated
      previously.

      Secondary outcome 2 was hippocampal volume (HV) change between 3-months and 3-years in stroke
      patients and controls with adjustments identical to primary outcome.

      Secondary outcome 3 was the comparison of HV change between 3-months and 3-years comparing CN
      and CI stroke participants with adjustments identical to secondary outcome 1.
