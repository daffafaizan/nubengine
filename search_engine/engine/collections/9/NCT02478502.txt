      cisplatin-based chemotherapy or after high-dose chemotherapy have a poor prognosis and no
      curative options. Taxanes in various combinations unfold cytotoxic effects on germ cell
      tumors resistant to conventional doses of cisplatin. Paclitaxel in combination with
      ifosfamide and cisplatin (TIP) has become a common regimen for salvage treatment of germ cell
      cancer. In most patients, however, resistance to paclitaxel, as evidenced by progression
      occurs.Cabazitaxel has been developed to overcome resistance to docetaxel and paclitaxel. It
      has shown efficacy in patients progressing during docetaxel therapy in a large phase III
      trial (TROPIC) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore,
      chemotherapy resistance might be less likely to develop in patients receiving cabazitaxel as
      compared to other taxanes.
