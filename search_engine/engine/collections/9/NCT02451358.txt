      (NH) or Southern Hemisphere (SH) formulations by the intramuscular (IM) route. Immunogenicity
      of the vaccine was assessed at baseline (Day 0) and 28 days after the last injection. Safety
      data were collected up to 28 days after each injection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were
      collected throughout the trial.
