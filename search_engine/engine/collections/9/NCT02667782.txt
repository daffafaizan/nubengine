      group. Both MBSR and MBCT will be delivered through a face-to-face teaching session followed
      by regular telephone follow-ups.

      The primary outcome measures of the dementia caregivers will be stress with Perceived Stress
      Scale (PSS; Cohen & Williamson, 1988). The secondary outcome measures of the dementia
      caregiver will be 1) anxiety with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmon &
      Snaith, 1983), 2) depression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD;
      Radloff, 1977), and 3) burden with Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI; Zarit, Reever, &
      Bach-Peterson, 1980). The control measure will be their level of mastery of the five facets
      mindfulness with Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins,
      Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006). Focus group interviews with each group of participants will be
      conducted post-intervention to explore their experiences and perceptions.

      Data will be collected at baseline (T0), at 2 months (the mid-point of the intervention; T1),
      4 months (immediately after the intervention; T2), and 7 months (the follow-up assessment;
      T3). Adherence rates, response rates, and drop-out rates will be collected and analyzed. The
      triangulation of both qualitative and quantitative data will be performed to determine the
      suitability and benefits of MBSR and MBCT for carers of PWD in the local setting.
