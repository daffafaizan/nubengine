      bronchitis COPD patients. Part 1 consisted of up to 27-days of screening period, one baseline
      period of 1 day, 13 days of bid dosing with study treatment, morning only treatment on Day
      14, follow up visits on Days 15 - 17, followed by a Study Completion evaluation. Twenty-seven
      patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to 3 cohorts..

      Part 2 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory study in Gold
      spirometry grades I-III COPD patients. Part 2 consisted of up to 20 days of screening period,
      a 9 day run in period, one baseline period of 1 day, 55 days of bid dosing, morning only
      dosing on Day 56, followed by Study Completion evaluation. It was planned to randomize 90
      patients in a 2:1 ratio, but part 2 was terminated after 21 patients were enrolled. Three of
      the 21 part 2 patients experienced moderate to severe (up to 17-fold) asymptomatic and
      reversible elevation of liver transaminase levels after 3 weeks of treatment with QBM076 150
      mg twice daily. Two of these patients had liver transaminase levels high enough to be
      reported as serious adverse events suspected to be related to the study drug.
