      The secondary objectives is the Impact of immune therapy with COVID-19 convalescent plasma on
      markers for ARDS due to severe COVID-19 infection; short-term all-cause mortality; time
      course of ARDS due to severe COVID-19 and assessment of safety and tolerability of immune
      therapy with COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

      As a primary endpoint/variable we will assess change in SOFA score from Baseline Visit to Day
      8.
