    
      ORIC-101 is a small molecule GR antagonist being developed for the treatment of patients with
      solid tumor malignancies. Mechanistically, ORIC-101 inhibits GR transcriptional activity and
      blocks the pro-survival signals mediated by the activated nuclear receptor.

      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, dose-finding study to assess the safety and
      preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel or other
      anticancer therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will begin
      with dose finding in combination initially with nab-paclitaxel in patients with various solid
      tumors (Part I); additional dose expansion cohorts in specific tumor types with
      nab-paclitaxel (Part II) or with other anticancer therapies may be evaluated through protocol
      amendment(s).

      The study will first evaluate intermittent administration (5 days on, 2 days off for 21 days)
      of ORIC-101 followed by continuous administration (daily for 21 days) in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.

      In Part II, patients will be enrolled across four cohorts of advanced or metastatic disease:

        -  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

        -  ovarian cancer

        -  triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)

        -  other solid tumors
