      proprietary quantifier of cortical activity displayed by the NeuroSENSE, with (1) commonly
      assessed clinical endpoints/variables relating to the DOA, (2) changes in anesthetic drug
      administration, and (3) the anesthesiologist's assessment of the DOA based on standard of
      care monitors and his/her own observations of the patient state.

      The hypothesis under evaluation is that the WAVcns index is an independent assessor of the
      progression of the anesthetic state and events of general anesthesia related to hypnotic
      endpoints.
