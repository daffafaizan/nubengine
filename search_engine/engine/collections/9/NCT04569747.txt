        -  Participants will receive HER2-directed treatment for 1 year and hormonal therapy for
           approximately 5 years.

        -  It is expected that about 375 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug works in
      treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is being
      studied.

      The drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies, which are
      disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has approved trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab + pertuzumab subcutaneous fixed
      dose combination (PHESGO) as treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. The FDA has also
      approved hormonal therapies as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
