      assigned to receive cisplatin-based (control arm) with carboplatin-based (investigational
      arm) chemoradiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive docetaxel (75mg/m2 on day
      1), carboplatin (AUC 4 on day 1) every three weeks for two cycles before the radiotherapy,
      and then receive radical radiotherapy and carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) every three weeks for
      three cycles during radiotherapy. Patients in the control arm receive docetaxel (75mg/m2 on
      day 1), cisplatin (75mg/m2 on day 1) every three weeks for two cycles before the
      radiotherapy, and then receive radical radiotherapy and cisplatin (100mg/m2 on day 1) every
      three weeks for three cycles during radiotherapy. Patients are stratified according to stage.
      The primary end point is overall survival (OS). Secondary end points include failure-free
      survival (FFS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival
      (LR-FFS), initial response rates after treatments and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses
      are conducted in the intention-to-treat population; the safety population include only
      patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
