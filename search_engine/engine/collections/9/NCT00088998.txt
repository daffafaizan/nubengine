      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with
           docetaxel, capecitabine, and bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a
      complete response (CR) receive at least 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for 3 years.
