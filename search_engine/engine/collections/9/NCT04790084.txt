      choroidal vascularity index can evaluate the choroidal changes of chorioretinal diseases as a
      whole. In this study, the choroidal changes of patients with common fundus diseases were
      systematically evaluated by collecting OCT and optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA) images of patients with common fundus diseases, especially in healthy people, myopic
      people and patients with central serous chorioretinopathy.
