      importance in the surgical management of localised prostate cancer. However there is no high
      quality evidence proving the superiority of the robotic approach over conventional
      laparoscopic prostatectomy. The study aims to evaluate functional and oncological outcomes
      between the two approaches. In terms of clinical values, oncologic and continence outcomes,
      erectile function as well as quality of life - patient satisfaction and psychosocial
      orientation will be investigated.
