      prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis in fractured ankle joints. The study is a double blind,
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, stepwise trial. Amobarbital will be delivered to
      ankle joints in solution with hyaluronic acid (HA) as a vehicle. Amobarbital/HA injections
      (active dose) will be compared to HA alone (placebo dose). Our primary goal is to confirm
      safety, but we will also assess whether treatment improves chondrocyte viability and
      decreases synovial inflammation. The intervention that has proven to be effective in vitro
      and in vivo models. The study team will assess safety and begin to evaluate efficacy of
      amobarbital/Gel-One in patients having sustained tibial pilon fractures. The study team will
      use advanced imaging-based methods we have developed to characterize how joints subjected to
      varying levels of fracture severity and residual elevated contact stress respond in treated
      and control groups.

      Phase I:6 subjects will be treated with a single dose open label, and safety measures will be
      assessed.

      Phase II: Once initial safety is confirmed, 20 amobarbital:10 control subjects will be
      treated with the single dose at the initial operation.

      Assuming continued safety, an additional 20 amobarbital:10 control subjects will be treated
      with two doses and evaluated. The second dose of 2.5 mM amobarbital will be administered
      during the second operation.

      Subjects will participate in the following procedures:

      SOC surgical intervention Randomization to Amobarbital/Gel-One arm or control arm X-rays CT
      scans Blood and urine Questionnaires
