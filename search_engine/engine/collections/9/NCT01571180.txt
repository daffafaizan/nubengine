      questioned preoperatively and one, three, six and twelve months after gastric bypass surgery.
      Each assessment will be performed during a routine consultation.

      The following aspects will be investigated:

        -  Medication The investigators have composed a questionnaire to examine which drugs the
           patients use, adherence, information received about medication and from whom,…

        -  Clinical parameters Every consultation, concentrations of hemoglobin, iron, hepcidin,
           vitamin B12,…. and a 24h urine collection to determine calcium excretion will be
           collected.

        -  Dietary intake The investigators will ask patients to keep a food record during two
           non-consecutive days preceding each consultation. In this food record patients have to
           note all consumed foods and beverages with the right/estimated amounts. This makes it
           possible to see the changes of the composition of the meals before and after RYGB.
