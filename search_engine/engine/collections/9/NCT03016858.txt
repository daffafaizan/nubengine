      standard of care in VATS. However, this type of anesthesia has been associated with several
      adverse effects, which can trigger complications and increase the overall surgical risk. In
      order to avoid intubated-anesthesia-related adverse effects, nonintubated strategies have
      been proposed in recent years.Encouraged by the satisfactory results with a preliminary
      experience of nonintubated VATS, the multicenter randomized parallel controlled study is
      established to comparatively analyze the outcome of patients undergoing either nonintubated
      intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation (NIIASV) or IASLV VATS thoracoscopic
      bullectomy surgeryï¼Œespecially in complication rate, safety during operation, muscle recovery
      after surgery, the difference the postoperative hospitalization time.
