      lentivirus-transduced CAR T cells in patients with malignant tumors.

      Primary objectives:

        1. Determine the safety and tolerability of CAR T cells (autologous T cells transduced with
           chimeric antigen receptors recognizing CD19, BCMA, GPC3 and Claudin18.2) in patients
           with malignant tumors (B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma, myeloma, hepatocellular
           carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction).

        2. Observe the cytokinetics of CAR T cells.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Observe the efficacy of CAR T cells in patients with malignant tumors.

        2. Make an evaluation on the distribution and in vivo survival of CAR T cells in targeted
           tissues.

        3. Observe the immunogenicity of CAR T cells, and determine if there are anti-scFv cellular
           immune response and anti-scFv humoral immune response.

        4. Observe the changes of cell subsets for CAR T cells against T cells (Tcm, central memory
           T lymphocytes; Tem, effector memory T lymphocytes; Treg, regulatory T-lymphocytes).
