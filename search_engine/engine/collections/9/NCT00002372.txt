      indinavir and nelfinavir. The randomized phase will be preceded by a single dose
      pharmacokinetic interaction study of 141W94 and indinavir in 12 patients. Data from this
      single dose investigation will be used to determine the dose of indinavir to be used in the
      randomized phase.
