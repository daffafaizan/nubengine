      increases the overall survival in patients with gliomas. Yet, recent data have shown that
      conventional MR imaging underestimates the spatial extent of gliomas, since tumor cells were
      found to invade beyond MR imaging abnormalities. Thus, it is hypothesized that an extended
      resection with a margin beyond MR imaging-defined abnormalities-a "supratotal"
      resection-might improve the outcome of gliomas. However, the exact extent of supratotal
      resection remains unclear. Unnecessary removal of brain tissue that does not contain cancer
      cells can lead to neurological deficits that affect quality of life, such as impaired
      cognition, memory, and vision. Recently, studies from human specimens have shown that
      infiltrating glioma cells spread about 1cm beyond the gross and radiographic margins of the
      tumor. The investigators thereof propose to perform extended resection at least 1cm beyond
      the MRI defined margin might improve the outcome of patients with gliomas.
