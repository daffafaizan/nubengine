      placement. Soft tissue augmentaion techniques have been suggested in order to overcome the
      alterations of buccal bone during remodeling. Nevertheless, it is still inconclusive whether
      soft tissue augmentation procedures actually have a protective role in preserving buccal bone
      thickness in immediate implants.

      Aim is to clinically and radiographically assess the effect of soft tissue grafting on buccal
      bone resorption and pink esthetics around immediately placed implants in maxillary anterior
      teeth after 24 months following implant placement. 18 non-restorable maxillary anterior teeth
      randomly assigned into 2 groups: (test group) immediately placed implants with simultaneous
      vascular interpositional periosteal connective tissue (VIP-CT) grafting versus non-augmented
      implant sites (control group). Buccal bone changes were assessed at implant placement (0) and
      at 4,9,12 and 24 months from baseline by specially manufactured device and at 24 months by
      cone beam computed tomography scans (CBCT). Pink esthetic score (PES) was evaluated at 6, 9,
      12 and 24 months intervals. Pain and satisfaction were assessed through questionnaires to the
      patients.
