      analgesia is recommended to overcome this issue. Therefore this randomized controlled trial
      was conducted to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided
      Ilioinguinal/Iliohyphogastric nerve block vs. local anaesthetic infiltration of wound with
      Ropivacaine on postoperative pain after open repair of unilateral inguinal hernia in adults.

      This study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi.It is a Randomised
      controlled trial conducted from March 2019 to October 2019. 60 participants for elective
      unilateral open inguinal hernia repair were included. Patients were randomly allocated (30
      each) to one of the two groups. Group I received ILI/IHG nerve block where 20mls 0.25%
      Ropivacaine was infiltrated around the nerves under U/S guidance, and group II received local
      anaesthetic infiltration (Ropivacaine 20mls 0.25%) at the end of surgery at the incision site
      to provide postoperative analgesia. Postoperative pain at rest (static) and on movement
      (dynamic) was assessed on VRS scale at 0= no pain , 1-3=mild pain, 4-6=moderate pain,
      7-10=severe pain at 0, 2,6, 12, 24 hours, either in person or telephone. Total tramadol
      consumption and time for first tramadol requirement was noted.

      In addition complications related to IHG block and LA infiltration were observed.Patient
      satisfaction was also gauged by the LIKERT scale in the questionairre.
