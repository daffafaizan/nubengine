      and VISTA studies. In these studies, aflibercept was injected using the fixed dosing regimen
      that an intravitreal injection was performed 5 times every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks.
      Although the efficacy was comparable to that of ranibizumab injected every 4 weeks,
      continuous visits and treatments account for quite a burden. TER is regarded as a alternative
      regimen that may reduce visit and treatment numbers for age-related macular degeneration. TER
      is a variable dosing regimen that an injection interval is adjusted based on the treatment
      response. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy of TER using aflibercept for DME, by
      assessing changes of visual acuity at 104 weeks compared to baseline.
