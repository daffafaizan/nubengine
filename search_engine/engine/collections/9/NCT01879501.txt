      to the anticipated and exponential growth in the ageing population in Singapore and a rise in
      chronic non-communicable eye diseases. Finding the best evidenced-based management for
      chronic eye diseases contributing to low vision (LV) is therefore crucial. Improving patient
      responsibility is the key to managing LV effectively.1 This means achieving optimum self
      management (SM).2 However, there are currently no LV SM programs in Singapore and none has
      been evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, the gold standard methods to
      evaluate health interventions.
