    
      Specific Aims I: Test the safety of intraocular injection of 1mg and 4mg celecoxib in
      patients who have chronic inflammation or macular edema who are unable to tolerate
      corticosteroids due to their side effects.

      II: Test the efficacy of intraocular 1mg and 4mg celecoxib in treating inflammation or
      structural complications of inflammation (macular edema) in patients who are unable to
      tolerate corticosteroids due to their side effects.

      After investigational new drug application and Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board
      approval, celecoxib will be compounded by the Investigational Drug Service of the Vanderbilt
      Medical Center and packaged in individual sterile single use syringes for intraocular
      injection within 2 hours of preparation. Pharmaceutical grade celecoxib will be obtained from
      the drug manufacturer (Pfizer) with certificate analysis and compounded in sterile dimethyl
      sulfoxide following strict sterile technique.
