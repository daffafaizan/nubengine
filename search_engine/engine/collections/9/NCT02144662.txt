      can be obtained in SD-OCT. Some OCT studies evaluated other quantitative factors in eye
      disease. It was reported that PROS length was correlated with BCVA in patients with DME.¹
      Other investigators suggested that the thickness, area, and volume of the outer layer were
      correlated with BCVA in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).² OFT and
      relative reflectivity of the ONL were associated with BCVA in patients with macular hole.3, 4
      The volume of the ONL was found to be associated with BCVA in patients with AMD.5 The aim of
      this study was to investigate the pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT images
      that correlate with posttreatment VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis
      (Ranibizumab) for RVO.
