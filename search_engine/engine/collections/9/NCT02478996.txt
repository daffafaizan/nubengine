      deterioration of lung function and pulmonal complications. This may be partly due to one-lung
      ventilation during the thoracic part of the operation. This often encounters for prolonged
      periods of reconvalescence and reduced quality of life, apart from socioeconomic
      disadvantages. Physical preconditioning has become a crucial leverage to optimize fitness and
      lung function in patients scheduled for esophagectomy, in particular during the interval of
      neoadjuvant therapy.
