      also long (=tubular) bones. Therefore, CMD has been added to the class of craniotubular bone
      disorders. There are a number of disorders in this group and sometimes they are difficult to
      distinguish. Typical signs for CMD are the lifelong bone deposition in bones of the face and
      head (=progressive craniofacial hyperostosis) and the widening of the ends of long bones
      (=metaphyseal flaring). Typical facial characteristics are wide-set eyes and a prominent jaw
      (=mandible). CMD is sometimes diagnosed in infants. The best way to confirm diagnosis is by
      molecular genetics.
