      (Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% liquid treatment) with 3:1 randomization. Subjects
      with scleroderma will be given 2 g/kg/mo of Privigen® or placebo (Albuminar®-5) for 6 months.
      Scleroderma is generally a progressive disease, and while the skin does improve with time in
      some patients, others have progressive disease in spite of aggressive treatment. Also,
      spontaneous improvement in other organ systems is even less likely. Patients entered into the
      trial will have failed to respond to standard of care treatment over the past 4 months. Thus,
      the investigators feel that any actual improvement observed can be attributed to the IVIG
      treatment. Since this is a pilot study, future larger controlled trials will be necessary to
      clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, but the investigators are hoping that this study will
      give us signals that will guide the future clinical trial.
