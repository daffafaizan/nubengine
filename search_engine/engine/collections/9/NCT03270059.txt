      I. To test if prior gadolinium administration affects vascular imaging using ferumoxytol.

      II. To test signal changes of T2*w multi-echo fast field echo (mFFE) scans before and after
      contrast agent injection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test if ferumoxytol affects gadolinium enhanced MRI. II. To test if steady state
      cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are different at various magnetic field strengths.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore late ferumoxytol enhancement (optional MRI) hours to days after ferumoxytol
      administration in various pathologies.

      II. To evaluate the effects of ferumoxytol on malignant and non-malignant lesions in head &
      neck, and liver lesions

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then ferumoxytol IV and undergo
      MRI over 60 minutes on day 1.

      GROUP II: Patients receive ferumoxytol IV and then gadolinium IV and undergo MRI over 60
      minutes on day 1.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.
