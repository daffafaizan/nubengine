      with peri-implantitis were included. In addition to the conventional scaling and debridement,
      random 24 implants were lased by a DL. Periodontal indexes, microbiologic specimens and
      radiographs were used for assessment. Baseline parameters were similar between groups. After
      six months laser group revealed higher MBL than the control group. Microbiota of the implants
      were found unchanged after one month. DL appears to have no additional positive influence on
      the peri-implantitis treatment.
