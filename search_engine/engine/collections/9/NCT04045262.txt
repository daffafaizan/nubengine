      breath) measurements of effective pulmonary blood flow (EPBF) and effective end-expiratory l
      lung volume (EELVCO2). The former refers to the non-shunted fraction of cardiac output and
      the latter to the functional end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) that contains CO2.

      The capnodynamic method is based on the advanced analysis of CO2 kinetics and the law of
      Conservation of mass. It states that lungs have to eliminate a similar amounts of CO2 as
      produced by aerobic metabolism and reaches the lung via pulmonary perfusion. For its
      calculation, two different measurements are needed:

        1. Exhaled CO2 measured by infrared optic sensor technology placed in a mainstream
           configuration between the endotracheal tube and the "Y" piece of the ventilator
           respiratory circuit.

        2. Flow, airway pressure and ventilatory volumes measured by the mechanical ventilator
           spirometer.

      The method requires the generation of cyclic small changes in the alveolar concentration of
      CO2 which is achieved by introducing a slightly modified breathing pattern. It consists of
      adding a short expiratory hold in each 3 out of 9 consecutive breaths and requires the
      patient to be in passive breathing conditions under mechanical ventilation.

      EPBF and EELVCO2 have been validated in experimental conditions and the first validations in
      patients in the setting of general anesthesia are under way.

      Methods:

      This study on EELVCO2 in critically ill patients involves 2 types of evaluations:

      The validation of absolute values of EELV by comparing it with CTsan. The trending ability of
      EELVCO2 in critically ill patients by comparing it with EIT.

      A calculated sample size of 30 patients is required for each objective.
