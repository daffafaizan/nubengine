      infarction). Delayed action isn't suitable and has to be elucidated. If a delayed gastric
      emptying time is observed during STEMI, limiting the use of morphine and encourage the use of
      prokinetic agents can be a first answer to optimize coronary angioplasty environment.

      Investigators propose a study to assess the gastric emptying times at the acute phase of
      myocardial infarction using a validated paracetamol absorption test. The STEMI group will be
      compared to in one hand, itself with measures performed 72 hours±12h after the event onset;
      and on the other hand, to a stable patient group referred for angioplasty for angina or
      non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). For STEMI group and stable patient
      group, the delay of apparition of Prasugrel or Ticagrelor efficacy will be determined by
      VerifyNow® test and correlated to gastric emptying times.

      Paracetamol absorption test is a safe, cheap and well validated method to assess these times
      including during the STEMI period. This one consists in oral ingestion of 1.5g of paracetamol
      followed by the realization of the curve of concentration of paracetamol in plasma samples.
      These samples are taken at 15 min intervals during the first 2 hours.

      In the same time the curve of Platelet reactivity Unit (PRU) obtained by VerifyNow® tests
      will be determined with the goal to establish a relation between gastric emptying times and
      delayed observed antiplatelet activity.
