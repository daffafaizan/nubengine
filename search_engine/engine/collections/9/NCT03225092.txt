      treatment of persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The
      investigators hypothesize that PRP injections will provide meaningful pain relief and
      improved functionality for patients suffering from post-TKA residual pain. The incidence of
      residual pain after TKA ranges between 10-34%. Many of these patients can be effectively
      managed by physical therapy, orthotics, and pes anserine bursa corticosteroid injections.
      However, there remain a number of refractory cases that are frustrating for both the patient
      and physician. With the advent of interventional pain management, advanced interventions for
      this clinical problem have focused on selective nerve blocks and ablations targeting the
      infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve. More recently, attention has been paid to the
      role of patient biology and inflammatory mediators in the development of post-arthroplasty
      pain (including IL-6 and CRP). If individual patient biology is the foundation of post-TKA
      pain, then biologic interventions aimed at restoring the balance of these mediators (such as
      PRP), rather than ablative procedures, seems preferable. Furthermore, while intra-operative
      PRP has been studied for its effects on wound healing, blood loss, and post-operative pain
      control, no study has investigated its utility in treating residual medial knee pain after
      TKA.

      All injections will be performed by the same board-certified sports medicine and
      musculoskeletal ultrasound physician. There will be no activity restrictions following the
      procedure.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to report mean changes in outcome scores. Data will be
      analyzed with a 2-sample t-test.
