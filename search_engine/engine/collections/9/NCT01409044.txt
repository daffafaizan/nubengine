        -  Listening to music is a common human activity. Music listening has been associated with
           decreased pain scores, increase in attentiveness and decrease in anxiety scores.
           Recently, with interest in holistic and complementary and alternative therapies, there
           has been increased awareness of the potential positive health effects of music
           listening.

        -  Inadequate pain management remains common especially in postoperative patients. Acute
           perioperative pain affects over 46 million Americans every year.

        -  As music is processed by the limbic system, enkephalins and endorphins are released.
           These substances are natural occurring opioids, suggesting music may decrease patient s
           requirements for opioids.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the effects of music listening on the amount of opioids delivered
      postoperatively to adult ICU patients via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the first
      48 hours.

      Secondary Objective:

      To determine the effects of music listening on pain and anxiety scores experienced by adult
      surgical patients during the first 48 hours postoperatively in the ICU.

      Eligibility:

      -All adult patients (18 years of age or greater) who are scheduled for surgery that have an
      anticipated ICU stay of 24-48 hours.

      Design:

      The design is a two-group randomized controlled trial. The two groups are:

        -  Treatment -Music group - intervention music delivered for approximately 50 minutes 4
           times a day

        -  Control - Standard care
