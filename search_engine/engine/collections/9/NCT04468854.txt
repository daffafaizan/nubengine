    
      In the experimental phase the investigator will administer 500 mg Luteolin (2x250 mg
      capsules) per day formulated for oral administration for 7.5 days (first intake: visit 1/3 in
      the morning; last intake: visit 2/4 in the morning). The last intake on visits 2 resp. 4 is
      important as the participants then have to recall the learned material from visits 1 resp. 3
      during a steady-state status of Luteolin.

      Subjects will be randomly allocated to treatment groups (starting with investigational
      product or placebo).
