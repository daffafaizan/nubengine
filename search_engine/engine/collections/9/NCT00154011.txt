      vascular responsiveness of different vasoactive compounds (angiotensin II, insulin, histamine
      and glyceroltrinitrate) in healthy subjects. Rosiglitazone will be given orally (4 weeks
      4mg/d, titrated to 8 mg/d for another 4 weeks) as treatment. Every subject will receive
      intravenous stimulation with angiotensin II, histamine, insulin and glyceroltrinitrate before
      and after an 8 weeks treatment interval with rosiglitazone.
