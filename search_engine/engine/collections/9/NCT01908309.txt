      loads against contrast-induced serum creatinine changes ( the load-to-damage relationship,
      LDR) characterizes the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of the contrast and it may allow for reliable
      comparative evaluations among small sized study groups randomized to different contrast
      media. The aim of the present study is to compare, through the assessment of the LDR slope,
      the intrinsic nephrotoxicity of two different contrast media using serum cystatin-C changes
      as the LDR dependent variable.
