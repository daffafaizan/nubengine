      formation of free radicals, which have a deleterious effect because they are powerful
      oxidizing agents, but also play the role of intracellular messenger, altering the cell
      functions.

      This role is especially true at the level of endothelial cells as the attachment of AGE to
      RAGE receptor causes an increase in vascular permeability. AGE binding to endothelium RAGE
      and to monocytes-macrophages, led to the production of cytokines, growth factors, to the
      expression of adhesion molecules, and the production of procoagulant activity. Increased
      permeability, facilitation of leukocyte migration, the production of reactive oxygen species,
      cytokines and VEGF suggest that the AGE could be an element of a cascade of reactions
      responsible for the diabetic angiopathy and vascular damages observed during aging and
      chronic renal failure. Recently, It's been proposed that balanced diets can limit the
      deleterious effect of AGE. For these reasons, the interest in preventive approaches
      complementary or alternative to cholesterol reduction should be one of the main objectives of
      cardiovascular research in the years to come. Already in the '70s the very low incidence of
      atherosclerotic diseases in Mediterranean countries (Greece and Southern Italy) and the
      importance of the "dietary factor" in such protection were noticed. Diets for people in these
      countries are, among other components, very rich in oleic acid, the main constituent of olive
      oil, with about 29% of daily caloric intake derived from monounsaturated fatty acids. Aim of
      this trial is to estimate the effect of a Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet on AGE
      products.
