        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-5013 in patients with recurrent high-grade
           gliomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent
      enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral CC-5013 weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 20 months.
