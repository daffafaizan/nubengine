      investigating the effectiveness of manual therapy have demonstrated improvements in outcomes
      when manual therapy has been added to a program of therapeutic exercise. However, the these
      clinical trials (3) have significant limitations and generalizability. Two of the three 3
      trials had a small number of subjects (14 & 22 subjects) and all 3 trials had only short term
      follow up (<12 weeks) and used non-validated self report outcome measures. These limitations
      reduce the confidence with which clinicians can apply these results to the patients they
      treat with SAIS. Clear evidence is needed to justify the cost and clinician time required to
      perform manual therapy in the delivery of patient care. Therefore, the purpose of this
      randomized clinical trial is to examine the short-term and long-term effectiveness of manual
      therapy in addition to therapeutic exercise as compared to therapeutic exercise only in
      patients diagnosed with SAIS.
