      -specific breath signature as a non-invasive screening tool for identifying PD patients with
      inflammation, tracking the progression of disease, and responsiveness to various therapeutic
      interventions, in particular anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapies. Neurological
      disorders include any disorder involving the brain or the nervous system, for example memory
      disorders, stroke, movement disorders and many other conditions.

      The study will lay the foundation for future studies in which breath fingerprinting could be
      used as a screening technique. Investigators will also be looking at how the breath
      fingerprint correlates with inflammatory proteins in the blood.

      Investigators will determine how molecules in human breath can define a "breath signature"
      that can be associated with neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. The long-term
      goal of this study is to use blood inflammatory marker relationships and Breath Analytical
      Approach to identify individuals at risk for development of neurologic disorders and to
      monitor the effects of immune interventions on the rate of disease progression.

      The study team will recruit a total of 100 participants: 50 early stage (defined by a Hohn &
      Yahr Stages 1-2), non-smoking Parkinson's Disease patients from among the Emory Movement
      Disorders Clinic and 50 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Investigators will recruit
      six to eight participants per month over an 18-month time period.
