      intended to be replacement for the capillary blood glucose measurement. The system contains
      several features that distinguish it from exiting sensor technology including no user
      calibration during 14 days of wear. The sensor is applied to the upper arm of the patient and
      the hand-held reader is used to scan the sensor to receive glucose result along with historic
      results with a 15 min frequency for up to 8 hours.

      An AGP (=Ambulatory Glucose Profile) report is a way to present the glucose data collected by
      the time of day that has several advantages: demonstrates median glucose levels and the
      25-75%, 10-90% excursions as well as the tendency for hypo or hyperglycemia throughout the
      day. This integration of results gives a more complete picture of the glucose control
      throughout the week/s while eliminating the "noise" from outliers.

      The hypothesis is that the addition of FreeStyle Libre system for 10 weeks to the treatment
      of uncontrolled Type 2 diabetic patients currently on MDI, will produce a modification of
      behavior/life style and improvement in treatment satisfaction, quality of life and glycemic
      control and reduce the number of any/major hypoglycemia events.
