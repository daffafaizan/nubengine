      research questions related both to the process of reprogramming and the properties of iPS
      cells. We will use various approaches to study the molecular mechanisms and processes that
      occur during reprogramming. We will use various experimental systems to characterize and
      study the properties of the iPS cells, their biology, developmental potential, capability to
      give rise to functional differentiated progeny etc.

      We will induce the differentiation of the iPS cells towards specific cell lineages and the
      progeny can be used to study the pathogenesis of diseases. They will be used for developing
      new therapeutic approaches and for high throughput screening of factors for potential toxic
      or therapeutic effects.

      All samples will be non-identified.
