      agents have not only high mortality rate but also high morbidity in the prolonged hospital
      course. Medications such as angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II
      receptor blocker may improve the survival of CHF patients. However, their implication is
      limited by the presence of hypotension secondary to low cardiac output. External enhanced
      counterpulsation (EECP), which generates the arterial and intracoronary hemodynamics similar
      to those of the intra-aortic balloon pump, is a recently approved treatment modality for
      patients with angina and heart failure. It can improve exercise capacity, quality of life and
      functional status.

      Forty patients of (1) impaired left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 40%) and are
      dependent on intravenous infusion of positive inotropic agents but (2) without significant
      aortic regurgitation, overt fluid overload, or symptomatic peripheral arterial insufficiency
      will be included. They will be randomly allocated into EECP or control groups (n=20 for
      each). The EECP therapy was given as a 1-hour session, once daily, for a total of 35
      sessions. The daily urine amount, blood pressure, time for taper off positive inotropic
      agents, length of hospital stay, and will be monitored daily in the hospital stay. Patients
      will be followed-up if he or she can be released from hospital and the mortality, readmission
      for heart failure, and 6-minute walking distance will be checked at the end of 6th month.
      Plasma natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels will be checked at enrollment, day 35, and 6th month.
