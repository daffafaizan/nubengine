    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo
      controlled trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the addition of antifibrinolytic
      therapy with tranexamic acid to the standard care in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to
      primary bone marrow disorders or chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy in
      order to prevent bleeding. The results of this study will change practice by providing
      evidence as to whether or not TXA is effective and safe treatment when used as an adjunct to
      platelet transfusion therapy in the thrombocytopenic patient.
