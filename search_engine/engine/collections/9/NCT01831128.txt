      patients with Chronic Heart Failure (HF) is 15-46% and it is associated with worse prognosis.
      Adaptative Servo-Ventilation (ASV) suppresses sleep apnoea and reduces hyperventilation, and
      is more effective than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for treating CSA/CSR.
      Short-term studies show that ASV improves cardiac function and quality of life in CHF
      patients.

      The SERVE HF multinational randomized trial is assessing the effects of addition of ASV
      (PaceWave, AutoSet CS; ResMed) to optimal medical management compared with medical management
      alone in symptomatic CHF patients with altered Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and
      predominant CSA/CSR. The FACE study is a French prospective, multicentre, observational
      cohort that will provide complementary data to SERVE HF trial by characterizing CHF
      population eligible for ASV indications and evaluating the treatment management on long term
      follow-up of CHF patients with CSA/CSR in routine practice.
