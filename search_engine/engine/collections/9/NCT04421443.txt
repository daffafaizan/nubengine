      prevalence and the large increase in recent years. This condition is associated with
      different health problems, including physical and mental diseases. The presence of anxiety or
      depression disorders among candidates for bariatric surgery it is very high and predicts
      worse results. The present study aims to explore the feasibility and clinical usefulness of
      an online group format application of the Unified Protocol, a transdiagnostic emotion-based
      intervention for patients waiting for bariatric surgery with at least one emotional disorder
      diagnosis or emotional symptoms.

      We will conduct a pilot study with a repeated single case experimental design (multiple
      baseline design) in a public mental health service. The sample will consist of 45
      participants who will be randomized to three baseline conditions: 8, 12 or 15 evaluation days
      before the intervention. Depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnostic criteria will be the
      primary outcome measures. Secondary measures will include evaluation of affectivity,
      personality traits, general fit, quality of life, and different body image and eating
      outcomes. An analysis of treatment satisfaction will be also performed. Assessment points
      include baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-ups every three months until two
      years after post-treatment.
