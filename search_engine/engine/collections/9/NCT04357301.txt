      (defined as systolic arterial pressure (SAP) < 117mmHg). The target mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) will be set at a SAP of 130mmHg in all patients. Definition of Hypotension is target
      SAP - 10% (130mmHg - 13 mmHg = 117 mmHg). We will use the same SAP target in all patients
      even if we used a modified definition of hypotension from the study of Futier and colleagues
      ( JAMA 2017). We won't use a individualized SAP for each patient but the same SAP target in
      all patients.

      The investigators want to demonstrate that the closed-loop system can prevent hypotension at
      this specific set point.

      The Investigators have shown the system works well based on a target MAP but not yet using a
      target of SAP.

      The investigators will test the system in a pilot study of 13 patients undergoing High-risk
      abdominal surgery which require the placement of a arterial catheter, the optimization of
      fluid therapy and a tight SAP control.

      Participants will receive standard patient care in that in no way will their anesthetic or
      surgical procedure will be altered as part of the study, with the exception of vasopressor
      administration ( automatically delivery instead of manually adjustments)

      Fluids will be given as goal directed fluid therapy in order to maintain stroke volume
      variation below 13% (hospital guidelines).
