    
      The study will be a single-centre study of NOX66 in two formulations administered once
      rectally and oral idronoxil . Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in 5 cohorts,
      comprising 1 oral dose (400 mg) and 4 NOX66 dose Cohorts (400 and 600 mg in formulation A and
      B).

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the research clinic the day prior to dosing for
      baseline evaluations and will be fasted for a minimum of 10 hours prior to pre-dosing
      procedures. On treatment day, subjects will be administered NOX66 suppository as single dose
      or as oral suspension. Subjects remain in the clinic for 24 hours (h) after each dose for
      safety and pharmacokinetic assessments and return for 3 follow up visits.

      Ten subjects will be assigned to treatment dose Cohorts (1-5) and subjects within each of
      these cohorts will be randomised to either active or placebo (n=8 active; n= 2 placebo).

      For all dose cohorts, there will be two sentinel subjects (2 active) who will be dosed at a
      minimum 24 hours prior to remainder of the cohort who will be dosed simultaneously
      thereafter. Dose escalation of NOX66 dose cohorts to occur once safety and PK has been
      confirmed, by Data Safety Monitoring Board, in subjects in the prior cohort as applicable.

      Following interim review of accumulating PK data from first 3 cohorts, the Sponsor may modify
      subject numbers within a cohort or cohort dose levels and implemented following approval by
      IRB.
