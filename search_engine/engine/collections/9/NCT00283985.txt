    
      Primary Objective:

        -  Determine the overall and complete response rate

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate survival without progression

        -  To evaluate total survival.

        -  To evaluate the tolerance and the side effects of the treatment.

        -  To evaluate the duration and the mode of hospitalization of the patients treated by this
           therapeutic association.

        -  To constitute a bank of biological samples - serum, tumoral, ADN, ARN to allow
           prognostic studies implying virus EBV, p53, CD94, C-kit and asparagine synthetase gene
           in order to better understand the mechanisms of the cancerogenesis of this variety of
           cytotoxic LNH and to identify the predictive factors of response to the asparaginase.

      Sampling:

      For each patient included in the protocol, the following sampling will be carried out with
      the diagnosis:

        -  Biopsy,

        -  Medullary biopsy

        -  Medullary aspiration

        -  blood: 3 tubes of 7 ml on EDTA and 3 tubs of 7 ml with heparin

      Treatment:

      All the patients included will receive three cures separated by 3 weeks (J1, J22, J43):

        -  J1: Methotrexate 3 gr/m2

        -  J2, J4, J6 and J8: KidrolaseÂ® 6000 u/m2

        -  J1 with J4: Dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg if age > 70 years)
