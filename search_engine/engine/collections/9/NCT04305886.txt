      group meetings would result in improvement in wellbeing and to determine whether use of a
      written curriculum provided increased benefit, the following study is conducted:

      Practicing clinical faculty in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the
      Massachusetts General Hospital were recruited to participate in three monthly small groups
      over dinner. Participants were randomized to a control group, which met without any specified
      guidelines for discussion content, or to receive an intervention which consisted of a
      one-page discussion guide addressing themes relevant to challenges in the healthcare
      environment: reframing challenging patient interactions; embracing uncertainty in work; and
      coping with errors, near misses, and bad outcomes. Outcomes included burnout, empowerment and
      engagement in work, stress from uncertainty assessed using validated metrics, and perception
      of of collegiality and community.

      All participants were also offered the option of participating in evaluation of biomarkers.
      To test the hypothesis that an increased sense of bonding and relational connection, and
      reduced stress levels would be reflected by changes in hormone levels during the meeting and
      over the course of the study. Faculty who opted into this portion of the study gave the
      following samples:

      Urine Oxytocin before and after the first and third group meetings Salivary Oxytocin before
      and after the first and third group meetings Salivary Cortisol before and after the first and
      third group meetings Hair Cortisol at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study
      (a roughly three month interval).

      An optional focus group was conducted after the three monthly sessions.

      All participants signed a consent form prior to participating in the study.
