      123I-mIBG for imaging. In this pilot study, up to 7 eligible participants will undergo
      pre-ablation and post ablation nuclear imaging.

      The major objective of our study is to evaluate the relationship between non-invasive imaging
      of cardiac innervation with invasive mapping of atrial innervation as determined by High
      Frequency Stimulation (standard of care to physiologically document autonomic function). This
      will be followed by the clinical ablation procedure, as discussed by the cardiac
      electrophysiologist, consisting of pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation, inclusive of regions
      of autonomic innervation, and sites showing complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE)
      when clinically indicated.

      The secondary objective is to determine the relationship between catheter ablation of AF and
      non-invasive nuclear imaging of cardiac innervation.
