      majority of infants regain full function of the affected arm without nerve surgery, those
      with more severe nerve root injuries will require it. Currently, the best way to determine
      who will need surgery is to measure the trajectory of muscle recovery by serial clinical
      exams, but the optimal time for nerve surgery (before 3 months of age) is earlier than the
      time it usually takes to determine whether the infant needs surgery (up to 6 months.) A
      non-invasive diagnostic test that identifies the more severe injuries that require surgery
      earlier than serial exams would improve treatment timing, planning, and accuracy, and
      ultimately outcomes.

      The investigators have developed a rapid MRI sequence with high spatial resolution and soft
      tissue contrast that does not require sedation or injection of a contrast agent, and that
      appeared to accurately assess the severity of nerve injury in infants with BPBP in a pilot
      study. This pilot study demonstrated that the protocol distinguishes infants who ultimately
      needed surgery from those who recovered spontaneously. The purpose of the current study is to
      enroll 100 infants at 3 centers (Shriners Hospital for Children Northern California, Boston
      Children's Hospital, and Gillette Children's Hospital) over a 5 year period to validate this
      imaging protocol as the new "gold standard" to determine whether infants with BPBP need
      surgery, so that individuals who need it could have surgery earlier when it is more
      effective, and the parents of the majority who will recover spontaneously could be spared
      months of worry.
