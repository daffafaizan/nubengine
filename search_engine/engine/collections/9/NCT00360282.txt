      significant abnormalities. Following screening, there were 2 experimental visits in which
      migraine sufferers were pre-treated with either Rizatriptan or placebo. After taking the
      drug, subjects were idle for 2 hours. Baseline motion sickness and subjective units of
      distress levels were assessed prior to undergoing sinusoidal-earth-vertical earth axis
      rotation in darkness at 0.05 Hz. Scores were taken immediately after stopping. Subjects were
      given a 2 minutes rest and then underwent a motion sickness provoking rotation. Subjective
      scores were assessed immediately following. Another two minute rest was given and if the
      subject was able, underwent a second motion sickness provoking stimulus followed by an
      assessment.
