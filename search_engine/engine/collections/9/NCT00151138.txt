      cortical (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and functional cortical blood flow (quantitative
      positron emission tomography, PET) status of previously unmedicated hypertensives. These
      individuals are then medicated for one year with one of two effective blood pressure
      medications. Our hypothesis is that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but not the
      beta-blocker will normalize cerebral blood flow and possibly, cognitive function. This
      hypothesis is tested by a repetition of our initial examinations at the completion of one
      year of treatment.
