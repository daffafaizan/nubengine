    
      Retrospective cohort of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit.Clinical scores such as
      SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the
      absence/presence of Motor evoked potential) will determine the predictive functional outcome
      of the upper limb deficit according to the PREP2 algorithm. The accuracy of this prediction
      will be verified according to the actual state of the patient at 3-6 months. Second, another
      algorithm will be built taking in account cognitive deficits and biological data to determine
      if the accuracy is higher. All data will be acquired during the clinical routine work-up.
