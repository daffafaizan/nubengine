      and control group (group K). Under general anesthesia, patients who will undergo both ESPB
      and RIB will be applied block with a 22 G and 100 mm block needle, accompanied by
      ultrasonography, and 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine. Apart from the standard peroperative analgesia
      protocol applied to all three groups, no additional procedure will be performed in group
      control. Postoperative analgesic consumption amount, first analgesic requirement time and
      visual analog scale (VAS) values of the patients will be recorded.
