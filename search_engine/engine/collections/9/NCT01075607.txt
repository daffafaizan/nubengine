      benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, thus saving them from the adverse effects of unnecessary
      treatment. We propose to identify and validate protein markers that can determine breast
      cancer recurrence and metastasis, based on an approach our group has recently found highly
      promising for biomarker discovery.

      The objective of our research is to identify and validate metastasis protein markers in lymph
      collected from vessels exiting from the primary tumor and prior to their entry into sentinel
      lymph node in women with metastatic breast cancer. Realizing that this novel procedure cannot
      be adopted for routine clinical use, we will examine the peripheral blood for the presence of
      these identified markers in order to develop a user friendly clinical test to detect
      metastasis and to evaluate response to therapy.
