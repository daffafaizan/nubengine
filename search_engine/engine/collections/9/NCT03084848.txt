      strong scientific interest is the development of executive control, an essential cognitive
      domain for academic and professional success and for mental and physical health. These
      functions are essentially located within the prefrontal cortex, characterising by a late
      maturation until the end of adolescence and, while under genetic control, can likely be
      improved with targeted interventions. The objective of this project is simple and innovative:
      testing in adolescents with the most appropriate brain imaging technologies available today
      (the Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI), the effect of an executive training focused on the
      inhibitory control (IC). This project aims at precisely testing the effect at the cognitive
      and brain levels of IC training in adolescence. To do this, the investigators will recruit
      two groups of 30 teenagers aged 16 to 17 years old, each assigned to one of two learning
      situations: IC vs Active Control (AC). Each participant will participate in 25 training
      sessions of 15 minutes per day, 5 days a week for a month. Brain structural and functional
      differences in the brain and between the pre-test and post-test related to intense IC
      training will be correlated with cognitive progress.
