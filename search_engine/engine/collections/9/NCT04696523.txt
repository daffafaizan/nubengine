    
      Assessments of efficacy:

        1. A brain Computer tomography angiography (CTA) and / or 3 D Digital subtraction
           angiography (DSA) (whenever possible instead of 2D DSA) will be performed at hospital
           arrival and whenever clinically indicated.

        2. 1st 3 Tesla MRI 72 ± 24 hours after onset of aSAH symptoms; 2nd 3 Tesla MRI 42 ± 4 days
           after onset of aSAH symptoms.

        3. 3D DSA: Computational fluid dynamic simulations (CFD), artificial intelligence and
           machine learning.

        4. Brain Positron emission tomography (PET): The 1st 4 ± 1 weeks and the 2nd at 3 months
           after onset of aSAH symptoms.

        5. Biochemical assessment: A blood samples of 20 ml for determination of plasma
           catecholamines, plasma metabolomics (see details of metabolomics in section 18.4.7),
           cardiac enzyme release (P-hs-troponin-T and heart fatty-acid binding protein), selected
           biomarkers will be analysed at intensive crae unit (ICU) arrival and at 24h, at 48h and
           at 72h after onset of SAH symptoms. In addition, a sample of spinal fluid will be
           collected through external ventricular drainage (EVD) at ICU arrival or as soon as it is
           in place and at 24h, at 48h and at 72h after onset of SAH symptoms for assessment of
           metabolomics

        6. Electrocardiograph (ECG) at ICU arrival and at 24h, at 48h and at 72h after onset of
           aSAH symptoms.

        7. Neurological evaluation: at 3, 12 and at 24 months after aSAH with GOSe, Modified
           ranking score (mRS).

      Statistical methods: 1) Basic statistical tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney, Chi square, etc); 2)
      Survival analysis methods; 3) An analysis of variance for repeated measurements; 4) A sample
      size of 100 is estimated on the basis of a recent studies in SAH patients to provide 80%
      power with a 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a mean difference of 0.02 (SD 0.035) in the
      global fractional anisotropy of white matter between the xenon group and the control group
      (98). Accordingly, this mean difference is estimated to have a predictive value for DCI and
      poor neurological outcome (i.e. mRS 3-6).Significance level of 0.05 and an estimation of 95 %
      confidence intervals will be used in the statistical analyses.
