    
      A randomized control trial of 70 cirrhotic patients randomly submitted for
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (35 patients) or EUS evaluation (35 patients) for the diagnosis of
      portal hypertension.

      The portal pressure gradient will be defined based on portal vein catheterization via
      interventional radiology.

      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy will evaluate the presence and grade of esophageal varices,
      presence and type of gastric varices, presence and signs of hypertensive gastropathy.

      Endoscopic ultrasound will evaluate the presence of esophageal varices, the presence of
      gastric varices and the EUS- signs og hypertensive gastropathy, Azygos vein diameter, mean
      velocity and blood flow volume index.
