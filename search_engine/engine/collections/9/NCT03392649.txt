      procedure and remain blinded to their treatment allocation. Both treatment options will
      utilize similar equipment, namely the use of alligator clips which will be placed on the
      tragus and earlobe of the right ear for patients. The distinction is only that in patients
      assigned to tragus stimulation, they will be initiated on therapy at the time of device
      placement.

      Prior to cardiac surgery, the discomfort threshold of both left and righ tragus stimulation
      will be determined for all participating patients. Intermittent electrode signals, or
      microcurrents, are delivered at 20 Hz with100 Âµsec pulse width with variable microampere (mA)
      output. The discomfort threshold is defined as the stimulation intensity in mA at which point
      patients experience discomfort. The stimulation intensity used in the study will be set just
      below the discomfort threshold. The clip will then be placed on the patient's ear at the end
      of surgery. After surgery is completed, the clip will then be removed and replaced on the
      opposite ear. Stimulation will then continue, one ear alternating with the other, every 4
      hours for a total of 48 hours. It is possible that the threshold can change during the
      post-operative period. If the patient shows any sign of discomfort from stimulation, the
      intensity of stimulation will be reduced to a level at which signs of discomfort disappears.

      Follow-up will be performed with a 14-day event monitor at the time of discharge.
      Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed pre-procedure and prior to hospital discharge.
      Echocardiography will be assessed prior to study initiation and when clinically available in
      follow-up.
