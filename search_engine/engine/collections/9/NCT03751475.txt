      principles.

      Firstly, the diagnosis of acute malnutrition is refined to target those at highest mortality
      risk within the CMAM definition of acute malnutrition (WHZ < -2 or MUAC < 125 mm or oedema),
      by targeting treatment to children with a MUAC < 125 mm or oedema. The simplicity of MUAC
      measure allows families to screen children and check for oedema at home and identify
      malnourished children at an earlier stage. The diagnosis is quickly confirmed by clinicians
      at the health center. MUAC progression is also used to monitor recovery and determine
      discharge thus eliminating the discrepancies that occur when both MUAC and WHZ are used to
      diagnose acute malnutrition.

      Secondly, RUTF dosage is rationalized, and calibrated to the child's degree of wasting. The
      WHZ tables and dosing tables are replaced by a single table that determines the child's RUTF
      ration based on MUAC category and weight. Larger rations, on a per kilo basis, are given to
      the most severely malnourished and the ration is reduced as the child progresses to recovery.

      Thirdly, supply chain is simplified to a single RUTF and data management from 2 programs are
      merged into one. This streamlined programme should result in better coverage, a high
      proportion of children detected before MUAC<115 mm, lower RUTF consumption per child and
      fewer acute malnutrition related hospitalisations.
