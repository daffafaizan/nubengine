      The other ingredients are hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, sodium hydroxide, boric acid, sodium
      chloride and water for injection. Among them, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin can increase the
      solubility of meloxicam and improve the stability of the solution. The indication of
      meloxicam eye drops is non-infectious ocular inflammation, especially for inflammation and
      complications after cataract surgery. The possible adverse reaction is transient tingling in
      the eye after eye drops.

      Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) that selectively inhibits COX-2
      cyclooxygenase. It is currently widely used in the treatment of acute and chronic
      inflammation and pain, and its mechanism of action is to prevent the production of
      prostaglandins (PGs) that cause inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX).
      Non-infectious ocular inflammation is usually caused by the synthesis and release of
      inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin (PG) after eye tissues are stimulated. Because
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and analgesic
      effects, and have no adverse effects of glucocorticoids, their application in ophthalmology
      has been valued.
