    
      The study is a 9-day trial including 85 healthy adults in age between 18 and 75. The
      participants will throughout the trial register their dietary intake, gastrointestinal
      symptoms including stool frequency and Bristol stool scale, physical activity, and medicine
      and supplements intake. Participants will on day 3 and day 5, respectively, consume sweet
      corns to estimate intestinal transit time by the time it takes sweet corn to travel through
      the gastrointestinal system. Furthermore, the participants will collect daily urine and stool
      samples.

      On day 2 and day 9, participants will arrive fasting at the department in the morning and
      have their anthropometry, breath hydrogen and methane levels measured, and a blood sample
      will be collected from each participant.

      The first visit (day 2) also includes a standardized meal test (rye bread, butter, jam, egg,
      and yogurt with nuts and berries) and intake of paracetamol (250 mg). Subsequently, the
      participants will stay at the department for the following 6 hours and have their
      postprandial breath hydrogen and methane measured and urine collected at specific intervals.

      Moreover, a sub-set of the participants will on the first visit (day 2) immediately after
      intake of the standardized meal swallow a single-use gastrointestinal SmartPill capsule,
      which will monitor their gastrointestinal pH, transit time, temperature and pressure.
