      the investigators randomly assigned 105 patients with metabolic syndrome to receive barberry
      juice, saffron juice or placebo tablet.

      The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of Crocus sativus (Saffron) and Berberis Vulgaris
      (barberry fruit) in treatment of metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome (syndrome X,
      insulin resistance syndrome) consists of a constellation of metabolic abnormalities that
      confer increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The major
      features of the metabolic syndrome include central obesity hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL
      cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Based on data from the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, the age-adjusted prevalence of the metabolic
      syndrome in the United States is 34% for men and 35% for Women. Review of literature revealed
      anti-inflammatory, radical-scavenging, antioxidant, cytoprotective, beneficial cardiovascular
      and neural system effects for saffron, potential use for treatment of hypertension,
      tachycardia and some neuronal disorders, such as epilepsy and convulsion, antihypertensive
      and vasodilatory activities. Barberry has promising and selective anti-cancer activities,
      beneficial effects in atherosclerosis, arthritis, coronary heart disease and hepatitis,
      hypotensive property and to promote immunity, prevention of insulin resistance and related
      diseases, neuroprotective, hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties for saffron in animal
      models.
