      11C-Glutamine in LAM.

      The objective is to test the hypothesis that 11C-Glutamine PET/CT will demonstrate uptake
      within the lungs and/or associated neoplasm of patients with LAM and that this effect will be
      modified by treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

      Rationale Our rationale is that 11C-Glutamine PET/CT may provide an improved ability to
      diagnose LAM, as well as predict and monitor treatment response to mTOR inhibitors.

      Aims Test the hypothesis that 11C-Gln PET imaging of the lungs in humans will reflect the
      known "glutamine addiction" seen in mechanistic preclinical studies of LAM. As a result, PET
      imaging will show increased tracer uptake in affected areas of diseased lungs and will show
      reduced uptake after initiating treatment with mTOR inhibitors.

      Approach: We will evaluate 11C-Glutamine PET/CT uptake in patients with known LAM, and if
      possible, we will test subjects again after 8 weeks of mTOR inhibitor therapy (either
      sirolimus or everolimus).
