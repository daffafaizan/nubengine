      fibrosis and ACE as a measure of hepatic steatosis by Liver Incytes in patients with
      different stages of NAFLD. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of ACE will be compared to
      CAP and LSM as measured by Liver Incytes to that measured by FibroScanÂ® using liver histology
      as the reference standard. The performance of these two methods will also be compared to that
      of non-invasive blood based markers such as APRI, FIB4, and NAFLD fibrosis score in
      predicting advanced fibrosis in biopsy proven NAFLD.
