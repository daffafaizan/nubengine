      that may provide reliable and real-time physiological measurements for clinical decision
      support, alerting, and patient self-management. The purpose of this study is to evaluate an
      UHN-built remote monitoring system for patients with complex chronic conditions called Medly.
      Patients with complex chronic conditions will be provided with a mobile phone and commercial
      home medical devices, such as a blood pressure monitor and weight scale. The measurements
      from the medical devices will be automatically sent to the mobile phone, and from there to a
      data server at the hospital for analysis and storage. Both clinicians and patients will be
      able to access these data and will be sent alerts by the system if the measurements are
      outside of the normal range. The system will be evaluated through interviews and comparing
      outcomes between the intervention and control groups.
