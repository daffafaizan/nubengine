      of hospitalization after age 65, and more than 20% after 80 years. Based on this observation,
      the health authority has proposed in 2011 the realization of therapeutic drug conciliation
      particularly in the elderly with multiple pathologies and multiple drugs. Taking into account
      the central role of the family practitioner in prescriptions, and the importance of
      coordination information such as output of hospitalization (vector of many malfunctions), we
      have achieved a therapeutic drug conciliation sheet (TDC) based primarily on the information
      needs by family practitioner after hospitalization of their patients. The issue of this study
      is to assess the interest for the use of a such TDC on the decrease in the rate of
      rehospitalization in the target population.

      To do this, we are proposing a multicenter observational study. Randomization would be across
      the centres. The study would focus on 750 patients more of 75 with polymedication. The
      follow-up will last 6 months.

      The main objective will be to determine if the use of the TDC, at the discharge of hospital,
      allows to reduce the number of use in emergency care within the two month after their
      hospital discharge. The first secondary objective will be identical to the main objective but
      rated at 6 months and the second secondary objective will be to assess the impact of the use
      of the TDC on overall mortality at 6 months.
