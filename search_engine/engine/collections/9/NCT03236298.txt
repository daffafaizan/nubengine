      ideal regimen has not been established. To optimize the PIEB regimen, the investigators have
      conducted several clinical trials using bupivacaine with fentanyl. Although PIEB provides the
      excellent analgesia to laboring parturients, studies completed by the instigators have shown
      that the incidence of sensory block to ice ≥T6 was 66%. For labor analgesia during the first
      stage of labor, effective sensory block requires T10 to L1; therefore, a sensory block ≥T6
      seems unnecessarily high, and the investigators seek to confine epidural spread within a
      proper range.

      Our previous studies showed that the effective volume 90% using 0.0625% bupivacaine was 10.7
      mL, and incidence of epidural blockade ≥T6 was similar even using a 5-mL bolus with 0.125%
      bupivacaine. The investigators concluded that it is not possible to reduce volume of the
      PIEB, or use a higher concentration of local anesthetic without compromising the quality of
      analgesia. There is some evidence in the literature that supports the idea that higher
      injection pressures result in a wider spread of local anesthetic administered into the
      epidural space, therefore a slower epidural delivery flow rate may result in less spread.
