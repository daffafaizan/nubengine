      male subjects. Primarily 6 dose levels are planned; the proposed doses are 20 mg, 60 mg, 120
      mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg. Actual doses may be decreased or increased based on the
      safety and tolerability of the drug, as determined by the Investigator and Sponsor.
      Additional cohorts may be added as needed to test lower, higher, or repeat doses.
