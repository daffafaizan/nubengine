    
      Patients with chronic mechanical neck pain will be instructed to use a standard smartphone
      for web browsing, either for 10 or 30 minutes, while seated on a standard chair at two
      separate sessions. Task duration will be tested by a random order generated by the Excel
      software.

      The outcome measures for this study will be neck pain, DCF fatigue and neck reposition error.
      All measures will be assessed prior to and immediately after performing the required task in
      each session by a single trained assessor.

      Neck pain will be assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), proprioception acuity will
      be quantified by measuring the repositioning error angle using Cervical Range of Motion
      instrument (CROM) and DCF endurance will be quantified using the neck stabilizer pressure
      biofeedback device.
