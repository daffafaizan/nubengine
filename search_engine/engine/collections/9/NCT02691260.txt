      low-carbohydrate weight loss program delivered via biweekly group classes. An innovative
      information technology (IT) solution will collate dietary self-monitoring data (input by
      patients via a mobile phone dietary application) and weight loss data (input by patients via
      remote scale). An algorithm will classify participants as achieving adequate or inadequate
      dietary self-monitoring and weight loss to earn intermittent rewards of varying value in
      real-time. Participants will be notified of earning rewards via text messaging.
