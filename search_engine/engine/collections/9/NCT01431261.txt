      36%. Of the working population the prevalence of chronic neck pain is 10 - 20%.The National
      Board of Health estimates that 5-6000 subjects per year in Denmark are involved in a traffic
      accident evoking whiplash-induced chronic neck pain. The main problems for patients with
      chronic neck pain are cervical dysfunction, reduced neck mobility and stability in addition
      to local and possibly generalised pain Besides chronic neck pain, patients may suffer from
      poor pain coping strategies and physical inactivity which influences physical function,
      general health and causes a poor quality of life.

      Physical training including specific exercises targeting the deep postural muscles of the
      spine is effective in reducing neck pain for patients with chronic neck pain. Physical
      behavioural graded activity is a treatment approach with focus on increasing general physical
      fitness, reducing fear of movements and increasing psychological function. Educational
      sessions, where the focus is on understanding complex chronic pain mechanisms and development
      of appropriate pain coping and/or cognitive behavioural strategies have shown reduced general
      pain.

      Thus this project is formulated on the expectation that rehabilitation of patients with
      chronic neck pain after a whiplash accident must target cervical dysfunctions, training of
      physical function and the understanding and management of chronic pain in a combined therapy
      approach.

      The study is designed as a randomized control study including 200 patients. All participate
      in the educational sessions. The training group receives on top of that instruction in
      specific neck exercises and general training.
