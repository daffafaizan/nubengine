      population calls for timely action for promoting brain health. The human brain has the
      capacity for plastic reorganization through learning and experience. Physical activity could
      induce plasticity and is important in the prevention of functional decline and increased
      survival. In this study, the effects of Qigong and stretching exercise on affective and
      cognitive function among the healthy elderly are investigated. This study is proposed to
      invite 200 participants (100 in each intervention condition). The investigators acquire data
      from questionnaires, assessments, neurocognitive tests, magnetic resonance imaging and blood
      samples at baseline (before the intervention) and post-intervention.
