    
      Background:

      BMS-247550 (NSC 710428), (ixabepilone) is a semi-synthetic analog of the natural product
      epothilone B.

      The epothilones are a novel class of non-taxane microtubule-stabilizing agents obtained from
      the fermentation of the cellulose degrading myxobacteria, Sorangium cellulosum.

      BMS-247550 is active against cancer models that are naturally insensitive to paclitaxel or
      have developed resistance to paclitaxel, both in-vitro and in-vivo.

      Objectives

      Establish the efficacy of the investigational agent BMS-247550 in patients with renal cell
      carcinoma when administered as a one hour infusion on day 1 to 5 every 21 days.

      Evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-247550.

      Explore the pharmacodynamics of BMS-247550 using an assay that measures the amount of
      endogenous tubulin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that exists in the
      polymerized versus the unpolymerized state.

      Determine the extent to which pharmacodynamic changes are observed over a range of doses of
      BMS-247550.

      Determine if cross-resistance to BMS-247550 exists in patients who have previously received
      sorafenib or sunitinib.

      Eligibility:

      Age greater than 18.

      Pathological confirmation of renal cell carcinoma.

      Prior chemotherapy including sorafenib and sunitinib is allowed.

      Design:

      Phase II study.

      BMS-247550 will be administered on days 1 through 5, every 21 days.

      Restaging will be done every two cycles.
