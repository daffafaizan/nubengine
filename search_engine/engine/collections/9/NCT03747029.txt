      the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. The definition of a
      valid cut-off of serum Ca/P ratio for patients with these disorders will be of help
      especially in those patients with apparently normal biochemical profile, but suggestive for
      primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism.
