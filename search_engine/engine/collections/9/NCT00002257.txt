      the study to achieve 120 randomized subjects. Eligible subjects will have CMV retinitis which
      has been diagnosed within one month of study entry by an ophthalmologist using indirect
      ophthalmoscopy. Subjects will be accrued by recruitment or referral. Anyone who volunteers
      for the study, meets the eligibility criteria, and signs an informed consent will be eligible
      for entry.
