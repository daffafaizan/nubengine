      the clinical research studies conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. A cohort
      will be developed and used for cross-sectional analyses, as well as followed prospectively
      for the development of a variety of health-related outcomes. Several data sources from the
      PBRC clinical database will be used to establish the PCLS database, including screening,
      archive and study-specific data. The only protocol specific to the PCLS study is the
      collection of blood sample for risk factor determination and storage in the PBRC archive
      bank, only to be invoked in cases where studies do not include a blood draw as part of their
      protocol.
