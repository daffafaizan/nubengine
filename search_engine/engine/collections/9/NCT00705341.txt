      measuring the sensitivity and specificity of methacholine challenge testing for
      differentiating asthmatic participants from non-asthmatic controls. The second phase is a
      cross-over, randomized, double-masked trial designed to evaluate the impact of high dose
      versus low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in
      asthmatics.
