      with sutures or staples. While useful in anchoring the graft in place, subjects often
      complain of pain from the staples as wound healing progresses.Pulling and sticking are common
      complaints.There is also a possibility that staples become embedded in the graft which leads
      to disruption of otherwise healed area, increased pain and anxiety for the subject as well as
      anxiety for the staff.

      Graft take can be optimized with appropriate medical management. Use of non-adherent
      dressings to protect the graft is customary. Various types of netting-style are used, such as
      Bridal veil, a sterile product which is fixed over the graft with staples.

      Silicone net dressings have also been used successfully to prevent lifting and adherence of
      skin grafts to the dressings, prevent pain and promote healing. Mepitel One is a sterile,
      transparent, and flexible wound contact layer consisting of perforated polyurethane film
      coated with Safetac soft silicone adhesive on one side. Mepitel One is available in various
      sizes and can be left in place for several days depending on the wound/skin condition.

      Evaluation of burns will be performed at Baseline. Skin graft assessment will be performed at
      Day 7 and Day 14. End of study will be considered the time that graft is considered to have
      >95% take.
