      hormone (Tesamorelin) on endogenous overnight growth hormone secretion and pulsatility, as
      well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Healthy male subjects will receive 2mg
      Tesamorelin, subcutaneously, daily for two weeks. At baseline and after two weeks of
      treatment, we will assess overnight growth hormone by frequent sampling as well as insulin
      stimulated glucose uptake by clamp. Subjects will then stop the Tesamorelin and will return
      for an identical assessment after a 2 week withdrawal period.
