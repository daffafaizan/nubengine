      common manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The clinical manifestations of
      coronary artery disease include death, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, congestive
      heart failure and arrhythmia. Restoration of circulation to the heart may be undertaken using
      a variety of techniques including angioplasty, stenting, and bypass grafting.

      Approximately 359,000 patients underwent coronary bypass procedures in the U.S. in 1999. Long
      term studies have observed an incidence of vein graft occlusion at 19% at 1 year, 25% at 5
      years and 50% by 15 years after operation for an overall rate of 2.5% per year after the
      first year of observation. The consequences of graft failure are as significant as those of
      primary atherosclerotic disease and include ischemia, myocardial infarction and death.

      CGT003 is a novel therapeutic that is under investigation as a treatment to prevent vein
      graft failure. It acts by inhibiting the transcription factor, E2F, which is activated in
      response to injury such as that which occurs when thin-walled vein grafts are exposed to the
      pressures of the arterial circulation. Blockade of E2F inhibits smooth muscle cell
      proliferation and redirects the vein graft remodeling that occurs within the first several
      days after implantation towards medial hypertrophy and strengthening of the medial layer and
      blunts formation of neointima. Inhibition of neotinimal formation coupled with expansion of
      the media should result in a decreased risk of the accelerated atherosclerosis and consequent
      vein graft failure over several years.
