    
      Consecutive consenting patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of
      2 transfusion groups based on their HCT value.

      Hematocrit Groups:

        1. 24%

        2. 28%

      Red blood cell transfusion will be given only when hematocrit values fall below the assigned
      group value. When the hematocrit value falls to a value less than the value for the
      randomized group a 1 unit RBC transfusion will be administered. Following administration of
      the 1 unit transfusion a repeat HCT is performed; if the hematocrit value responds to
      transfusion and is greater than or equal to the randomized group no further transfusions will
      be administered. A measurement of the patient's HCT after each unit of RBC administered is
      required prior to administering additional units. If a patient's hematocrit is greater than
      the value for the group which they are randomized, no transfusion of RBC is necessary. Other
      management decisions are left up to the discretion of the care team. Adherence to the
      treatment protocol will be required for the patients in the operating room, intensive care
      unit and postoperatively until discharge from the hospital.

      Before surgery, the patient will be asked to respond to a quality-of-life questionnaire.
      Follow up phone calls will be made by Study personnel at 1 and 3 months after surgery to ask
      the same questions.
