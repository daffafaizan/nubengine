      appearance especially of the front teeth. The aim of this pilot study is to determine a time
      point when visible discoloration appears in the front teeth. Therefore, participants of this
      study will rinse twice daily with chlorhexidine mouth rinse for 10 days. To elicit a more
      pronounced discoloration, participants will rinse with black tea right after the
      chlorhexidine rinse. Discoloration will be measured daily by discoloration index, by
      spectrophotometry, and by the use of a digital photo.
