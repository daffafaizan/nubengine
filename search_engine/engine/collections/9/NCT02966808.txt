      voltage-dependent potassium channels functioning, causing an improvement of conductivity of
      action-potential in neurons. This is why nowadays is the only approved drug to treat walking
      and mobility problems in MS. Results obtained after Phase III randomized clinical trials
      proved improvement in walking ability measured using the Timed 25 Walking Feet test (T25WF).

      There are few studies regarding fampridine effects on symptoms different from mobility. The
      ENABLE Phase VI study found the first data related with the long-term impact of this
      treatment in physical and psychological function in patients according to their own
      perception. Results from this study indicated that, after one year of treatment, patients
      perceived a sustained benefit in their health, both physical and psychologically.
