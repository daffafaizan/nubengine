      socket fabrication is complex, and the need for prosthetists is far greater than the
      throughput of existing clinician training programs. The first step in fitting a prosthetic
      limb is to fabricate the socket, which fits over the residual limb and acts as the interface
      between the residual limb and the prosthesis. The socket is the most custom component of the
      prosthetic system and must be comfortable to wear, easy to clean, and durable enough to
      withstand years of day-to-day use.

      Simple and low-cost methods for socket fabrication and fitting would improve access to
      prosthetic care and could give many people in need their first opportunity to use a
      prosthesis. We have developed an easy-to-follow method that allows us to cast the limb in
      less than 30 minutes and finish the socket in 90 minutes, making it a practical choice for
      socket fitting in busy clinical settings, and where users are unable to return for multiple
      fittings. We have submitted a provisional US patent for our socket fabrication method.

      We hypothesize that our novel method of fabrication for a low cost prosthesis can produce a
      device that has appropriate suspension, a comfortable interface, and requires little long
      term follow-up.
