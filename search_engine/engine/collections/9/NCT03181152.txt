      airway impairments. The differential diagnosis is not easy because the patients always
      complain of the similar symptoms and are not able to complete spirometry well.

      Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) is capable of identifying airway obstruction and reactions
      to bronchodilators by providing impedance data and curves. IOS is also a patient-friendly and
      valuable tool with minimal demands on patient and requiring only passive cooperation.

      IOS is a tool to measure lung function during tidal breathing. The output is a measure of
      respiratory impedance (Zrs), which include the respiratory resistance (Rrs) and respiratory
      reactance (Xrs) measured over a range of frequencies (usually from 3 to 35 Hz).

      The main objective of this study is to investigate the ability of IOS to measure small airway
      disease by providing different impedance profiles for participants with ACOS,asthma and COPD.
      Another objective of this study is to investigate the differential ability to identify three
      diseases by measuring airway impedance and reactions to bronchodilators.

      First,participants completed the IOS test.Second,participants inhaled salbutamol for 200g 15
      minutes to repeat the IOS.The investigators collect these 2 data for analysis.
