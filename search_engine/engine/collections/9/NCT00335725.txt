    
      This is a multicentric, prospective, randomised, investigator blind, controlled clinical
      trial (phase III) of two parallel groups, one receiving the test drug FSH (Fostimon® , IBSA)
      and the other the reference drug FSH (Gonal-F®, Serono). The groups will be paired on the
      major prognostic criteria.

      In effect, a double blind trial is not really feasible since the drugs presentations are very
      different. However, in IVF, drugs are usually dispensed and/or injected by a nurse and
      therefor the Investigator can be blind. Moreover, the used preparations will contain the same
      amount of gonadotrophin units (75 IU), will be repackaged in anonymous boxes and the
      following sentence will be written in the Patient Information Sheet: "You are required not to
      inform the Investigator about the product's name".

      The randomisation is necessary to get groups as comparable as possible for all the other
      aspects. The multicentric design has the double interest of facilitating the patients'
      recruitment and of decreasing the biases related to attitudes in a specific centre.
