    
      The CADS software integrates the patient's home blood glucose data with appropriate
      laboratory data (e.g. A1c, liver function, kidney function), demographic data (age, gender),
      current and previous medications, and active/inactive medical diagnoses. The software makes a
      recommendation about what medication changes are appropriate with potential alternates.
      Providers with their patients are block randomized into CADS or "Usual Care" for 1 year.
