    
      This study is divided into two major part, Firstly,to observe the variance of cough reflex
      sensitivity of chronic cough patients and the relationship between it and airway
      inflammation.

        1. Recruit chronic cough patients and healthy volunteers as subjects.

        2. Help subjects to complete detailed history,physical examination,Hull airway reflux
           questionnaire,chest x-rays,induced sputum,blood routine test,pulmonary ventilation
           function test and histamine provocation test before they enter this study.

        3. Complete allyl isothiocynate(AITC) cough provocation test the day subjects enter the
           study,then complete capsaicin（CAP）cough provocation test after 3 days.

        4. To detect the substance P(SP),calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP),prostaglandin
           E2(PGE2),et al level in sputum supernatants.

      Secondly,to observe the distribution of TRPA1,TRPV1 channels and the relationship between it
      and cough reflex sensitivity.

      1）Recruit chronic cough patients and healthy volunteers and complete related examinations as
      mentioned before.

      2)Collect mucosa specimens from upper trachea via endobronchial biopsy,and airway epithelial
      cells from 2nd or 3rd order bronchi via brushing.

      3)Evaluate the expression level of TRPA1,TRPV1 of mucosa specimens of subjects by
      immunofluorescent assay and Image analysis software.

      4)Cultivate airway epithelial cells from subjects and evaluate the expression of TRPV1,TRPA1
      and functional changes of it.
