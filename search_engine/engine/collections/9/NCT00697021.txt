      because it can identify patients at risk of ischemic event based on hemostatic influences,
      particularly platelet aggregation and platelet reactivity. Secondly, because treating those
      patients who exhibit high platelet reactivity -- an indication that they are not reaching a
      therapeutic level -- with appropriate drugs and doses is expected to improve outcomes.

      In this study that would be increased clopidogrel maintenance dosing (150 mg) or aspirin
      maintenance dosing to 200mg in an attempt to lower platelet reactivity below the 50th%ile,
      which we expect to also reduce their ischemic risk during the follow up period.
