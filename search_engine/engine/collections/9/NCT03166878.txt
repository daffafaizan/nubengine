        1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of UCART019 in patients with relapsed or
           refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma.

        2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and
           the phenotype of persisting T cells. Real Time polymerase chain receptor (RT-PCR)
           analysis of peripheral blood(PB), bone marrow(BM) and lymph node will be used to detect
           and quantify survival of UCART019 over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to UCART019 cell
           infusions.

        2. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19,
           and assess correlation with loss of detectable UCART019 (loss of engraftment).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of allogeneic CD19 CAR-T-cells followed by
      a phase II study.

      The UCART019 will be administered by i.v. injection over 20-30 minutes as a using a "split
      dose" approach to dosing: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2.
