        -  Determine the antitumor activity of flavopiridol in patients with recurrent or
           persistent endometrial carcinoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-24
      months.
