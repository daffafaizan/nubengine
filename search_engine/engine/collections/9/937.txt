bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig.bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig is describedand is compared with a previousdescription.  the defect was observed in 19piglets out of a total of 73 born in 8litters, sired by one large white boar.twelve affected piglets died at or soonafter birth and 7 died between the ages of 11and 69 days.  inheritance by a simpleautosomal recessive factor is suggested bythe evidence.  grossly the conditionwas characterized by varying degrees ofhypoplasia and persistence of fetal lobulation.microscopically, the dominant featurewas the poor development of the collectingtubule system.  it is concluded thatthe basic defect is a failure of developmentof mesonephric mesenchyme.
