      the breathing exercise, which is now concluded.

      minutes. It was a guided breathing awareness session with a registered nurse (PhD student)
      who is also trained in integrative therapies and yoga instruction.

      In parallel, during one of the visits the reliability and validity of a new scale for stroke
      to measure quality of movement and body awareness is tested.

      This part is still ongoing and thus this becomes a one-time visit.
