      hypertrophy and differentiation of adipocytes occurs in the dermal reticular layer at the
      sites of subcutaneous insulin injection. Currently, lipohypertrophy is assessed by palpating
      insulin injection sites. The detection on early, non palpable (subclinical) lipohypertrophy
      remains difficult in the clinical setting. Recent studies have identified distinct
      ultrasonographic features of hyperechogenicity in areas of adipose tissue consistent with
      clinical evidence of lipohypertrophy at insulin injection sites, and have detected changes
      int he thickness of subcutaneous tissue where not clinically evident in population of
      patients with type 1 diabetes. Lipohypertrophy can adversely affect glycemic control.
      Injecting into lipohypertrophic areas leads to poor absorption and the need for increasing
      doses of insulin.

      In this study study participants will undergo an assessment for lipohypertrophy during a
      scheduled visit at the VGH Diabetes Centre. A Diabetes Nurse will assess lipohypertrophy by
      palpation according to the FIT Protocol. A second diabetes nurse who was not present at the
      palpation will assess insulin injection sites for lipohypertrophy by ultrasound using a
      linear probe.
