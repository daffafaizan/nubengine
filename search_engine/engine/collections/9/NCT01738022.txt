      not been tested in the human upper airway. Gas density and viscosity are different gas
      properties that influence upper airway collapse and are variables of different models.

      In this study, subjects will breathe gas mixtures of different densities (helium and
      sulfur-hexafluoride) or viscosity (neon) for brief periods of time during flow-limited
      breaths. Flow limitation will be induced by sustained reductions of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). The investigators will test some models of upper airway collapse by
      observing if flow while breathing different gas mixtures scales according to the differences
      in density and viscosity.
