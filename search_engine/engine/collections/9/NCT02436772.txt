      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) patients using the OncoCEEâ„¢ platform. No procedures will be associated with this study,
      as these mutations will be evaluated from the leftover blood that has already been sent for
      standard of care ER and HER2 using the same platform. Results from this testing will be
      correlated with results obtained from standard testing to calculate the rate of concordance
      between tests.
