      radiation therapy treatments are as they would be given if the person was not on a research
      study. The selection of the group a patient is in is done by random, like flipping a coin.
      The doctor is not able to influence which group anyone is selected for. As is done routinely,
      radiation therapy is given Monday through Friday for about 4 to 6 weeks.The injections of
      enbrel or placebo are given two times a week. The enbrel or placebo is given as an injection
      directly under the skin with a small needle.
