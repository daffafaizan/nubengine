      While less frequent than in the era before effective treatment for hypertension, hypertensive
      emergency remains a relatively common cause of hospital admission in some sub-populations. In
      1989, hypertensive emergency accounted for approximately 60 admissions per year to the
      Medical Service at Presbyterian Hospital, and a somewhat higher proportion of intensive care
      unit admissions and utilization. The importance of hypertensive emergency may have been
      underestimated because the International Classification of Diseases discharge codes included
      only malignant hypertension, a severe form comprising only about half of the admissions for
      hypertensive emergency. There had been almost no epidemiologic studies of hypertensive
      emergency since 1969, and very little was known about risk factors.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A matched case-control study design was used. Cases were obtained from admissions to the
      Medical Service at Presbyterian Hospital. Morbidity and mortality data were obtained by
      follow-up of the case series.
