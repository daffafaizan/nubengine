946. respiration in hypothermia.  i. respiratory pattern andacid-base balance in the bloodmongrel dogs, under light pentobarbital anesthesia,were made hypothermic by im-mersing them in ice water and then normothermicin warm water.  in the course ofcooling, the respiratory rate and pulmonaryventilation, after an initial increase,were reduced as the rectal temperature fell,and spontaneous respiration was ar-rested at rectal temperatures of 21-25 c.alveolar pco2 was increased, after aninitial slight lowering, with the progress ofhypothermia.  arterial ph and standardbicarbonate (jorgensen and astrup) decreased,and the alkalinity of the blood coh/ch (winterstein) decreased markedly during hypothermia.these findings suggestboth respiratory and metabolic acidosis as themechanisms concerned.  in the courseof rewarming all these changes disappeared rapidlyand completely though the venti-latory stimulation observed as an initial transitoryphenomenon during cooling failed to occur.
