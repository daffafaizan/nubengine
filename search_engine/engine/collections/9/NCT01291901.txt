      progressive cancer. Existing treatments have limited efficacy and also suffer significant
      side effects. This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial designed to evaluate the impact of intradermal injection of NP2 in subjects who have
      intractable pain due to malignant disease. NP2 is a gene transfer vector engineered to
      express human preproenkephalin, a gene naturally involved in pain control. Delivery of NP2
      directly to the site of pain caused by cancer is intended to provide increased Enkephalin
      peptides, which bind to opioid receptors, that may allow better pain control.
