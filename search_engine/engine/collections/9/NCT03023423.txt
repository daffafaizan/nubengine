      provide study treatment (atezolizumab alone or atezolizumab+daratumumab) to participants with
      previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety.
      Participants who receive atezolizumab treatment with confirmed disease progression based on
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be eligible to crossover to
      treatment (atezolizumab + daratumumab) if they meet crossover eligibility criteria. It is
      expected that 100 participants will enroll in the study including 6 participants in the
      safety run in phase. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review ongoing data, and may
      formulate recommendations on study conduct, including expansion of enrollment of some PD-L1
      subgroups, resulting in greater than 96 participants. The participants in the safety run in
      phase will be administered the combination of daratumumab and atezolizumab to determine the
      safety and tolerability that will be evaluated by the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) for dose
      limiting toxicity before the random assignment of participants in a 1:1 ratio in 2 treatment
      arms. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days), Treatment Phase and
      Post-Treatment Follow-up Phase which will continue until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal
      of consent, or the End of the Study [the study end is approximately 6 to 12 months after that
      last participant is enrolled]. Participants will undergo tumor assessments (RECIST 1.1),
      immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and safety evaluations (adverse events,
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram [ECGs], vital sign measurements, physical examinations,
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status score) over the time.
