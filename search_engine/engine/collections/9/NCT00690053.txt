      dose-steps:

        -  Step 1 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 6 mCi (222 MBq) dose of [18F]HX4 (which
           contains a maximum of 15 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection.

        -  Step 2 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 12 mCi (444 MBq) dose of [18F]HX4 (which
           contains a maximum of 27 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection.
