      I. Compare urinary flavonoids composition, compliance and sensory acceptability of 2
      blueberry-based amorphous functional confections one containing blueberry extract and the
      other of a whole blueberry powder) formulated to deliver the 320 mg of anthocyanins.

      II. Assess the effect of blueberry source (extract versus [vs] whole fruit powder) on urinary
      metabolomics profile.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants undergo a washout on days -7 to -1 and then consume blueberry extract
      confection on day 0. Participants undergo a second washout on days 1-7 and then consume
      blueberry powder confection on day 8.

      GROUP II. Participants undergo a washout on days -7 to -1 and then consume blueberry powder
      confection on day 0. Participants undergo a second washout on days 1-7 and then consume
      blueberry extract confection on day 8.
