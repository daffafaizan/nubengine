      emergency room and waiting for transfer to catheterization laboratory seems to be the
      principal source of delay. In order to improve delays a fast track (direct transfer in
      catheterization laboratory) has been implemented for patients being diagnosed with STEMI by
      emergency physician out of hospital. The present study aims at evaluating the benefits of
      this procedure.
