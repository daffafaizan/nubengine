      caused by donepezil HCL (a cholinesterase inhibitor) in healthy older adults at genetic risk
      for Alzheimer's Disease. Participants with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease will be
      eligible for this study. Participants without a family history of AD will also be enrolled to
      serve as a control group.
