      function. Pertinent to the proposed work, dietary intake has been recently shown to have the
      potential to directly influence the gut microbiota composition as well as brain function.
      Specifically, the consumption of probiotics or foods containing healthful microbial cultures
      (e.g., fermented milk, yogurts, etc.) are increasingly being recognized as modulators of
      metabolism, cognition, and stress. These foods are readily available in the marketplace,
      however, their implications for physical and cognitive function are not clear. Accordingly,
      the proposed study aims to investigate effects of probiotic beverage consumption on changes
      in behavioral and biological measures of cognition and stress among adults.
