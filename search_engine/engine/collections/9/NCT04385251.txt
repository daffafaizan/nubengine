    
      SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019 causing a novel Corona-Virus
      Induced Disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. While a
      proportion of people with COVID-19 have sufficiently severe symptoms to require
      hospitalization at the time of initial symptom onset, in others the disease may remain mild,
      and in some cases there has been observed a worsening of symptoms a few days after initial
      presentation with relatively mild symptoms. There is an urgent need for understanding the
      progression of disease for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who do not require
      immediate hospitalization.

      This is an international, observational cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2
      infection/COVID-19 managed as outpatients (not hospitalized). This study will also be a
      platform for the enrollment of outpatients for randomized trials that will be conducted by
      the INSIGHT group.

      Those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will form an observational cohort study and be
      followed for 28 days. Procedures and data collection have been streamlined to facilitate the
      enrollment of a large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.
