        1. To evaluate the correlations between plasma levels of orexin A and symptoms of ADHD.

        2. To evaluate the correlations between mRNA expression levels of pre-pro-orexin gene and
           symptoms of ADHD.

        3. To evaluate the correlations between plasma levels of orexin A and neurocognitive
           dysfunction of ADHD.

        4. To evaluate the correlations between mRNA expression levels of pre-pro-orexin gene and
           neurocognitive dysfunction of ADHD.

      Subjects and Methods: Subjects in this study will be recruited from Children's Mental Health
      Center, Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The sample will
      consist of 50 ADHD probands (aged 6 to 18 years) and 50 age- and sex- matched healthy
      controls. The phenotype measures include (1) interviews for psychopathology (K-SADS-E) and
      social functioning (SAICA), (2) self-administered questionnaires to measures ADHD symptoms
      (SNAP-IV), comorbid conditions (YSR, CBCL), and family support (Family APGAR), and (3)
      Neuropsychological tests: CPT, WISC-III, and CANTAB. Plasma orexin A and mRNA expression
      levels of pre-pro-orexin gene will be measured in all participants.

      Anticipated Results: We anticipate the identification of potential relationship between
      plasma orexin A, mRNA expression and symptoms of ADHD. In addition, this study will determine
      the association of plasma orexin A and mRNA expression with the neurocognitive deficits of
      ADHD. We hope that this study will elucidate the pathogenesis of ADHD, and orexin A will be a
      possible biomarker for this disorder. In addition, the data of orexin A and mRNA expression
      of pre-pro-orexin gene in ADHD will provide insight in developing more specific and more
      effective treatment for ADHD.
