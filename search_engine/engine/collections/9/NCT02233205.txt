    
      Ultrasonic sonoporation can increase the release of chemotherapeutics, thus increasing the
      therapeutic effects.

        1. Main purpose

             1. To identify the safety of combining ultrasonic microbubbles and chemotherapeutics
                to treat malignant neoplasms of hepatic metastases from alimentary system and
                pancreatic carcinoma.

             2. To explore the largest mechanical index and ultrasonic treatment time which
                patients can endure.

        2. Secondary purpose

             1. To observe tumor clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD).

             2. To evaluate the preliminary effect,such as time to failure(TTF), time to death(TTD)
