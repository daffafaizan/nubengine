      these etiologic agents. However, mechanical therapy itself may not always reduce or eliminate
      the anaerobic infection at the base of the pocket, within the gingival tissues. To overcome
      this, various systemic and local drug delivered antimicrobials have been used as an adjunct
      to scaling and root planing (SRP).The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1.2%
      rosuvastatin (RSV) gel local drug delivery as an adjunct to SRP in smokers with chronic
      periodontitis (CP).

      Methods: Sixty subjects were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: SRP with placebo
      gel (group 1), SRP with 1.2% RSV gel (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at
      baseline, 6 and 9 months. Radiographic assessment was done using computer aided software at
      baseline, 6 and 9 months.
