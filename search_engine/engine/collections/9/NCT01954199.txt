      associated with higher economic and social burden, and has been considered a predictor of
      chronicity and disability among subjects with low back pain.

      Numerous approaches are proposed for its management; however, evidence regarding the best
      therapeutic approach is lacking. Neurodynamic techniques are proposed to be effective to
      manage NRLP.

      Thus, this study aims to verify, through a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of
      a two-week program of neurodynamic techniques on pain and disability in individuals with
      NRLP.
