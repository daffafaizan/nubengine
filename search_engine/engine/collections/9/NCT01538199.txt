      date, TLT has been administered to over 550 people who have had a stroke. TLT has also been
      used in 10 people with MDD who were taking part in a research study. During this study, TLT
      was shown to relieve MDD symptoms without causing too many side effects.

      The -Infrared Radiation (NIR) device is also marketed for wrinkles treatment, however it is
      experimental for the use in depression. An experimental device means that it is one that has
      not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      During this study, the investigators hope to better find out if NIR TLT is helpful for
      treating depression. The investigators will do this by comparing the effects of TLT ("active
      treatment") NIR device to a sham treatment (which is an inactive or "pretend" treatment)
      device. The sham ("pretend") device looks exactly like the NIR device but will not use a
      near-infrared radiation during the study visits. There are two sets of identical devices that
      will be used in this study, producing active and sham treatment, respectively. The devices
      work exactly the same when you are receiving active treatment and sham treatment, except that
      the devices will produce therapeutic transcranial LED energy during the active treatment
      sessions but it will not produce this LED energy during the sham treatment sessions.

      The investigators hope to enroll about 30 subjects in this study at the Massachusetts General
      Hospital Depression Clinical and Research Program.
