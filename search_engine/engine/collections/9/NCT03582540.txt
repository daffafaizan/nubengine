      recruit 150 patients from 2016 to 2020. Patients with a native papilla scheduled for ERCP
      (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) are screened for the study. Patients with a
      difficult biliary cannulation are included in the study if the guidewire is inserted in the
      pancreatic duct. At that point, patients are randomized in two arms: early versus delayed
      DGT. The early arm attempts biliary cannulation using the double-guidewire technique
      immediately and the delayed arm uses the double-guidewire technique only if 10 more minutes
      of standard cannulation technique does not allow biliary cannulation. The primary outcome is
      the biliary cannulation rate success. Secondary outcomes are complications rate and
      performance of the technique in both arms. Follow-up is 30 days.
