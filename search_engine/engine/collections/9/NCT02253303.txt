      extraction-site incision is 4 to 5 cm, and it is the largest and most painful incision in
      laparoscopic colon surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the midline extraction
      incision in patients with colon cancer. A prospective randomized controlled trial is
      conducted to compare midline extraction incision with off-midline extraction incision. The
      investigators hypothesize that the use of the midline extraction incision in laparoscopic
      colon surgery will result in more cosmetic effect and better quality of life compared to the
      off-midline extraction incision.
