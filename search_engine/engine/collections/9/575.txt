growth and growth retardationvarious attempts have been made over the years to define growth.  fromthe standpoint of this review, growth is the physiological accretion of newtissue which is reflected in the acquisition of protein and water.  thisprocess in almost all instances leads to increase in size (length, weight, andvolume) and actively progresses from the fertilization of the ovum to theperiod of sexual maturity where millions of cells are present in a state ofadvanced organization.  with further time, growth is less and, indeed, maybecome negative insofar as cells are lost.
