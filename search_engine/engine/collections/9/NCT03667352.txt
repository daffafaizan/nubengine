      intraoperative and postoperative analgesia by blunting the hemodynamic responses to noxious
      stimuli. The transversus abdominis plane "TAP" block, a regional anaesthesia technique that
      provides analgesia following abdominal surgery. It involves a single large bolus injection of
      local anaesthetic into an anatomical space between the internal oblique and transversus
      abdominis muscles.

      Ropivacaine is less cardio toxic, less arrhythmogenic, less toxic to central nervous system
      (CNS) than bupivacaine, and it also has intrinsic vasoconstrictor property. Clonidine is an
      alpha-2 receptor agonist, which has a known property of reducing requirement of analgesics in
      the perioperative period.

      This study aimed to assess the efficacy of scalp block and TAP block with 1µg/kg clonidine as
      adjuvant to 0.2% ropivacaine versus intravenous fentanyl (0.1µg/kg/hr) on intraoperative
      hemodynamics and perioperative analgesia in abdominal bone flap cranioplasties.
