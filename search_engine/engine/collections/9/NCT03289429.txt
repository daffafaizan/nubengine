      fibrillation (POAF) is the most common type of arrhythmia after cardiac surgery. It has
      different leading causes, including myocardial injury, inadequate myocardial protection, the
      effect of cardiopulmonary bypass, and electrolyte imbalance. Beta blockers, amiodarone, and
      magnesium sulfate are used for the management of POAF.

      Statin is used commonly for its lipid lowering action, however, some studies shows that
      statin has powerful pleiotropic effects including its antiarrhythmic effect.

      This study aims to compare the antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects of Atorvastatin
      versus magnesium sulfate after cardiac replacement surgery.
