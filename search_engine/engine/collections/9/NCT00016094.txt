      I. To estimate the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with relapsed
      aggressive NHL treated with single agent bevacizumab therapy.

      II. To evaluate response rate and toxicity in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL treated
      with this regimen.

      III. To measure tumor VEGF and VEGF receptor 1 and 2 expression (Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR) and to
      explore the correlation between expression level and histology and response.

      IV. To measure pre-therapy, week 8 and time to progression biologic measures of VEGF activity
      including plasma VEGF levels, urinary VEGF levels, and circulating number of endothelial
      cells and explore the correlation with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for a maximum of 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years
