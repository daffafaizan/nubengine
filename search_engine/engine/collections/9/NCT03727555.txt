      mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes a peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter
      (ABCD1). ABCD1 is responsible for transport of CoA-activated very long-chain fatty acids
      (VLCFA) into the peroxisome for degradation. X-ALD is clinically characterized by two main
      phenotypes: adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and the inflammatory cerebral ALD. This diease
      presents most commonly in males. Approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms
      later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood
      cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. The disease is characterized by
      normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state.
      ALD patients are normally treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a
      matched healthy donor. However, HSCT must be performed at a very early stage of the disease,
      which limits the therapeutic opportunies for juvenile or adult forms of ALD. This trial aims
      to treat ALD using a safety and efficiency improved self-inactivating lentiviral vector
      carrying a functional ABCD1 gene to correct the genetic defect. By Intracerebral injection to
      delivery the lentiviral vector with a normal ALD gene to correct the pathologies associated
      with this genetic defect.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the advanced self-inactivating
      lentiviral vector TYF-ABCD1, the in-vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of
      degradative metabolite in patients at the time of treatment, assessment of vector integration
      sites, and finally the long-term correction of patients' disease beheviors.
