      children. The commercial objective is to make safe, noninvasive genetic testing available to
      the public, independent of age and other factors that may contribute to pregnancy or other
      clinical complications.

      Sample specimens will not be used to develop genetic lines and/or DNA banks for cloning. Any
      samples or remnant specimens remaining may be stored indefinitely for future research
      programs.

      Eligible subjects (or parent/guardian) will provide written informed consent after which
      basic demographic and clinical data will be obtained and a whole blood sample will be
      collected. A subject's participation may end immediately after their blood draw. The amount
      of whole blood drawn at any visit will be based upon age of the subject and test to be
      performed.

      In the event a Subject is pregnant, information regarding the gender of the fetus established
      by either ultrasound, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results, or at delivery will be
      collected. Clinical data regarding any karyotyping procedure that may occur on the fetus will
      be recorded.
