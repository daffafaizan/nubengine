        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive extensive stage small
           cell lung cancer treated with cisplatin and oral topotecan vs cisplatin and etoposide.

        -  Compare the response rates, response duration, and time to progression in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the patient-perceived disease status and well being in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), lactate dehydrogenase (less than
      1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs 1.5 times ULN or greater), and country. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV on day 5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes
           on days 1-3.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to each course, at 4 weeks after study, and
      then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 760 patients (380 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 18 months.
