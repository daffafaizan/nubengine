      moderate term, repeated exposure of Pulsed Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (PLIFUS) in
      patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We hypothesize that the treatments will
      be well-tolerated, subjects' EEGs will show improvement (fewer epileptiform discharges), and
      that subjects will experience a reduction in seizure frequency as a result of the treatment
      without adverse events.

      Due to the lack of options for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, investigations into
      alternative noninvasive treatments are warranted. PLIFUS has been shown to safely modulate
      neuronal tissue, and is non-invasive and painless. Several human studies have shown that the
      use of PLIFUS can suppress somatosensory evoked potentials and induce functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) responses.

      Once the subject is enrolled in the study, the subject will be scheduled for a standard brain
      MRI scan at BWH if they have not had one in the last 3 months. The subject will be asked to
      keep track of their seizure events in the Daily Seizure Log Diary from the screening visit
      until 2 months after the last treatment session.

      The treatment period will include 8 treatment sessions total. These will occur 2 days per
      week for 4 weeks, each lasting approximately 1-2 hours, starting 1 month after seizure
      logging begins.
