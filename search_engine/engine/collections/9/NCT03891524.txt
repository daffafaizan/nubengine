      (for example, VTE) that binds and inhibits activated form of human coagulation Factor XI
      (FXIa) with high affinity and selectivity. The study will consist of 3 phases: up to 30-day
      screening phase before total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, 10 to14 day postoperative dosing
      phase, and 4-week follow-up phase. The hypothesis of this study is JNJ-70033093 reduces risk
      of total VTE during treatment period. The total duration of participation following
      randomization will be approximately 6 weeks. Efficacy evaluations include unilateral
      venography assessment of operated leg and assessments of symptomatic DVT, PE, or death.
      Safety evaluation includes adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and physical
      examinations. The safety and efficacy will be monitored throughout the study.
