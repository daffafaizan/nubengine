    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, dose-finding study in
      parallel groups of subjects with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH). All subjects will receive a fixed dose of lemuteporfin injected
      transurethrally into the prostate followed by transurethral application of either one of
      three active light doses or a sham light dose. Subjects will be followed for safety and
      efficacy for a minimum of three months to a maximum of 12 months. The primary study endpoint
      will be the change from baseline in AUA SI score at three months.
