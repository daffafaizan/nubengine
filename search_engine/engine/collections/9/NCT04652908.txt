      over the spinal cord to prevent meningitis, which had no effect on motor function. The
      potential benefit of earlier intervention was realized when prenatal ultrasound of patients
      with MMC early in gestation revealed near-normal leg movements despite displaying paralysis
      at birth. This finding gave credence to the two-hit hypothesis that paralysis was progressive
      during prenatal life and suggested that fetal intervention could prevent the secondary damage
      to the spinal cord. Fetal repair of MMC did confer improvement in motor function of children
      treated in the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) randomized controlled trial. The
      promising results of the MOMS trial demonstrated the potential for improvement of paralysis
      for these patients, but distal motor function still remained severely impaired in the
      majority of patients with MMC with standard in utero repair alone. While this demonstrated
      that the ideal time to intervene to prevent paralysis is in utero with the goal of preventing
      the accrual of ongoing damage to the spinal cord, there is still room for improvement. The
      remarkable regenerative capacity of the fetal environment combined with regenerative capacity
      of placental mesenchymal stem cells offers potential for augmentation of the fetal repair of
      MMC with a novel therapy to further reduce and repair the sustained spinal cord damage.
