    
      From April 2002 to November 2014, patients referred to our Department with a diagnosis of
      acute transection of thoracic aorta will be studied by preoperative Computed Tomography (CT)
      evaluation in order to perform thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with left
      subclavian artery coverage. Then patients will be followed up with clinical and instrumental
      (CT, Duplex ultrasound) controls at discharge, 1, 3 and 6 months and yearly thereafter. We
      will evaluate the presence of major and minor neurological complications, episodes of left
      arm claudication, cardiovascular, respiratory and bleeding complications. Furthermore we will
      evaluate the technical success of the technique evaluating the onset of failure, collapse,
      leak or distal migration of the graft.
