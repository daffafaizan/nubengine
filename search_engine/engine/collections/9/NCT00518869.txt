    
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      complementary effect of PG2 in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer under
      conventional chemotherapy. Patients with Stage IIIb-IV non-small-cell lung cancer will be
      screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria and only eligible patients will be enrolled into
      this study.

      All enrolled patients will be randomized to PG2 or Placebo arm and will receive the
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy treatment (Cisplatin 75mg/m2 and Docetaxel 60mg/m2 on Day1)
      during the first three 21-day chemo-cycles. Chemo regimen modification is allowable, as
      usual, in case of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see Section 6). After
      randomization, each patient will be administered with PG2 or placebo for 4 days in the 1st
      week, 3 days in the 2nd week and 3 days in the 3rd week of each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles
      (Dosing Schedule in Section 6). Total 10 doses will be given in each cycle.
