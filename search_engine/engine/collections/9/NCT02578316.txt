      14C-lenvatinib on Day 1 of the Study Phase. Thereafter participants were given daily oral
      doses of 24 mg of lenvatinib over a 28 day cycle. During the Study Phase, participants
      received an initial single dose of 14C-lenvatinib oral patient dosing solution containing 24
      mg of lenvatinib as anhydrous free base and radioactivity of 100 mCi (3.7 MBq) on Day 1,
      followed by collection of blood, urine and feces samples for pharmacokinetic analysis between
      Day 1 and Day 8, with a discharge visit on Day 8. Participants then entered the Extension
      Phase of the study to continue to receive once daily oral administration of non-radiolabeled
      lenvatinib at a dose of 24 mg. Each 28-day dosing period will be considered one treatment
      cycle.
