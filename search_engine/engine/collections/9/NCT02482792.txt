      psychological, may react with general aberrations related to posture, respiration, and
      movements, as well as with muscular tension and skin changes.

      Employees With Long lasting musculoskeletal pain problems, working in the Municipality of
      Bergen, will be invited to participate in an Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT), and randomized
      to either receive Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy (NPMP) or a series of Cognitive Patient
      Education in combination with active individual physiotherapy (COPE-PT). The aim is to
      examine the effect of NPMP compared to those receiving COPE-PT on pain, function, quality of
      life and sick-leave.
