        -  To determine the influence of bevacizumab on platelet aggregation in patients receiving
           bevacizumab for cancer.

        -  To determine the influence of VEGF on platelet aggregation.

        -  To determine the influence of VEGF or bevacizumab on cyclooxygenesis.

        -  To determine if the sequence of medication plays a role in platelet aggregation.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected before and after bevacizumab infusion. Samples are
      analyzed for measurements of platelet aggregation, coagulation parameters, and endothelial
      activation (e.g., fibrin fragment F1 and 2, thrombin and antithrombin complex, soluble
      P-selectin, Von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, tissue factor, and endothelin 1).
