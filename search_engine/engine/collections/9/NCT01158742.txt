      of renal function after donation are based on predictive equations, which were not designed
      for living kidney donors. One concern is that use of these equations may underestimate
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) following donation. Systematic underestimation of GFR may
      cause previous kidney donors to be inaccurately categorized as having chronic kidney disease
      (CKD).

      While data for the entire kidney donor population are insufficient, there is even less
      available information about renal function after donation in black renal donors. In the
      general population, the incidence of end stage renal disease is higher among blacks compared
      to whites. Whether this pattern carries over to the black renal donor population is unclear.

      The primary objectives of this study are to more accurately measure current GFR; evaluate the
      change in GFR before and after donation; compare measured GFR in donors matched by race, age,
      sex, time from donation, presence of hypertension, and presence of obesity; and evaluate
      differences between predictive equations and measured GFR.

      This is an observational study to look at the long term outcomes in living kidney donors.
      Participants in this study will also be participants in DAIT RELIVE-04. As a part of this
      study, participants will have a brief medical history taken and a glomerular filtration rate
      test performed.
