      intensity endurance exercise causes beneficial brain adaptation in patients with mild
      cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI). Aim 1 will determine the effect of high
      intensity endurance exercise on cognitive function and other clinical symptoms in PD-MCI. Aim
      2 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on brain structure and
      function in PD-MCI. Aim 3 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on
      cortisol in PD-MCI. Aim 4 will determine the effect of high intensity endurance exercise on
      inflammation-related biomarkers found in blood in PD-MCI. Aim 5 will determine the effect of
      high intensity endurance exercise on peripheral levels of neurotrophic factors found in blood
      in PD-MCI.
