      replacement with Corin's TriFIT Hip System at the Ottawa Hospital - General Campus. As part
      of their clinical care, patients routinely undergo a clinical examination and have had
      radiographs taken at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly following surgery.
      Using specialized software, radiographs from each interval will be examined to assess femoral
      stem migration and joint wear patterns. Femoral stem migration will be assessed using
      computer-assisted software. The study will also assess the rate of implant failure during the
      first two post-operative years. Clinical assessments and questionnaires will also be
      completed during each of the follow-up intervals.
