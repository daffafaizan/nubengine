    
      The aim is to compare, in terms of procedural success and safety, the procedure of
      percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) without rapid ventricular pacing with the
      same procedure carried out with the aid of rapid ventricular pacing.

      It is a pilot study with the objective to enroll 100 consecutive patients matching inclusion
      and exclusion criteria who are randomized 1:1 in two arms: in the first patients undergo
      procedure of BAV without rapid pacing, in the second BAV with rapid ventricular pacing able
      to help in balloon stabilization during inflations.

      Efficacy will be studied analysing changes in transvalvular gradient from baseline to
      post-BAV. Safety outcomes will be collected both at discharge and at 30-day. Other procedural
      data will be object of direct comparison.
