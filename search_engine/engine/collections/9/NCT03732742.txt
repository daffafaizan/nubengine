      obstruction frequently requires the destruction of pulmonary valve (PV) competents including
      the pulmonary annulas. The resulatnt pulmonary insufficiency may lead to late functional
      deterioration of right ventricular performance. Acute right ventricular dysfunction has been
      associated with poor pulmonary runoff, tricuspid valve regurgitaion and pulmonary
      hypertension. Preservation of PV comptence may prevent both early and late right ventricular
      failure. Total repair of tetralogy of fallot is a corrective surgical procedure that involves
      closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and relief of right ventricular outflow tract
      (RVOT) obstruction. The surgeon must decide whether the right ventricular outflow tract size
      will be sufficient to allow for the entire cardiac output to traverse it without causing
      extreme elevation in right ventricular pressure or will go for trans-annular patch. Recently
      interest has shifted to preserving the integrity of the pulmonary valve annulus thus avoiding
      pulmonary valve regurgitation.
