      volar forearm of voluntary participants. Several physiological skin parameters will be
      monitored in weekly intervals during the application period. Additional measurements will be
      carried out immediately before the start of the application and after a treatment-free
      recovery period of 2 weeks. The untreated forearm will be used as a reference.

      Subsequent to the observational study, tape stripping experiments with fluorescein
      sodium-loaded formulations will be conducted on the non-dominant forearm of the participants.
