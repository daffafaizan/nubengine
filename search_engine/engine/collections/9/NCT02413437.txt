      contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEUS) group and conventional ultrasound(US) group.The aims
      include:

        1. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate, specificity and sensitivity between CEUS and US
           group.

        2. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate specificity and sensitivity between
           smaller(<3cm) and larger(â‰¥3cm) nodule group.

        3. To explore operating strategy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy.

        4. To evaluate economic efficiency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy compared
           with conventional ultrasound guided biopsy.
