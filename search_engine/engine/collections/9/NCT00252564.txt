      randomized on a 1:1 basis to either treatment Arm.

      In this trial, we will compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this novel
      combination of biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus cetuximab and bevacizumab (FOLF-CB)
      to the current standard of care, biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin and
      bevacizumab (Bev-FOLFOX). For practical purposes, this study will be a head to head
      comparison of oxaliplatin versus cetuximab, since the other components of both regimens will
      be the same.
