      endanger both the whole mission and crew. There is a certain risk for a cardiac arrest in
      space requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). So far, 5 known techniques to perform
      CPR in microgravity have been reported.

      The aim of the present study was to describe and gather data for two new CPR techniques
      useful in microgravity.

      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled manikin trial and asked 15 participants
      with valid diving-license to resuscitate a manikin in two different techniques of CPR in a
      free-floating position underwater. The first technique, (Schmitz-Hinkelbein-Method) is
      similar to conventional CPR, with the patient in a supine position on the performer's knees
      for stabilization. The second technique (Hinkelbein-Schmitz-Method) is similar to the first,
      but chest compressions are conducted with the elbow.
