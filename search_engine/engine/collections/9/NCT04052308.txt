      sessions interspersed with passive / active recovery, has been studied as a new approach to
      hypertension therapy and systemic arterial hypertension. HIIT training has also been shown to
      be able to reverse how the hemodynamic, metabolic and hormonal changes that are involved in
      the physiology of essential hypertension, leading to improved arterial stiffness and BP
      response, endothelin-1 and nitrite / nitrate to exercise, Increased cardiorespiratory
      capacity when moderate-intensity continuous exercise was performed in young women with a
      history of essential arterial hypertension.

      Six weeks of HIIT training (3 times / week) reduced body fat and waist circumference in young
      women while increasing fat-free mass, maximum running speed, and aerobic fitness. Two recent
      studies evaluating body constitution change in overweight patients have shown that HIIT
      training is comparable to moderate-intensity continuous exercise, but HIIT is more efficient
      compared to the time spent during training, and HIIT can deliver savings of approximately 40%
      of the training time, which can facilitate the inclusion of training in the daily routine of
      patients.

      In previous work by the investigators, patients undergoing an education and physical activity
      program showed improvement in WOMAC. Researchers believe that the inclusion of an HIIT
      training protocol may lead to improved BP and hemodynamic variables in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.
