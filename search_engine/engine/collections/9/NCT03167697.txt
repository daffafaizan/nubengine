      phenylketonuria patients. In particular, this randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate
      the efficacy (changes relating to nutritional status and metabolic control) of this new
      protein substitute, while also capturing data pertaining to tolerance, compliance, safety and
      acceptability. Designed for poorly compliant adult patients with proven phenylketonuria or
      hyperphenylalaninemia, this new protein substitute is composed of an adapted mixture of other
      essential and non-essential amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins and selected minerals and
      trace elements and enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fifty eligible adults (â‰¥ 16
      years) will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two intervention arms (n = 25 per
      arm). Following a 3-day baseline period, and in addition to routine nutritional management,
      patients will receive either one sachet of the new protein substitute daily (intervention) or
      continue their usual dietary and/or protein substitute regimen (maximum of 1 protein
      substitute per day (equal to 20g protein equivalent) control) for 28 days.
