      clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions. The incidence, mechanism and
      substantial adverse clinical outcomes of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are well known in
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the life sustaining role of pancreatic enzyme
      medication in CF care is well established. Much less is known about the incidence and impact
      of RPF/PI in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Reliable non-invasive screening or
      diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available for RPF/PI.

      This is a cohort study of subjects with CP who will be evaluated before and after pancreatic
      enzyme medication (Creon36™) administration. A cohort of healthy subjects will serve as a
      comparison group and will be evaluated only once.

      Subjects with CP will receive Creon36™, a pancreatic enzyme medication, and fat and energy
      absorption will be evaluated using three methods: MBT, CFA, and BC before and after
      administration of Creon36™. Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI yet they rarely
      undergo diagnostic testing. Pancreatic enzyme medication will likely improve clinical
      outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy volunteers
      will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to optimize the
      understanding and interpretation of the findings from the three methods and the RPF/PI cohort
      with CP. There will be no intervention for the healthy cohort.
