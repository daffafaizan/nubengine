      exposed bone or tendon e.g. located on the scalp or extremities. The chronic non-healing
      wounds are characterized by no significant wound area reduction within 4 weeks of standard
      wound treatment. Standard wound treatment includes mechanical or sharp serial debridement and
      low pressure irrigation for cleansing and wound dressings ensuring moist wound healing.
      Exposed bone or tendon in a chronic wound can be described as a potentially 'problematic
      wound area', since the healing by sound granulation tissue from the soft tissue sides of the
      wound to cover the problematic wound area is often reduced or absent.

      The subpopulation is characterized by either referral from other specialties with non-healing
      wounds of various etiologies and no or limited options of medical, surgical, or
      reconstructive plastic surgery procedures to treat the wounds; or the wounds are a
      consequence of previous reconstructive procedures with unsuccessful outcome and no or limited
      options of further reconstructive surgery. This group of patients often needs wound treatment
      for a very long period (months-years) to heal, in spite of best practice standards of wound
      treatment. Treatment with xenogeneic acellular dermal matrixes and autologous full- or
      split-thickness skin grafts may be an option, but it often requires general anesthesia and a
      2-staged approach. The LeucoPatch may be a new solution in wound treatment, which can be used
      in the outpatient clinic, to promote faster healing in patients with chronic, non-healing
      wounds with exposed bone or tendon
