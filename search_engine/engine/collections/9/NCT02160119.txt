      in daily life adaptation. The orienting response towards potentially relevant events involves
      automatic attentional mechanisms that would be elicited mainly by two classes of biologically
      important stimulations: novel stimuli and emotional stimuli. The neural basis of emotional
      and change-related attention in ASD will be explored by investigating brain reactivity in
      both visual and auditory modalities, during tasks mixing emotional and non emotional stimuli.
