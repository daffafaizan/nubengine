      response to the anti HER combination of trastuzumab + lapatinib, HER2 gene amplification, and
      the ensuing high levels of HER2 expression on the tumor surface, persist in spite of the
      tumor progression as determined by HER2 amplified ctDNA levels measured at progression and
      HER2 IHC findings on rebiopsies of resistant tumors. These findings offer an unexpected
      'precision chemotherapy' rescue potential, in spite of progression under anti HER2 treatment
      and were confirmed experimentally in a HER2 amplified mCRC PDX (metastatic ColoRectal
      Carcinoma Patient Derived Xenografts), model generated from the viable biopsy of a relapsing
      HERACLES patient. In this model a randomized trial comparing TDM1 to pertuzumab versus
      control (6 animal per arm), showed that T-DM1, but not pertuzumab treated animals achieved
      tumor disappearance. The results of this experiment confirm the principle strength of
      targeted toxins which is based on their bipartite structure, with one component binding to a
      disease-specific cell-surface target molecule and the other conferring cytotoxicity, once
      internalized. In this case HER2 amplification confer to the tumor the characteristics of a
      'molecular sponge' for TDM1 with the trastuzumab moiety targeting the still over-abundant
      HER2 bound to the cell-surface of anti HER2 resistant tumor cell clusters, thus allowing for
      a 'surgical' delivery of the emtansine cytotoxicity moiety. Given the good predictability of
      mCRC PDXs model, as testified by HERACLES TRIAL results (NCT03225937), investigators believe
      that this activity signal should be tested in the clinic. It is therefore proposed a
      proof-of-concept trial of T-DM1 in HER2 amplified mCRC patients progressing or relapsing
      after trastuzumab-lapatinib treatment.
