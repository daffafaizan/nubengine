      cardiorespiratory system due to changes in the interaction between patient and ventilator.

      This was a randomized crossover clinical trial that included patients in an intensive care
      unit (ICU) who had been on MV for more than 48 hours and who were considered ready for
      weaning. Cardiorespiratory variables, oxygenation, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Doppler
      echocardiogram findings were analyzed at baseline and after 30 minutes in each trial weaning
      method (PSV and T-tube). Comparisons were made between PSV and T-tube, weaning success and
      failure and patients with and without heart disease, using ANOVA and Student's t test. The
      level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
