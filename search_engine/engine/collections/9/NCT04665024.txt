      and intensive care unit at University of PÃ©cs, Clinical Centre, Heart Institute, Hungary . A
      convenient sample of 100 patients were divided into two groups: group 1 and 2. Group 1 (G1)
      included patients undergoing planned surgery who performed chest physiotherapy at home in two
      weeks period before the surgical operation, and group 2 (G2) included patients who patients
      undergoing planned surgery but did not perform preoperative chest physiotherapy at home.
      Preoperative and postoperative chest physiotherapy was performed in G1, and only
      postoperative one made in G2. Potential effects of preoperative chest physiotherapy were
      studied in both groups with respect to oxygen saturation, pulmonary complications and length
      of hospital staying. O2 saturation,O2 supplementation, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were all measured in a day before (zero day) surgery as
      well as the first seven days of postoperative period.

      Results: Measures of oxygen level and lung functions were significantly (P<0.05) changed in
      studied groups. The mean values of O2 saturation and supplementation measured in almost seven
      days of postoperative period were significantly (p<0.05) higher among G1 compared to the
      values of G2. The same trend was also correct for the mean values of FVC and FEV1.

      Conclusions: The results concluded that, the performance of preoperative chest physiotherapy
      before open heart surgery is recommended, as it might result in the decrease of complications
      of heart surgery, improvement of respiratory functions and length of staying at hospital.
