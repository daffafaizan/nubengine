      known that physical activity can promote well-being and help prevent several chronic
      diseases. It is recommended that an individual should do moderate to vigorous walking for 30
      minutes or walk approximately 10,000 steps everyday. Several studies have reported measuring
      walking activity using self-reported surveys, or pedometers in samples ranging from a dozen
      to a couple of thousand participants. However these studies have largely required
      participants to enter their walking data manually, either from memory or from pedometer
      recordings.

      With the rapid availability of activity sensors embedded in smart-phones (such as Apple's
      iPhone version 5S and up and several Google's Android phone models), it is now possible to
      track physical activity data passively from the end-user and do so for longer durations as
      individuals have increasingly begun to use their Phones as a continuous device of use.
