        -  To determine the role of trastuzumab in the generation of HER2-specific antibodies in
           breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant combination therapy.

        -  To determine whether the improved disease-free period and overall survival of patients
           treated in the adjuvant setting with combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab is
           dependent on the Fcγ receptor genotype of the patient.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected serum and DNA samples are analyzed for HER2-specific antibodies
      and FcγR genotype by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR).
