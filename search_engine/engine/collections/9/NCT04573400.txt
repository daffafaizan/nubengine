      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), clearly distinct pathophysiological entities. UC, the most
      common form of IBD worldwide, is a disease of the colonic mucosa only; it is less prone to
      complications. In contrast, CD is a transmural disease of the gastrointestinal mucosa which
      can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract . CD and UC should be considered systemic
      diseases since they are associated with clinical manifestations involving organs outside the
      alimentary tract. Extraintestinal manifestations involve several organs, and either precede
      the onset of intestinal manifestations or appear and evolve in parallel with them .
      Neurologic involvement associated with IBD is frequently underreported. Nevertheless, it is
      important to quantify the morbidity burden of clinically significant neurologic complications
      in IBD because early recognition and treatment of neurologic diseases are crucial for
      preventing major morbidity . Neurologic involvement in IBD as a subgroup of the EIMs may
      precede the appearance of digestive symptoms or develop after diagnosis of IBD. In addition,
      neurological symptoms may exacerbate during flare-ups of IBD or evolve independently from
      intestinal manifestations without responding to treatment provided for the underlying bowel
      disease.Within (IBD) literature, anxiety and depression symptoms are commonly identified to
      be associated with increased disease activity and reduced quality of life. Research also
      indicates that ongoing psychological distress can exacerbate disease activity,] and increase
      the risk of flare-ups and health care costs. Given this, screening and targeted treatment of
      neuropsychological conditions in IBD patients are crucial.
