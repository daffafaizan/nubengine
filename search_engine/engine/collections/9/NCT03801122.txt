      consequence of the disease or the treatment by chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.
      Platelet transfusions are commonly given to raise any low platelet count and reduce the risk
      of clinical bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). The last studies have
      showed that many patients continue to experience bleeding, despite the use of platelet
      transfusions. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent. It reduces the breakdown of clots
      formed. This treatment is widely used in medicine (e.g. emergency, surgery, post-partum) and
      decreases blood loss and the use of red cell transfusions. The purpose of this study is to
      test different doses of tranexamic acid (full dose: 3g/day and half dose (1.5g/day) and to
      study its effect by thromboelastography, with the aim to determine the optimal posology for
      further clinical studies.
