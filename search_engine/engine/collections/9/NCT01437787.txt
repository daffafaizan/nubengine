    
      The expected duration of a patient's treatment in this study is approximately 8 months, based
      on a maximum 28-day screening period, followed by a â‰¥6-month (6-cycle) treatment period, and
      an End Of Treatment (EOT) visit, which should be performed at least 30 days following the
      last administration of IMP or placebo.

      Patients who continue to benefit clinically will be allowed to remain on IMP or placebo
      beyond the 6-month treatment period until the occurrence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
