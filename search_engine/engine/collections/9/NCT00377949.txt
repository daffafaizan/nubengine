      therapy. One of the most major complications of systematic sclerosis is pulmonary
      hypertension (PHT), which is now the cause of all scleroderma related deaths. New therapeutic
      advances have improved short-term management of pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma, but
      long-term outcomes are unknown. With this in mind, Dr. Steen has developed Pulmonary
      Hypertension Assessment Registry of Scleroderma (PHAROS), a preventive, multi-center, web
      based observational study that looks at the natural history and outcome of scleroderma
      patients who are at high risk or have early pulmonary hypertension. Patients entered into the
      registry will be followed in prospective fashion noting the clinical course of disease by
      both scheduled and event driven follow up. A thorough baseline history will be collected to
      determine key prognostic and correlative factors for both disease prevalence and progression.
      Yearly follow up consisting of questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, echocardiogram, 6
      minute walk tests and predefined patient characteristics will also be conducted to further
      understand and note the progression of scleroderma related PAH. Event driven follow up will
      occur to record findings and record specific predetermined events in the clinical course of
      disease.
