    
      to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on mandibular condylar volume and
      position after treatment of Class II malocclusion with Twin Block (TB) functional therapy via
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).

      Materials and methods: Twenty-eight growing patients, 14 boys, and 14 girls ranged in age
      9-12 years, were randomly divided into control group (mean initial age 10.64Â±1.36 years), and
      laser group (mean initial age 10.55 1.45 years). All patients treated with TB appliance where
      Gallium aluminum arsenide diode laser applied in one group weekly around TMJ region for 12
      sessions in three months with set parameters: continuous 635 nm, 50 mW, 4.5J/cm2, 45 seconds/
      point, total dose per side 11.25J. CBCT were obtained before and immediately after TB
      therapy, in addition to routine orthodontic records. Changes in TMJ and skeletal variables
      were analyzed and compared within and between both groups.
