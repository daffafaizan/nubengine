      Indeed, various studies demonstrated maladaptive changes in physiological stress regulation
      systems of depressive patients, i.e. in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the locus
      coeruleus-noradrenergic system. On a central level, changes of the locus
      coeruleus-noradrenergic system have been demonstrated.This seems to be the case especially in
      depressive patients with early life traumata. Comparable to the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system influences not
      only the physiological stress response, but has also central influence with effects on
      cognitive functions. Indeed, noradrenergic effects on cognitive functions such as attention,
      learning and memory have been demonstrated in healthy individuals. Even though deficits in
      cognitive domains are core symptoms of major depression, the relationship of the
      noradrenergic system and cognitive processes has rarely been investigated so far.

      In this project, the investigators will examine noradrenergic influences via administration
      of the alpha2-receptor blocker yohimbine on cognitive and emotionally relevant processes in
      depressive patients and controls. Additionally, the investigators will examine the influence
      of early life traumata on these relationships. Thus, the investigators will examine
      participants with and without major depression and with and without early life stress.

      Results of this study will improve the understanding of cognitive dysfunctions associated
      with the noradrenergic system in patients with major depression.
