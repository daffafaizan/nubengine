      to also look at the safety of oral acyline.

      Acyline temporarily blocks the production of the hormone testosterone in normal men. It has
      been given to over 100 men in an injection form. This study will be testing acyline in a pill
      form. This is the first time the pill form has been tested in humans.

      This study may help develop an oral form of a testosterone-blocker, which may be useful in
      the treatment of diseases such as prostate cancer, premature puberty and possibly in a male
      contraceptive.

      This study requires three 12-hour blood draw periods for pharmacokinetics (PK) testing. PK
      testing looks to see how much study drug is in the blood. This gives information about how
      the body handles and gets rid of the study drug.
