      outcomes in brain injured patients; however, there are no conclusive studies that demonstrate
      that fever prevention/controlled normothermia is associated with better outcomes. This study
      will be conducted to assess the impact of advanced temperature control to prevent fever in
      brain injured patients. The fever prevention group will use the Arctic Sun Temperature
      Management System and will be compared to standard care patients in whom fever may
      spontaneously develop. If fever develops in a patient in the standard care group, they will
      be treated with standard fever care measures according to a step-wise algorithm, consisting
      primarily of intermittent antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) and cooling blankets and, when
      necessary, advanced targeted temperature management devices.
