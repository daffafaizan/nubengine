      intrarenal surgery (RIRS) due to renal stone(s). A total of 60 patients (male or female) will
      be recruited, and will be randomized into 2 groups consisting of 30 patients in each group.
      The first group of patients will undergo RIRS with a ureteral access sheath (UAS) positioned
      prior to surgery; and the second group will undergo RIRS without UAS. As use of UAS decreases
      the pressure in the renal pelvis during RIRS, it is aimed to evaluate whether using UAS or
      not affects the kidney functions. Besides the routine kidney function tests, namely urea and
      creatinine, and Netrin-1 (more specific and early marker of kidney function) will be used to
      assess the differences in the kidney functions. Preoperative blood urea, creatinine and
      Netrin-1 levels and urine Netrin-1 levels will be studied for all patients. After the
      surgery, blood urea and creatinine levels will be again studied as well as blood Netrin-1
      levels at postoperative 48th hour; and urine Netrin-1 levels at postoperative 24th hour.
