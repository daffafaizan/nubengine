    
      This is a prospective, partially blinded, two-centre cross-sectional study in which the
      diagnostic test accuracy of CAD4TB and an Afinion CRP assay test for TB will be assessed at
      facility level by evaluating a sample of 1400 adults (age ≥18years) with one or more TB
      symptoms (WHO recommended four-symptom screening; cough, weight loss, night sweats, fever) of
      any duration.

      Presumptive TB patients will be recruited (i) at the outpatient departments of the
      Butha-Buthe District Hospital (Butha-Buthe, Lesotho) and the Caluza Clinic (Pietermaritzburg,
      KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) and (ii) during community-based health campaigns by SolidarMed
      in Lesotho and HSRC in South Africa. Participants will be enrolled after giving written
      informed consent.

      Study procedures comprise the following (detailed in the schedule of events): collection of
      contact, anthropometric, demographic and clinical data, HIV testing and counselling per
      national guidelines, collection of capillary blood for HIV testing, Afinion CRP assay,
      differential white blood cell count, VISITECT CD4 Advanced Disease Test (if HIV-positive),
      CrAg Lateral Flow Assay (if HIV positive and CD4 count <200 cells/μl as per VISITECT CD4
      Advanced Disease Test, and no history of cryptococcal meningitis treatment); collection of
      urine (if HIV positive) for Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test; chest radiography for CAD4TB and
      CAD4COVID analysis and remote expert reading; nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-Cov-2 real-time
      PCR and SARS-Cov-2 antigen test, collection of two spot sputa samples (S1,S2) for Xpert
      MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (S1) and for mycobacterial culture [MGIT] (S2). At week 12
      (±2weeks), we will contact each participant by phone and collect data on their vital status,
      and any TB treatment since enrolment. For individuals on TB treatment, further information,
      e.g. on reasons for empirical treatment, will be collected at the health facility the
      participant started TB treatment.
