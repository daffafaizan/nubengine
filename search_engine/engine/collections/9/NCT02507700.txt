    
      Sevoflurane will be used for anesthesia induction and maintance. Laryngeal mask airway will
      be placed without neuromuscular blocking agent. In group P (popliteal block), a single dose
      of 0.3ml.kg(-1) of 0.25% bupivacaine will be performed for popiteal nerve block (with
      ultrasound guidence). In group C ( control), only plaster cover will be applied without nerve
      block for sham procedure to provide double-blinded study. Intraoperative heart rate, mean
      arterial pressure, BIS (bispectral index) values, sevoflurane consumption will be recorded
      ten minutes interval. Wong Baker faces scale and skin conductance fluctuations will be
      recorded at postoperative 0, 10th min, 20th min , 1st h, 4th h, 12th h qnd 24th h. Total
      analgesic consumption (paracetamol orally ) will be recorded.
