    
      From January 2009 to March 2020, data of all consecutive patients requiring distal
      pancreatectomy in our public tertiary hospital were prospectively collected and
      retrospectively analyzed.

      Registrars were progressively involved for MIDP since 2009 and their experience was: < 5 open
      pancreatic resections, < 5 MIDP and at least 30 advanced minimally invasive gastrointestinal
      resections.

      Outcome of patients who underwent either distal pancreatectomy by the consultant or
      registrars were compared.

      Our primary outcome was the conversion rate. The secondary outcomes were 90-days
      postoperative outcomes including CR-POPF defined and classified according to the 2016 ISGPF
      definition.
