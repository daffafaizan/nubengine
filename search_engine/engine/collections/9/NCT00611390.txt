      citriodora, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Origanum syriacum, and Rosmarinus
      Officinalis, against placebo in the treatment of patients with acute viral Laryngitis or
      Tracheitis.

      In- vitro and clinical studies suggest therapeutic potential of aromatic herbs and trees oils
      in the treatment of Laryngitis or Tracheitis. The pharmacological and clinical activity of
      Eucalyptus citriodora, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Origanum syriacum, and
      Rosmarinus Officinalis, include anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities.
      Some of these herbs and trees oils have direct activity on the respiratory tract, the
      coughing reflex and the airflow in the nasal tract.
