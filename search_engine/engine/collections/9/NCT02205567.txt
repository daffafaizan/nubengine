    
      The research hypothesis is to assess whether bergamot reduces plasma lipids (total
      cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol), atherogenic lipoproteins, carotid intima-media thickness
      (IMT) and liver steatosis in patients with dyslipidemia.

      The primary objective is to assess whether bergamot reduces plasma lipids and atherogenic
      lipoproteins in patients with dyslipidemia.

      Primary endpoint: Reduction in plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins. The secondary
      objective is to assess whether bergamot reduces carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and
      liver steatosis in patients with dyslipidemia.

      Secondary endpoint: Reduction in IMT and and liver steatosis.

      Clinical diagnostic tools will include the measurement of:

        1. cIMT, that will be assessed by B-mode real-time ultrasound using a single sonographer
           (Medison SonoAce Pico, with a probe of 7.5-10.0 MHz) in a standardized manner with fixed
           angles of insonation;

        2. liver steatosis, that will be assessed by by abdominal ultrasound.

      Biochemical analyses will include the analysis of:

        1. Routine testing of plasma lipids;

        2. Atherogenic lipoproteins, e.g. the analysis of 11 distinct lipoproteins including
           very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), 3 intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) subclasses
           and 7 low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses.
