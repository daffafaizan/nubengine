      of them are undiagnosed. Diabetes also accounts for 14.5% of all-cause mortality worldwide,
      with close to half of the deaths are in subjects <60 years old. These highlight the
      importance of early diagnosis of disease, timely intervention with appropriate therapy, and
      treating type 2 diabetes patients to goal to prevent the development of complications.

      Asian type 2 diabetes phenotypes are different than Caucasians, i.e. significant pancreatic
      beta-cell dysfunction, higher visceral adiposity, more vulnerable to cardio-renal
      complications. Although clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors have been published, real-world
      data on the use of this new class of antidiabetic medication is still lacking, in
      particularly among Asians.
