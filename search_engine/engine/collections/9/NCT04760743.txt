    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study to
      assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a SK SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein
      subunit vaccine (NBP2001) in healthy adults.

      A total of 50 healthy adults between 19 and 55 years of age will be enrolled and
      block-randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of either one NBP2001 formulation (Test
      group 1 or 2) or placebo saline (Placebo group).

      Over the study period, participants will commonly attend 10 planned visits. Telephone calls
      will be made 7 days after each vaccination (Day 7+3 after Visit 2 and Visit 4). However,
      sentinel participants will be required to return at Day 7(+ 3 days) after 1st vaccination for
      rigorous safety assessment.

      Study vaccination will comprise 2 intramuscular injections of saline placebo, or a 30 or 50Î¼g
      dose of NBP2001 in an injection volume of approximately 0.5mL. The study vaccines will be
      injected preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm at a 28-day interval.

      Halting rules based on reactogenicity and safety outcomes are defined, and enrollment and
      study vaccination may be paused during the study if any halting rules are met.
