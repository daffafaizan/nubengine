      have important influences on health and health behaviors (Berkman et al., 2000; Berkman &
      Syme, 1979) and mental health (Tsai et al., 2014). While the majority of these studies have
      been conducted in resource-rich settings, studies conducted in resource-limited settings have
      similarly demonstrated associations between social networks and health (Perkins, Subramanian,
      & Christakis, 2014). In this literature, the tie between two persons is the important unit of
      measurement. Classically, the social tie is typically elicited using a "name generator"
      survey that inquires about ties based on the affective content of the relationship (Laumann,
      1966; Wellman, 1979) or normative bonds such as kinship ties (Kleiner & Parker, 1976).

      Another popular approach to eliciting social ties has employed multiple name generators
      inquiring about specific types of interactions, such as discussions about important matters
      or exchanges of money (Burt, 1984; Marsden, 1987; McCallister & Fischer, 1978). These types
      of name generators have strong face validity, are less likely to be subjectively interpreted
      in different ways by different respondents, and are therefore likely to be more reliable.
      These are accompanied by a heavy respondent burden, however, and single-item name generators
      may perform comparably to multiple name generators only under limited circumstances (Marin &
      Hampton, 2007). It remains unclear, however, whether the order of name generators may affect
      study participant responses. While no studies have examined this empirically, there is a
      broad literature on public opinion polling suggesting that alternative specifications of
      question ordering can have important effects on respondents' answers (McFarland, 1981).
