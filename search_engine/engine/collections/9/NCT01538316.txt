      and mortality rates vary geographically, being much lower in Asia than in Western countries.
      Notably, latent PCs seem to be equally distributed, thus supporting the hypothesis, that
      environmental factors may be important in prostate cancer progression. Moreover,
      epidemiological evidence strongly supports the concept that the incidence of clinical
      prostate cancer depends on lifestyle factors, mainly related to diet. The isoflavone
      genistein and the flavonoid quercetin have been identified as likely preventive candidates.
      The aim of the intended clinical trial is to evaluate the hypothesized effectiveness of
      polyphenolic phytochemicals with highly purified dietary supplements in patients at high risk
      of clinical PC and without systemic treatment. This will provide data, which serve as an
      important pre-requesite for targeted dietary interventions using alternative medicine as
      preventive measures in men with latent PC.
