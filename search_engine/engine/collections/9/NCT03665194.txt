      be dosed in four groups of eight (purely for logistical reasons relating to the procedure
      times expected with dosing and ECG). Volunteers will receive either the active drug or
      matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Therefore within each cohort, six volunteers will receive
      the active drug and two will receive matching placebo.

      Volunteers will be screened within 20 days prior to entering the study on Day -1. Each
      volunteer will receive verbal and written information followed by signing of the ICF prior to
      any screening procedures taking place. Volunteers will be admitted to the study unit on Day
      -1, dosed twice daily on Days 1-3 and once on Day 4 (morning dose only). They will be
      discharged on Day 6 and will have a telephone follow-up on Day 14. If they report any
      relevant Adverse Event (AE) they will be invited to attend the unit for an outpatient visit
      as close to Day 14 as is possible.
