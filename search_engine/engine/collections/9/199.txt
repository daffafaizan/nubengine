infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, isdescribed . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in thedensity of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilisstrain sb-1 .dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weightequivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, isinfective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-formingability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules arerequired to initiate an infective center . recombination studies withmixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm theexistence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a secondinfective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . inthis system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to thecells . at these concentrations the multiple-event nature of phage dnainfection precludes the formation of unaided plaques . however, bysubsequently superinfecting the dna-infected cells with atemperature-sensitive mutant and plating under selective conditions,genetic rescue of the infecting dna is accomplished and detected .infective centers elicited by this /marker rescue/ phenomenon aredirectly proportional to dna concentration . the time of attainment ofdnase resistance by phage dna infective centers that have irreversiblyadsorbed dna can be measured . phage dna infective centers require atleast 13 minutes to become totally dnase resistant . the reasons for thefailure of single phage dna molecules to carry out an infection arediscussed in terms of a specific breakage-reunion
