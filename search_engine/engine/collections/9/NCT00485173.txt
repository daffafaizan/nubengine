    
      This pivotal clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      INFUSE速 Bone Graft with the PEEK Interbody Spacer and Anterior Cervical Plate in patients
      with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). The implant under investigation in
      this clinical trial is INFUSE速 Bone Graft, the PEEK Interbody Spacer, and Anterior Cervical
      Plate. The device will be implanted using an anterior surgical approach. Safety and
      effectiveness data for patients in this study will be compared to that of historical
      controls. Historical control data will be taken from the control arms of the following
      Medtronic studies: (1) the Artificial Cervical Disc (also known as PRESTIGE速 Cervical Disc
      System) pivotal IDE trial (NCT00642876) and (2) the BRYAN速 Cervical Disc System pivotal IDE
      trial (NCT00437190).
