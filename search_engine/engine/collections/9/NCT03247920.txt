      infections. Since the early diagnosis of bacterial infection in neonates is difficult,
      intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is usually started promptly after subtle
      symptoms. The majority of neonates become asymptomatic shortly after initiation; when
      infection is probable or proven by elevated inflammatory markers and/or a positive blood
      culture, intravenous antibiotics are administered for at least 7 days.

      However, for neonates blood culture has a limited sensitivity. Therefore, the majority of
      neonates with probable infection are treated for a prolonged time with intravenous
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. In older children, intravenous antibiotics are often
      changed to oral antibiotics after cessation of symptoms and decreasing inflammatory
      parameters. This is not yet widely practised in neonates because of uncertainties in
      pharmacokinetics. Two explorative small studies from France and Italy into neonatal
      antibiotic switch therapy suggest that follow-up treatment with an oral antibiotic is
      promising; but the non-inferiority and safety was not yet properly addressed. Neonatal switch
      therapy, if proven to be safe and efficacious, would have a major impact on neonatal
      well-being, mother-to-child bonding and moreover costs.
