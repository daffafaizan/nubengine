      accelerated regimen can also be considered on a case-by-case basis in those adults with
      neurological pathologies, systemic vasculitis or autoimmune disease requiring an anti-CD20
      monoclonal antibody if the combination of injections over a short period is likely to promote
      immunization.

      The aim of this pilot, interventional study is to evaluate the anti-HBV vaccine response
      measured by the level of anti-HBs antibodies greater than 10 IU / l after vaccination in
      patients to receive treatment with anti-CD20.

      Evaluation of the specific anti-HBV vaccine response, measured by the level of anti-HBs
      antibodies greater than 10 IU / l at M2, M6 and M13 in patients having received a regimen
      accelerated by Engerix B 20 Âµg (D0, D7, J21), then recall 12 months later. Anti-CD20 drugs
      should be started at least 1 month after the first 3 injections for neurological pathologies
      and after the first 2 injections for vasculitis and autoimmune diseases (scheme linked to the
      underlying pathology with the need for rapid treatment with anti -CD20 in these pathologies).

      Follow-up of 3 parallel cohorts of patients seronegative for hepatitis B virus (HBV):

        -  1 cohort followed for multiple sclerosis or another inflammatory neurological disease
           (group 1)

        -  the cohort followed for systemic vasculitis (group 2)

        -  1 cohort followed for an autoimmune disease (RA, Lupus, etc.) (group 3) to receive
           treatment with anti-CD20 (rituximab or ocrelizumab) and to be vaccinated against
           hepatitis B.

      The patients will be followed for a period of 13 months after the start of the vaccination.
