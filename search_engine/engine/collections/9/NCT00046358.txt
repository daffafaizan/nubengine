      associated with a delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is separate evidence
      that beta-amyloid(1-42) is involved in the pathophysiology of AD and levels of
      beta-amyloid(1-42) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients are significantly lower
      than that found in controls. It has been suggested that these standard medications may have
      indirect effects that alter the normal course of AD, but there is no data to directly support
      this contention in humans. Based on previous work, it is our hypothesis that CSF
      beta-amyloid(1-42) levels may serve as an early biomarker of AD. Any pharmacological induced
      change in CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) might have profound implications for the eventual onset of
      illness. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects of two
      commonly prescribed nonsteroidal and cholesterol lowering medications, ibuprofen and
      lovastatin, on the levels of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid(1-42) in a group of normal
      controls 'at risk' for developing AD.
