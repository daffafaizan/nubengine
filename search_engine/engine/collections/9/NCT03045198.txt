      long-term treatment of patients with CF chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa due
      to its immunomodulating properties . AZT causes a significant reduction of the
      proinflammatory cytokine Lipopolysaccharid binding protein (LBP) according to Steinkamp and
      Schmitt-Grohé. There is an inverse correlation between LBP and lung function. Moreover
      Schmitt-Grohé and coworkers provided evidence of a positive correlation between the
      lipoprotein HDL and lung function. Ribeiro and coworkers found an increased expression of
      Lipid/Cholesterol genes of primary human airway epithelial cultures after treatment with AZT.
      Freedman and coworkers were able to show decreased levels of Docosahexaen acid in CF
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to explore the impact of a 4 week trial of AZT on lipoprotein and
      fatty acids (docosahexaen acid etc.) synthesis.

      Delta F508 homozygous patients receive AZT (10 mg/kg body weight resp. max 500 mg) every
      Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 4 weeks. 20 patients (age 10-60 years) will be recruited.
      Fatty acids (blood), cytokines (whole blood and induced sputum) and clinical parameters are
      assessed before and 4 weeks after AZT treatment.
