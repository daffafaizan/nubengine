      with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who are symptomatic despite the use of
      antihistamines. It is proposed that benralizumab will deplete eosinophils and basophils from
      affected skin, improve symptoms of CSU, and improve CSU-related quality of life. This Phase
      2b study is designed to evaluate induction and maintenance dosing regimens.
