      I. To define the safety and tolerability of cyclosporine A in combination with dasatinib in
      adults with Bcr-Abl+ chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, or when used in specified
      patients with accelerated phase CML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib when combined with cyclosporine.

      II. To assess whether the combination of dasatinib and cyclosporine alters T cell number and
      function.

      III. To assess the feasibility of determining phosphorylation of Src in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells by flow cytometry as a surrogate measure of dasatinib activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cyclosporine PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 8-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during
      treatment for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and T-cell number and function by
      flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
