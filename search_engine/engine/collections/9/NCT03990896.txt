      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved talazoparib for the
      participants' specific disease but it has been approved for metastatic breast cancer with a
      germline (inherited) BRCA mutation.

      Talazoparib is a study drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins
      called "poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases" also called "PARPs". PARPs are proteins (made from
      genes which are part of your DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are
      involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA
      when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the defective cell will usually die and
      be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA that do not die can become cancer cells. Cancer
      cells may be killed by a study drug, like talazoparib, that stops the normal activity of
      PARPs. In clinical trials, the use of talazoparib and other PARP inhibitors have shown that
      these drugs can reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with BRCA1 or
      BRCA2 mutations.

      In this research study, the investigators are examining how effective talazoparib is in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer with a BRCA mutation in their tumor.
