      (i.e., sleep, walking, nutrition, stress management) to standard of care behavioral
      management (i.e., sleep, walking, nutrition, stress management) (STANDARD OF CARE) plus
      vestibular exercises (i.e., balance, eye-head movements, and dynamic walking exercises)
      (VESTIBULAR) for reducing recovery time, symptoms, and vestibular (balance, eye-head
      movements) and cognitive (e.g., memory, processing speed) impairment in adolescent patients
      with vestibular clinical profiles following sport--related concussion (SRC).
