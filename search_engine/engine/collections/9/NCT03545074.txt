    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an experimental condition (MAPs
      Mindfulness intervention) and an active control group (Health Education), using a pretest and
      immediate posttest research design. Both conditions are comprised of a 6-week group
      intervention, which will be administered at the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus. The sample
      (N=80) will be drawn from a population of adults (18-65 years old), residing within a 10mile
      radius of the UCLA Westwood Medical Campus. To determine initial eligibility, potential
      participants will self-select based on perceived high levels of stress. Participants will
      respond self-report questionnaires to assess for psychological symptoms and will be drawn
      blood samples (180ml total) to assess levels of pro inflammatory cytokines before and after
      the interventions. Participants will attend a total of 8 visits.
