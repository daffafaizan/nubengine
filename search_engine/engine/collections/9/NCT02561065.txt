      promote cardiovascular health in participants having a high or a low degree of subclinical
      atherosclerotic plaque burden (SAPB), compared to standard care.

      Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including middle-aged bank
      employees from the ´Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis´ (PESA) cohort,
      stratified by SAPB. Within each stratum, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive a
      lifestyle program or standard care.

      The primary outcome measure is the adapted FUSTER-BEWAT CVD risk and lifestyle composite
      score and secondary outcome measures include physical activity, sedentary time, standing
      time, diet, smoking, anthropometric measures, blood biomarkers, self-rated health,
      work-related outcomes, healthcare consumption, program process measures and cost measures.
