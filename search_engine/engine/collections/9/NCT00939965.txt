      Primary

        -  To investigate the feasibility of implementing individualized dosing of isotretinoin in
           patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after course 1 of treatment, based on isotretinoin
           pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

        -  To minimize the large inter-patient variation in plasma concentrations of isotretinoin.

        -  To ensure that patients are not exposed to potentially sub-optimal plasma concentrations
           of isotretinoin during long-term treatment, particularly for patients who are not able
           to swallow isotretinoin capsules.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary data on the potential impact of isotretinoin therapeutic
           monitoring on clinical response and toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and during courses 1-3 for pharmacokinetic studies
      and determination of each patient's individual therapeutic-dose level requirement. Genotyping
      to identify genes that metabolize enzymes is conducted via PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.
