      when compared to other sites of the oral cavity, as palatal tissues are tightly bound to the
      hard palate with limited tissue space between it and the periosteum . As the injection is
      given, pressure builds up within the palatal tissues causing pain.

      Studies conducted on indirect palatal injection technique (intrapapillary) revealed that it
      reduces the pain of palatal injection with the same efficacy of anesthesia during extraction.

      The desirable method to evade pain during palatal injection is just not to have one. So
      studies was made to evaluate the single buccal injection and its efficiency during extraction
      of maxillary teeth. The relatively thin porous bone of posterior buccal maxilla facilitates
      the diffusion of local anesthetic,as well as articaine can diffuse through soft and hard
      tissues more reliably than other LA so that maxillary buccal infiltration of articaine
      provides palatal soft tissue anesthesia.Therefore single injection eliminates the need for
      multiple painful injections.
