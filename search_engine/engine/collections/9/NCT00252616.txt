      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive trophic enteral feedings for 96 hours followed by
      advancement to goal feeding rates or initial advancement to goal feeding rates. Primary
      endpoints are ventilator free days, ICU-free days, gastrointestinal intolerances, development
      of nosocomial infections, and mortality.
