      world with low and middle-income countries disproportionately affected with rates as high as
      30-40% compared to an average rate of less than 3% in high income countries. In addition to
      the grave clinical implications of these infections, the additional costs incurred by both
      patients and treating institutions can be catastrophic.

      The World Health Organization's "Clean Care is Safer Care" initiated quality improvement
      projects in five African hospitals between 2013 and 2015, demonstrating that low-cost
      interventions can decrease the rates of surgical site infection in low and middle-income
      countries. This successful initiative formed the basis of the World Health Organization's
      Surgical Unit Based Safety Programme guidelines.

      This will be a prospective cohort study collecting data about surgical practices, pre- and
      post-operative care and post-operative infection from time of admission through
      post-operative day 30. Patients will be identified when they are scheduled for surgery and
      undergo consent process. If they consent to participate in the study their clinical course
      will be followed through post-operative day 30. Inpatient observational data will be
      collected to determine whether current practices are in line with World Health Organization's
      Surgical Unit Based Safety Programme guidelines. Potential confounding risk factors for
      infection will be identified, and post-operative information will be collected through
      inpatient follow up as well as telephone calls on post-operative day ten and 30 to assess for
      signs or symptoms of surgical site infection.
