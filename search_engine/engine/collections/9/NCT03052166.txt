    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm case collection study, with IRB approval. The
      study will follow an adaptive design with an initially planned total enrollment of
      approximately 600 cases to include both benign and malignant cases, representative of all
      tissue densities.

      The images and clinical data accrued in this prospective case collection will be used for
      creation of a database to facilitate future reader's studies, publications, building teaching
      files, and future marketing for QT Ultrasound.
