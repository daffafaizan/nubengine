      in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC)ï¼Œespecially the emotional sound; however,
      precise and accurate quantitative indices to estimate cerebral activation to different
      auditory stimuli remain scarce. In this study, investigators assessed the response of
      different brain regions to three acoustic stimuli using quantitative electroencephalography
      (QEEG) and ERP(Event-related potential),and further investigated the predictive value of QEEG
      in the prognosis of DOC.
