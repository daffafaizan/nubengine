      combination with hormonal suppression of endometriosis (standard of care), will lead to
      significant improvement of endometriosis-related pain.

      The proposal seeks to:

        1. determine if the addition of LDN to standard endometriosis treatments will improve
           patient- reported endometriosis associated pain using daily Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
           scores and

        2. measure the impact of treatment on quality of life as measured by validated
           questionnaires including the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP30) and the Patient's
           Global Impression of Change (PGIC).
