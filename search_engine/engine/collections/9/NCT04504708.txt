        -  Part 1: ZX-101A Dose Escalation

        -  Part 2: ZX-101A Dose Expansion

      The Part 1 (dose escalation) of the study is designed to determine the safety and
      tolerability of ZX-101A administered orally once daily in 28-day cycles. The Part 2 (dose
      expansion) of the study is designed to further investigate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic and clinical activities of ZX-101A administered orally
      once daily in 28-day cycles at the selected recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Results of clinical findings in patients in the dose-escalation portion of the study will be
      reviewed to identify conditions (or genetic characteristics) most likely to respond to
      ZX-101A. These select types of hematologic malignancies will be enrolled in cohorts in the
      dose-expansion part of the study.

      Male or female patients who are 18 years of age or older with relapsed/resistant or
      refractory advanced hematologic malignancies (CLL/SLL, iNHL, and other NHL subtypes) will be
      included in the study provided that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are satisfied.

      Up to three cohorts are planned in Part 2 - Dose Expansion of the study: 1)
      relapsed/resistant or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic
      Lymphoma (SLL), 2) relapsed/resistant or refractory indolent Non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL),
      and based on emerging data from Part 1-Dose Expansion, a third cohort consisting of other
      types of NHL may be included.
