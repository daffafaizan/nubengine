      I. To collect and interrogate samples in patients with prostate cancer that were diagnosed
      with prostate cancer and are planned for radical prostatectomy at Mayo Clinic Arizona.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile and tolerance of therapy for 60 days of treatment
      prior to surgery.

      II. To assess change in stage and/or grade of cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      response to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate specific pathways and changes when comparing biopsy specimens to
      prostatectomy.

      II. To describe the quality of life of patients receiving hormonal therapy prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive low dose raloxifene hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days 1-30.
      Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive low dose bicalutamide PO daily on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every
      30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive low dose raloxifene hydrochloride PO daily and low dose bicalutamide
      PO on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients receive high dose raloxifene hydrochloride PO daily and high dose
      bicalutamide PO on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
