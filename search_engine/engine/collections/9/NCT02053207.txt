      neuroscience suggests that cognitive training, which harnesses the brain's adaptive
      plasticity to improve, maintain, or restore function in a target area, can be used to
      strengthen brain resilience and improve cognitive outcomes following challenge. While its
      effectiveness has been demonstrated in older adults as well as in other (nonsurgical) patient
      populations, no training intervention like this has ever before been used in any surgical
      patient in the preoperative period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility
      of administering a 20-day cognitive training intervention (Cog-Train) to a widely inclusive
      sample of cardiac surgical patients before their surgery. Data obtained will be used to
      design a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) on Cog-Train's effectiveness in
      improving postoperative cognitive outcomes.
