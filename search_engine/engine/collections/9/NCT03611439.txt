      investigators in this study have used transgenic Drosophila melanogaster models and machine
      learning to develop an eight component botanical mixture (Geneaire™* ReBuilder™) that targets
      multiple genetic pathways involved in brain aging and dementia that are homologous between
      Drosophila and humans.

      While beta-amyloid plaques and phosphorylated-tau tangles are diagnostic for AD, the cause(s)
      of their soluble precursors that kill neurons has not been determined. The majority of AD
      patients are diagnosed after 60 years of age. Many studies point to aging related processes
      like inflammation, neural vascular damage, neural stress, altered cell metabolism,
      inefficient cellular autophagy, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and poor
      diet as potential causal factors in the decline of brain function over the decades that
      precede an actual AD diagnosis. AD is a multifaceted pathology involving many biochemical
      pathways and thus a multifaceted therapeutic approach may prove beneficial.

      The goal of this study was to test ReBuilder on human cognitive function. During the 12-month
      pilot study, the subjects were evaluated quarterly on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE),
      Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study's Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), and the
      Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).
