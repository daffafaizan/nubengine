      conceptualization, design and utility of pediatric CR programs have been poorly studied.
      Particular challenges for children with heart disease include uncertainties regarding
      physical activity restrictions imposed by clinicians and overprotection by caregivers. These
      challenges may lead to poor lifestyle and deconditioning, resulting in increased health risks
      associated with inactivity, such as adiposity, and reduced perceived general health and
      quality of life. Preliminary studies have shown therapeutic benefits of physical exercise as
      an add-on therapy in an effort to improve patients' functional outcome after cardiac surgery
      1; however, delivery of these programs has been variable, and it is not clear whether a
      combined program of facility and home-based exercise would yield higher patient adherence for
      children. The investigators hypothesize that a supervised exercise training program delivered
      both in the hospital and in participants' homes will be acceptable and feasible for children
      with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The investigators will conduct a pilot trial over 1
      year in which the investigators will randomize 20 participants to either aerobic exercise
      only or a combined aerobic and strength training program for 12 weeks. The investigators will
      conduct qualitative interviews to understand intervention acceptability. Results will support
      a larger definitive study aimed at determining efficacy.
