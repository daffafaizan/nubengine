    
      A prospective, randomised, controlled trial compared two different techniques of high tibial
      osteotomy with a lateral closing wedge or a medial opening wedge, stabilised by a Puddu
      plate. The clinical outcome and radiological results were examined at one year.

      The primary outcome measure was the achievement of an overcorrection of valgus of 4Â°.
      Secondary outcome measures were the severity of pain (visual analogue scale), knee function
      (Hospital for Special Surgery score), and walking distance.
