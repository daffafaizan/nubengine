      to placebo in patients with painful distal symmetrical diabetic neuropathy or post-herpetic
      neuralgia. The treatments in this three-period crossover study are dextromethorphan, up to
      920 mg/day (about 8 times the antitussive dose), memantine, 30-50 mg/day, and placebo.
      Memantine is an NMDA antagonist used in Europe to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's
      disease. The underlying hypothesis, based on studies of painful neuropathies in animal
      models, is that neuropathic pain is caused largely by sensitization of central nervous system
      neurons caused by excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, acting largely through NMDA
      receptors. A previous small trial of dextromethorphan suggested efficacy in diabetic
      neuropathy pain. The study requires one visit to the NIH outpatient Pain Research Clinic, and
      consists of three 9-week treatment periods. Patients who respond to one of the medications
      will be invited to participate in further controlled studies of the medication followed by up
      to several years of open-label treatment under continued observation.
