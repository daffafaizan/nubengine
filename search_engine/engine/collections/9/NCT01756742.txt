      United States . Pleural effusion (PE) is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space that
      is classified as transudate or exudate according to its composition and underlying
      pathophysiology. The goal in the management of pleural effusion is to provide symptomatic
      relief by removing fluid from the pleural space and to allow the treatment of the underlying
      disease. While some authors (REF) propose respiratory physiotherapy, in the majority of the
      cases only the medical treatment combined with the pleural fluid removal by thoracentesis are
      the most common practice. The objective of this study is verify the effectiveness of
      respiratory physiotherapy in pleural effusion
