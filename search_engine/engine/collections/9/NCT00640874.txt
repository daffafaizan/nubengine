    
      The aim of this study is to

        1. Describe the effectiveness of short-term prophylaxis against symptomatic pandemic
           influenza infection

        2. Describe the safety of short-term prophylaxis

        3. Describe the seroconversion rate against pandemic influenza among recipients of
           short-term prophylaxis

      The study is an open label prospective cohort study. Contact group members of people with
      diagnosed influenza who are recommended to receive NA inhibitor prophylaxis for short periods
      of time will be enrolled following provision of informed consent. Each episode of short-term
      prophylaxis will be recorded separately.

      By design it is hoped that volunteers in this study who develop symptoms and signs of
      pandemic influenza infection will be enrolled in the Index Case (PIPET A) protocol with
      follow-up as required.
