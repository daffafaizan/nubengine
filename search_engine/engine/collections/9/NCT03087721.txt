      trial, with allocation by the minimization method, with two parallel groups and intention of
      superiority. It was designed to test the hypothesis that a 12-week program of HIIT-LV, yields
      larger beneficial effects on insulin resistance, skeletal muscle composition and endocrine
      function than CAE.

      Although aerobic exercise increases cardio-respiratory capacity, modifies risk factors and
      decreases mortality risk, there is currently controversy and gaps in knowledge over the
      efficacy of more intense and low-volume physical activities on muscle metabolism in patients
      with metabolic disorders.

      The primary outcome will be the insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity and percentage of
      pancreatic Î²-cell function. The secondary outcomes will be the glycosylated hemoglobin, mass
      and muscle fibre type composition of thigh and plasma levels of musclin and apelin.
      Assessments will be made before and after the 12-week program. Calculations based on
      previously results (difference mean 10% and SD 15%) suggest that a total number of 60
      patients randomized 1:1 (30 in each group) to the two intervention groups is sufficient to
      detect larger beneficial effects with HIIT-LV with a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided test) and
      statistical power of 0.80 (primary endpoint is insulin sensitivity).
