      experimental glaucoma study will characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of RNFL
      birefringence during glaucoma progression and establish an initial feature set and classifier
      for a case-control clinical study. The case-control clinical study will refine the initial
      feature set and classifier and use ROC analysis to test sensitivity and specificity of the
      feature set and classifier for discriminating between normal and glaucomatous human eyes. The
      feature set and classifier formulated in the case-control clinical study is a prerequisite
      for planning a large-scale longitudinal study. A large-scale longitudinal study to compare
      different approaches for detecting early glaucoma is outside the scope of the proposed
      research. Moreover, considering the large number of subjects required for statistical
      significance when the conversion rate from ocular hypertensive to glaucoma is low
      (<10%/year), a longitudinal study is best performed in a multi-institution clinical trial
      over several years.
