      clearance devices in adults with ALS. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of
      two treatment groups: treatment with a mechanical HCFF device alone or treatment with both a
      mechanical HFCC device and a cough assist device.

      This outpatient study includes a screening/baseline visit followed by a 180 day (25.7 weeks)
      treatment period with three scheduled clinic visits (day 30, day 90, day 180). Pulmonary
      assessments and ALS outcome measures will be collected at each visit in addition to quality
      of life assessments and device usage diaries.
