      lungs during major surgical procedures of long duration may improve postoperative outcomes
      and decrease morbidity and mortality. The aim of the current study was to identify ventilator
      strategies that are less damaging to normal lungs. The investigators plan to compare three
      ventilation strategies commonly utilized in the operating room in normal lungs. One group
      will be ventilated with high tidal volume (15 mL/kg PBW) and low PEEP (3 cm H2O), another
      group ventilated with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg PBW) and low PEEP (3 cm H2O) and the final
      group ventilated with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg PBW) and high PEEP (10 cm H2O). This study
      will show the effects of these commonly used methods of ventilation on pulmonary mechanics,
      systemic and pulmonary inflammatory markers and outcomes in patients with normal lungs
      undergoing surgery of long duration.
