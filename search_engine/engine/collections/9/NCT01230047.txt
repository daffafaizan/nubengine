      interventions to adult clients who self-report problems with depression and/or anxiety. The
      course is eight weeks long. Clients are assigned to either (1) receive the course (COU
      condition) from October- December 2010 or (2) placed on a waiting list and receive
      treatment-as-usual (TAU condition). Those in the TAU group will be offered the course in
      January 2011.

      Random assignment to COU or TAU conditions will be attempted although this may be relaxed due
      to institutional constraints.

      Participants are assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory
      (BAI) at the beginning of the course, on the last day of the course, at 1-month post-course,
      at 4-months post-course, and at 12-months post-course.

      Participants in the COU condition will be compared to those in TAU condition at the beginning
      of the course, on the last day of the course, and at 1-month post-course. Further evaluations
      (4 and 12 months post-course) will be pre-post evaluations without a comparison group.
