    
      Study ADCT-502-101 was the first clinical study with ADCT-502 in participants with Advanced
      Solid Tumors with HER2 Expression.

      ADCT-502 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an engineered version of the
      humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, directed against the human HER2 receptor,
      conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. ADCT-502 specifically binds to
      HER2, and once internalized, releases the PBD dimer to allow cross-linking of DNA and
      eventually trigger cell death.

      The study had 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants received an infusion of
      ADCT-502, at escalating doses. Part 1 continued until the maximum tolerated dose or the
      recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) for expansion were determined. In Part 2 (expansion),
      participants were due to be assigned to the recommended dose level of ADCT-502 identified in
      Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee, but the study was terminated prior to the
      beginning of Part 2.

      For each participant, the study included a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period, and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 weeks
      after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration was dependent on overall
      participant tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment as participants were
      able to continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
