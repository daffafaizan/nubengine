      can cause mild to life-threatening illness. This study will evaluate the protective efficacy
      of TV005 (a dengue virus vaccine) administered at Day 0 against viremia and rash induced by
      rDEN2∆30-7169 (a live attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine) administered at Day 180. The
      safety and immunogenicity of the TV005 and rDEN2∆30-7169 vaccines will also be evaluated.

      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a dengue
      virus or a flavivirus. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single injection
      of TV005 or placebo at study entry (Day 0). All participants will receive a single injection
      of rDEN2∆30-7169 on Day 180. For at least 30 minutes after each vaccination, participants
      will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse effects of the vaccines.
      Participants will record their temperature three times a day for 16 days after the first and
      second vaccinations.

      In addition to study visits at Day 0 and 180, participants will attend study visits at Day 4,
      6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236,
      270, and 360. At select study visits, participants will undergo a physical examination,
      medical history review, blood collection, and a pregnancy test for female participants.
