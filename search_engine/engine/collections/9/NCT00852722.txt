      approach to MS. Current treatments in MS include disease modifying therapies such as human
      recombinant interferon beta, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. However, these are only
      partially effective, cannot be taken orally, have side-effects and are very expensive.
      Developing treatment that can be combined with current disease modifying agent remains an
      important goal for improving the care of people with MS.
