      fibrinolytic enzyme Nattokinase and NSK-SD is transported across the gut, and has shown
      multiple effects on vascular health, including fibrinolytic effects and regulation of blood
      pressure.

      A previous study on effects on blood pressure was conducted in an Asian population involving
      86 people, where 73 people completed the study requirements (39 in the NSK-SD group, 34 in
      the placebo group). The data showed statistically significant reduction in both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure after consumption of Nattokinase, whereas the changes after
      consuming placebo were not significantly different from baseline.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of consumption of nattokinase on
      hypertension in a North American hypertensive population with associated genetic, dietary,
      and lifestyle factors. This is in extension of, and contrast to, previous studies in Asian
      populations.
