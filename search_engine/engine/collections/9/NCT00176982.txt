      Alopecia areata is a tissue restricted autoimmune disease directed at the hair follicle,
      resulting in hair loss. Patients frequently suffer severe psychiatric consequences. This is
      especially true of girls and young women who become bald. The incidence of alopecia areata in
      the USA (Minnesota is 20.2 per 100,000 person-years with a lifetime risk of approximately
      1.7%. There is no significant gender difference. The disease is often chronic with a
      remitting, relapsing course. Although it responds to immunosuppression, generalized
      immunosuppression has significant morbidity and treatment is frequently frustrating and not
      successful. New treatment options are essential. With evidence that alopecia areata is a
      T-lymphocyte mediated autoimmune condition it has become a model system for the study of
      pathogenesis and treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmunity and as such is a model for a host
      of additional T-cell mediated autoimmune conditions.
