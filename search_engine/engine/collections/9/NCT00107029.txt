      differing progression to AIDS in individuals who are followed after being off antiretroviral
      therapy. These studies do not always associate the same HLA class I alleles with the risks of
      HIV-1 disease progression; however they consistently demonstrated that HLA-B*35 and B*53
      portend a bad outcome compared to the better outcome observed in HLA-B*27 and B*57 carriers.
      Despite this information, very little data exists to explain the mechanism of this
      association.

      This longitudinal study will look at the HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cell responses and the
      dominant HIV-1 genotype among individuals identified as HLA-B*27, B*35, B*53 and B*57
      positive through studies done in collaboration with the REACH project.
