    
      A total of 100 patients diagnosed with POTS are asked to participate in the study. Prior to
      start of the training program a special POTS questionnaire (based on the symptoms reported in
      The BIG POTS Survey), the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire and SF-36 (general health
      questionnaire) will be completed by the participants. Orthostatic tests are performed during
      10 minutes, measuring heart rate and blood pressure after 0, 1, 3, and, if possible, 10
      minutes of standing. On a separate occasion, patients will perform a submaximal biking
      exercise test, while noting symptoms, degree of exertion, achieved effect, pulse and blood
      pressure reaction. Following this initial evaluation, the training program will be performed
      during a total time of 16 weeks, which may be non-consecutive but within 6 months in total.
      The training program consists of 2-3 visits per week, and 60 minutes per visit. The training
      may be performed on specialized exercise bicycles in supine position or upright position
      depending on the severity of POTS symptoms. These exercises will be done under the
      supervision of physiotherapists with special interest in POTS. After the final training
      session the POTS questionnaire, the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire and SF-36 will be
      completed once again. In addition, orthostatic tests and submaximal biking exercise test will
      be performed on a separate occasion soon after the last training session. The present study
      will be using longitudinal comparisons, meaning that the 100 POTS patients are their own
      controls. The POTS questionnaire, the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire, SF-36,
      hemodynamics and exercise capacity will be compared before and after the 16-weeks training
      program.
