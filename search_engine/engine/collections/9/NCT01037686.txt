      and healthy controls undergo two scans. PD patients after the surgery undergo four scans. PD
      patients who undergo two scans before the surgery, undergo only two scans after the surgery.

      Uptake of Tc-ECD, a CBF radiotracer, is done in the following conditions:

        -  For PD patients before the surgery - during the performance of the semantic verbal
           fluency task or at rest (total of 2 scans).

        -  For PD patients after the surgery- during the performance of the semantic verbal fluency
           task or at rest, either at on-stimulation or off-stimulation condition (total of 4
           scans). The stimulator is turned off by the neurologist for 10 min.

        -  PD patients before and after the surgery- during performance of the semantic verbal
           fluency task or at rest before the surgery and during performance of the semantic verbal
           fluency task or at rest after the surgery only at off-stimulation condition (Total of 4
           scans).

        -  Healthy controls - during the performance of the semantic verbal fluency task or at rest
           (total of 2 scans).

      Following the Tc-ECD injection, the subjects are scanned by Irix SPECT camera for 15min.

      Scans are analyzed and the regional CBF is measured using imaging software. Statistical
      analysis is done to discover the effect of the surgery, stimulation and the disease on blood
      flow at rest and during task performance. In addition, differences between groups in number
      of words produced during the task are also statistically analyzed.
