      intima-media thickness, and endothelial functions have never been investigated in
      hemodialysis patients. Regarding inflammation, the present data in hemodialysis patients are
      derived from small studies with short follow-up.

      We postulate that atorvastatin would reduce progression of coronary calcification and carotid
      artery intima-media thickness, decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function.

      In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, four hundred forty-six prevalent
      hemodialysis patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to
      atorvastatin (20 mg/day in first month; increased to 40 mg/day afterwards) and placebo arms
      (each arm consists of 223 patients), after completion of baseline investigations.
      Randomization will be performed with random permuted blocks and will be stratified according
      to dialysis center, age, sex, diabetic status, duration of dialysis, high flux dialyser use,
      and dialysate calcium level. Follow-up period will be twelve months.

      It is estimated that 446 patients would provide 90% power with a two-sided, alpha error rate
      of 5%, of detecting a significant difference between treatment arms. Dropout rate is expected
      to be 20%, not to be replaced.
