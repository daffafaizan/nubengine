    
      BT1718 is a type of drug called a 'bicycle drug conjugate' which is designed to target and
      inhibit the function of the protein 'membrane type 1 metalloproteinase' (MT1-MMP). MT1-MMP is
      involved in breaking down the proteins that usually surround a cell; however in cancer cells
      it can allow a cancer to grow and spread. MT1-MMP is usually found at a low level in normal
      cells, but can reach higher levels in cancer cells.

      BT1718 has been designed to recognise and attach itself to the MT1-MMP protein. Once attached
      a segment of BT1718 is taken into the cancer cell which causes it to die (DM1 toxin).

      This is a first in human clinical study which has two phases. A 'dose escalation' phase where
      groups of patients will receive increasing doses of BT1718 to find a safe dose that best
      targets the cancer cells. In this phase it is expected that approximately 50-60 patients with
      advanced solid tumours will be entered in the study.

      An 'expansion phase' where larger groups of patients will receive the selected dose of BT1718
      to allow us to find out more about how the drug is working.In this phase at the optimal
      dose/schedule(s), patients will be enrolled with tumour types known to commonly overexpress
      MT1-MMP and where MT1-MMP overexpression is confirmed during prospective selection at
      enrolment (i.e. squamous non-small cell lung cancer). It is expected that up to an additional
      70 patients will be required to complete this phase.
