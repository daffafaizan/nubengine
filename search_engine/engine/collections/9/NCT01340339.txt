      Fernando Figueira Medicine Institute(IMIP), who require phototherapy as an indication of the
      medical team. Following the sample calculation, 144 patients will be randomized according to
      gestational age (350/7-376/7 or 380/7-416/7 weeks) to receive super-LED reverse phototherapy
      or fluorescent reverse phototherapy with spectral irradiance of 8-12 microwatts/cm2/nm.The
      bilirubin will be determined by micromethod with bilirubinometer, after blood collection in
      heparinized capillary until bilirubin reaches level that indicates suspension of therapy.
