      clinician that pleural drainage would be beneficial. Ultrasound will be used to confirm the
      presence of pleural effusion and to estimate the size of the pleural effusions and to confirm
      the position of the pleural drain. Data will be collected before drainage, 30 minutes after
      drainage and then at 4,8,12 and 24 hours after the insertion of the drain (please see also
      attached summary of investigations). Measurements will include arterial blood gas analysis
      drawn from an indwelling arterial catheter, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, mixed,
      expired CO2 and ventilator settings. The measurements will stop either at the end of the 48
      hour period or when the team caring for the patient chose to remove the drain (whichever is
      the first).

      All measurements including the arterial blood gas analysis form part of the standard care of
      an ICU patient. The arterial blood gas measurements are withdrawn from an indwelling arterial
      catheter which is routinely in place on all ICU patients. Only the use of thoracic ultrasound
      by a trained ultrasonographer both before and after the procedure will be additional to the
      standard care of the patient. The use of Chest X-rays is at the discretion of the treating
      clinician and does not form part of the study protocol. Standard biochemical, microbiological
      and cytological tests will be performed on the pleural fluid and blood in keeping with the
      standard practice for pleural effusions.

      The primary outcome measure is the effects of drainage on the P:F ratio. measures of dead
      space ventilation, A-a gradiants, ventilator settings and dynamic compliance will also be
      assessed
