    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability, determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend
      a phase II dose of the combination of MLN0128 (TAK-228) (sapanisertib) with ziv-aflibercept
      in patients with advanced cancers refractory to standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To give early indication of efficacy by evaluation of tumor size. II. To evaluate v-akt
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin
      (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) signaling and adaptive responses; testing phosphorylation
      levels of biomarkers such as, but not limited to, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1
      and 2, AKT and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)
      following treatment with MLN0128 (TAK-228) and ziv-aflibercept in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and biopsy samples during expansion cohort.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-4, 9-11, 16-18, and 23-25
      and ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
