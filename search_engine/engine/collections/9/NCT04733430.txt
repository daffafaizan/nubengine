      targeted therapies, has markedly changed the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for this
      tumor entity, leading to improved outcomes for patients with metastatic NSCLC.

      The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) allows for detection of a multitude of different
      druggable mutations. In absence of a curative treatment approach and a druggable mutation the
      prognosis of lung cancer remains poor.

      Thorough knowledge of the treatment reality, e.g. characteristics, diagnostic, treatment and
      outcome of unselected patients in real-Iife practice, is crucial to evaluate and improve the
      quality of care for patients with lung cancer.

      The purpose of this project is to set up a clinical platform to document representative data
      on molecular testing, sequence of systemic treatment and other treatment modalities, and
      course of disease in patients with lung cancer. A particular focus is on molecular biomarker
      testing and NGS of patients before the start of first-line treatment. The data shall be used
      to assess the current state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that can
      be improved.
