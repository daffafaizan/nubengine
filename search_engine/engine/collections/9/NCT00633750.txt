      Primary

        -  To determine the in situ antitumor effect of neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride as
           measured by a reduction in Ki67 and/or an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl
           transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive
           tumor cells in patients with treatment-naive, operable breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To identify a molecular profile, based on measurements of Estrogen Receptor (ER),
           Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), and a Human Epithelial Growth Factor
           Receptor-2(HER2), and protein expression profiles in patients with treatment-na√Øve,
           operable breast cancer that is responsive to erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  To correlate tumor concentrations of erlotinib hydrochloride with serum levels
           immediately before surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 5-14 days. Patients then undergo
      surgical resection within 24 hours after the last dose of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and during surgery for correlative laboratory
      studies. Tissue samples are stained for ER, HER2, and EGFR levels, proliferation (Ki67), and
      apoptosis (TUNEL) by immunohistochemistry. Levels of erlotinib hydrochloride in tissue
      samples are measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Blood
      samples are collected on the day of surgery. Levels of erlotinib hydrochloride in blood
      samples are measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

      Patients are followed within 6 weeks after surgery.
