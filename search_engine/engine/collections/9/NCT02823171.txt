    
      This study will be a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment
      sequence crossover study to determine the bioequivalence of pacritinib following
      administration of 400-mg doses of P3CT (Reference) and FMI (Test) formulations and to
      characterize the PK of pacritinib.

      Each subject will receive 2 treatments (a 400-mg oral dose of four 100-mg pacritinib P3CT
      [reference] formulation capsules and a 400-mg oral dose of four 100-mg pacritinib FMI [test]
      formulation capsules) in a 2-period crossover design. Each treatment will be administered as
      monotherapy during 1 of 2 treatment periods. A 9-day washout will separate the 2
      administrations of study medication. Subjects will remain confined to the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) throughout the study for safety observation and PK blood sample collection
