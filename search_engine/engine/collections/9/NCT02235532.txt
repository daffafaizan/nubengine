      toothpastes have recently gained attention. This study aimed to assess the effects of Aloe
      Vera toothpaste on dental plaque and gingivitis.

      This single-blind cross-over clinical trial was conducted on 20 dental students (10 males and
      10 females with a mean age of 24.5Â±4 yrs.) with gingivitis. Students were randomly divided
      into 2 groups. The first group used Aloe Vera toothpaste for 30 days and then their plaque
      index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were recorded. A 2-week wash-out period was allowed and
      then subjects used fluoride toothpaste for the next 30 days and underwent PI and GI
      assessment again. This order was reversed in group 2. Wilcoxon-Sign Rank and two way Repeated
      Measure ANOVA tests were applied for statistical analysis.
