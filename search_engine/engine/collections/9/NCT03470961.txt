      globulins(ATG). To investigate the efficacy and safety of polyclonal antibodies induction
      regimen using Grafalon compared with ATG in de novo simultaneous pancreas kidney transplant
      recipients. The primary analysis of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the
      two regimens with regard to efficacy, defined as failure rate.

      The secondary objective of the study is the assessment of safety and further efficacy
      parameters in terms of incidence of acute rejections, graft/patient survival, DGF(delayed
      graft function), pancreas function and renal function
