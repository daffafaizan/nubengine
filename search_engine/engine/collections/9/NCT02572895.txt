      are promoted for prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) on the basis of their content
      of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) with "A-type" interflavan bonds. Several clinical
      trials have assessed efficacy of cranberry-derived products, essentially with cranberry
      juices, but discordant results have been found. Lack of compliance but mostly lack of
      standardization in product concentrations can account for the variability among results.
      Indeed, most clinical trials do not report quantity of PACs. According to most recent
      studies, quantification of PACs requiring standardized and reproducible methods should be at
      least 37 mg/day. It can be hypothesized that efficacy of cranberry extract in UTIs prevention
      among young women can be strongly increased using optimal dosage (standardized to 37 mg/day
      of PACs). The purpose of this clinical trial study is to assess, among young and sexually
      active women presenting recurrent UTIs, efficacy of an optimal dose of cranberry extract
      quantified and standardized to 37 mg/day of PACs, compared to a control dose quantified and
      standardized to 2 mg/day of PACs on mean number of new UTIs during a 6-month follow-up
      period.
