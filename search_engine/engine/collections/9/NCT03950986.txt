      Health Care System to increase adult immunizations uptake among veterans. The intervention
      targets patients of primary care providers (physicians, physician assistants and nurse
      practitioners) through a modification of the existing reminders in the VA electronic health
      record system.

      The intervention includes a bundled vaccination reminder for influenza, pneumococcal and TDap
      vaccines, an immunization dashboard that relays a patient's vaccination status and history,
      and talking points for providers to use in their dialogues with patients. This intervention
      was designed to mitigate potential bottlenecks to vaccination, based on conversations and
      observations with facility clinicians.

      The team will evaluate the intervention using a randomized controlled trial.
