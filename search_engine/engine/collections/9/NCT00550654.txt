      Primary

        -  To evaluate local control (defined as absence of local progression) at all treated sites
           of metastatic disease in patients with extracranial oligometastases treated with
           ablative doses of highly conformal radiotherapy delivered with helical tomotherapy.

        -  To evaluate local control at each treated site of metastatic disease in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine median time to local progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate interfraction and intrafraction motion with megavoltage computed tomography
           (CT) imaging based on site of metastasis in these patients.

        -  To compare tumor growth during systemic therapy in tumors treated with targeted
           radiotherapy vs newly developed tumors that have not been treated with radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate if treatment with hypofractionated highly conformal radiotherapy with
           helical tomotherapy can improve pain scores and decrease the need for analgesia in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histology (renal cell carcinoma vs melanoma vs
      sarcoma vs other histologies).

      Patients undergo hypofractionated highly conformal radiotherapy with helical tomotherapy once
      every other day over 5 days for a total of 3 fractions. Patients undergo megavoltage imaging
      before and after each fraction to verify the positioning of each target lesion.

      Patients complete a pain assessment questionnaire at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after
      treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
