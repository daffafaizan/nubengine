      infiltration of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of epidermal keratinocytes, and abnormal
      differentiation. Latest data estimate that the prevalence of psoriasis in adults has
      increased to 11.43%, which shows that the control and treatment of psoriasis is still
      insufficient. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the
      effective methods for the treatment of psoriasis. More and more evidences support the
      recognition of psoriasis not only affects the skin, but also suffers a chronic multisystem
      inflammation. In addition, blood-stasis accumulates in meridians, viscera and limbs to form a
      variety of syndromes with psoriasis for so long, which similar to many metabolic related
      diseases. Therefore, the method of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis has
      always been the focus of TCM treatment and prevention of psoriasis. This multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will provide high-quality clinical
      evidences for evaluating the efficacy, safety and recurrence rate of Taodan granule, a
      representative prescription for the treatment of psoriasis with blood stasis syndrome, in the
