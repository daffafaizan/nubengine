    
      Eligible patients will be initially randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of the 3 medications
      under investigation (colchicine 0.6 mg x 2/day; dapsone 150 mg/day; azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day)
      for 6 months. Endpoint is response to treatment at month 6 (stage 1).

      If the patient has to discontinue the study drug within the 6 month study period or during
      the subsequent follow-up period (up to month 12) because of a lack of response (or failure),
      flare or side effect, he/she will be randomized again to receive one of the remaining two
      study drugs (stage 2, with a 1:1 randomization ratio) for 6 months. Endpoint in this second
      stage will again be the response to treatment at 6 months.
