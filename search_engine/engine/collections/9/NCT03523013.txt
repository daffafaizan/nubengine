      controlled crossover trial". CPAP is first line golden standard treatment for Obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA). However, the overall CPAP compliance is about 50%. One of the reasons
      responsible for the poor compliance is the inadequate pressure setting initially. Therefore,
      it is crucial for us to find out the adequate pressure as soon as possible. Sleep endoscopy
      is the way to evaluate upper airway obstruction of OSA patients. Meanwhile, the investigators
      used CPAP to titrate the adequate pressure to keep upper airway open under sleep endoscopy
      guidance. While the investigators find out this adequate pressure, the investigators set this
      pressure into CPAP program, which OSA patient will use for 1 month. To compare the different
      effect of CPAP under either auto-CPAP titration pressure or sleep endoscopy guidance
      pressure, those OSA patients will use auto-titration CPAP for 1 month as well. Another
      highlight of this study is the sedative agent-dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is a Î±2
      antogonist, which cause patients sedative but less respiratory drive suppression. The
      mechanism of dexmedetomidine is more physiological for nature sleep.
