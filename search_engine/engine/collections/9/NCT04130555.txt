    
      The study will be prospective, multicentric, single-arm, observational (non-interventional)
      to evaluate the safety and performance of CELLIS Rectopexy used in rectal prolapse repair by
      ventral rectopexy.

      All evaluations will be performed and products used according to the usual practice, without
      additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment and monitoring procedure.

      The study will be conducted in France in 3 investigational centres including 55 patients
      scheduled for the repair of rectal prolapse.

      Each patient will participate in one assessment period including a screening visit, followed
      by the day of surgical procedure and a hospitalization period. Patients will return for
      ambulatory visits at Day 30 (+/- 7 days), Month 6 (+/- 2 weeks), Month 12 (+/- 2 weeks) and
      Month 24 (+/-2 weeks).

      The surgical technique used to repair rectal prolapse will be either Laparoscopic Ventral
      Rectopexy (LVR) or a robotic assisted rectopexy with the use of the da Vinci Surgical System
      (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).
