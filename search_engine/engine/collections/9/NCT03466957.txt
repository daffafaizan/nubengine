      single-institution, non-randomized, one-arm study. All patients will receive 45-50 Gy
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric-modulated
      arc therapy (IMRT/VMAT) technique, 1.8-2 Gy/fraction +/- concurrent cisplatin based
      chemotherapy. First BT with commercially available standard applicators (tandem with ring +/-
      parallel needles or vaginal cylinder) will be carried out. MRI with applicator in situ will
      be performed, high-risk clinical target volume (CTV-HR) and organs at risk (OAR) will be
      delineated and treatment planning will be conducted. In the case of large gynecological
      cancer and suboptimal target coverage at BT (V100 ≤ 90%, D98 ≤ 80%, D90 ≤ 100%, D100 ≤ 60%) a
      preplan will be performed as the basis for the 3D applicator modelling. The next BT
      application will be performed with an individually designed 3D printed applicator.
      Dose-volume characteristics of the following treatment plans will be compared: the preplan,
      the plan with standard and the plan with individual 3D printed applicator.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the improvement of dose-volume parameters
      with the use of 3D printed individual applicators in advanced gynecological cancer.
