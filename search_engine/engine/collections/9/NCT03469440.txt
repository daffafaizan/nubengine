      inadequate tissue perfusion. Recent studies have been demonstraded which the monitorization
      of continuos central venous saturation could be benneficial. There is evidence that
      monitoring continues venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) can be beneficial in patient outcomes,
      guided by ScvO2 therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in resuscitation of
      critically ill patients with sepsis and after congenital heart surgery complexa. The early
      detection and treatment of tissue hypoxia can prevent morbidity and mortality. tissue hypoxia
      may be a result of the imbalance between supply (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2). If the
      fault supply, oxygen consumption is maintained by increased oxygen extraction resulting in
      decreased central venous oxygen saturation
