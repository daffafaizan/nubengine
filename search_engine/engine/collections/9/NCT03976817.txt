      Bioprosthesis remains the substitute of choice for elderly patients. However, it may be
      associated with patient-prosthesis mismatch particularly for patients with small aortic
      annulus. Moreover, "valve-in-valve" transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become
      a suitable therapeutic option for bioprosthesis structural degeneration, especially in
      patients with high surgical risk. It is therefore of great importance to implant the widest
      bioprosthesis as possible at the first AVR. The investigators report a surgical technique
      allowing the implantation of a larger bioprosthesis in patients with small aortic annulus:
      the supra-annular aortic valve replacement (SA-AVR) above the aortic annulus. The
      investigators analyzed the postoperative outcomes of the SA-AVR technique using the Perimount
      Magna Ease (Carpentier-Edwards, Irvine, California) bioprosthesis.
