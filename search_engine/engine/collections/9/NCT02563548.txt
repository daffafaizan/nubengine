    
      Study involves dose escalation phase (completed in Nov-2016) to assess the safety and
      tolerability of PEGPEM (PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase [PEGPH20] combined with
      pembrolizumab [KeytrudaÂ®]) and to find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) ; and an expansion
      phase to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of PEGPEM in stage III b/IV NSCLC and
      relapsed/refractory GAC participants. Plan was to include approximately 51 HA-high
      participants (30 NSCLC and 21 GAC participants) in the dose expansion phase on the obtained
      RP2D from dose escalation phase of the study.
