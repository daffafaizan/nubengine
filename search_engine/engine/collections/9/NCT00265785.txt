      Primary

        -  Assess overall survival of patients with selected stage IIIB or IV bronchoalveolar
           carcinoma treated with pemetrexed disodium.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, partial and complete) in the
           subset of patients with measurable disease treated with this drug using standard RECIST
           criteria and computer assisted image analysis.

        -  Evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Perform molecular correlative studies on patient tissue to investigate potential
           predictors of efficacy. (This will not be completed as this study was closed due to poor
           accrual.)

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib
      (yes vs no).

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenous (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.
