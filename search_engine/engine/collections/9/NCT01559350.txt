      controversy. A variety of grafts and configurations are used: the right gastroepiploic
      artery,the right internal thoracic artery in situ or in a Y-graft configuration,the free
      radial artery implanted into the aorta or the left internal thoracic artery, and the
      saphenous vein graft. The influence of the type of graft to the right coronary artery system
      on clinical results remains poorly documented, and the complementary conduit of choice to
      this system has yet to be determined. No superior long-term patency rate for any of these
      grafts to the RCA has been clearly established. We have used a saphenous vein and a right
      gastroepiploic artery for the right coronary artery system.
