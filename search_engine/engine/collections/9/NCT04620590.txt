      weeks dapagliflozin treatment in T2DM patients with impaired renal function. The study
      population is as described below. The maximum duration of the study will be 62 days including
      the allowed window periods for the study (±1 day for Visit 7 at Day 13). The study will allow
      for an up to 6-week Screening and Run-in Period. The Run-in Period should always last 6 days
      for patients not on insulin but may be up to 20 days (day -20 to day -1) for patients on
      insulin. Patients on insulin may require a longer Run-in Period in order to be able to adjust
      their insulin requirements according to the caloric content of the food boxes, if needed. It
      is recommended to keep the insulin dose stable during the trial, but investigators can change
      the dose if medically required. However, it is not mandatory for the patient on insulin to
      use the entire extended Run-in Period. Based on the Investigator's judgement, the Run-in
      Period may be shortened once each patient (on insulin) has had sufficient time to adapt to
      the food boxes, and it is determined that the patient's insulin requirement has stabilised
      sufficiently to continue in the study. The study will then include a 2-week Treatment Period
      (Day 1 to Day 14) and a 5-day Follow-up Period: Day 15 to Day 19. Patients will consume food
      from standardised food boxes (with sodium content 150 mmol) starting on Day -6 (patients not
      on insulin) or Day -20 at the earliest (patients on insulin) of the study until Day 18
      (inclusive). Eligible patients will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets once daily for 14±1
      days starting on Day 1. This will be followed by a Follow-up Period of 5 days.
