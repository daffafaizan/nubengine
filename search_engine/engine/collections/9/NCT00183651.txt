      abnormally to emotional stimulation. Standard dialectical behavior therapy (SDBT) has been
      shown to be an effective treatment for borderline personality disorder. This treatment
      combines weekly group sessions, at which patients learn new ways of dealing with their
      emotions, with weekly individual sessions with a therapist to discuss their emotions. The
      study compares SDBT to both individual DBT with no skills training and DBT skills training
      with no individual therapy. The study will determine whether efficacy of standard DBT is
      reduced when either DBT skills training or individual DBT therapy is removed.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive 1 year of SDBT, DBT with group sessions but no
      individual sessions, and DBT with individual sessions with no group sessions. Participants
      are monitored for 1 year after completing their assigned therapy. Throughout the 1-year study
      and during the 1-year follow-up period, self-report scales and questionnaires are used to
      assess participants every 4 months. These scales and questionnaires measure participants'
      suicidal thoughts and attempts, treatment compliance, emotional coping skills, social
      functioning, and overall well-being.
