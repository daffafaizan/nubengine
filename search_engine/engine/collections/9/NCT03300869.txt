      information in the form of clinical sites to increase the overall patient cohorts on which
      clinical outcomes and new assisted-healthcare technologies can be assessed. Using the
      collaborative and retrospective study of types 2 and 3 SMA patients in Taiwan, the
      investigators aim to 1) characterize the correlation of genotype and phenotype, 2) correlate
      the onset, progression, management with disease outcome, 3) depict comorbidity and within
      type 2 and 3 SMA patients with different SMN2 copy number.
