    
      Participants with a blood disease or cancer that can affect their infection-fighting white
      blood cells and those who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are
      receiving immunosuppressive therapy and have or are at risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)
      are eligible for the study. These blood diseases and their treatments can weaken the immune
      system and may put individuals at high risk for a serious fungal infection of their internal
      organs or blood (invasive fungal infection). As these infections can be hard to detect early
      and can be life-threatening, many physicians believe that individuals diagnosed with these
      diseases should receive antifungal therapy to try to lower their risk of getting this type of
      infection.

      Enrollment into this study will take place in several stages (parts). The determination of
      which part a participant will be in is based on which part is open at the site at the time of
      enrollment.
