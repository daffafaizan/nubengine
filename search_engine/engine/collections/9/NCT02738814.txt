      nonirritating airway properties, has acquired widespread acceptance in children. However,
      sevoflurane has been reported to be associated with emergence agitation in children, with a
      reported incidence of up to 80%. In severe case, it cause injury to the child or to the
      surgical site and lead to the accidental removal of surgical dressings and intravenous
      catheters. In case of intense agitation with high risk of self-injury, pharmacologic
      intervention seems reasonable. Pharmacologic treatment of emergence agitation relies on the
      administration of IV sedative agents (IV midazolam 0.1 mg/kg12 or propofol 0.5 or 1 mg/kg) or
      opioid agents (IV fentanyl 1 or 2 mcg/kg). However, these treatments are empirical and were
      extrapolated from pharmacologic preventive studies performed at the end of surgery or from
      personal experience. To the investigators knowledge, there is no risk of recurrence of EA
      after a first episode. Consequently, EA is not per se a factor of increased duration of PACU
      (post-anaesthesia care unit ) stay, but sedative or opioid agents administered
      postoperatively to alleviate it might prolong this stay.

      Therefore, the investigators design a study to confirm statistically effect of propofol for
      treatment on emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric strabismus surgery
      through PAED scale. Furthermore duration of PACU stay is checked after propofol
      administration.
