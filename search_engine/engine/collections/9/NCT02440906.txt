      evidence-based "whole person" interventions that take into account clinical, environmental,
      and social risk factors and co-morbidities. Unlike more traditional didactic approaches to
      health management, WIN addresses individual behavioral, social, and economic barriers to
      health and wellness, and promotes continued engagement in achieving, internalizing, and
      maintaining healthy behaviors.

      The study is focused on non-dual eligible adult STAR+PLUS (a Texas Medicaid managed care
      program for people with chronic illnesses) members (ages 21-55) with a behavioral health
      disorder including serious mental illness (SMI - e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or
      major depressive disorder) or other behavioral health conditions (e.g., anxiety disorder or
      substance abuse). Key features of the program include the use of professional health
      navigators, working in collaboration with the three STAR+PLUS plans in the Harris Service
      Area (SA) (United-Evercare, Amerigroup, and Molina), the use of motivational interviewing
      (MI) techniques to help members develop and meet personal wellness goals, and a flexible
      wellness account for the participant to use in meeting his/her goals.
