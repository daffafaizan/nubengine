    
      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 5 as follows:

        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with
           a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.

        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 3. Subjects in Group 3 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 2 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% body mass index [BMI]).
           Group 3 will also serve as the control group for Group 1.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 4.

        -  Group 5: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 4 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% BMI).

      This study employs a staged design as follows:

        -  Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and matching healthy subjects with
           normal hepatic function (Groups 1 through 3) will be enrolled concomitantly.

        -  At least 4 subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate
           satisfactory safety and tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before subjects with
           severe hepatic impairment may be dosed.

        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and
           tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before the remaining subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.
