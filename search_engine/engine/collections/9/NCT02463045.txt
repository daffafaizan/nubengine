      non-absorbed treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is a disease of unknown cause
      characterised by inflammation of the lining of the large intestine and manifesting with
      abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. TOP1288 given rectally has a local anti-inflammatory
      action in experimental models of UC. The present study will be the first time TOP1288 has
      been given to humans and explores the safety, tolerability and how the body handles (absorbs,
      distributes and eliminates) TOP1288 and seeks evidence of the biochemical effect of the drug
      in the body. The study is in three parts: Part 1 investigates single doses in groups of
      healthy volunteers, each group dosed with an increased dose provided the drug was safe and
      well tolerated at the previous level. Part 2 investigates multiple ascending doses in healthy
      volunteers each group dosed with an increased dose provided the drug was safe and well
      tolerated at the previous level. Part 3 investigates one dose level by administering that
      dose in patient volunteers with UC. The study design is adaptive - that is after the first
      dose level in Part 1, which is predefined, the exact dose and dose-intervals can be modified
      from a pre-set plan by a Safety Review Committee in the light of the emerging results.
