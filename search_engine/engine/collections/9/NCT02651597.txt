    
      The trial will be a 3 week double-blinded, randomized, cross-over design with 3 treatment
      intervention (oatmeal breakfasts costain low, medium and high viscosity of beta glucan)
      periods separated by about 5-7 days washout period. Normoglycemic (<5.6 mmol/L) males and
      females (12 of each) of age 18-45 y with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 will be
      recruited.

      Each participant will receive each of the following breakfast foods in a random order: 1) oat
      meal containing low viscosity beta glucan; 2) oat meal containing medium viscosity beta
      glucan; 3) oat meal containing high viscosity beta glucan. The participants will be asked to
      consume one of the breakfast foods during each visit.

      Following each blood sample, appetite, physical comfort, energy/fatigue, and palatability of
      treatments will be measured by visual analogue scales (VAS).

      Glucose measurements: Capillary blood will be collected during each visit by finger prick.
      Blood will be collected at fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the first
      bite/sip of the test product according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)
      guidelines. Blood glucose will be measured in finger prick blood samples by glucose meters .

      Males will be scheduled for three sessions over 3 weeks. Women will be scheduled during the
      first two weeks of their menstrual cycle (follicular phase), once per week.

      During the wash-out days (5 - 7 days between each phase), participants can go about their
      daily activities unrestricted with the following exception: no strenuous activity or alcohol
      consumption on the days before the clinic visit. The investigators will ask that participants
      go to sleep at the same time on the days before the sessions.
