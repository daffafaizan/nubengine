      days antibiotic treatment in patients with acute common bile duct stone (CBDS) cholangitis
      after successful endoscopic biliary drainage as regards recurrence rate of acute cholangitis,
      complete stone clearance rate, morbidity and mortality associated acute cholangitis, and
      complications related ERCP procedure.

      The study will be divided patients with acute CBDS cholangitis with complete stone clearance
      into 2 groups, group (A) will be received intravenous antibiotic until the temperature is
      less than 37.8 c for 72 hours and group (B) will be received intravenous antibiotic for 7
      days, followed by oral antibiotic for 7 days, regardless of the body temperature.
