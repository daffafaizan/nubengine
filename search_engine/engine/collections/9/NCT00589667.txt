    
      Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2) will be given together on Days 1 and 15
      of a 28 day cycle in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC). Patients will not have received more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in
      the recurrent/metastatic disease setting. Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation will be
      administered per standard guidelines for pemetrexed chemotherapy.

      The primary endpoint is the objective radiologic response rate. Radiologic imaging of
      evaluable disease will take place after every 2 cycles. Patients may remain on study until
      progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.
