      using upper extremity motor assessments of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb and grip. Upper
      extremity kinematic and strength testing will be performed with the rehabilitation robots in
      measurement mode. The rehabilitation robot modules include the wrist, the planar
      (shoulder-elbow), and alternating wrist and shoulder-elbow robot. These robotic devices are
      cleared for marketing as a registered medical device under U.S. FDA regulations and are
      listed with the FDA both as an evaluation devices and as therapy devices.

      Patients will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of robotic therapy sessions or 12 weeks of
      robot therapy combined with transition to task therapy. Study interventions will occur 3
      times a week for 12 weeks. Robot therapy will consist of a progression through three robot
      modules: wrist, planar, and alternating wrist and shoulder-elbow robot. The progression will
      be sequential with four weeks of training on each robotic device. All participants will
      complete a motor activity log during this intervention phase.

      TMS is being used for physiological measurement and evaluations will be conducted with each
      participant at baseline, week one, week five, eight, and final. TMS will also occur during
      the follow-up on week twenty-four.

      Disability and depression questionnaires, upper extremity measures and evaluations of
      functional performance will be conducted during the study at baseline, and at training
      completion (visit 36). Patients will return twelve weeks after the end of the training period
      to determine whether any observed improvements persist.
