      weight loss among overweight/obese individuals with knee OA. The investigators will take
      advantage of the planned trial "Effect of liraglutide on body weight and pain in overweight
      patients with knee osteoarthritis: A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, single-centre trial" (the parent trial) in which a significant weight loss is sought
      achieved over 8 weeks by means of intensive dietary counseling and meal replacement in
      overweight/obese individuals with knee OA.

      The investigators hypothesize that weight loss is associated with a decrease in daily time
      spent physically inactive.

      Physical activity is measured using accelerometer based recordings using a wearable sensor
      that continuously records physical activity over the entire weight loss program (8 weeks).
      The sensor is miniaturised, discretely worn on the thigh, and is waterproof. Thus the
      measurements interfere minimally with the participants daily life.
