nucleic acid metabolism in the lens iii. effect of x-radiation .a previous communication reported an increased in vivo incorporationof p-32 into the albuminoid rna fraction of the rat lens 6 hours afterthe animal had been exposed to x-radiation (1,500 r) .in the present stody, the in vitro uptake of p-32 and c-14-adenine byalbuminoid, ribosomal, and soluble rna fractions of normal andx-irradiated rat lenses was measured . the rna fractions were extractedby sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.9 per cent nacl . the specific rnafractions were also hydrolyzed, chromatographed (on paper), and the ac-tivity of the individual nucleotides (as well as the specific rna frac-tions) was determined . an experiment was also performed in which thecapsules were removed (after the 3 hour incubation period) and theactivities determined in the nucleic acids extracted from the capsulesand in the three rna fractions of the remaining lens matter .the results of these experiments indicate that the incorporation ofp-32 and c-14-adenine into albuminoid rna was markedly stimulated 1 hourafter 1,500 r whole body radiation . there was no significant effect onribosomal or soluble fractions .the effect of formaldehyde and heating on x-irradiated albuminoid rnawas much less than on the albuminoid rna derived from control animals .
