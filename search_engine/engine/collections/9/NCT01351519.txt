      dose of 20mg/kg given orally 3 hours prior to surgery. Brain tumors will be resected with the
      aid of ultraviolet light to visualize the tumor. After surgery an MRI will be done to
      determine whether the tumor has been completely or partially resected. All subjects will be
      followed for safety. All subjects will be followed closely by clinical examination and by MRI
      to monitor for disease recurrence.
