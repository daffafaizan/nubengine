      antiretroviral therapies are not yet readily available to slow disease progression. There is
      compelling evidence that massage therapy may enhance immune status and alter the course of
      HIV disease. Increased immune capacity and improvement in HIV disease progression markers
      have been demonstrated following massage therapy in HIV infected adolescents and adults, even
      in the absence of antiretroviral treatments. In studies with premature newborns, increased
      weight gain, decreased stress behavior, and more optimal cognitive and motor development have
      been reported following massage treatment. This study will examine the efficacy of massage
      therapy, an affordable and potentially beneficial complementary/alternative treatment, to
      promote health and enhance well-being in HIV infected children in the Dominican Republic.

      Children will be randomly assigned to receive either massage therapy or standard
      care/friendly visits twice weekly for 12 weeks. Data will be gathered to assess acceptance,
      safety, and compliance to massage therapy and to examine whether massage treatment has
      improved immune function, developmental performance, and behavioral function.
