      dose affects neonatal outcomes in infants with RDS who are treated in the immediate postnatal
      period.

      In a research environment, the dose of surfactant is rigorously controlled, usually
      administered at a dose of 100mg/kg or 200mg/kg. In clinical practice, clinicians more
      frequently follow the 'whole vial dosing' approach, where a full vial is given aiming to get
      as close as possible to the desired dose. Reasons for whole vial use include reduction of
      waste and administration of surfactant shortly after birth where an infant's weight is
      unknown. It is unclear whether whole vial dosing leads to under-dosing or over-dosing and
      whether either situation affects outcomes.

      Information regarding the dose of surfactant delivered, and the method of administration, are
      not currently routinely recorded in the UK.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare two dosing groups (100-130 mg/kg and 170-200
      mg/kg) in terms of the proportions of infants who require mechanical ventilation within four
      days of birth.
