        -  Determine the efficacy of the combination of mitoxantrone and vinorelbine in terms of
           response rate, progression free survival, overall survival, and quality of life in
           patients with metastatic hormone refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1 and 8 and mitoxantrone IV on day 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment, prior to each course, and then at 2 months
      after study completion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
