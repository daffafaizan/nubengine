    
      This is a randomized, open label Phase II neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety
      of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus lapatinib (L) followed by abraxane (A) versus
      trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing
      breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms: arm 1,
      trastuzumab emtansine plus lapatinib for 6 weeks, followed by trastuzumab emtansine plus
      lapatinib plus abraxane for 12 weeks; arm 2, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab for six weeks,
      followed by trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel for 12 weeks. Patients will undergo
      surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. All patients will have a core needle biopsy at baseline,
      after week 6, and at the time of disease progression. Surgical specimens will be obtained
      after week 18.
