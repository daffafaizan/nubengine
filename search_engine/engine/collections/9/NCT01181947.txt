             1. This study is a post-market registry without using a control. All analyses will be
                descriptive in nature and no statistical comparisons are planned.

                Sample size

             2. There is no sample size calculation since this is not a hypothesis driven study;
                VALIANT CAPTIVIA has recruited 100 subjects and will follow these subjects through
                for approximately 36 months.

        2. Number of investigation sites and study duration

             1. 15 investigation sites in Europe and Turkey where the Valiant Captivia Thoracic
                Stent Graft System is commercially available have enrolled 100 subjects.

             2. There will be no minimum nor maximum number of enrolled subjects per investigation
                site.

             3. The sites' compliance with the clinical investigation plan will be assessed on an
                ongoing basis. In case of serious non-compliance, the sponsor may decide to stop
                subject enrolment in a site based on the assessment.
