      intra-oral photos of the lesions will be taken before and after the treatment. Resin
      infiltration technique will be performed according to manufacturer's instructions under
      rubber-dam isolation. Intra-oral photos will be taken directly after infiltration (1 day),
      and 1 week and 6 months later.

      The system of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) involving 3 color
      parameters: lightness (L), red/ green chromaticity (a), and yellow/blue chromaticity (b),
      will be used to assess the extent and durability of color and lightness changes between
      lesion and sound enamel areas before and after resin infiltration. The extent of assimilation
      and durability of effect will be assessed by comparing CIE L*a*b data collected before
      infiltration (baseline), directly after infiltration (1 day), and 1 week and 6 months later.

      The color assessments were standardized using a spectrophotometer (SpectroShade, Italy).
      Lesion areas will be measured for each time point by using an image analysis toolkit (ImageJ,
      National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.).

      Multifactorial analysis of variance with repeated measures will be used for statistical
      analyses.
