    
      Specific Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction
      intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors,
      injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged,
      drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This aim will be accomplished through
      the random selection of high-risk rural women drug users from rural jails, screening and
      assessment for high-risk behavior, and random assignment to the HIV-Ed or MI-HIV intervention
      conditions. Follow-up interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months in the community post-release will
      examine changes in high-risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will report
      significantly greater reductions in risky injection drug use practices, other drug use, and
      sex risk behaviors than women who participate in the HIV-Ed condition.

      Specific Aim 2: Examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and
      behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at
      follow-up among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This aim
      will focus on community service utilization during the follow-up period by the intervention
      and education comparison group, and how health and behavioral health service utilization
      relates to patterns of HIV/HCV risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will
      utilize more services due to increased motivation for treatment and treatment planning
      following the brief intervention.
