      Breast prosthesis can improve patient's figure externally, increase self-confidence, thus
      improving quality of life. Prospective study of different breast prostheses has not yet been
      performed in China. The objective was to understand the knowledge regarding breast prostheses
      in breast cancer patients, evaluate the quality of life of patients wearing different types
      of breast prostheses and to compare the physical and psychological effects of different
      temperature-controlled breast prostheses on patients. The investigators designed a randomized
      control study in one cancer center in Shanghai. Eligible participants were randomized into
      either intervention or control group. In the first 6 weeks of the study, self-adhesive breast
      prostheses and conventional breast prostheses were used in the intervention and control
      group, respectively. In the later 6 weeks, the breast prostheses used were switched into
      another kind. Several dimensional parameters were examined by different questionnaires at the
      end of both 6th and 12th week including scars and skin, survey of breast prosthesis
      knowledge, survey assessing the comfort and practicality of breast prostheses, quality of
      life instruments for cancer patients and body image scale. The investigators expected that
      women would be satisfied with the temperature-controlled breast prosthesis and were more
      willing to choose self-adhesive breast prostheses.
