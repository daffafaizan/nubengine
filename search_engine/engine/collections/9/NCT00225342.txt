    
      Ischaemic heart disease is one of the main complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, both in
      terms of morbidity and mortality. Reducing plasma glucose with hypoglycaemic agents has not
      been shown to improve cardiovascular mortality or morbidity. Chronic stable angina is a
      common problem in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      We postulate that in subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hba1c >7.5%), on
      metformin therapy, and chronic stable angina that the addition of the insulin sensitiser,
      rosiglitazone to control their diabetes will improve their angina when compared to the
      addition of the hypoglycaemic agent gliclazide. This hypothesis is based on the fact that
      insulin resistance is an upstream mechanism common to both conditions.

      We will randomise such patients to 3 months therapy of rosiglitazone or gliclazide for 3
      months, comparing angina status before and after by way of full Bruce protocol exercise
      testing, 24 hour ST segment analysis and angina questionnaire.
