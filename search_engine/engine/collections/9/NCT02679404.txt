      procedure and the relevant follow-up with Sorin Group aortic valve devices in accordance with
      the IFU to further evidence the safety and efficacy in a post-approval environment. All
      current and future Sorin Group aortic valve devices that have obtained CE-mark or other local
      regulatory and/or commercial approvals may be included in the registry. During the duration
      of the registry,other aortic valve replacement products or current devices might receive
      modifications and might become commercial available. This registry allows extensions for the
      inclusion of new products.

      This observational global registry is intended to collect data without requiring any
      deviation from the standard of care and IFU in each participating center. The participating
      centers shall include those patients that have provided their informed consent to participate
      in this registry following the local applicable regulations.

      The data collection shall be performed as per the local standard of care and without exposing
      the patient to any additional risk to the treatment (s)he would normally receive.

      The registry is an open-ended project:

        -  Inclusions phase: open-ended

        -  Follow-up phase: annually throughout 5 years (7 and 10 years are optional).

      The study shall be completed after the 10-year follow-up of the last patient.
