      with a history of urolithiasis are a segment of the population that can benefit from meeting
      physician-recommended fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary studies with this population
      have revealed patient interest in using various technologies (i.e., wrist-worn sensors, smart
      water bottles, mobile applications) to increase their fluid consumption but the investigators
      are not aware of any that combine multiple technologies. The investigators' long-term goal is
      to examine if just-in-time reminder notifications to drink following periods when patients
      have not been drinking will increase compliance among patients with a history of
      urolithiasis. To prepare for that study, the investigators seek to evaluate the feasibility
      and acceptability of the sipIT tools in this study.

      This study is part three of a set of studies aimed at determining the feasibility of using
      technology to increase compliance with fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary data
      included 1) a focus group of participants with a history of urolithiasis and 2) a lab study
      to examine the feasibility of using wrist-worn sensors to detect non-alcoholic drinking
      events. Data from the focus group revealed that participants are interested in using a
      variety of technologies (e.g., wrist-worn sensors, smart water bottles, mobile applications)
      to assist with increasing fluid consumption. Data from the lab study revealed that using
      wrist-worn inertial sensors to detect drinking events is feasible. Based on data from the lab
      study, an algorithm was developed to detect these drinking events and has been implemented in
      a consumer smartwatch consumer smartwatch app for just-in-time drinking detection.
