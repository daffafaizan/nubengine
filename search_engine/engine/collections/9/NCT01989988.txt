      of diabetes treatment between different gastric bypass procedures involving type 2 diabetics
      patients with BMI from 27.5 to 35 kg/m2. This program will determine the relative
      effectiveness among LMGB „ÄÅRYGB and SADJB .The primary end point including HbA1C<6.0%,
      LDL-C<100mg/dl and SBP<130mmHg at one year after surgery. Through this study, the
      investigators may understand which gastric bypass is the best for type 2 diabetic's
      treatment. The investigators also hope some new treatment modulation may be developed.
