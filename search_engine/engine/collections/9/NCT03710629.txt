      to explore clinical treatments of the NSCLC patients with different driver genes, the impact
      factors of patient survivals, and the relevance of gene types, clinical treatments, and
      distribution of gene types. The follow-up visits, interactions between the investigators and
      patients, patient questionnaires/quality of life, and other patient information will be
      uploaded via mobile APP, and webchat every three months.
