        1. To systematically measure for the first time in healthy children and adolescents the
           effects of brief bouts of exercise on:

             1. Numbers of circulating PMBCs, their subsets and key intercellular adhesion
                molecules (ICAMs).

             2. PBMC gene regulation of stress, inflammatory, and growth/repair mediators
                [including: interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
                (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I
                (IGF-I), heat shock proteins (Hsp)].

             3. Circulating (serum) and intracellular PBMC levels of key mediators by flow
                cytometry and cell culture techniques.

             4. Circulating endogenous triggers of PBMC mediator responses-soluble Hsp, IL-6, and
                F2-isoprostanes.

        2. To determine how the acute PBMC responses are altered by gender, pubertal status, body
           composition (measured by whole-body and regional DEXA), and fitness (measured by
           progressive cycle ergometry and gas exchange).

        3. To determine the relationship in healthy children and adolescents among acute PBMC
           responses to exercise, biochemical precursors of the metabolic syndrome (insulin,
           glucose, lipids), and the balance of the TH1/TH2 immune response.
