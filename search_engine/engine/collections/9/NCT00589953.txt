      placebo-controlled randomized trial from the neonatal intensive care unit at Morristown
      Memorial Hospital (Morristown, New Jersey). Subjects will be enrolled within the first 24
      hours of life and randomly assigned to receive Epo or saline vehicle placebo.

      Standard NICU care will be provided to all subjects. Serial exams, CBC-d, reticulocyte
      counts, serum Epo levels, serial HUS, and head MRI will be collected at established time
      points during the study period. At 18 to 22 months corrected age, subjects will undergo a
      neurodevelopmental evaluation assessing for cerebral palsy, Bayley Scores of Infant
      Development-II (BSID-II) Mental Development Index (MDI), BSID-II Psychomotor Development
      Index (PDI), bilateral hearing aid use, and visual impairment.
