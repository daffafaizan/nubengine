      6). Research participants with neuromusculoskeletal impairments were recruited for the study
      and consented with an approved protocol. The study was conducted during 1 visit to LTI in
      Holliston, MA . The study consists of several assessments. Participants are surveyed for
      cognitive limitations and self-assessment of difficulties in completing tasks of daily living
      by completing surveys such as the Quickdash Questionnaire [1], the Mini-Mental State test
      [2], and the McGann Feedback form [3]. Pinch strength without and with the powered orthosis
      is evaluated. A selection of functional outcome measures are performed such as the
      Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) [4], the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHP) [5], and the
      Box and Blocks Test (BBT) [6].
