    
      Study objectives are as follows: Objective 1: To assess COVID-19 perceptions, COVID-19
      vaccine confidence, projected vaccine recommendation practices, and trust in the health
      system and public health authorities among a cross-section of healthcare providers in the US
      (nurses and physicians); Objective 2: To assess COVID-19 perceptions, COVID-19 vaccine
      confidence, projected vaccine uptake, and trust in the health system, in healthcare
      providers, and in public health authorities among key at-risk subgroups in the US (minority
      populations living in the rural south); and Objective 3: To develop, tailor, and test
      COVID-19 vaccine messaging to boost vaccine confidence and trust, and COVID-19 preventive
      behavior, among at-risk subgroups in the US (minority populations living in the rural south).
      Perceptions, confidence, uptake, and trust in potential COVID-19 vaccines will be assessed
      among four identified and distinct groups via a quantitative and electronic survey and
      qualitative focus groups with key at-risk subgroups will be utilized to develop, tailor, and
      test COVID-19 vaccine messaging for at-risk subgroups.

      This study will: 1) provide important national-level data regarding healthcare provider
      vaccine perceptions, confidence, trust, and projected vaccine recommendation practices for
      COVID-19, 2) ascertain vaccine perceptions, confidence, trust, and projected uptake of
      potential COVID-19 vaccines among at-risk populations in the US, and 3) develop tailored
      messaging for at-risk populations that can be used to boost vaccine confidence and trust, and
      preventive behaviors, among these high-risk groups in the coming years. This study will help
      to inform a larger coordinated national promotion strategy and campaign that can work to
      effectively communicate with the public about potential COVID-19 vaccines.
