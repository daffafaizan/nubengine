      will compare two monitoring strategies - a classical strategy based on the practices of the
      pharmaceutical industry, and an optimized strategy based on patient's risk level - on their
      ability to produce exact data, focusing on the main quality criteria: regulatory requirements
      and scientific validity of results. Optimon is a non inferiority randomized trial.
