      conditions, such as grading/staging of chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol,
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease,
      cholestatic liver disease, as well as in elucidating the etiology of elevation in liver
      tests.1 Since it was first performed in 1883, percutaneous (PC) liver biopsy has become
      routine practice and is usually performed under the guidance of real-time imaging using
      transabdominal ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT).1,2 However, in recent times,
      liver biopsy has been increasingly performed via transgastric or transduodenal routes under
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance. The perceived advantages of performing EUS-LB compared
      to PC-LB are the ability to simultaneously assess other organs such as common bile duct and
      pancreas, access to both left and right lobes of the liver and the routine use of conscious
      sedation during EUS procedures.3 Although single arm cohort studies and retrospective
      comparative studies assessing the technical success, tissue quality and safety of these
      different liver biopsy modalities exist, currently there are no randomized trials comparing
      PC and EUS-guided LB.4-7
