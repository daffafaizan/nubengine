      intensive care units in the Grenoble Hospital Center. Every patients who underwent a
      posterior fossa craniectomy for a cerebellar hematoma at Grenoble University Hospital between
      01/01/2010 and 01/01/2020 were enrolled in this study. The main objective is to assess the
      level of disability and the quality of life of patients who have had a posterior cranial
      fossa craniectomy. The primary outcome is the mRS(Modified Rankin score) measured at least
      one year following the ICU discharge. Secondary outcomes are the mRS(Modified Rankin Score)
      measured at discharge from the rehabilitation department, the GOS (Glasgow Outcome score)
      measured at least one year following the discharge from intensive care, and the SF36 (The
      Short Form 36)from the medical outcome study, score assessing the quality of life, collected
      via phone call.
