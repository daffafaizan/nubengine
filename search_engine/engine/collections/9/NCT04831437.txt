      hypofractionation is non-inferior to the conventional treatment. We will enroll 60 eligible
      patients with cervical cancer stage IB to IIIC and randomly allocate them into the
      intervention (hypofractionation) group or the control (standard) groups. The patients in the
      intervention group will receive external beam radiotherapy(EBRT) to a total dose of 40 Gy in
      15 fractions within 3 weeks concurrently with weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin 40mg/m2
      (total of 3 cycles). Whereas, the control group will receive EBRT to a total dose of 45 Gy in
      25 fractions within 5 weeks concurrently with weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin 40mg/m2
      (total of 5 cycles). All patients from both groups will undergo high dose rate brachytherapy
      one week after completion of EBRT to a total dose of 28 Gy per 4 weekly sessions. Patients
      will be evaluated regarding early and late toxicities as described by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 at the completion of brachytherapy, and at 3
      months, 6 months, and 3 years from completion of treatment. Also, clinical response will be
      evaluated through dynamic contrast enhanced pelvic MRI 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years after
      completion of brachytherapy.
