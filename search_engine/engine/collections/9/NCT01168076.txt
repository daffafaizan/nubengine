      using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis techniques has been
      established using general purpose, scientific-grade infrared spectrophotometers under the
      90-049 UNM HRRC protocol. Now that the concept of painless, bloodless, and reagent-less
      clinical laboratory tests has been shown to be viable, the challenge is to bring this
      technology to the patients who need it. We must develop a device that is portable,
      affordable, and rugged - all while improving accuracy. We must also improve our understanding
      of the nature of glucose in whole, intact skin. Since the light beam cannot discriminate
      plasma glucose in skin blood vessels from glucose in the larger skin interstitial fluid
      space, the exact nature of the glucose in all tissue compartments contributing to the
      light-beam signal must be elucidated. The noninvasive measurement can be no more accurate
      than the reference measurement on which it was based. Finally, we have found that the
      accuracy of the noninvasive measurement also worsens as a function of time from the initial
      measurement. This effect is independent of instrumentation drift and is due to physical
      changes in the patient's skin such as variation of hydration, collagen, vascularity,
      glycation end-products, etc. To account for these sources of physiologic interference they
      must be evaluated independently and then compared to errors of the noninvasive predictions
      over time.
