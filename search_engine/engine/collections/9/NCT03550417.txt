      conducted through a review of medical records, internal respiratory databases and electronic
      hospital patient record (OACIS, HOMER & EPAS). Participants: Participants in the study will
      include all patients who have emergency service presentations or admissions to The Queen
      Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH) with new or existing bronchiectasis in 2011(Jan 1st to Dec 31st).
      This will be repeated using the same criteria in 2013. An additional year of July2016-
      Jun2017 has been added for recency of management and to assess if change occurred with
      introduction of electronic patient record. Data collection: Demographics, clinical data,
      hospital service utilization, and clinical outcomes such as exacerbation frequency and
      disease progression. All data will be extracted into a standardized data extraction form,
      which a random subset will be checked by a second researcher.Analysis of results:Demographic
      and descriptive data will be given in means + standard deviation and compared using a
      two-tailed and Student t-test. Categorical variables will be compared using chi-squared or
      Fisher exact tests, and when appropriate the Mann Whitney U test for non-parametric data.
      Statistical significance will be determined using an alpha of p <0.05. All analyses will be
      examined using SPSS software (version x). A subgroup analysis for primary and secondary
      admission diagnosis will also be performed.
