      often presents in infancy. The disease can be the first manifestation of the so-called atopic
      march, the natural progression of allergic disorders, with subsequent development of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis. Approximately 40% of the children with AD will develop asthma later in
      childhood.

      Currently, topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of atopic dermatitis; however,
      relapses are common and parents often fear possible side-effects, leading to non-compliance.
      There is increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the
      development of allergic diseases. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics,
      living micro-organisms with immunomodulatory effects, could possibly offer a new way of
      treatment of allergic disease.

      Clinical trials investigating the preventive as well as therapeutic effect of probiotics on
      atopic dermatitis show inconsistent results. Systematic (Cochrane) reviews of all clinical
      trials (about treatment of AD by use of probiotics) concluded that the probiotic strains
      studied to date are not an effective treatment for AD; however, there is great heterogeneity
      between studies since many different probiotic strains are used. Because of the known strain
      specific capacity in immunomodulatory effects, some strains might have a greater effect than
      others.

      Better results can possibly be achieved by using a selected, (in laboratory setting) proven
      modulatory multispecies probiotic mixture, containing 6 different strains.
