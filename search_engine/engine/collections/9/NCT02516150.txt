      significantly alter the anti-hypoglycemic effect of mico-dose glucagon in individuals with
      type 1 diabetes. The study will aim to quantify the effect of a blood alcohol content on the
      anti-hypoglycemic efficacy of glucagon using a hyperinsulinemic -normoglycemic clamp
      technique in volunteers with type 1 diabetes in a randomized crossover trial.
