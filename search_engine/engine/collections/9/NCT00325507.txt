      Primary:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax® injections when given as first or
           second line treatment in conjunction with subcutaneous low dose IL-2 to patients with
           locally advanced or metastatic clear cell or papillary cell renal carcinoma.

        -  To assess the immune responses induced by treatment with TroVax® and subcutaneous low
           dose IL-2.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess tumour response rates, time to progression, survival and progression free
           survival at 6, 12 and 24 months after commencement of treatment with subcutaneous low
           dose IL-2.

        -  To assess the ability of the reintroduction of low dose subcutaneous IL-2 to induce
           further disease responses or stabilisation in patients being treated with TroVax® alone.

      Study design:

      This will be an open label evaluation in patients with clear cell or papillary cell renal
      carcinoma requiring immunotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. A single dose
      level of TroVax® in combination with a clinically accepted regimen of subcutaneous low dose
      IL-2 will be tested in 25 evaluable patients and their immunological responses to TroVax®
      (antibody and cellular) will be assessed. If immunological activity is observed after two
      cycles of TroVax®/IL-2 in 70% or more of these patients, further randomised trials will be
      undertaken to determine the clinical efficacy of TroVax® in this group of patients.

      The dosage schedule of subcutaneous low dose IL-2 will be an initial dose schedule of 250,000
      U/kg/dose for 5 days in week 1 followed by 125,000 U/kg/dose for 5 days in each of weeks 2
      though 6 inclusive. There will then be a two-week recovery period before the next cycle
      commences. The dosage regimen of TroVax® will be injections given prior to the first cycle on
      two occasions (weeks -2 and 1), and one injection given at the beginning of week 4 of the
      first cycle. In subsequent cycles, booster injections of TroVax® will be given at week 1
      only, prior to commencement of subcutaneous IL-2 therapy. After the first and second cycles
      of combined treatment, patients will be evaluated by CT scan for their response to treatment.
      If their disease has progressed after the second cycle, they will be withdrawn from the trial
      if they require alternative therapy (deterioration of one level of the Karnofsky score or
      appearance of disease in a new site). If they are experiencing progressive disease that does
      not require alternative therapy or stable disease or better, they will be treated with cycles
      of TroVax®/IL-2 as described above for up to a further four cycles. The tumour status will be
      evaluated by CT scan after every cycle.

      All patients will be monitored for up to 6 cycles (48 weeks) to assess tolerability,
      induction of humoural and cellular immunity to 5T4 cell surface antigen, immune response to
      the vector, tumour response rates, survival, time to progression and progression free
      survival. Patients who are intolerant of further treatments with subcutaneous IL-2 during
      this part of the study will be withdrawn from the study.

      Patients who are still stable or experiencing a tumour response at 48 weeks will be offered
      further boosts with TroVax® without IL-2 every three months at weeks 52, 64, 76, 88 and 100.
      During this period, if disease progression recurs, two further cycles with subcutaneous IL-2
      as described above may be given in combination with TroVax® as described above with the
      objective of inducing further disease response or stabilisation.

      Following termination of all patients' participation in the trial (including those with
      progressive disease after two cycles of TroVax®/IL-2), contact will be kept by the
      Investigators with their families in order to determine the date of death.

      A total of 25 patients will be enrolled.

      Withdrawal criteria from the trial:

        1. Non-compliance with the protocol.

        2. Patient withdraws consent.

        3. Progressive disease with new sites of disease demonstrated on CT scan and/or requiring
           other cancer treatment (deterioration in Karnofsky performance score of 10% or more).

        4. Death.

        5. Serious IL-2 related adverse events or lack of tolerance to further treatment with IL-2

        6. Serious TroVax® related adverse events (DLT).

           Treatment plan and methods:

           Patients complying with the entry criteria will be invited to enter the study. After
           giving fully informed consent, patients will be subjected to a physical examination to
           document general fitness to proceed with the trial. Vital signs will be recorded.
           Performance status (Karnofsky) will be documented. At that time, metastases will be
           documented using chest, abdominal and pelvic CT scans and an MRI scan of the brain will
           be obtained. Blood samples will also be obtained for clinical pathology (10 mL; safety
           testing). A urine sample will be tested for protein and blood (safety testing). A 12
           lead ECG and echocardiogram will be obtained. This screen should not occur more than two
           weeks before treatment with TroVax® begins. If available, tumour tissue from earlier
           biopsies will be obtained and tested for the presence of tumour antigens, e.g. 5T4. CT
           scans must be compared with scans obtained within the previous three months in order to
           determine that the disease is progressing.

           therapy will be TroVax® injection every three months, on weeks 52, 64, 76, 88, 100.
           Perform physician examination on each occasion and assess Karnofsky score prior to
           injection. Obtain samples for safety testing (blood 10 mL and urine) and immunological
           evaluation (10 mL sample only for antibody testing) prior to each injection. A further
           10 mL sample for immunological evaluation will be obtained one week after each TroVax®
           injection. CT scans will be obtained at weeks 63, 75, 87, 99. At each CT scan, assess:

           If disease has progressed, recommence subcutaneous low dose IL-2 treatment (6 weeks on,
           two weeks off IL-2) at week 64, 76, 88 as appropriate and give a further 2 cycles of
           subcutaneous low dose IL-2.

           If IL-2 restarted at week 64 (76, 88), schedule is:

           Physician examination. CT scan.

           After the second cycle of IL-2, if disease has progressed and requires other treatment
           (deterioration in Karnofsky score by 10% or more, disease appears in a new site),
           withdraw patient from trial.

           If the treatment cycles with IL-2 end before week 104 and the patient is responding,
           stable or progressing but not in need of alternative therapies (Karnofsky stable, no new
           disease sites), recommence TroVax® on the original schedule (see Flow Chart). If disease
           is progressing and requires further therapy (deterioration in Karnofsky score by 10% or
           more, disease appears in a new site), withdraw patient from trial.

           Four weeks after the final treatment, all patients will, if possible, attend for a final
           follow up visit. The following will be obtained:

           Physical examination. Karnofsky score Safety testing (blood 10 mL and urine).

           All study visits must occur within +/- 3 days of the day stipulated in the protocol.

           If patients withdraw at any time during the trial, a final follow up visit, if possible,
           will be obtained four weeks after withdrawal.

           Concomitant medication and adverse events will be recorded at each visit.
