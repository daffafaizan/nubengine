      (0.9 %Sodium Chloride Solution,0.9%NaCl). The randomization sequence will be
      computer-generated, and randomization will be performed in blocks and will be stratified
      according to participating center.Dexmedetomidine and 0.9 %NaCl solution will be treated from
      10 minutes before anesthesia induction, ending in the last 10 minutes before the operation to
      complete. Cystatin C level and urine volume (but are not limited to these data) at 1,7,14
      days after the transplantation will be recorded. The participation of each patient is
      scheduled for 14 days.Investigators will research both living and cadaveric kidney
      transplants.
