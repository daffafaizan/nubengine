      acceptability of TTNS in the treatment of bladder storage symptoms in multiple sclerosis. The
      CONSORT extension for pilot and feasibility studies will be followed to standardise the
      conduct and reporting of the study. The recruitment plan is twofold: 1) Open recruitment for
      people with MS through MS Ireland's communication channels; 2) Recruitment from a convenience
      sample of people with MS who have previously participated in a qualitative study. The
      investigators will assess recruitment/retention rates, the urinary symptoms changes and the
      effect on quality of life using International classification of incontinence questionnaire -
      overactive bladder (ICIQ-OAB), 3-day bladder diary, King's Health Questionnaire and collect
      self-reported data on adherence and adverse events and acceptability of using TTNS.
