      response to treatment, socio-demographic parameters, course and family history. The
      investigators will perform a clinical trial of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in mixed
      depressive episodes of both bipolar (I and II) and major depressive disorders. METHODS: The
      study is designed as a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial evaluating
      TBS for the treatment of moderate or severe major depressive episodes with mixed features of
      patients receiving at least one first or second line pharmacological treatment for depressive
      episodes without adequate response. Ninety adult (18 to 65 yo) patients will be enrolled and
      submitted to 6-week (comprising 5 consecutive days a week sessions for the first 3 weeks and
      then 2 days a week for a further 3 week) of inhibitory followed by excitatory TBS in
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Participants will be assessed using clinical and
      neuropsychological tests before and after the intervention. The primary outcome is change in
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) score over time and across groups. Cognitive
      parameters will also be assessed with neuropsychological tests.
