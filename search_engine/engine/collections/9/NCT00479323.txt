    
      Serum 89SF is a pooled sera from individuals vaccinated with a 23 valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine collected in the late 1980s. The 89SF standard for ELISA is running
      low (2-3 year supply) and is insufficient to serve for opsinophagocytosis assay (OPA), which
      requires large volumes. The objective of this study is to immunize healthy volunteers with
      licensed polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax 23) with subsequent blood
      donation in a quantity sufficient to make reference sera. Two hundred fifty volunteer
      subjects will be recruited from a total population of up to 600. Study participants will
      include healthy men and nonpregnant females, ages 18-45. Subjects will undergo physical
      examination by a licensed clinician, subject interview, and clinical laboratory and serologic
      testing. Potential subjects must provide written informed consent and meet all eligibility
      criteria. On Day 0, subjects will receive 0.5 mL pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax 23) in the
      deltoid muscle. Volunteers will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes following immunization
      for observation of any adverse reactions. Volunteers will return to clinic in 10-35 days
      following immunization to donate 1 unit (approximately 500 mL) of blood. Volunteers will
      return for a second donation of 1 unit of blood not less than 8 weeks and not more than 14
      weeks following the first donation.
