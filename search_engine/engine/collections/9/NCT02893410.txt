      treat their MPN, were identified.

      The investigators submitted by mail or directly at the consultation a unique questionnaire
      containing 25 questions concerning patients characteristics, evaluation of observance,
      identification of side effects and own appreciation of the drug.

      After completion of the questionnaire, the patients were identified and followed to collect
      new data about thrombotic events or phenotypic evolution.
