      corticosteroids, although these studies have not consistently reported a statistical benefit
      or the benefits achieved in singletons. Nevertheless, based on the improved outcomes reported
      in singleton gestations, one course of antenatal corticosteroids is administered to all
      patients who are between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation and at risk of delivery within 7
      days, irrespective of the fetal number. Moreover, "a repeat course" of antenatal
      corticosteroids should also be considered in women who are less than 34 weeks of gestation
      who have an imminent risk of preterm delivery within the next 7 days, and whose prior course
      of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously, again,
      irrespective of the fetal number.

      The objective of the current study is to evaluate fetal outcomes in twin pregnancies
      following repeat betamethasone administration during pregnancy.
