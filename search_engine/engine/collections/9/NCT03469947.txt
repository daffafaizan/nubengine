    
      The Cal-PAT study is a multi-centered, prospective, observational cohort study. From March
      2015 to July 2017, patients â‰¥ 18-years-old who sustained blunt or penetrating trauma with
      signs of hemorrhagic shock identified were considered for TXA treatment by first responders
      in the prehospital setting and physicians in hospital. A control group was formed of patients
      seen in the five years prior to data collection cessation (June 2012 to July 2017) at each
      receiving center who were not administered TXA. Control group patients were selected through
      propensity score matching based on gender, age, injury severity scores, and mechanism of
      injury. The primary outcome measured was mortality. Secondary outcomes measured included the
      total blood products transfused, the hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and the
      incidence of known adverse events associated with TXA.
