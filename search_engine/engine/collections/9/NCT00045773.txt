      number of affected individuals. A significant subset of patients with LLD, particularly those
      with vascular depression, have abnormalities in certain parts of the brain that are evident
      on MRI scans and may be associated with poor acute and long-term response to antidepressant
      treatment. Studies have also indicated that LLD patients frequently have frontal lobe
      dysfunction. A longitudinal study with the antidepressant nortriptyline has demonstrated that
      frontal lobe dysfunction is associated with poor acute response and a greater risk for
      recurrence of LLD. However, it is not known if this finding applies to other antidepressants.
      This study will be the first clinical trial to simultaneously test the effects of specific
      brain and psychological factors on course of response, remission rate, and other measures of
      health outcomes in people with LLD.

      Participants are treated with sertraline for 12 weeks. During this period, participants
      undergo cognitive testing, MRI, electrocardiogram (EKG), and laboratory tests. Study visits
      occur every 2 weeks.
