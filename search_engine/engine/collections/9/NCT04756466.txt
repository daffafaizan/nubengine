      immune response in the elderly population, improving the immune response to a possible
      COVID-19 infection. The strain would act as an adjuvant that contributes to developing an
      effective response against the virus, and therefore there are fewer infectious symptoms due
      to this virus or, if it appears, it occurs in a milder way among the subjects who take the
      probiotic strain. Also,the investigators hypothesizes that the administration of the
      Lactobacillus may improve the immune response generated by the Covid-19 vaccine in this
      elderly population.
