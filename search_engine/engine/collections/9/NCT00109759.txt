    
      RagweedMATAMPL (tyrosine adsorbed ragweed pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl lipid A
      (MPLÂ®)) has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with
      proven type I hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified,
      detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is included in the
      product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the product and to
      enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.

      The ragweed pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient,
      an allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.

      This will be a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of RagweedMATAMPL in healthy volunteers. Fifteen (15) volunteers will be
      randomized to receive up to 4 subcutaneous injections of either increasing doses of
      RagweedMATAMPL or Placebo over 7 day intervals.
