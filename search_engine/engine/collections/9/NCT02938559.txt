      disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Existing therapies fail to produce
      complete recovery. Progress toward improving outcome must include innovations that are safe,
      powerful, inexpensive and simple (for fast and effective dissemination). The proposed
      research seeks to test one such innovation. The investigators seek to improve outcome by
      improving memory for the content of cognitive therapy (CT) sessions. CT is one of the most
      promising approaches to the treatment of MDD, yet there is room for improvement.

      It is proposed that adding memory enhancing strategies to CT may improve MDD outcome because:
      (a) MDD is often characterized by memory impairment, (b) there is evidence that the memory
      impairment is modifiable, (c) CT typically entails the activation of emotion, (d) emotion can
      impair or bias memory and (e) there is evidence that memory for the content of therapy
      sessions is poor.

      Hence, the overall goal is to evaluate if integrating strategies designed to enhance memory
      for the content of CT sessions improves treatment outcome for MDD. Cognitive support involves
      a series of specific procedures that support the encoding and retrieval stages of an episodic
      memory. It is hypothesized that CT+Memory Support, relative to CT-as-usual, will be
      associated with improved illness course and functional outcome at the end of treatment as
      well as 6 and 12 months post-treatment.
