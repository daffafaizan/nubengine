comparison of ultraviolet sensitivity of bacillus subtilis bacteriophagespo2 and its infectious dna .deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from a clear plaque mutant of thetemperate phage, spo2, was infectious when incubated with competentcultures of bacillus subtilis 168 m . the relationship between numbersof infectious centers and dna concentration was linear .the sensitivity of the infectious dna to ultraviolet light was muchgreater than that of the free phage when b. subtilis 168 m was used ashost . acriflavin, which inhibits host cell reactivation, increased therate of ultraviolet inactivation of the free phage so that it approachedthe inactivation rate of the phage dna . acriflavin had little effect onthe survival curves of the infectious dna .non-host reactivating mutants (hcr ) of b. subtilis 168 m wereisolated . the survival curves of spo2 phage were much steeper when thehcr mutant was used as a host than those obtained when the hcr parentalstrain was used as a host .ultraviolet sensitivity of the phage dna was still greater than thatof the free phage even when b. subtilis hcr was used as host, but thedifference in sensitivity was much less than the difference obtainedwith b. subtilis hcr as a host .possible explanations for the greater ultraviolet sensitivity of theinfectious dna are discussed .
