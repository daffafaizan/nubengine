      adults can be improved using interactive video game play.

      Study participation involves playing the video game Mario KartTM (provided by the study),
      while wearing a patch over their better-seeing eye. Participants are asked to play the game
      for a total of 40 hours over a one-month period.

      The primary outcome measure will be LogMAR visual acuity measured 1 month after initiating
      game play.
