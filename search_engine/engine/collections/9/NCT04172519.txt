      form of pelvic floor muscle training in patients after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. A
      randomized control trials will be carried out on a group of about 300 people (men over 40
      years of age) before and after radical prostatectomy. The examined people will be divided
      into 4 groups and will be assessed before and after surgery: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6
      months. All participants in the study will undergo tests such as: urodynamic, biochemical,
      MRI, standardized questionnaires regarding the quality of life, physiotherapeutic assessment,
      histopathological assessment, and cancer progression assessment.
