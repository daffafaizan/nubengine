    
      Adenovirus conjunctivitis is an epidemic disease registered as a common occupational disease
      for ophthalmologists and orthoptists. It can leave corneal sequelae even several years after
      infection.

      The investigation tream create a nationwide anonymous retrospective questionnaire using the
      secure internet application REDCapÂ® to build and manage the questionnaire addressed to
      ophtalmologists (interns, graduates and retirees) and orthoptists.

      Investigator collect several characteristics such as general characteristics (sex, age range,
      profession), administrative procedure declaration (occupational disease declaration, sick
      leave, cessation of surgery); infection characteristics (bilaterality, season, anteriority,
      sequels, current therapy, professional discomfort), risk factor (refractive surgery history,
      wearing of eyeglasses or contact lenses, smoking, or corticosteroid therapy).

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of these sequelae in the
      at-risk population of ophthalmologists and orthoptist. Secondary aim are to describe
      administrative procedures (occupational disease declaration and sick leave), infections
      characteristics; and risk factors such as a refractive surgery history, the wearing of
      eyeglasses or contact lenses, smoking, or corticosteroid therapy.
