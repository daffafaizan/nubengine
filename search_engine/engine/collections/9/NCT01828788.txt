    
      Prospective, controlled, randomised, parallel, single-centre, single-blinded trial, comparing
      to a control (conventional care with no locoregional anaesthesia) an infusion of ropivacaine
      through two multihole catheters placed lateral to the sternum. In both groups, postoperative
      analgesia will be achieved by paracetamol plus titrated then self-administered intravenous
      morphine.
