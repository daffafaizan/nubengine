    
      This 2-year prospective multi-centre cohort study will be conducted at chronic pain clinics
      at Women's College Hospital (WCH), Toronto Western Hospital (TWH), Toronto Rehab Institute
      (TRI), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) in Toronto, and St. Joseph's Hospital (SJH) in London, Ont.

      The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) screening
      algorithm against the results of polysomnography.The research assistants will approach all
      patients visiting chronic pain clinics for eligibility. For recruited patients, a written
      informed consent will be obtained. All recruited patients will undergo polysomnography at the
      Toronto Rehab Institute Sleep Lab or Toronto Sleep and Pulmonary Centre. An overnight
      oximetry by an oximeter will be collected. The sleep physician will review the
      polysomnography results.

      All recruited patients will also complete the STOP-Bang questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS). The thyromental distance, Mallampati classification, Friedman staging,neck
      circumference and oxygen saturation will be measured. Demographic data, co-morbidities,
      medications and an overnight oximetry will be collected.

      Patients will be assessed on their opioid-related knowledge via the Patient Opioid Education
      Measure (POEM) at the first visit. They will be educated on knowledge of opioids via
      education sheet, pamphlet and video from ISMP-Canada, and then repeat Patient Opioid
      Education Measure (POEM) 6- 8 months later during pain clinic follow up visit.
