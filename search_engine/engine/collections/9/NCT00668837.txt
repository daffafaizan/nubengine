      safety and tolerability of flexibly-dosed ER OROS paliperidone (3 to 15 mg/day) in patients
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Other measures assessed in the extension study included:
      change in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score; change in PANSS
      subscale (positive and negative) scores; overall functioning, as measured by the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S); personal and social functioning, as measured by the
      Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP); and quality of life parameters, as measured by
      the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4). Paliperidone ER OROSÂ® tablet
      formulation (3 to 15 mg/day) to be taken orally for 52 weeks
