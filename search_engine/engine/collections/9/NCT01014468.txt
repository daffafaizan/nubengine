      age-related macular degeneration who were treated with at least two (initial and one month
      after) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and had a
      follow-up of at least 3 months. Patients underwent Snellen visual acuity testing, optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and ophthalmoscopic examination at baseline and follow-up
      visits.
