      arthritis patients.

      Approximately 270 subjects will be participating in this trial, at approximately 25 centers
      in the United States. Patients will be eligible to participate in this study if hemoglobin
      (Hb) is <=11.0 g/dL. The hypothesis is that PROCRIT improves fatigue scores in rheumatoid
      arthritis patients with anemia of chronic disease. If a patient chooses to participate,
      he/she will be randomized to receive either PROCRIT or placebo on a weekly basis starting at
      20,000 units per injection (up to a maximum of 40,000 units).
