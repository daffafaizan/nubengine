      ranging from 2.7 % to 6.8 %. This disease of the rotator cuff tendons is characterised by
      calcifications in the tendons, most commonly in the supraspinatus tendon up to 82%. The
      aetiology remains unclear.

      Calcifying tendinitis is regarded as a self-healing condition with usually spontaneous
      resolution of the calcifications. But some patients have chronic or recurrent pain and
      disability of the shoulder which requires treatment. The treatment should be minimally
      invasive and effective in short and long term. Symptomatic treatment is indicated first using
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise and non ultrasound guided
      subacromial corticosteroids injection.

      The role of corticosteroid injections is unknown due to the lack of good studies. Family
      doctors and orthopaedic surgeons inject corticosteroids in the shoulder without the guidance
      of ultrasound; with this method accurate needle placement in the subacromial bursa is not
      possible. When this treatment fails other therapeutical methods can be used. Ultrasound
      guided needling is a percutaneous technique of fragmentation or extraction of calcifications
      in the rotator cuff tendon.

      Literature shows favourable results but only a few randomized controlled trials were
      executed. Randomised controlled trials are needed to give more insight in the effectiveness
      of us guided needling. Comparing two groups of patients treated with us guided corticosteroid
      injection and one group combined with us guided needling can provide information of the
      usefulness of us guided needling.
