      disequilibrium; headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, if they become obtunded, have visual
      impairments or cramps. Accordingly patients were divided into 2 groups; the "DDS group" of
      patients who experienced one of the DDS symptoms of headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,
      become obtunded, have visual impairments or cramps and patients who do not experience any of
