    
      Patients will be invited to participate before surgery, the inclusion criteria will be
      revised and the informed consent will be signed.

      In the operating room will be recorded demographic data and relevant background such as: Age,
      Weight, Size, BMI, Lean Mass, Fat Mass and Total body water among others.

      Afterwards, in the operating room, the patient will be monitored regularly: ECG (DII) if
      feasible and pulse oximetry. An arterial catheter will be installed for monitoring and taking
      blood samples during the intraoperative period.

      In addition, the EEG will be monitored through a frontal electroencephalographic monitoring
      (BIS) system; that will be recorded throughout the surgery.

      The anesthetic induction will be with propofol and remifentanil. The propofol will be
      administered using an initial bolus of 1-2 mg / kg according to the criteria of the
      anesthetist and then a continuous infusion of 10 mg / kg / hr that will be adjusted adjusted
      to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60.

      Plasma samples of propofol: arterial samples of 3-4 ml will be taken at 2, 5, 10, 30, 60
      and/or 120 min after beginning the administration of propofol. Subsequently samples will be
      taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 min and at 6-12 hrs after stopping the infusion of
      propofol. The samples will be centrifuged and stored at -20 Â° C until analysis by HPLC.
