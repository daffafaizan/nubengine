      for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, the considerable number of esophageal cancer
      patients received operation as the first treatment modality. Accordingly, postoperative
      treatments have been playing an important role because of the poor survival rates of the
      patients who have been treated with resection alone. The existing data shows that the 5-yeal
      survival rate of stage T2-3N0M0(UICC 7th edition) of thoracic esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma(TESCC) after surgery is about 50% ,and locoregional lymph nodes metastases is
      responsible for the main cause of failure while distal metastases account for relatively less
      ratio. Therefore, the subclinical residual tumor is affirmative even if the early disease has
      been undergone curable excision and local adjuvant treatment may be essential. While we have
      proved the value of prophylactic radiation therapy after radical esophagectomy for esophageal
      carcinoma with positive lymph node metastases and stage â…¢ disease, there is still lack of
      clear evidence for prophylactic radiation therapy in stage T2-3N0M0 disease now. The
      comparison of conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy after operation versus surgery alone
      does not show statistically significant difference for stage T2-3N0M0 disease in our previous
      report. In the precise radiotherapy setting, more and more evidences of non-randomised
      control study indicate the trend or preliminary results of dosimetric advantages of IMRT
      translating into substantive benefits in both survival and locoregional control compared with
      3- dimensional conformal and 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy for the treatment of
      esophageal carcinoma, but it remains to be confirmed in the randomized control study that
      whether the IMRT is effective to improve the clinical outcomes of stage T2-3N0M0 patients of
      TESCC. In view of this, we designed the randomized controlled trial to determine the clinical
      efficacy and toxicity of prophylactic IMRT after surgery in stage T2-3N0M0 disease of TESCC.
