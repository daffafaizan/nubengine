      targets the family and peer contexts of overweight children. 23 rural schools were identified
      for participation (schools within a 90-mile radius of the PI's campus were targeted) and each
      was assigned to one of five intervention conditions using stratified random sampling, with
      stratification based on proximity to each other (to avoid spill-over effects) and proportion
      of Native American Indian students. A community sample of 1186 1st grade children, their
      families, and their teachers were successfully recruited. Anthropometric assessments were
      conducted with the 1186 children. Those who were not at Control schools were invited to
      participate in the intervention. 541 children qualified for the intervention (i.e., had BMI%
      > 75%), including 459 at Intervention schools and 82 at Control schools. Intervention
      conditions were (1) a 12-week Family Food & Lifestyle intervention (FL), aimed at improving
      family nutritional intake, activity levels, weight perception, and parental monitoring of
      child eating; (2) a 12-week Family Food & Lifestyle and Family Dynamics intervention (FL+FD)
      that additionally targets dysfunctional family patterns such as high conflict, poor
      parent-child communication, and parental over-control or permissiveness; and (3) a Peer Group
      (PG) intervention conducted throughout one semester of the school year that includes a
      guidance-type curriculum sensitizing children to the importance of social inclusion of all
      children. Thus, 5 treatment groups were evaluated in the intervention year and followed
      through 4th grade: FL, FL+FD, FL+PG, FL+FD+PG, and Control. Child psychosocial variables such
      as emotional eating, self-esteem, loneliness, and social withdrawal will be analyzed as
      mediators between family/peer contexts and child overweight.
