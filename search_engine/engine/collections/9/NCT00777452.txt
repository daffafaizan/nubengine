      cancer. Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with active surveillance,
      radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound were
      included. All men completed the questionnaires of Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) (version 4), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after
      treatment.
