    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the
      LEP-F1 + GLA-SE vaccine. The vaccine consists of the recombinant four-antigen Mycobacterium
      leprae antigen LEP-F1 in combination with the adjuvant formulation GLA-SE (Glucopyranosyl
      Lipid A - Stable Emulsion) and is being developed for the prevention of leprosy disease. This
      is a first-in-human study and will be conducted in healthy adult subjects. Two dose levels of
      the vaccine (2 μg LEP-F1 + 5 μg GLA-SE and 10 μg LEP-F1 + 5 μg GLA-SE) will be given by
      intramuscular administration on study Days 0, 28, and 56.
