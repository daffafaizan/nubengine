    
      Recurrent high grade glioma with dDDR, defined by genomic aberrations associated including
      IDH mutation, PTEN mutation and "BRCAness" signature as defined by next-generation-sequencing
      (NGS) based comprehensive genomic profiling, will be enrolled.

      Patients will receive treatment in 7-day cycle. D1-4: Oral talazoparib 0.75mg daily; D1:
      Carboplatin (AUC 1.5). On cycle 1 day 1 low dose whole radiation radiation therapy will be
      given to increase drug penetration. Primary outcome is 6-month progression free survival
      (PFS-6) by RANO criteria. The study intended to recruit 33 subjects
