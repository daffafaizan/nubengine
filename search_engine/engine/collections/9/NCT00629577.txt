        -  Classify cervical cancer progression at a molecular level using gene expression
           profiling generated from expression microarrays.

        -  Profile gene expression changes of dysplasia and early carcinoma of uterine cervical
           tissue at a molecular level using expression microarrays.

        -  Define a set of genes that classify the various grades of cervical cancer/dysplasia at a
           molecular level.

        -  Compare the expression profiles of clinical data to determine how accurately cell lines
           model the in vivo environment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo colposcopy and a cervical smear is taken for flow cytometry
      analysis. Patients also undergo 2 biopsies from one clinically abnormal or normal site.
      Tissue samples are analyzed by gene expression profiling using human expression microarrays
      containing approximately 40,000 unique sequences. Data analysis consists of defining a set of
      genes, containing new targets for biomarkers, that classify the biopsies into 3 grades.
