    
      pregnancy and postpartum period are associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. this
      risk is further increased in women with thrombophilia.

      This risk is higher in the postpartum period compared with pregnancy period, especially the
      risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). The American College Of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, The
      American college of chest physicians and The Royal College of obstetricians and gynecologists
      recommend using low molecular weight heparin during the postpartum period in women with
      thrombophilia and women with risk factor for developing thromboembolism. there is no specific
      guidelines regarding the best protocol based on the level of anti-10 a.

      This study will compare between two protocols based on anti-10a levels.
