      the internal one opens in anal canal. And according to relation between fistula and anal
      sphincters there are intersphincteric, transphincteric, suprasphincteric and
      extrasphincteric. Varieties of surgical procedures are encountered for management of this
      disease but complications such as recurrence and incontinence still facing surgeons strongly.
      In previous study of total 31 patients post-operative complications were; incontinence of gas
      (16.13%), incontinence of stool (3.23%), recurrence (3.23%) with conclusion of that: outcomes
      of fistulotomy with cutting seton were satisfactory in most patients (1). In this study and
      aiming to reduce the complications rate data will be collected about the outcomes of combined
      partial fistulectomy or fistulotomy and cutting seton procedure in a prospective study. The
      goals of treatment are draining infection, eradicating the fistulous tract and avoiding
      persistent or recurrent disease while preserving anal sphincter function.
