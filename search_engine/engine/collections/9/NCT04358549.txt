      favipiravir in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19. Subjects will be randomized within their
      study site and stratified by the severity of their disease to receive either favipiravir +
      standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone.

      The dose regimen will be 1800 mg favipiravir BID plus SOC or SOC alone on Day 1 followed by
      1000 mg BID favipiravir (800 mg BID for subjects with Child-Pugh A liver impairment) plus SOC
      or SOC for the next 13 days.

      The study will have 14 days of treatment and 46 days of follow-up.

      Approximately 50 patients are planned to be enrolled in the trial at approximately 8 study
      sites in the US.
