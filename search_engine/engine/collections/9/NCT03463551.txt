      drugs after a stroke. Being able to visualise potentially rescuable brain tissue on scanning
      may allow more people to be treated. Currently available methods require extra time to
      acquire and are not therefore widely used. By carrying significant extra oxygen to the brain,
      the ABL-101 molecule may not only allow the visualisation of salvageable tissue, but also
      prevent progression of stroke damage in and have an additional direct benefit on tissue
      survival. Studies in animal models of stroke show smaller areas of stroke damage after
      ABL-101. There is therefore a rationale for testing this molecule in stroke patients, both as
      a diagnostic method, and also as a potential therapeutic agent.
