      Papillary Bleeding Index will be recorded. Gingivitis subjects will be asked to rinse with
      Camellia sinensis mouthwash or placebo mouthwash. VSC level will be measured at 30 minutes
      and 3 hours post-rinsing. For the following 4 weeks, subjects will be rinsed with the
      assigned mouthwash twice daily after toothbrushing. All parameter will be recorded again at
