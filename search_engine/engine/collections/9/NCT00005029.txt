      platinum sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the nature
      and degree of toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment continues every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
