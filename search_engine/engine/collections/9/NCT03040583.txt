      disease is characterized by disabling dryness, fatigue and pain, and systemic complications
      in 30% of patients. No treatment has proven effective in this disease. The previous or
      present systemic complications included skin, articular, lung, kidney, peripheral and central
      nervous system, muscular involvement and vasculitis, as well as lymphoma occurrence were
      recorded. For previous lymphoma, the diagnosis and the histological subtypes were confirmed
      by reanalysis of the medical and histological records. The objective of this cohort was to
      assess systemic complications (signs) and evolution of patients with pSS and to determine the
      evolution and factors predictors of lymphoma of systemic complications and lymphoma in pSS
      during a 20-years prospective follow-up. This cohort was successful in rheumatology field,
      395 patients was recruited for 2 years in 15 French centers (10 rheumatology and internal
      medicine 5) and followed for 5 years until July 2014.

      The primary objective of this cohort is to assess the evolution of Primitive Sjogren Syndrome
      patients and to determine predictors factors of lymphoma and systemic complications during a
      20-years prospective follow-up.
