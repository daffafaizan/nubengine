      omega-7 fatty acid decreases the serum biomarkers of inflammation, i.e. highly sensitive
      C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha and IL-6 of participants who have been experiencing decreased
      quality of life (QOL) and having elevated these serum markers. The study is
      placebo-controlled and conducted in a double blinded manner. Participants will be crossed
      over on supplements (active and placebo) in a random sequence. The total length of a trial is
      six weeks in which the participants will be asked to maintain stable diet. The baseline blood
      draw, physical exam, range of motion, QOL and dietary assessment and taking vitals are
      performed. After the blood test results and/or QOL assessment confirm the eligibility, three
      weeks supply of the investigational supplement will be mailed or picked up in person. The
      supplementation is one gel-capusule a day for three weeks. At the end of three weeks, another
      blood draw, physical exam, range of motion, and QOL assessment are conducted; then the other
      investigational supplement will be provided. The assessment of the second supplement will
      occur after another three-week mark. If no adverse reaction is observed and there is no
      concerns, the participant will be exited from the study.

      The goal of enrollment is 50 participants who are between 18 to 99 years old with decreased
      quality of life and potentially elevated serum markers of inflammation. Volunteers will be
      randomized by a block of four so at any given moment, one group does not exceed more than
      three participants. The study takes place at Kenmore campus.
