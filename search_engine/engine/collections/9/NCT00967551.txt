      Department of Pediatrics, Universidade Federal Da Bahia, Salvador-Bahia, Brazil over a period
      of 18 months. This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving the use of 2 types of
      micronutrient sprinkles in a group of 120 children who attend a day care center in Salvador,
      Bahia. They will be randomized into 2 groups of 60 children each. The intervention group will
      receive sprinkles containing zinc while the control group will receive micronutrient
      sprinkles without zinc. The primary outcome variables of interest are zinc status, stool zinc
      losses and diarrhea duration. Both groups of infants will be monitored at monthly intervals
      for an initial duration of 180 days for zinc status, diarrhea episodes, respiratory illness
      and growth. This study will allow for the establishment of a cohort of children who will be
      monitored in a micronutrient supplementation trial using sprinkles.
