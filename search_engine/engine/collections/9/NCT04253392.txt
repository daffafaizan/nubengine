      Reflux Disease is sponsored by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. This is a post-market prospective,
      multi-center, observation, single arm, long-term safety surveillance registry of subjects
      implanted with the LINX device. Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled and implanted at up to 50
      centers in both the US and selected countries outside the US with regulatory approval for the
      LINX Reflux Management System. The study will collect data from patients 10 years post
      implant. The primary objective of the study is to confirm the long-term safety profile of the
      LINX device and procedure (implant/explant). Secondary objectives include Effectiveness,
      Health Economics and Health Utilization.
