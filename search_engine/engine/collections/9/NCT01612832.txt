    
      Hypothesis:

      No studies considered the comparison of pre-emptive and post-incisional or post-surgery PGL
      administration. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of PGL preemptively
      would diminish pain sensation, and therefore the need for pain administration in
      neurosurgical patients, better than postoperatively. In addition, preoperative administration
      could reduce the level of anxiety in these patients.

      It should be stressed that this study will used a placebo controlled group and at availuating
      placebo related psychological effective treatment versus a central efficacy of Lyrica

      Objectives:

      To assess the beneficial preemptive and preventive effects of PGL on the immediate and late
      (1- and 3 months) postoperative analgesia requirements and pain scores in neurosurgical
      patients.
