      racial/ethnic disparities in underserved communities. An inherited blood disease, Sickle Cell
      Disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic and acute illness and reduced quality of life
      (QOL). It affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is
      the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves QOL. Poor
      adherence is common among youth and young adults with SCD.

      The importance of poor medication adherence, use of community-based health workers (CHWs) to
      bridge the gap between health services and underserved parent-youth dyads affected by SCD,
      the strength of the science, the success of the investigators' multi-ethnic feasibility
      study, and the potential application of study findings to youth with other serious chronic
      illnesses speak to the importance of this trial.
