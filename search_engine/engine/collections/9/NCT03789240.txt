    
      Background:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) with a
           highly variable clinical course across patients

        -  Standard frontline therapy for FL includes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with or
           without chemotherapy that can induce durable remissions but is generally not curable

        -  The 20% of patients who relapse within 2 years of frontline chemotherapy have an
           inferior overall survival; molecular profiles and gene-expression signatures can
           identify patients at high-risk of early treatment failure but are incomplete and require
           further validation

        -  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is critically important in FL; agents that
           target PI3K show good clinical activity in patients who relapse early after chemotherapy

        -  Copanlisib is an intravenous therapy targeting both PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms
           and is FDA-approved for use in adults with relapsed and refractory FL

        -  Induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab may produce deep and durable remissions
           in patients with FL without the use of cytotoxic agents

        -  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising modality for monitoring therapy

      Objective:

      - To determine the complete response (CR) rate after copanlisib and rituximab as induction
      therapy for patients with untreated follicular lymphoma

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed stage II-IV follicular lymphoma, grade 1-2 or 3a
           that meet criteria for initiation of systemic therapy

        -  No previous systemic therapy; prior local radiation permitted

        -  ECOG performance status 0-2

        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function

      Design:

        -  Phase 2 study of up to 65 patients with untreated FL who meet standard criteria for
           treatment

        -  Patients will first be treated with a window of copanlisib monotherapy, followed by
           induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab for up to 6 cycles

        -  Patients who achieve a CR after 6 cycles of induction therapy will stop treatment and be
           monitored with computed tomography (CT) scans and plasma assays for circulating tumor
           DNA (ctDNA). Patients who relapse > 6 months from the end of induction can be re-treated
           with 6 additional cycles of copanlisib and rituximab

        -  Patients who achieve a partial response after 6 cycles of induction therapy will receive
           an additional 6 cycles of extended induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab

        -  Patients who do not achieve at least a partial response after 6 cycles of induction
           therapy will stop treatment and be monitored with CT scans and peripheral blood assays
           for ctDNA

        -  Patients who progress or relapse after induction therapy and meet criteria for salvage
           therapy will be treated with standard chemotherapy and a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody
