      The study consisted of 3 periods: screening, double vaccination with an interval of 3 weeks
      and follow-up.

      All eligible subjects were randomized into the study in appropriate cohort groups
      sequentially. Randomization was performed within each cohort in ratio 2:1 to the vaccine and
      placebo groups, respectively:

        -  Cohort 1 (total 30 volunteers) - 20 volunteers received the vaccine twice, 6.7 log
           EID50/dose; 10 volunteers received Placebo twice.

        -  Cohort 2 (total 30 volunteers) - 20 volunteers received the vaccine twice, 7.7 log
           EID50/dose; 10 volunteers received Placebo twice.

      The decision to administer the second dose of vaccine or increased vaccine dose (cohort 2)
      was approved by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on the basis of preliminary safety
      results assessment.

      The follow-up period lasted 3 months after the second vaccination.
