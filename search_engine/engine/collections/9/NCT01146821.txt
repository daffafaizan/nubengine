      mortality of critically ill patients with severe sepsis. However, prior to such a large
      trial, we need to determine the optimal dose of IV fish oils in this population. Therefore,
      the primary objective of this proposal (FOILED) is to determine the safety and efficacy of IV
      fish oil doses of 0.20 g/kg and 0.50 g/kg, compared to a control group, in critically ill
      patients with severe sepsis by examining organ function, blood safety and biochemical
      parameters, markers of systemic inflammation and innate immunological parameters.

      Study Design: This is a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose ranging clinical trial with
      prospective controls.

      Setting: 2 tertiary care ICUs in Germany (UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden and
      University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen).

      Patients: Mechanically ventilated adult patients (>18 years old) admitted to ICU with
      clinical evidence of sepsis, sepsis associated organ dysfunction, and high expression of
      inflammatory cytokines.
