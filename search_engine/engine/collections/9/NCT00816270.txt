      Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) and Octyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Dermabond) was also studied for
      cosmetic blepharoplasty with satisfactory results. Liquid Bandage (Johnson & Johnson,
      Skillman, NJ, USA) is a more flexible formulation of octyl-2-cyanoacrylate available in many
      american drugstores for home use. Animal models shown that this product could accelerate the
      healing of lamellar wounds and studies in humans have demonstrated its safety and
      effectiveness as an occlusive protective film over cuts, abrasion and wound surgery. Liquid
      Bandage was also used as a temporary wound barrier in clear corneal cataract surgery with
      satisfactory applicability. There is no study in the literature using this device in
      blepharoplasty yet.
