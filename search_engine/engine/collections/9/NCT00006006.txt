      I. Determine the feasibility and activity of thalidomide in patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity of thalidomide in these patients. III. Assess the use of interferon
      alfa in patients who develop disease progression while being treated with thalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Patients on a stable dose of thalidomide for at
      least 4 weeks with evidence of progressive disease receive interferon alfa subcutaneously
      twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression after initiation of
      interferon alfa therapy or unacceptable toxicity.
