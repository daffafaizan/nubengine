    
      This multi-center, randomized, open-label study is designed to compare the safety and
      efficacy of therapy with Zevalin regimen versus Zevalin and motexafin gadolinium in patients
      with rituximab-refractory, low-grade or follicular NHL. Approximately 100 adult patients will
      be enrolled in the study (approximately 50 in each group at 15 clinical sites in North
      America).

      Patients will be screened for eligibility within the 14 days prior to Day 1 of the study.
      Once written informed consent has been obtained and patient eligibility has been established,
      the patient will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Zevalin or Zevalin and motexafin
      gadolinium.

      Patients will be assessed for safety at each visit to the study center and for disease
      response at Months 3, 6 and 12. An end-of-study-visit will be performed at Month 12.

      Disease status will be assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/CT, and/or
      flow cytometry. Disease response will be evaluated in accordance with the standardized
      definitions and criteria of the International Working Group Revised Response Criteria for
      Malignant Lymphoma. The efficacy endpoints that will be assessed are complete response rate
      and overall response rate.

      Safety will be assessed by adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical
      laboratory assessments. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-emergent adverse
      events(TEAEs) will be collected for all patients beginning on Day 1 and continuing through
      the end-of study-visit to be performed at Month 12 or withdrawal from study.
