      therapy with eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral coping skills therapy (MET+CBT). A
      contingency management procedure will be added to this intervention, providing reinforcement
      for completion of homework, as verified by call-ins to an Interactive Voice Recording (IVR)
      system. Outcomes will be compared to an MET+CBT intervention in which reinforcement will be
      provided for marijuana-free urine specimens, and to a control group that receives Case
      Management. Recruitment of 234 marijuana-dependent participants will occur over a three-year
      period. They will be randomly assigned to one of the three 9-session interventions. Treatment
      will be individual, manualized, and provided on an outpatient basis. Pretreatment assessments
      will obtain baseline data; follow-up assessments at three-month intervals for one year will
      evaluate marijuana use outcomes, other drug or alcohol use, and psychosocial functioning. It
      is anticipated that the intervention in which completion of homework is reinforced will
      result in the best outcomes. The mechanisms by which the interventions result in behavior
      change will be the specific focus of attention in this study.
