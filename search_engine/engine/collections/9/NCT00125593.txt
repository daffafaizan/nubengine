      which aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of reducing LDL cholesterol in more than 9,000
      patients with chronic kidney disease (about 3,000 of whom were on dialysis at randomization).

      Patients were randomly assigned to simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus
      matching placebo (a subset of these patients had previously received simvastatin 20mg only
      and were then randomly re-assigned to receive simvastatin 20mg plus ezetimibe 10mg or placebo
      at one year). Details of the SHARP trial design and methods have been reported previously
      (reference: Am Heart J 2010; 160:785-94.).

      SHARP was overseen by an independent Steering Committee that included nephrologists,
      cardiologists, clinical trialists, and statisticians, with 2 non-voting observers from the
      main funder (Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals). The independent sponsor was the
      University of Oxford, and the trial was funded by Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, the
      Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation and the
      UK Medical Research Council.

      In October 2009, the Steering Committee decided (blind to the effects of study treatment on
      clinical outcomes) to change the original protocol-specified primary outcome to a revised key
      outcome of major atherosclerotic events, defined as the combination of non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, coronary death, ischemic stroke, or any revascularization procedure (i.e.
      exclusion of non-coronary cardiac deaths and strokes confirmed to be hemorrhagic from the
      original major vascular event outcome). These and other changes are described in the revised
      statistical analysis plan for SHARP (reference: Am Heart J 2010; 160:785-94.). Accordingly,
      the chief emphasis of the published results (reference: Lancet 2011; 377:2181-92) is on the
      revised pre-specified key outcome of first major atherosclerotic events.
