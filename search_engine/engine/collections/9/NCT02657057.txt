      and TENS SNS have been proven effective modifying bladder diary scores (change in the
      frequency of day and night urination, and urge incontinence), and improving subject's quality
      of life. Only PTNS has shown changes in urodynamic data while undergoing therapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that short-term effectiveness and benefit reported, is not
      lower in the TENS group, if we compare both therapies in a randomized control trial.

      Secondary goals are to evaluate changes in bladder diary scores (frequency of urination,
      nocturia, number of urgency and leakage episodes ), participants quality of life improvement
      scores and treatment benefit score at TBS scale, while undergoing these therapies.
