      frequently diagnosed cancer and the fourth cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide . The
      ﬁve-year survival rate is around 64.9% for all stages, while in metastatic cases, it only
      reaches 13.1% .

      Approximately 26% of CRCs are diagnosed at stage IV among patients aged younger than 50
      years, compared with 23% in those aged 50 to 64 years and 19% among those aged 65 years and
      older. Overall survival (OS) among patients younger than 50 years (68%) is similar to that in
      those 50 to 64 years (69%) because of a later stage at diagnosis.

      Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of CRC . In recent studies body mass index
      (BMI) was prognostic for overall survival and progression free survival. That is risk of
      progression and/or death was greatest for low BMI; risk decreased as BMI increased. BMI was
      not predictive of treatment effect . Cachexia and associated poor performance status have
      previously been identiﬁed as negative prognostic factors in patients with CRC.

      Tumor sidedness is an independent prognostic factor in patients with early and metastatic CRC
      as left-sided primaries have improved outcomes. sidedness also represents a powerful
      predictor of benefit from anti epidermal growth factor receptor[EGFR] inhibitors therapies in
      patients with RAS wild-type metastatic CRC (mCRC) .

      The mainstay of treatment of mCRC includes cytotoxic chemotherapy with the addition of a
      molecularly targeted agent . The cytotoxic regimens that are usually used include a
      combination of oxaliplatin or irinotecan with a fluoropyrimidine, in addition to targeted
      agents such as [EGFR] inhibitors for patients with RAS wild-type mCRC or vascular endothelial
      growth factor inhibitors .
