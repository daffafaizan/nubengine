      experimental group Down syndrome babies (will receive infant massage in the period between
      the two measurements) with the maturational development of the control group Down syndrome
      babies (will receive infant massage after two measurements). Assess both the development
      partial motor, cognitive, language and social, and also the maturational development global.
      Finally, measure also the ratio of development, both in the pretest as on the posttest. The
      test that will use to measure the development of them babies is the scale of development
      psychomotor of her first childhood Brunet-Lezine-R. The babies of the study may hay between 4
      and 8 months old.
