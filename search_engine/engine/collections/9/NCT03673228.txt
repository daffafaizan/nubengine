      the relapse prevention intervention and will: 1) compare the effectiveness of standard
      post-operative cessation treatment with a comprehensive relapse prevention intervention on
      smoking cessation outcomes; 2) conduct a comparative economic analysis to assess the value of
      the relapse prevention intervention for patients and the healthcare system; and 3) explore
      the impact of the interventions on surgical complications and readmissions.
