    
      Primary objective of this study is the evaluation of the time of the healing of the lesions
      resulting from minor amputations (digital or forefoot) treated with LipogemsÂ® technique.

      Secondary objectives are: 1) assessment of the safety of the lipofilling; 2) evaluation of
      the intensity of pain (VAS); 3) assessment of the skin tropism; 4) calculation of the relapse
      rate (defined as the occurrence of local infections, dehiscence and suffering of skin flaps
      that lead to a revision of the amputation stump or amputation at a higher level); 5)
      evaluation of the time of hospitalization and quality of life (QoL).
