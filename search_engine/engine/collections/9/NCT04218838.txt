    
      Randomized, multicenter, open-label, randomized design to compare CornerLoc Allograft-based
      Sacroiliac Joint Stabilization System to Intra-articular Sacroiliac Joint Steroid Injection.
      Within the initial phase, referred to as the Randomized Phase, the primary determination of
      efficacy and safety will be 6-months following the study procedure. The analysis will be
      based on the randomization assignment. In the second phase of the study, referred to as the
      Cross-over Phase, patients who fail to respond to the randomized treatment assignment will be
      permitted to receive the non-randomized treatment. The basis of the sample size and
      hypothesis testing for this clinical investigation will be based on the Randomization Phase.
