      system and in a controlled environment (substance abuse treatment)but at at high risk for
      opioid relapse and engaging in HIV risk behaviors when returning to the community. Initially,
      9 women were enrolled and received buprenorphine medication. After the first 9 participants,
      women were randomized to either buprenorphine or placebo. Women received the buprenorphine
      medication for 12 weeks in the community and at the end of the 12 weeks were transitioned
      either to another buprenorphine provider, methadone provider, or tapered off buprenorphine
      based on the participant's preferences. One additional follow-up at 3 months after treatment
      was conducted. The primary outcome was opioid positive urines at all time points.
