      to identify the possible differing effects of the synbiotic Gasteel PlusÂ® supplementation.

      The participants were professional soccer players of the Second Division B of the Spanish
      League and sedentary students of the same sex and age range. Both study groups were randomly
      divided into two groups: a control group administered with placebo, and an experimental group
      administered with the synbiotic. Each participant was evaluated at baseline, as well as after
      the intervention which lasted one month. Only in the athletes group did the synbiotic
      intervention clearly improve objective physical activ-ity and sleep quality, as well as
      perceived general health, stress, and anxiety levels.
