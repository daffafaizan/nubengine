      (HSCT). Patients with sufficient Vitamin D levels (>50nm/L) prior to allogeneic transplant
      have significantly better overall survival (OS) and lower rates of rejection and relapse.
      Vitamin D inhibits Th1 and augments Th2 cell development. Patients who receive vitamin D
      supplementation during allogeneic transplant have less inflammatory-mediated processes such
      as chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and lower levels of na√Øve CD8+ cells and CD40
      ligand. Multiple studies have raised concern regarding the adequacy of standard and high-dose
      vitamin D dosing for vitamin D deficiency. A single oral ultra-high dose of Vitamin D given
      prior to HSCT has been shown to be a safe and well tolerated method of sustaining therapeutic
      Vitamin D levels for 6-19 weeks.

      This is a pilot study to investigate the dynamic changes in inflammatory biomarkers following
      ultra-high-dose vitamin D supplementation. The study population is patients with total
      vitamin D level </=50ng/mL prior to HSCT.
