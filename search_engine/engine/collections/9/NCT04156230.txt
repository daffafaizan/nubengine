    
      This study is an open label, non-randomized, single center, intervention study. An estimated
      63 symptomatic subjects with a pretest score of deep vein thrombosis likely (Wells score â‰¥ 2)
      or a positive D-dimer test will receive [18F]GP1 PET/CT to evaluate the diagnostic validity
      of [18F]GP1 PET/CT for detecting deep vein thrombosis foci in lower extremities.

      The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment, and follow-up. The screening period
      starts with the patient's signature on the informed consent form and ends with assignment to
      treatment that is inclusion of the subject for treatment. The treatment period starts with
      baseline measurements, and ends with the last measurement/procedure on the day of intravenous
      injection of 250 MBq of [18F]GP1. The follow-up period contains the end-of-study interview.
      Key measurement is the PET/CT image acquisition about 120 minutes after the single injection
      of [18F]GP1 This study includes venous ultrasonography of deep vein thrombosis as a valid
      reference standard. [18F]GP1 PET/CT will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by
      three experienced readers.

      This study will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate from the sponsor or a
      designated contract research organization. Data quality and study integrity will be assessed.
      The investigator will document the items that are required to evaluate the study in the
      subject files. Data required according to this protocol are to be recorded on the case report
      forms provided by the sponsor as soon as possible.
