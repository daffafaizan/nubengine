      with high mortality rate in China. Nucleotide/nucleoside analogues are used for anti-virus
      treatment in these patients. Entecavir, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and Tenofovir
      Alafenamide are first line drug in China. But there still lacks of data of Tenofovir
      Alafenamide in treatment of HBV related ACLF. This study is to investigate the clinical
      efficacy of three types of nucleotide/nucleoside analogues in treatment of HBV related ACLF.
