      the beneficial effect of laparoscopic salpingectomy on IVF ET outcomes in patients with
      hydrosalpinges. Surgery is not usually safe especially in patients with extensive adhesions,
      morbid obesity and previous multiple laparotomies. Other less invasive options for patients
      with hydrosalpinges as ultrasound guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid, antibiotics and
      hysteroscopic occlusion of fallopian tube were studied in order to find an alternative to
      salpingectomy. Although these methods are simple and getting popular,current data are
      inadequate to recommend these treatment options instead of salpingectomy. The aim of this
      study is to determine whether the ultrasound guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid at
      the time of oocyte retrieval can improve the outcomes of IVF-ET .
