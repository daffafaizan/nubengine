    
      The aim of this project is to study the psychological effect of Continuous Subcutaneous
      Insulin Infusion (CSII) in a cohort of type 1 diabetic patients and to explore the influence
      of psychological factors (coping style, locus of control, self-efficacy) on glycaemic
      control. A sample of 36 type 1 diabetic patients will be recruited at Endocrinology, Diabetes
      and Metabolism Division of Verona City Hospital.

      Among T1DM patients routinely followed by our Institution the study will be proposed to those
      starting the CSII therapy based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Each study participants will provide a written informed consent and will undergo a set of 4
      psychological evaluation assessing depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, perceived interference
      caused by diabetes, family support, locus of control and coping strategies on top of routine
      medical examination and laboratory testing for outcome measures at baseline and after 6, 12
      and 24 months after study entry.
