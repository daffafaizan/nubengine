      prevalence widens in young adults. Background of this pathology can be multifactorial. One of
      the most common is poor core stability and overloading of the local tissues as a result.

      Among treatment methods stabilizing training is commonly used with good effects. This form of
      therapy affects the transverse abdomen (TrA) and multifidus (MF) muscles. To assess these
      structures several methods can be applied, e.g. sonofeedback.

      All participants will be randomly divided into two groups:

        1. Training group (TG)

        2. Control group (CG)

      Outcome measure:

      Pre- and post-therapy outcome measure will be done. It will include:

        -  ultrasound (sonofeedback) of the TrA and MF

        -  Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI)

        -  subjective pain scale - Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)

      Intervention:

      Core stability training including 4 exercise positions, each of 15 repetitions, 4 sets. Once
      a day, 5 times a week, 20 sessions in total (4 weeks).

      Our hypothesis claims that the core muscles morphology will change over the training process
      duration, in result, the analgesic effect will be achieved.
