      therapy in patients with myocardial infarction. Differences in adherence rates between
      patients enrolled in the program and patients undergoing standard outpatient care will be
      monitored during the study. The study will be conducted according to the clinical approbation
      protocol, the principles of good clinical practice (GCP) and regulatory requirements.

      The developed program is based on the experience of international research studies and
      includes the following sections:

        -  daily seminars with patients going to be discharged about the benefits of adherence to
           therapy; distribution of printed materials;

        -  service for the regular informing of the patients which is motivating to remain
           adherence to medications by automated contact management systems (SMS, e-mail), as well
           as calls from contact center operators;

        -  questioning of participants of the program for general adherence to therapy, reasons for
           refusal, change of therapy / drug, complaints and other. The questioning is carried out
           through telephone interviewing by contact center operators and automatic collection of
           electronic forms through aggregator services.

      Information motivating to remain adherence to the therapy is structured as follows:

      A) greeting and presentation, a reminder of the necessity for therapy, with the support of
      the patient's Trust in prolonging the quality of life by regular use of medications; B) the
      explanation of the action of the medicine taking into account the peculiarities of ordinary
      consciousness, warning the patient of the most common mistakes in treatment; C)
      recommendations for changing lifestyle and explaining their need; D) a reminder of the
      possibility to contact the attending physician, emotional support and counseling.

      The establishment of an information and counseling center will allow the patient to be
      supported throughout the time when the likelihood of giving up therapy and the risk of
      complications due to failure are most likely.
