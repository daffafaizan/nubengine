      ratios of 1:1:1. Two different doses of long chain n-3 fatty acids are tested against zero
      grams long chain n-3 fatty acids (lc-n3FA). These are provided in similarly looking gelatine
      capsules with either fish oil, a mixture (1:3) of fish oil and olive oil, or olive oil.
      Eligible women are randomized at around gestation weeks 16-24 and are asked to take the
      capsules until they have completed the preterm period (i.e. at 37 full gestation weeks) or
      until they deliver. Women are asked to complete questionnaires at randomization about diet
      and other baseline information, and again in gestation week 30 and after delivery. The trial
      is undertaken at hospitals in the two provinces of Gan-Su and Shaanxi. The three
      randomization groups will be compared with respect to proportions of preterm delivery. Cox
      regression will be used to compare the groups with respect to rates of spontaneous deliveries
      while accounting for elective delivery by regarding these as censoring events.
