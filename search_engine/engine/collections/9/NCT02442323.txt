      reductions in fatigue and pain. While pancreatic cancer patients may have physical
      restrictions that limit their participation in moderate to high-intensity exercise
      activities, empirical evidence suggests that even low-intensity, home-based walking programs
      can confer benefits for cancer patients. In this pilot study, 50 patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the walking intervention program or usual care (UC). Assessments
      of quality of life, distress, and symptom burden will be completed at baseline
      (pre-intervention) and at follow-up (i.e. within 2 weeks post-intervention or approximately
      12-14 weeks post-baseline). Data from the proposed pilot study will inform the development of
      a larger randomized trial designed to improve QOL and reduce morbidity in this patient
      population.
