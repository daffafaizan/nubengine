      tracer of vitamin A, and blood was sampled in a staggered, serial design to determine
      individual and group vitamin A kinetics. Data were subsequently modeled using compartmental
      analysis, and study truncation analysis was performed on data to investigate the factor of
      study duration on resulting vitamin A kinetic models and outputs related to vitamin A
      metabolism.
