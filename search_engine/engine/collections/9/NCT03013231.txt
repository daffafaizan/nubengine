      90% of patients achieving successful outcomes in terms of objectively measurable knee
      function, only 63% return to their pre-injury sport participation rate. This leads one to
      question what factors other than knee function may contribute to such a discrepancy. Prior
      studies have shown psychological factors, such as fear of re-injury, can play in role in
      whether a patient returns to play. However, the role of patient resilience on recovery is
      less clear. This research will examine the effect of patient resilience on post-ACLR return
      to sport. The Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS), a proven method of assessing ability to recover
      from stressful situations, will be used to evaluate patient resilience. The role of
      resilience on recovery post shoulder surgery, as well as rehabilitation in post-operative
      orthopaedic geriatric patients has been examined; however, the effect of resilience on
      specifically ACLR return to sport has yet to be studied.

      This research will provide insight as to how to identify patients at high risk for not
      returning to sport, the first step in improving return to sport outcomes in ACL
      reconstruction patients.
