      assessing changes of pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements in ambulatory blood
      pressure, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in adults between the ages of 20 and
      65. The investigators are seeking individuals with elevated blood pressure and stage I
      hypertension who are not currently taking blood pressure medications or exercising regularly.
      Participants will receive 12 weeks of free yoga for their participation.
