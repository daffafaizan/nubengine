      important innovation, being related to easier manipulation, reduced risk of stent thrombosis
      and low rate of revascularization. Previous studies do not have enough power to detect
      potential significant difference for ULM or bifurcation lesions. Consequently the
      investigators performed a multicenter registry enrolling all consecutive patients treated
      with Biomatrix Flex, Xience Alpine, Ultimaster, Resolute Onyx and Synergy. MACE (a composite
      end point of death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization and stent
      thrombosis) will be the primary end point, while its single components will be the secondary
      ones.
