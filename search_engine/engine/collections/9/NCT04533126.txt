      behavior, created by Taibi Kahler. It helps to understand how people interact and
      communicate. In order to communicate well with a person, it is convenient to use an adapted
      channel of communication. PCM focuses on the mastery of fundamental communication skills that
      are required to adapt and connect with all types of people. The sets of adaptive
      communications skills are learning, assessing, adapting, predicting and resolution. PCM
      defines six basic personality types, and four different channels of communication. Each one
      has one or several favourite channels of communication. On the whole, there are the following
      four channels of communication: Prescriptive, Informative-Interrogative, fostering,
      Emotional-Ludic.

        -  In the prescriptive channel, the interlocutor should be firm and determined, without
           being aggressive.

        -  The informative/interrogative channel requires a neutral tone of voice, showing no
           particular emotion. The interlocutor should emphasize using questions as a tool to
           communicate with the person.

        -  The ludic/emotive channel emphasizes exclamations, interjections, and allows expressing
           one's desires and urges, with immediate reactions without thinking them twice.

        -  The fostering channel allows sharing one's emotions and feelings with the interlocutor
           in a close, warm, and caring way.

      These channels refer to both the used words and to the non-verbal part of communication
      (gestures, mimic, tone of voice).

      This study aims to characterize the brain regions involved in the response to the different
      channels of communication.
