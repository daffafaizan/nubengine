    
      This project will fully develop and preliminarily validate CampAir, an empirically-based
      dynamic e-health intervention (based on the evidence-based ASMA) to assist adolescents with
      uncontrolled asthma to learn how to manage their illness and improve their asthma control. In
      addition to developing a highly novel product for adolescents with asthma, the research
      proposed for this project will address unique scientific questions. Despite the high asthma
      prevalence among adolescents, few interventions have specifically targeted adolescents. This
      study is innovative in that it is among the few to focus on adolescents, who are often
      overlooked by the healthcare system. This research will assess factors associated with
      successful implementation of CampAir, thereby providing new information regarding how
      e-health interventions can be effectively developed and implemented for use with adolescents
      with asthma. To ensure the software and website function as intended, investigators will
      systematically test each of the seven CampAir modules with target end users. Participants
      will review one module per week for seven weeks. As part of each module, participants will
      also complete a daily asthma checklist. Following the review of each module, participants
      will be prompted to complete measures assessing technology acceptability and usability and
      product quality. Results will be used to modify and finalize the user interface and
      navigation to maximize usability. Results are expected to support that all participants find
      the CampAir product to be of high quality and technical acceptability. Participants are
      expected to rate the usability and relevance of the CampAir product highly. All participants
      are expected to advocate use of the product and recommend continued development and testing.
