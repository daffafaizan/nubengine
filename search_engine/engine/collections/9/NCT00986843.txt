    
      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows.

        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OratecanTM

        2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of HM30181A, irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38
           and SN-38G) following oral administration of OratecanTM

        3. To evaluate anticancer activity of OratecanTM in patients with advanced solid
           malignancies Groups of 3 patients per cohort or dose level will be treated with
           escalating doses of irinotecan in combination with a fixed 60mg dose of HM30181A.

      If 0/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the dose of irinotecan will be escalated
      by 10 mg/m2 in the next dose level. If 1/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the
      cohort will be expanded by 3 additional patients to 6 patients. If no additional patients
      develop DLT, the dose of irinotecan will again be escalated in the next cohort of 3 patients.
      If 2/3 or 2/6 patients develop DLT, then dose escalation will cease, and the previous dose
      will be declared the MTD.
