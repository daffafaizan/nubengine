    
      Objectives

        -  To start a prospective observational cohort study of CRC patients from their primary
           diagnosis until death.

        -  After obtaining Informed Consent, to prospectively collect data on medical history,
           serious comorbidities, baseline clinical parameters, imaging results, pathology results,
           tumor characteristics, treatment, treatment outcomes, hospital stays, interventions and
           grade 3/4 adverse events.

        -  After obtaining separate Informed Consent for biobanking, to store blood and tumor
           tissue material, obtained during routine practice, in the biobank.

        -  The cohort will serve as an infrastructure geared towards efficient, safe and
           comprehensive clinical evaluation of new (image guided) interventions for treatment of
           CRC.

      Expected outcome

        -  More accurate data on the treatment and clinical and patient reported outcomes of CRC in
           daily practice.

        -  A continuous infrastructure for a large variety of research purposes including:

      A. Prognostic research B. Biological research and (epi)genetic research C. Studies that
      compare new therapies in a target population according to the cohort multiple randomized
      controlled trial design. D. Health care policies and cost-effectiveness studies
