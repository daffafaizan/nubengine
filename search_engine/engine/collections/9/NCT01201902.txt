        1. Proportion of subjects, stratified by group, with seroconversion to HI antibody

        2. Proportion of subjects, stratified by group, achieving a serum hemagglutination
           inhibition assay(HIA) antibody titer of 1:40 greater against the influenza H1N1 2009
           virus

        3. GMT(Geometric Mean Titer) and GMR(Geometric Mean Ratio) measuring by HIA antibody titer

             -  Safety Outcome Measures :

      1. Solicited adverse events(Day 0 ~ 6, Day 21 ~ 27) 2. Unsolicited adverse events(Day 0 ~ 42)
      3. Adverse events(Day 21 ~ 6 months)
