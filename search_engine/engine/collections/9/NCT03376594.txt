           daily. beforeBreakfast, lunch and dinner.

        2. Group 2 consists of 30 patients, taking Loratadine dosage 100 mg 1time daily.Taking drug
           is as follows

      Volunteers will be treated by drugs continuously for a period of six weeks. Taking three
      times a day 1 tablet before meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), giving drug based on random.

      Volunteers groups receiving Benjakul take 1capsule 3 times daily. Volunteer groups receiving
      Loratadine take loratadine tablet first 1capsule 1 time daily and then taking placebo once 1
      capsule during the day and 1 capsule in the evening.

      Patients have to report all the 42 days (6 weeks). The blood and urine samples will be
      collected and evaluated before the treatment and later following symptoms after 21 and 42
      days (3 weeks and 6). Assessment methods to measure the nasal, other of nasal symptoms,
      assessment of quality of life and overall treatment (Global assessment),Acoustic Rhinometry
      and tools which are used to evaluate nasal congestion. measuring the narrowest
      cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity, this tool takes a short time to evaluate and can
      determine volume of nasal cavity by calculating of the CSA in the nasal cavity. In addition,
      the researchers areable to check the safety of using medications by taking blood and urine
      samples to check Hematology CBC, Lipid profile, FBS monitoring of renal function (Renal
      function test) and liver function tests (Liver Function Tests: LFTs). So, the volunteers must
      NPO before every blood drawing.
