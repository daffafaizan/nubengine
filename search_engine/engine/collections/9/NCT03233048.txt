      criteria, participants will have baseline tests and initial visits with a physician,
      dietitian, and psychologist. Next, the ORBERAâ„¢ Intragastric Balloon (IGB) will be inserted
      into the stomach and then removed after 6 months. Participants will continue to be followed
      for 6 months after the balloon is removed. Throughout the year, participants will have
      additional tests along with ongoing visits with a physician, dietitian, and psychologist.
