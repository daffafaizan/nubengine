      is to compare PFMT with intravaginal vibratory stimulus versus PFMT alone on the treatment of
      female urinary incontinence. Women with an indication for conservative treatment of urinary
      incontinence will be referred to the Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy Team by the Medical Team of
      the Ambulatory of Urogynecology and Obstetrics of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre
      and those who are in compliance with the inclusion criteria proposed for the research will be
      invited to participate in the study.
