      docetaxel in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Determine the dose limiting
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess any antitumor activity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of irinotecan. Patients receive
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
