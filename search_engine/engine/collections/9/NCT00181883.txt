      brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1 (IC50=30nM), and adrenergic
      receptors.

      This is an 8-week open-label study aimed at assessing the effectiveness and tolerability of
      Quetiapine, in the treatment of preschool children aged 4 to 6 years with bipolar and bipolar
      spectrum disorder. This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether
      Quetiapine is efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of preschoolers with pediatric
      bipolar and bipolar spectrum disorder in this age group. The study results will be used to
      generate hypotheses for a larger randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit
      hypotheses and sufficient statistical power.
