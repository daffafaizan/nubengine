      decreases bone mineral density and increases fracture risk. This effect is evident with a
      daily dose of 5 mg for three months or an accumulated dose of 450mg. There is, however, less
      evidence that intermittent use of glucocorticoids is harmful to bone.

      Graves orbitopathy is treated with a weekly infusion of the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone
      and the accumulated dose over a 12-week course sums up to 4,500mg.

      The investigators therefore want to investigate if that treatment regimen affects bone
      turnover, bone mineral density, or bone structure in 30 patients with Graves' orbitopathy.
