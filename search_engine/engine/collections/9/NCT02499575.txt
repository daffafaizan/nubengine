      electing to undergo an outpatient first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint procedure
      (bunionectomy, 1st MTP fusion, or cheilectomy). As a standard, patients undergoing these
      procedures are given regional anesthesia (adductor canal block plus popliteal block).
      Patients are then given prescriptions for oral opioids to manage post-operative pain. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether a single intrapopliteal administration of
      Exparel, in conjunction with the standard of care regional block, improves pain relief and
      therefore decreases use of post-operative opioids.
