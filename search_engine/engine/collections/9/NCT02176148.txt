      quality of life. As there are many safe topical therapies that require daily use to be
      effective, and adherence to medication remains a common problem in dermatology, it is
      worthwhile to reliably measure adherence to medication in patients with cutaneous lupus. By
      elucidating barriers to effective control of cutaneous lupus with topical medications, we can
      improve patient care and guide interventions that will avoid the use of systemic therapy
      which often has more side effects.

      The primary aim is to determine adherence to topical and systemic lupus treatment. Subjects
      will receive standard of care therapy (low potency and high potency topical corticosteroids)
      and systemic therapy when clinically appropriate. Adherence to medications will be monitored
      electronically in all subjects. The following hypothesis is to be tested: Non-adherence to
      topical and systemic medication contributes to treatment failure in patients with cutaneous
      lupus.
