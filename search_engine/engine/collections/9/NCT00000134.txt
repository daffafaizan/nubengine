      to affect 35 to 40 percent of patients with AIDS. Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive
      disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. At the time of
      this trial, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). Although
      most retinitis responds well to initial therapy with systemically administered drugs, given
      enough time, nearly all patients will suffer a relapse of the retinitis. Relapsed retinitis
      generally responds to reinduction and maintenance therapy, but the interval between
      successive relapses progressively shortens. The CRRT addressed the issue of the management of
      relapsed CMV retinitis.

      The CRRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing three regimens in
      patients with relapsed retinitis. Patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis that had relapsed or
      was nonresponsive to initial therapy were randomized to one of three regimens: (1)
      intravenous foscarnet reinduction at 90 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by
      maintenance therapy at 120 mg/kg/day; (2) intravenous ganciclovir reinduction at 5 mg/kg
      twice daily for 2 weeks followed by maintenance at 10 mg/kg/day; and (3) combination therapy,
      wherein patients continued their previous therapy and were reinduced with the second drug and
      then placed on maintenance therapy with foscarnet at 90 mg/kg/day and ganciclovir at 5
      mg/kg/day.
