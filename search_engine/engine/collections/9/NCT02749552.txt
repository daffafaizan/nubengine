      a brief (5 sessions) ACT intervention or to waitlist control group. A mobile app will be used
      to encourage daily ACT skill practice and track health behaviours over time. The primary
      objective of the proposed project is to test whether a brief ACT intervention can result in
      sustained weight management (at 6 months and 1 year) compared to a waitlist control group. If
      this brief format of ACT intervention for obesity proves to be effective in encouraging
      health behaviours and weight loss, it may provide a low cost, sustainable option to enhance
      much needed obesity management services in Nova Scotia.
