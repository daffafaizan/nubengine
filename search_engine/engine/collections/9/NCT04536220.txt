      cell carcinoma. However, due to factors such as sampling method, smear making, staining
      technique, lower levels of the pathologists and other factors, its diagnostic sensitivity is
      still not very satisfactory. Poor diagnostic efficacy usually means another puncture, longer
      hospital stay, more medications and a higher incidence of adverse events. Missed diagnosis
      continuously directly delays the treatment time of the disease and seriously affects the
      patient's prognosis. Therefore, how to use new technologies to improve the differential
      diagnosis efficiency of benign and malignant pancreatic occupants is the key to improving the
      prognosis of diabetic cancer patients.

      The portal vein blood comes from the venous tract, including the blood flowing from the
      plasma to the liver. By collecting blood samples from the patient's portal vein, clinicians
      can separate more information from the patient. Studies have shown that the portal vein blood
      can be collected by ultrasound endoscopic puncture. This method is less traumatic, convenient
      and safe, and more information about the retinal tissue can be obtained. It is an important
      way to improve the efficiency of patient diagnosis. This study intends to use ultrasound
      endoscopic puncture technology to obtain portal vein blood, and use big data and ctDNA,
      metabolomics, exosomes and other different omics methods to screen the potential value of
      volume-occupying benign and malignant differential diagnosis markers in portal vein blood.
      Peripheral blood will simultaneously be collected to evaluate the efficacy of these newly
      developed markers.
