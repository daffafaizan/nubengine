    
      This study is an extension of previous clinical trials (NCT00308997 and NCT00567281) that
      were initiated in 2006. This study record provides the results for the amended study
      NCT00567281 (originally called a 'third arm') that was discontinued following the passing of
      Dr. Ralph Hoffman. The primary purpose of the study was to conduct fMRI neuroimaging studies
      prior to and subsequent to the rTMS intervention. The intent was to ascertain changes in
      regional brain activation and connectivity that most robustly predict level of improvement in
      auditory hallucinations elicited by bilateral rTMS as assessed by our primary outcome
      variables. It was hoped that this combined fMRI/rTMS study would provide critical new
      insights into the neurobiological basis of auditory hallucinations.

      The results presented are what was summarized following Dr. Hoffman's passing and were
      compiled by Dr. Philip Corlett.
