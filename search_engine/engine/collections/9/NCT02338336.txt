      for patients even for normal walking. The severity and magnitude of the warts can vary, but
      they are the cause of much pain and discomfort for all age groups. Nowarta 110 has been
      evaluated for the therapy of plantar warts caused by the HPV virus, (HPV infection). Clinical
      experience in a totals of 124 patients receiving Nowarta 110 for 5 weeks treatment in
      multiple clinics overseas has demonstrated the potential of Nowarta110 with absolutely no
      side effect.
