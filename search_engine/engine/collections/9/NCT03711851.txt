    
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based ACT intervention program with
      minimal therapeutic contact, compared to an ACT-based bibliotherapy and a pain education
      program (active control group) among adults with chronic pain. Participants were randomly
      assigned to each group. We hypothesized that:

        1. both ACT interventions would lead to significant reductions in pain-related disability
           (primary variable), greater than the control group (education), and that the web-based
           program would lead to greater reductions in disability than the bibliotherapy group;

        2. both ACT interventions would lead to significant improvements in quality of life
           (secondary variable), greater than the control group (education), and that the web-based
           program would lead to greater improvements in quality of life than the bibliotherapy
           group;

        3. both ACT interventions would lead to significant reductions in anxiety and depressive
           symptoms (secondary variables), greater than the control group (education), and that the
           web-based program would lead to greater reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms
           than the bibliotherapy group;

        4. Improvements on primary (pain-related disability) and secondary variables (quality of
           life, anxiety/depressive symptoms) for the ACT groups will be maintained at 3 and 6
           months and will remain superior to the control group (education);

        5. Participants from both ACT groups would have a positive impressions of change following
           the intervention (as measured by the PGIC scale).

             -  Some of the questionnaires described in the following section were administered and
                will be subject to subsequent analyses examining patient trajectories of change and
                profiles of patients who respond well or not to these treatment modalities.
