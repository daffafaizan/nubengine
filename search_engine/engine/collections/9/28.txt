amyloid.. starch gel electrophoretic analysis of some proteins extractedfrom amyloid .proteins extracted by strong urea from washed tissue of patients withamyloidosis secondary to several diseases or associated with familialmediterranean fever have common major electrophoretic components . inhearts of primary amyloidosis one component in common with the secondaryamyloid may be present . however, primary amyloid is much more difficultto dissolve and does not regularly give the components observed when thesecondary amyloid is extracted . the big question remains as to whatconstituent or constituents comprise the fibrils now known to be a partof amyloid .
