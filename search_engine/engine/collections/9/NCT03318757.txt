      maxilla, and 6 ml into the mandible). This will be injected into the soft tissue and gingiva
      surrounding the surgical site at the time of wound closure. Participants in Group 2 (standard
      of care) will receive bupivacaine 0.5% (4 ml into the maxilla, and 6 ml into the mandible)
      injected into the soft tissue and gingiva surrounding the surgical site at the time of wound
      closure.

      Post-operatively, all participants will be cared for utilizing the current standard
      post-operative pain management protocol for all patients undergoing elective orthognathic
      surgery at Boston Medical Center. This consists of acetaminophen 325 mg given every 4 hours
      as a scheduled medication; patients also receive an additional 325 mg of acetaminophen for a
      reported pain level of 1-3, 5 mg of oxycodone for a reported pain level of 4-6, and 10 mg of
      oxycodone for a reported pain level of 7-10. All participants will be provided the same
      methods of postoperative pain control following their elective orthognathic surgery.
