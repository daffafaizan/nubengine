    
      This is a patient level randomized study of a targeted, web-based overdose prevention and
      naloxone intervention for patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy. This study will be
      conducted in a health system which has implemented naloxone standing orders. Adults
      prescribed chronic opioid therapy will be identified in the electronic health record,
      outreached, and recruited for participation. Once enrolled, participants will be randomized
      to usual care or the intervention. The web-based intervention is an animated video which
      provides education on what is an opioid overdose, how to prevent and recognize an opioid
      overdose, and how to respond with naloxone. This video also encourages patients to pick up
      naloxone from a pharmacy under standing orders. Participants will be given knowledge and risk
      surveys over the follow-up. The primary outcome is opioid risk behavior. Secondary outcomes
      include knowledge about overdose and naloxone, substance use, and pain intensity. Patients
      will also be followed in the electronic health record for naloxone dispensings, changes in
      opioid dose, aberrant urine toxicology results, and overdose events.
