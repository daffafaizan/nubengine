      also randomly divided into four groups.In each group, dexmedetomidine target plasma
      concentration are 0,0.4,0.6,0.8 ng/ml. Dexmedetomidine administered 15 min before target
      controlled infusion of propofol. The propofol infusion is started to provide a target
      effect-site concentration of 1.0 ug/ml, and increased by 0.2 ug/ml until loss of
      consciousness when the effect-site concentration and target concentration are equilibrium.
