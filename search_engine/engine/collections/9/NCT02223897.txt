      techniques have resulted in reduced rates of infection, acute rejection and vascular
      complications after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, ischemic-type biliary
      lesions (ITBLs) are still one of the most serious complications after OLT, with a usual
      reported incidence of 5-15%, and an incidence of up to 26% in some studies. 46% patients with
      ITBLs require re-transplantation after 2 years of OLT.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),a kind of pluripotent stem cells,can differentiate into
      vascular endothelial cells, which participate in angiogenesis in ischemic tissue. MSCs can
      also stimulate the proliferation and migration of mature endothelial cells via
      paracrine.Furthermore, MSCs secret a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor, human basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth
      factor, interleukin-1 and interleukin-8, etc., which also induce angiogenesis.

      Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus
           huc-MSCs treatment.

        -  Arm B: Participants will receive 6 months of standard regular treatment for ITBLs plus
           placebo.

      huc-MSCs will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags
      containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. After huc-MSCs transfusion, patients are
      followed up once per week(in the first months,<1M),once per 2 week(1-3M)and once per
      month(3-6M), and the evaluation of liver function and biliary blood supply was performed.
