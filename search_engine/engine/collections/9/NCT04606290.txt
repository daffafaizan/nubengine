      to patients with domiciliary long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) is better than manually
      controlled oxygen treatment in keeping SpO2 within intended target interval. In manually
      controlled oxygen treatment flow is usually kept constant for months between visits from
      specialist nurse, whereas in automated control the patient can titrate oxygen flow several
      times a day based on pulse oximetry in a closed-loop system.
