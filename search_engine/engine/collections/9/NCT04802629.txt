      significantly higher affinity for oxygen when compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA), which makes
      it more suitable for oxygen extraction at the lower partial oxygen pressures in utero.
      Although the regulation of HbF expression is determined developmentally, recent studies
      report a respectable variation in the fraction of HbF in neonates.

      Such data suggest that the differences in HbF expression could affect end-tissue oxygenation
      in neonates.

      The methodology for measuring oxygen saturation and extraction in cerebral and peripheral
      tissues of neonates using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been well practiced in
      our study group. However, the method has not yet been used to investigate whether the
      fraction of fetal hemoglobin (FHbF) plays a significant role in cerebral and peripheral
      oxygenation in neonates.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between cerebral and peripheral
      oxygenation and oxygen extraction, as measured by NIRS, and the FHbF and absolute HbF
      concentration in postnatal conditions in term and preterm neonates.
