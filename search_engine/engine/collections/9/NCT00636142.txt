      subjects face an increased risk for cardiovascular events that is closely related to a
      cluster of metabolic disturbances (i.e. insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and
      impaired fibrinolysis), collectively referred to as syndrome X. The actual mechanism
      underlying development of syndrome X has not been elucidated. Increased TNF-alpha activity
      has been proposed as a key factor.

      The objectives of the study are to test whether neutralizing TNF-alpha with infliximab in
      obese subjects affects insulin resistance and phenotypical manifestations of the metabolic
      syndrome such as:

        -  fasting plasma insulin

        -  ivGTT derived parameters of insulin resistance and beta-cell function

        -  total body fat

        -  plasma lipid profile

        -  vascular endothelial dysfunction
