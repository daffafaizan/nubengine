        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of dose-dense carboplatin plus paclitaxel on a weekly
           schedule given in sequence after gemcitabine and doxorubicin in patients with renal
           impairment and metastatic or locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the
           urothelium.

        -  Observe the outcome of this sequential systemic chemotherapy in these patients, or
           following surgical resection as adjuvant therapy in patients in whom poor renal function
           precludes the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carboplatin.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 10 minutes and doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes for 5
      doses on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 3
      through 10 of each 2-week course. On week 11, patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.

      Each cohort of 3 patients is entered on sequentially increasing doses of carboplatin. If any
      patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 6 patients are entered at that dose
      level. If 3 patients experience DLT at any dose level, the maximum tolerated dose has been
      surpassed and a total of 6 patients are treated at the previous level.

      Patients are evaluated at week 16 and at end of study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 18-30 patients accrued into this study over 9-15 months.
