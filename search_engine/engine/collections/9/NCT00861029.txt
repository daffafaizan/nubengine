    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      designed to estimate the effects of repeated, once daily oral dosing of pazopanib on
      electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac
      repolarization (QTc interval duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with solid
      tumors. Moxifloxacin, a drug known to cause mild QTc interval prolongation, is included as a
      positive control to validate the ability of the study to detect a small prolongation in the
      QTc interval. Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG
      recordings obtained via a Holter monitor. The effects of pazopanib and moxifloxacin on
      cardiac repolarization will be compared with placebo.

      This study will also assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma
      concentrations of pazopanib and its metabolites and their effects, if any, on cardiac
      repolarization, specifically on the QT interval.
