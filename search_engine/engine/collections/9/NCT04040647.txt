      the day of surgery. Data suggest that orthostatic symptoms prevent a large number of patients
      (up to 50%) from ambulating the day of surgery.

      The investigators plan to include 50 patients scheduled for colorectal surgery and bariatric
      surgery in an ERP.

      The primary endpoint will be the ability to get out of the bed and sit in an armchair.
      Orthostatic symptom will be recorded. The secondary endpoint will be a 6-min walk test
      (6-MWT). This test will be performed before surgery, 3 hour after the end of surgery, and 24
      hour after surgery. The day of surgery a 2-min walk test (2-MWT) will be realized.

      Correlation of the ability to early ambulate and postoperative course (adherence to ERP,
      complications) will be analyzed.
