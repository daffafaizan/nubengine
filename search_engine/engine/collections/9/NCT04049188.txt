      pain control, and potentially also survival when patients are enrolled early.1-3 However,
      hospice programs are often seen by patients and their caregivers as the last resort after
      exhaustion of all effective treatment options. The need to revoke active treatment (for all
      hospice patients with cancer outside of the VA system) discourages hospice enrollment.

      This study aims to understand and analyze barriers to access specifically for short course
      palliative radiation therapy in cancer patients enrolled in hospice.
