      plasma (HT-CCP) transfusion as a possible treatment for people who have COVID-19, the
      coronavirus infection. "HT-CCP" is plasma that contains a high amount of antibodies that were
      made to fight off COVID-19 because it is donated by another person who has also been infected
      with coronavirus but has recovered, so their immune system has had enough time to make these
      antibodies. This study is being done to determine whether HT-CCP will help people with
      COVID-19 recover from their infection more quickly and lower their risk of having to go on a
      ventilator or reduce the time they need to stay on a ventilator. It is not yet known whether
      HT-CCP helps people with COVID-19, which is why the study needs to be randomized, meaning
      some subjects will be randomly selected to receive HT-CCP while others will be randomly
      selected to receive FFP.
