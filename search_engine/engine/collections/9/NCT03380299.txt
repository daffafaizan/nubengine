      for approximately 40% of all leukemia's and mainly affecting older individuals. As it has a
      highly variable clinical course, identification of molecular and biological prognostic
      markers has provided new insights into the risk stratiÔ¨Åcation of patients with CLL .

      The interactions of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with the microenvironment in secondary
      lymphoid tissues and the bone marrow are known to promote CLL cell survival and proliferation
      . CD49d (one of biomarkers) is one of independent prognostic risk parameter in CLL with
      important roles in shaping these interactions.

      CD49d also is one of independent prognostic risk parameters in CLL that predict adverse
      outcome and linked to processes involved in interaction with the vascular endothelium and/or
      migration into the extravascular compartments .

      The cell-surface glycoprotein CD44 is involved in cell motility, cellular trafficking, and
      stem cell differentiation . It contributes to the phenotypic hallmarks of many cancers, such
      as invasiveness, self-renewal, and sustained survival. CD44 transmits both growth and
      apoptotic signals, a functional duality that is also observed in hematologic malignancies.

      CD44 expression in CLL is mediated by the tumor microenvironment. As a coreceptor, CD44
      promotes leukemogenesis by regulating stimuli of MCL1 expression. Moreover, CD44 can be
      addressed therapeutically in CLL by specific antibodies.
