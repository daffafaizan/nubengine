      (ARGlass) and one in normal condition (Normal). Participants had two perform different tasks
      of a 90 minutes total duration. Before, during and after these tasks, two feet balance, one
      foot balance, precision balance, stroop and memory tests were performed. Also, heart rate and
      electromyographic activity of some muscles were recorded. Finally a survey was filled to
      determine, for example fatigue, pain or comfort.
