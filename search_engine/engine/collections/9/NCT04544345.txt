      adverse effects of AV dyssynchrony due to PR interval prolongation. According to the ESC and
      ACC guidelines, severe first degree AV block is an IIa indication for permanent pacemaker
      implantation, yet data on these patients' clinical outcomes are scarce. To independently
      determine the impact of AV resynchronization, His bundle pacing will be used to avoid
      intraventricular desynchronization.

      Symptomatic patients with severe first-degree AV block and echocardiographically proven AV
      dyssynchrony will be included in the study.

      All patients will receive a dual-chamber pacemaker with an atrial lead positioned in the
      right atrium and ventricular lead placed on the bundle of His. In a single-blind cross-over
      design, patients will be randomized to AV sequential His bundle pacing with echo-guided AV
      optimization or back-up VVI pacing mode. Each study period will last for three months. At the
      end of both periods, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete echocardiographic study, and
      clinical evaluation will be performed.

      Peak oxygen uptake and echocardiography-based hemodynamic parameters in both periods will be
      compared.
