    
      Approximately 300 patients presenting with a displaced orbital fracture (OFx) in the floor
      and/or medial wall (blow-out fracture) will be enrolled prospectively in this registry. All
      patients, surgically and nonsurgical treated will be followed-up (FU) within the registry. FU
      period for all patients will include assessments post-treatment at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6
      months as corresponding with the local standard (routine) visit schedule at each
      participating clinic.

      Data collection includes patient and fracture details, treatment details, functional,
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes and anticipated or procedure- and implant-related
      adverse events (ie, complications). Computer Tomography (CT) scans or Cone Beam-CT (CBCT)
      scans taken as per standard of care will be collected within the registry.
