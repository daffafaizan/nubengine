      discussion group about violence and suicide prevention. The TAU group without specific family
      interview for patient and family caregiver dyad. In the BFCC group, four 90-minute BFCC
      program sessions were additionally provided twice a week for each hospitalized family dyad.
      It was hypothesized that family caregivers in the BFCC group could primary increase their
      family function, and secondary improve perceived health status and reduce caregiver's burdens
      compared to the TAU. The results showed family caregivers in the BFCC group significant time
      group interaction effects in overall family function (p=0.03) and subscale-conflict (p=0.04),
      communication (p=0.01), and problem solving (p=0.04), but there were no significant
      interaction effects on the caregivers' perceived health status and caregiver's burdens.
