      disorders has been cited as a contributor to better outcomes for these youth, and parent
      components have been included in several evidence-based interventions for adolescent mental
      health problems. Additionally, youth experiencing mood and behaviour changes that come about
      as a result of a depressive episode can lead to frustrated/overprotective reactions from
      parents, which can contribute to worse outcomes for these adolescents. Interventions focused
      on addressing parent-adolescent conflict and reducing negative interactions can potentially
      support recovery from depression and reduce episode relapse. However, there is very little
      research on including parent components in psychosocial interventions specifically aimed at
      youth depression. This randomized control trial aims to fill this gap by randomizing parents
      of youth receiving treatment for depression into either 1) an 8-week virtual or in-person
      group parent intervention, or 2) usual care.

      Participants will be parents or caregivers (for simplicity, the term "parent" is used to
      refer to parents or caregivers) of adolescents aged 13-18 with depression who are part of the
      care pathway for youth depression at a mental health research hospital in Toronto, Canada.
      Their adolescents will also participate in the study in order to provide multi-informant
      data; however, should adolescents decline to participate in the study, their parent will
      still be able to take part.

      Parents and adolescents will complete a combination of questionnaire, interview, and
      observationally coded measures at pre- and posttreatment, along with questionnaire measures
      at mid-treatment and 3 months follow-up.
