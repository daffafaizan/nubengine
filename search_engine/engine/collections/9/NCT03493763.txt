      cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Liver resection is a common treatment for HCC.
      However, even after successful surgical resection, most patients suffered from recurrence or
      progression of the tumor. Because clinical staging systems cannot precisely predict the
      outcome of patients with HCC, it's of great interest to search biomarkers for HCC. Among
      them, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most well-studied. However, the applicability of AFP for
      HCC after surgical resection of tumor is still uncertain.

      The discovery of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) originating from different tissues in the circulating
      blood has revolutionary potential for the clinic. Liquid biopsy-based biomarkers and
      detection tools offer substantial advantages over existing diagnostic and prognostic methods,
      including being minimally invasive. They thus have a cost-efficient potential to promote
      higher patient compliance and clinical convenience to enable dynamic monitoring.

      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the intermediate of active demethylation from
      5-methylcytosine. 5hmC not only marks active demethylation but also serves as a relatively
      stable DNA mark that plays distinct epigenetic roles. Recent genome-wide sequencing maps of
      5hmC in various mammalian cells and tissues support its role as a marker for gene expression.
      Previous studies have established 5hmC-Seal technology for 5hmC profiling in cfDNA and showed
      that the differentially enriched 5hmC regions in cfDNA are excellent markers for solid
      tumors.

      In this study, investigators aim to find out how plasma 5hmC profile changes in
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients after liver resection, and determine whether 5hmC can be
      used as a biomarker for HCC recurrence monitoring.
