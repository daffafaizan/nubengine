      surgeries, the incidence of new incisional hernias (IH) is estimated at 400,000 cases per
      year. These hernias are a major source of morbidity and mortality for patients, and they
      result in $6-10 billion per year in healthcare costs. Our multidisciplinary hernia prevention
      group has identified a novel IH prevention strategy in the form of dehydrated human
      amniotic-chorionic membrane (dHACM). We previously showed that dHACM prevents IH in animal
      models, and subsequently in a prospective cohort of high-risk patients.

      The purpose of this trial is to quantify the efficacy of dHACM in IH prophylaxis by
      performing a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Our specific aim is to
      test the hypothesis that augmentation of standard abdominal fascia closures with
      prophylactic, onlay dHACM sheets without fixation will reduce IH formation in a high-risk
      population.
