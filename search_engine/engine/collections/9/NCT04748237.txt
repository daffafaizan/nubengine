    
      Patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ACS, without
      acute MI but with an intermediate risk (HEART-score >3) will after written informed consent
      be randomized to either a strategy with an initial CCTA or not.

      Patients randomized to strategy including early CCTA will receive standard care according to
      responsible physician and perform a CCTA as soon as possible (in most cases within 24 hours,
      but at least within 7 days).The result will be presented to the responsible physician who
      will plan further care of the patients.

      Patients randomized to a strategy not including early CCTA will receive further care
      (including examinations) according to responsible physician but not include early CCTA. These
      patients will often undergo a non-invasive functional test, such as Exercise-ECG, stress
      echocardiography or nuclear imaging according to local routines, but not always.

      All patients should receive optimal prevention according to current guidelines. The
      responsible physician will be encouraged to initiate secondary prevention measures if
      examinations show signs of CAD.

      The primary endpoint is composite of death, readmission because of MI or unstable angina
      requiring revascularization at 3 years.
