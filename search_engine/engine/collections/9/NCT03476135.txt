      (NCT03205358) were eligible for enrollment. All participants received a single booster dose
      of MenACYW conjugate vaccine on Day 0. Immunogenicity was assessed at pre-vaccination and 30
      days after vaccination. Safety was assessed throughout the study period, and included
      solicited injection site and systemic reactions (Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination);
      unsolicited adverse events up to Day 30 (Visit 2), and serious adverse events occurring
      throughout the trial.
