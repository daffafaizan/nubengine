      These disorders impair school, social, and family functioning. When left untreated, they also
      put children at risk for major depression and substance abuse in late adolescence and
      adulthood. Previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy and
      selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of child anxiety disorders. This
      study is testing the relative and combined efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy and
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as compared to each other and pill placebo.

      During Phase I of this two-phase study, 488 participants were randomly assigned to receive
      sertraline (Zoloft), cognitive behavioral therapy, a combination of these treatments, or a
      placebo for 12 weeks. Phase II involved a 6-month maintenance period for participants.
