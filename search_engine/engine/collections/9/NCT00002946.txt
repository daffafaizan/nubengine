      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Phase II dose of oral penclomedine in
      patients with malignancies.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of oral penclomedine in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of oral penclomedine in these patients. IV. Determine the bioavailability of
      oral penclomedine in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients enrolled on the bioavailability portion of this study receive one dose of IV
      penclomedine over 1 hour followed by 2 weeks of rest. At the end of two weeks, they receive
      oral penclomedine for 5 days every 28 days. The starting dose is determined by a single
      primary patient who has been administered oral penclomedine and observed for dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT). [Bioavailability portion completed as of 3/98.] Those not on the
      bioavailability portion of study start on a standard design dose escalating schedule in which
      patients enroll in cohorts of 3. Patients are administered oral penclomedine daily for 5
      days. This treatment repeats every 4 weeks. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately below
      that at which 2 patients experience DLT. Treatment repeats for 6 courses or until severe
      toxicity or tumor progression is observed.
