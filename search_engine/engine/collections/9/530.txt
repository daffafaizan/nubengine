1846. anaphylactic tests in model tumour antigen investigationsthe efficacy of anaphylactic tests in detecting'tumor' antigen in serum was investi-gated.  a simple model of a tumor-antigenstudy was carried out using rat tissueand rat serum, with bovine y-globulin (byg)acting as a mock cancer antigen.  itwas found that if byg (absolute dosage 100ug.) had formed 1/6 of the antigen mix-ture used for sensitization it was readilydetected when present in a concentrationof 10-3 in the serum used for challenge,but not invariably detected in a concentra-tion of 10-4.  if byg (absolute dosage 50ug.) had formed approximately 1/50 of thesensitizing mixture, it was infrequentlydetected even when present in the challeng-ing serum in a concentration of 10-2.  itis concluded that anaphylactic tests used inthis context do not have a very highsensitivity or discriminatory capacity.
