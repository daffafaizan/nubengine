      of the varicella antigen (VZV Skin Test reagent), once at baseline before the first
      vaccination, a second time before the second vaccination, and a third time approximately 14
      days after the second vaccination. Reactions to the skin test were assessed by the same
      examiner for each participant to the greatest extent possible.
