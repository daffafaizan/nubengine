    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a stepwise fashion, dose levels for an
      investigational quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing 2 influenza A strains and 2
      influenza B strains. This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose escalating study in which up to 200 healthy adults age 65-75 years will be administered
      a single dose of either placebo or an investigational influenza vaccine (VAX2012Q,
      Quadrivalent Recombinant Hemagglutinin Seasonal Influenza Vaccine) at one of up to 3 dose
      levels. Fifty or up to 75 subjects will be enrolled in each dose level. Data for safety and
      immunogenicity will be collected for all dose levels.
