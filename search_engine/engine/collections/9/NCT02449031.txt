      Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) PortCF registry and using TOBI Podhaler or another
      FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic. No therapeutic intervention will be assigned
      and physicians will use their discretion in choosing a treatment regimen for their patients.

      Sputum samples (primarily collected during routine clinical follow-up) from patients able to
      spontaneously produce sputum will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.

      In addition, this study will include two optional sub-studies for qualifying patients in the
      first study year - Sputum microbiology sub-study and TOBI Podhaler sputum pharmacokinetics
      (PK) sub-study.
