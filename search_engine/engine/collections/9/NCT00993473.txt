      Treatment phase: 24 weeks

      At randomization, patients were stratified with respect to their baseline HbA1c level (<8.5%
      or ≥8.5%) and hypoglycemic event rate (number of CGMS hypoglycemic excursions <0.5 or ≥0.5
      events per 24 hours). Following randomization, trial basal insulin was initiated and
      up-titrated within the first 12 weeks to reach a stable dose.

      Follow-up phase: 2 weeks

      All Phases: 28 to 30 weeks
