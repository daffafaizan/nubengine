    
      This is a phase 1, open label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single
      administration of one of two doses of a recombinant replication deficient human adenoviral
      (Ad5) TB vaccine containing the immunodominant antigen Ag85A delivered to the respiratory
      tract by aerosol in healthy volunteers with a history of BCG immunization.

      28 healthy volunteers will be enrolled. The first cohort (n=8) will receive a lower dose of
      vaccine using the AeroNeb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer. For the second cohort (n=20)
      participants will be randomized to either a higher dose of vaccine by aerosol (n=10) or
      intramuscular administration (n=10). Cellular immune responses in the lung and peripheral
      blood will be evaluated
