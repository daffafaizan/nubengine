    
      We are conducting a randomized, controlled clinical trial in Soweto, South Africa to evaluate
      the efficacy of 0.5% chlorhexidine wipes of the birth canal during labour and of the infant
      at birth in reducing 1) vertical transmission of leading pathogenic bacteria from mother to
      child during labour and delivery, and 2) incidence of neonatal sepsis and maternal peripartum
      infection, in comparison to external genitalia sterile water wipes. In conjunction with this,
      we will compare vaginal carriage of bacteria commonly associated with neonatal sepsis and
      maternal peripartum infection among HIV-infected and non-infected pregnant women who deliver
      at the only public hospital in Soweto, and will characterize the burden of disease and risk
      factors for maternal peripartum infection and serious neonatal infections in this population
      by conducting active prospective surveillance.
