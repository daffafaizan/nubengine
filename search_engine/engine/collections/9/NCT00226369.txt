      (CPB) in infants undergoing cardiac surgery. We performed a multicenter, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of the leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion inhibitor
      Cylexin in young infants to determine if it reduces I/R injury following hypothermic CPB.
      Entry criteria included age at surgery 1-45 days, birth weight > 2.3 kg, and planned repair
      or palliation of congenital heart defects with CPB. We excluded patients with specified
      antecedent events or conditions, including lung or kidney disease, seizures, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, infection, or other serious noncardiac morbidity. Randomization was stratified
      by study center and cardiac diagnosis. Cylexin was administered continuously from sternotomy
      until 24 hours post CPB. Centers followed their usual operative and postoperative care
      practices. From December 1997-March 1999, we enrolled 230 infants, 155 for 2-ventricle
      repairs (Group 1: D-TGA=90, VSD=16, TOF/truncus=22, TAPVR=9, VSD with aortic arch
      obstruction=18) and 75 for stage 1 palliation (Group 2: single ventricle with aortic arch
      obstruction). Of those enrolled, 117 were assigned to Cylexin (Group 1=80, Group 2=47) and
      113 to placebo (Group 1=75, Group 2=38). Pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable
      between treatment groups. Early (30 day) mortality for Cylexin versus placebo patients in
      Group 1 was 0% versus 3.8% (p=0.25) and for Group 2 was 10.8% versus 28.9% (p=0.08). In both
      risk groups, treatment with Cylexin did not significantly improve other early postoperative
      outcomes or decrease the occurrence of adverse events. Cylexin did not significantly improve
      early mortality or postoperative recovery in Group 1 patients. Despite a small sample size,
      early mortality in Group 2 Cylexin-treated patients tended to be lower, suggesting the need
      for future trials of agents that could reduce I/R injury in high-risk infants.
