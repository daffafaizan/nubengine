    
      BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin
      C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid
      dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes (clinical
      formulation BXQ-350). Given via intravenous (IV) infusion, data indicate that the agent
      exhibits the propensity to enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and
      induce cell death.

      The study is divided into 2 parts:

      Part 1: Dose Escalation and Safety - Sequential cohorts of patients 1-30 years of age with
      relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors will be treated with
      escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is established, or in the absence of a Maximum
      Administered Dose, the highest planned dose level is reached.

      Part 2: Safety and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity - Patients will be enrolled into one of
      four cohorts and administered BXQ-350 at the established MTD or at the highest planned dose
      level. The four cohorts will consist of: recurrent ependymoma, recurrent malignant brain
      tumor, recurrent Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), and relapsed non-central nervous
      system (non-CNS) solid tumor.
