      of light and production of sharp visual images, becomes cloudy and hardens, resulting in a
      loss of visual function. Left untreated, cataracts can cause preventable blindness. During
      cataract surgery the natural lens is removed and a man-made intraocular lens (IOL) is
      implanted in its place.

      IOL technology has advanced significantly in recent years and as a result the main goal of
      cataract surgery is no longer simply the successful removal of the cloudy lens and
      restoration of vision. Providing patients with the best possible refractive outcome and the
      best possible visual quality is now much more important when assessing surgery outcomes.

      Aspheric, multifocal and accommodating IOLs are among the new designs developed to improve
      visual outcome after cataract surgery. In order to assess the effectiveness of these designs,
      visual function needs to be evaluated both objectively and subjectively following their
      implantation. Such evaluation allows the continued evolution of these IOL designs towards
      optimum. This proposed research study, which aims to assess the visual function and optical
      performance of new CE marked IOLs after implantation, could significantly contribute to the
      enhancement and development of improved IOL designs in the future.

      We have successfully conducted similar patient trials for the past 5 years. As new IOL
      designs are constantly being developed, approved and CE marked, this type of research study
      will always have the potential to offer new information that is not currently available and
      has not previously been assessed or published and could contribute towards improved IOL
      designs in the future.

      All outcome measures will be captured 3-6 months after surgery
