      exercise on skeletal muscle function. Twenty-five T2DM patients will be enrolled and be
      prescribed a 10-week exercise program. The exercise program will comprise aerobic and
      resistance components; a moderate level of intensity will be calculated based on results from
      a maximal graded exercise test (VO2R) conducted prior to the intervention. MRI data will be
      acquired at baseline and before and after the intervention that can provide mechanistic
      insight into the adaptations in lower leg muscle function.
