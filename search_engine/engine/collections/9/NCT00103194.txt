      I. To evaluate the percentage of patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer who
      experience > 50% decline in serum PSA during treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of PSA decline. II. To characterize the change in PSA slope with
      GW572016. III. To characterize the safety and tolerability of GW572016 in this patient
      population.

      IV. To estimate the time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival at 2 years (from
      start of therapy).

      V. To evaluate the correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      expression/signaling (from available prostate biopsy specimens or prostatectomy blocks) and
      its relationship to change in PSA in patients treated with GW572016.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if patient is <
      2 years from study entry, every 6 months if patient is 2-5 years from study entry, or every
      year if patient is 5-10 years from study entry for 10 years.
