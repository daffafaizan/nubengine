      validation of telemedicine as a tool for spasticity evaluation or referral. This study will
      test the reliability of using telemedicine so a neurologist can remotely identify residents
      of a long-term care facility who should be referred to a neurologist for an in-person
      spasticity consultation. The telemedicine referral tool will be tested for bedside
      implementation in all consenting participants residing in Tennessee State Veteran's Home,
      which is a long-term care facility in Murfreesboro, TN. Each of the 140 residents will
      receive one neurological examination and one physical examination guided by the
      teleneurologist. A medical record review will also be performed.
