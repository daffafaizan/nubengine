    
      Upon admission, all children will receive nutritional treatment and standard medical care in
      accordance with the nutritional guidelines of the national protocol, with the exception of
      the routine distribution of antibiotics. Antibiotics will be provided at admission and during
      follow-up only if clinically justified. The results of the program (ie, nutritional recovery,
      hospitalization, death and abandonment) will be monitored in all children aged 6 to 59 months
      admitted for outpatient therapy in 2 outpatient treatment sites in the Madarounfa health
      district in Niger.

      To ensure that the children included in the study receive appropriate care, the study will
      ask the children's leaders to return to the clinic for medical surveillance in the event of a
      clinical complication. Program staff will facilitate appropriate management, including
      prescription of antibiotics if clinically justified, and transfer to hospital of all children
      in need of close supervision and / or comprehensive medical management.
