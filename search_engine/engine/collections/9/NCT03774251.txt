      plasma (PRP) injection versus extracorporeal shock wave therapy for management of refractory
      Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS).

      GTPS is a common cause of extra-articular lateral hip pain which occurs in up to 10- 25% of
      the population, and is a common presenting complaint to primary care and Sports Medicine
      clinics. Previously, most cases of GTPS were diagnosed as trochanteric bursitis, for which
      the standard treatment focused on relieving inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      medications and corticosteroid injections. However, corticosteroid injections typically only
      provide short term pain relief, likely secondary to the fact that the underlying pathology is
      likely not from an isolated bursal inflammation. Recent studies suggest that in fact the most
      common cause of GTPS is gluteus medius or minimus tendinopathy or tear. Platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) has been used in treating tendinopathies and tendon tears throughout the body to
      promote healing through the concentrated growth factors released from platelets.
      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is another treatment which has been used
      increasingly in the treatment of tendinopathies. The purpose of this randomized prospective
      study is to compare the efficacy of PRP injection to ESWT in treating patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of GTPS.
