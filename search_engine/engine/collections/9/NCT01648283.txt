      CYP2B6*6 polymorphism, on clinical methadone plasma concentrations, clearance, and
      metabolism. The hypothesis was that CYP2B6*6 heterozygotes or homozygotes would have reduced
      metabolism and clearance. A secondary objective was to evaluate other less common genotypic
      variants, when encountered. Healthy volunteers in genotype cohorts CYP2B6*1/*1, CYP2B6*1/*6 ,
      and CYP2B6*6/*6, and also CYP2B6*4 and CYP2B6*5 carriers, received single doses of IV and
      oral methadone. Plasma and urine methadone and metabolite concentrations were determined by
      tandem mass spectrometry. The primary outcome measure was methadone metabolism, measured as
      plasma metabolite/patent area under the concentration-time curve ratio and metabolite
      formation clearance.
