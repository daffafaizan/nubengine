        -  Compare the effectiveness of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine (BAK) gel
           versus placebo, in terms of improving sensory neuropathy, in cancer patients with
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy> Secondary>

        -  Compare motor and autonomic symptoms and functioning, mood states, pain, and peripheral
           neuropathy in these patients.

        -  Assess the adverse event profile of topical BAK gel.

        -  Explore whether topical BAK gel is absorbed systemically. OUTLINE: Patients are
           stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs non-active), current use of
           opioids or oral pain medications (yes vs no), pain rating (4-7 vs 8-10), and prior
           ineffective pharmacologic treatment for peripheral neuropathy (yes vs no). Patients are
           randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply 1 spoonful of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine gel
           topically to each area of pain, numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice
           daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients apply 1 spoonful of placebo gel topically to each area of pain,
           numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice daily for 4 weeks.

      Some patients in both arms may choose to continue on the active gel or, if on placebo, begin
      the active gel for an additional 8 weeks off study. Patients complete health, pain, mood, and
      quality of life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study. Patients also
      record adverse symptoms weekly in a Symptom Experience Diary.
