      Trabectedin (depending on dose reductions : between 1.5 and 1 mg/m²/3 weeks; over 24 hour
      administration) until progression, intolerance or 6 cycles (according to the SPC of
      Trabectedin)

      Randomized part (50 patients):

      After the 6 first cycles, if there is not progression or unacceptable toxicity, the patients
      will be randomly assigned to continuous or "intermittent/holiday" therapy with CT-scan
      evaluation every 6 weeks in both arms

        -  Arm A Continuation of Trabectedin (between 1.5 and 1 mg/m²/3 weeks; over 24 hour
           administration) until progression or intolerance

        -  Arm B "Intermittent/holiday" therapy. Rechallenge of Trabectedin will be implemented in
           the event of progression; in this case administration of Trabectedin will occur until
           the second progression or intolerance
