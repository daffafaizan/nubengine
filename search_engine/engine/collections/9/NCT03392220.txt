      unilateral neck dissection with cN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study
      is to see if unilateral dissection can get similar regional control as bilateral dissection.

      308 patients with cN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma will be enrolled in five centers of
      northern China. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1: 1 ratio case group or control goup.
      Patients in case group will undergo unilateral (laryngeal primary tumor affected side) neck
      dissection (II-IV) while bilateral neck dissection (II-IV) in control group. And other
      necessary standard treatments will be performed in both case group and control group.Allowed
      by the patients, the investigators will obtain archived tumor specimens and 10ml peripheral
      blood samples from the patients before surgery.

      The patients will be followed-up every three months after surgery, until three years after
      surgery or develop regional recurrence. During the follow-up procedure, radiological
      evaluation will be performed. The primary end point is the patient's pathologically confirmed
      regional lymph node recurrence. Patients with primary end point will enter the overall
      survival follow-up stage. At the median follow-up time of two years, the investigators will
      undergo a major regional control rate analysis, then, all patients will be followed-up to
      five years postoperatively, and the overall survival analysis will be performed.
