      suggest which technique is superior for closure of the skin incision with regards to wound
      complications, including wound separation and infection. As the morbidity associated with a
      cesarean delivery is usually related to wound complications, especially infection, we feel
      that it is important to examine this outcome by comparing the current skin closure
      techniques: staples versus suture.
