           Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX) is the mainstay of treatment. Regardless of
           the choice of first-line therapy, more than half of the patients with
           advanced/metastatic disease will progress within six months and will not survive more
           than one year.

        -  Immune cells (IC) are a significant part of the pancreatic tumor-associated stroma and
           play a fundamental part in maintaining a non-immunogenic and immuno-suppressive
           environment.

        -  IO (Immuno-Oncology drug) monotherapy is not effective in advanced pancreatic cancer;
           therefore, we need more active combination regimens including IO/IO or IO/chemotherapy,
           etc. Furthermore, we need biomarker study to uncover which population is an optimal
           target for this IO-based treatment strategy.

        -  Based on these rationale, we plan to conduct an open-label, phase 2 study to explore
           biomarkers and evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy
           combination in an advanced pancreatic cancer primary environment.
