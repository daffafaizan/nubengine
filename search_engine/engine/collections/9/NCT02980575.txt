      training as part of their treatment. However, they often find themselves limited by
      breathlessness and tiredness in their legs. These barriers limit how much a person may
      benefit from an exercise program and how well they may keep up with a recommended schedule of
      exercise at home. One way of reducing feelings of breathlessness and leg tiredness is by
      listening to music during exercise.

      The impact of adding music to exercise versus exercise alone has not been explored in the
      setting of pulmonary rehabilitation. This study is aimed at determining the effect of
      listening to music during exercise sessions on exercise capacity, symptom severity, quality
      of life and motivation to exercise.

      People with COPD will be randomly allocated to exercise plus music or exercise alone. A music
      therapist will aid with music selection for the exercise plus music group and the music will
      be loaded onto a portable device that participants will listen to with earbuds. All
      participants will complete assessments before starting a pulmonary rehabilitation program, at
      the end of the 8-10 week program and 6 months following completion of the program. They will
      complete walking tests, report symptom severity and complete a series of questionnaires
      asking about their quality of life, symptoms and keenness to exercise.
