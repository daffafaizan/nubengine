      groups. A description of each group is as follows:

        -  Group 1 (30 subjects): 5.0 mL of the 1.62% combined gel (containing 8.3 mg NES + 62.5 mg
           T) applied each day on the arms and shoulders

        -  Group 2 (15 subjects): 4.4 mL of the 1.62% AndrogelTM (containing 62.7 mg T) applied
           each day to the arms and shoulders

      The total duration of treatment will be 28 days followed by a 72 hour sampling period to
      assess half-life and a recovery period of at least 28 days, at which point the subjects will
      return to the clinic for an end of study visit.
