      has symptoms of ischemia, for instance intermittent claudication (pain during exercise).
      Diagnosis of atherosclerosis in the legs is normally done with an interventional x-ray-based
      angiography (DSA- digital subtraction angiography). This is uncomfortable for the patient,
      and associated with risks of complications (bleeding, vascular damage, embolism).A novel
      approach to diagnosing atherosclerosis is the use of magnetic resonance angiography. A
      variant of this is the whole body magnetic resonance angiography(WB-MRA), that produce a
      picture of the arteries in almost the whole body (excluding the coronary arteries). WB-MRA
      has a number of advantages compared to DSA. It does not use ionizing radiation, is not
      invasive, uses a contrast medium with fewer side affects and finally gives a covers a great
      deal of the arteries in the body.

      This study will compare WB-MRA with DSA in patients with symptoms of peripheral
      atherosclerosis in the lower legs. We will investigate 2 different contrast agents used for
      WB-MRA. The patients will be randomized to receive either the contrast medium Dotarem or the
      contrast medium Vasovist. In both groups we will compare the results of WB-MRA with DSA.
