      evidence-based VA community program of exercise for older adults with chronic stroke. The
      investigators' short-term objectives are to test study hypotheses using a Randomized Clinical
      Trial (RCT) with an Attention Control (also referred to as the "Sittercise" exercise
      program). The investigators will also explore factors related to exercise adherence in a
      community program for chronic stroke survivors. The investigators' longer term objective is
      to disseminate this model to facilitate the development of a network of community-based
      exercise programs for older adults with chronic stroke. In the RCT the investigators propose
      to offer courses in Office of Aging (OoA) Senior Centers and National Rehabilitation
      Hospital. At the conclusion of the research study, the OoA plans to continue offering
      APA-stroke courses. Through partnership, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the
      Administration of Aging (AoA) can potentially replicate this model at the community
      throughout the U.S. using local OoA Senior Centers and other facilities that would increase
      community access for Veterans.
