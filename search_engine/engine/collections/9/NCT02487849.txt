      recurrence-operation, if macroscopical tumor-free status (optimal cytoreductive operation)
      can be reached in combination with a platinum-based standard-chemotherapy.

      Several studies showed that the combination of optimal cytoreductive operation and HIPEC is a
      secure method of treatment. In comparison to operation and standard-chemotherapy it has a
      significant positive influence on survival rates. A hyperthermal intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      with Carboplatin is possible without severe side-effects.

      The combination of optimal cytoreductive operation (according to Desktop II criteria), HIPEC
      with Carboplatin and following platinum-based systemic chemotherapy should be carried out in
      patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence.

      Condition for applying HIPEC is reaching optimal cytoreduction (<0.5 cm visible tumour rest
      at the end of operation) and according to expert opinion a complicatin-free prolongation of
      narcosis after finishing the operative intervention. HIPEC is carried out additionally to
      standard therapy. If it can be carried out, the amount of systemically administered
      patinum-based chemotherapy is reduced for one cycle.

      This regime should be tested on safety in performance, quality of life for patients, and
      consequences for the following systemic chemotherapy.
