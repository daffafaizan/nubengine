      the major infectious disease threats to the human population. Annual vaccination is generally
      effective only against those strains included in the vaccine. Because of the frequent
      emergence of divergent variants and the periodic emergence of strains with novel
      hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase surface proteins that can result in global pandemics, the
      availability of potent antiviral agents for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza
      remains an urgent clinical and public health priority.
