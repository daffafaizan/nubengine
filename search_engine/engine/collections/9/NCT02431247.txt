    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (a medical
      research study in which neither the researchers nor the participant know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), active-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or
      procedure is compared to a standard [control] treatment or procedure) study. The study
      consists of 5 periods: a Screening period, Double-blind treatment period, Single-arm
      treatment period, Extension period and a Follow-up period. Participants will receive either
      darunavir (DRV)/ cobicistat (COBI)/emtricitabine (FTC) /tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) fixed
      dose combination (D/C/F/TAF FDC) or DRV/COBI FDC along with FTC/TDF FDC. Primarily percentage
      of participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than
      (<) 50 copies per milliliter (copies/ml) defined by snapshot analysis will be evaluated.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
