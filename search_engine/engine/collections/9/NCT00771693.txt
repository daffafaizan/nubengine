    
      Each patient is admitted in the fasting state, on 3 different occasions . Blood glucose
      levels are normalized using intravenous infusion of insulin aspart , to a blood glucose level
      of 6-7 mmol/l. 15 minutes after normalization ,and right before a standardized meal, the
      patient is given a subcutaneous injection of insulin aspart 0.1 U/kg, 0.2 U/kg or placebo.
      The order of injections in the cross over study is randomized and blinded to the patient and
      to the investigators. The patient eats the meal and is followed up for 90 minutes after
      completion of the meal.

      Blood tests for platelet function and other parameters are taken at 3 main points: 1. before
      glucose normalization.

      2. 15 minutes after glucose normalization, and right before the meal. 3. 90 minutes after the
      meal.

      Platelet function is evaluated by flow cytometry in whole blood (P- Selectin expression,
      Fibrinogen binding,aggregate formation: platelet- leukocyte, platelet-platelet,
      platelet-monocyte). Agonists that are used for platelet activation in flow cytometry are the
      thromboxane analogue U46619, ADP, and a collagen peptide that activates GPVI. Platelet
      adhesion is measured by the IMPACT cone and platelet analyser.
