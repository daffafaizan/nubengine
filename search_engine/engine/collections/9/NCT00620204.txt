      accompanying chest pain or discomfort. The precise mechanisms have not been established, but
      a reduction in NO (nitric oxide) production, an imbalance between endothelium-derived
      relaxing and contracting factors,or an injury of endothelium have been suggested.

      Impaired FMD(flow mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation) in the brachial artery was
      demonstrated in vasospastic angina,and improvement of endothelial dysfunction with treatment
      of statin is documented in several studies.

      So, we expect that statin treatment for vasospastic angina provide additional therapeutic
      effects via improvement of endothelial dysfunction.
