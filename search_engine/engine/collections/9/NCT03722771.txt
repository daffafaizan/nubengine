      greatest concern among dental practices for patients. Limited randomized clinical trials have
      demonstrated evidence-based results of lavender oil, despite being the most effective
      essential oil for anxiety and stress. The hypothesis of the present study was that the
      inhalation of lavender oil prior to oral surgical procedures may reduce anxiety and
      consequently may effect intra and post-operative blood pressure, inspiration and heart rate.
