    
      Glutathione (GSH) deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance
      and inflammation are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In prior studies, investigators have
      shown that GSH deficiency contributes to mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress, and
      that GSH deficiency can be corrected by supplementing its precursors glycine and cysteine
      (provided as N-acetylcysteine, NAC), with the combination termed GlyNAC.

      This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the effect of GlyNAC vs. alanine placebo
      supplementation provided for 24-weeks to patients with AD, and measure changes in cognition,
      GSH concentrations, oxidative stress, brain glucose uptake, brain inflammation and insulin
      resistance.

      Participants will be recruited, and enrolled only after meeting eligibility criteria. Before
      beginning study supplementation they will undergo imaging studies (MRI, Tau-PET, FDG-PET and
      TSPO-PET scans), and only the FDG- and TSPO-PET scans will be repeated after completing
      24-weeks of nutrient supplementation. Cognitive measurements, metabolic and mitochondrial
      measurements (as described below) will be done before supplementation, and after 12-weeks and
      24-weeks of completing supplementation.
