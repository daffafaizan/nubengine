      multi-center study that will include enrollment of up to 660 Subjects. Subjects will be
      followed for 90 days post stroke onset. The primary effectiveness endpoint for this study
      will be the binary endpoint that defines success as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of
      0-2 and failure as an mRS score of 3-6 at 90 days or the last rating. The secondary
      effectiveness endpoint for this study will be the change in NIHSS score from baseline to 90
      days or the last rating, analyzed across the full range of scores on the NIHSS. Tertiary
      effectiveness endpoints include: The 90-day binary endpoint, denoted as the 90-day bNIH
      score, based on the NIHSS score that defines a successful result as either (i) an improvement
      of 9 or more points on the NIHSS or (ii) a final NIHSS score of 0 or 1; the score on the mRS
      at 90 days or the last rating analyzed across the range of scores from 0 to 6 on the mRS
      scale, SIS-16 at 90 days; mortality at 30, 60 and 90 days.
