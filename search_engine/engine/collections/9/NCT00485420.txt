    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that includes 404 subjects, 300 subjects with
      bipolar disorder and 104 subjects with recurrent or chronic major depressive disorder. The
      study subject diagnostic groups (bipolar and depressive) are separately randomized to either
      usual care or to eCare and the data collected from the two diagnostic groups are analyzed
      separately.

      All subjects randomized to the eCare intervention are assigned an eCare nurse care manager in
      addition to one year of access to an Internet-delivered care management and patient
      self-management program. While both diagnostic groups receive similar Internet-delivered
      services for depression, the subjects with bipolar disorder receive special services for
      bipolar disorder. All subjects randomized to usual care will receive their normal psychiatric
      care and do not have access to the website.

      Study subjects are followed for 24 months and outcome measurements are taken every six months
      by telephone interviewers blinded to treatment assignment. Specific measures include
      depression and mania symptoms, severity, adherence with medication, general health,
      functioning at work and at home, satisfaction with care, and confidence in coping with their
      disorder. The primary outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder are the severity of
      depression and the severity of mania over time. The primary outcome for patients with
      recurrent or chronic depression is the severity of depression over time. The hypothesis is
      that Internet-based care management will have a favorable effect on the burden of bipolar
      disorder and/or on recurrent/chronic depression over time.
