    
      <Stage 1> In Stage 1, the trial will be conducted in 20 participants for 28 days in a single
      arm, open-label design. Artecom® will be administered orally once a day for 3 consecutive
      days. All subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety for 28 days.

      After the completion of the final participant in Stage 1, the DSMB will review the safety
      data from Stage 1 and determine whether to proceed to Stage 2.

      <Stage 2> In Stage 2, a total of 382 participants will be enrolled and randomized in a double
      blinded manner to receive either Artecom® or placebo (1:1 ratio) orally once a day for 3
      consecutive days. All subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety for 28 days.

      A second DSMB meeting and review of all available blinded safety data will occur after 191
      participants have completed Day 28. A final DSMB meeting will be held after the completion of
      a study assessment by the last participant.
