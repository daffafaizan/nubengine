    
      Study Success for Primary Endpoint A will be established if the proportion of subjects in the
      Treatment Group meeting the Subject Success Criteria A, is determined to be non-inferior to
      that of the Control Group (at two years) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis.

      Subject composite success requires the subject to achieve the Effectiveness Endpoint:

        1. Two year actuarial survival

        2. Freedom from procedures to repair, or replace the implanted device

        3. Freedom from stroke resulting in a Modified Rankin Score of >3 at the two-year follow-up

      Study Success for Primary Endpoint B will be established if the proportion of subjects in the
      Treatment Group meeting the Subject Success Criteria B is determined to be superior to that
      of the Control Group (at three years) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis.

      Subject composite success requires the subject to achieve the Effectiveness Endpoint:

        1. Three year survival

        2. Freedom from the serious adverse event of drive cable or pump pocket infection
