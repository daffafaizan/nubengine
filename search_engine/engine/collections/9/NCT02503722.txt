      I. To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sapanisertib (MLN0128)
      (TAK-228) in combination with osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with advanced epidermal
      growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and who
      are resistant to previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. (Dose escalation
      phase) II. To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in
      combination with osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC who are
      resistant to previous EGFR-TKI therapy with first line osimertinib. (Dose expansion phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in combination with osimertinib
      (AZD9291).

      II. To evaluate the response rate, disease control rate and progression free survival of the
      combination.

      III. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination by studying baseline
      biopsies, resistance biopsies, and serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sapanisertib.

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17,
      19, 22, 24, and 26 (day 1 is omitted in cycle 1). Patients also receive osimertinib PO QD on
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.
