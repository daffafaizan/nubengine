    
      This research study is evaluating how patient-reported outcomes (e.g. symptoms, quality of
      life) and biomarkers compare to standard of care clinical assessments such as imaging and
      tumor markers in predicting the clinical outcomes (e.g. disease progression and survival) in
      patient populations with colorectal, pancreatobiliary, or esophagogastric cancer that are
      receiving anti-cancer therapy Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center

        -  Patient reported outcomes will be collected through a series of self-administered
           questionnaires and blood draws will be used to obtain bio and tumor marker information.

        -  Information will also be collected from the participants electronic medical record.

        -  Tissue may be obtained for next-generation sequencing.

        -  The study will conclude after participants are no longer receiving anti-cancer
           therapies.

        -  It is expected that about 600 people will take part in this research study
