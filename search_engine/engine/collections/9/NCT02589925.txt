      disease with dementia DEMPARK-DBS STUDY

      Indication: Parkinson's disease with mild to moderate dementia

      Primary Objective: To provide a proof of safety of combined bilateral subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) and basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) stimulation in treating levodopa responsive motor
      symptoms of Parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction in patients with advanced Parkinson's
      disease having mild to moderate dementia.

      Exploratory Objectives: To determine if additional NBM stimulation improves or slows
      progression of cognitive decline in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease having mild to
      moderate dementia

      Test Device: Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) Neuromodulation Vercise™ System. A
      neurostimulation device consisting of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), integrated
      rechargeable battery, two DBS leads, a splitter allowing to control four electrodes, surgical
      tools, and external devices (programming system, remote control, and charging system).

      Device Description: The Vercise™ system IPG is a multiple independent current controlled
      pulse generator. The system is identical in form factor and dimensions to the commercially
      available 22-cc Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation II IPG. To allow the delivery of
      stimulation pulses to four DBS electrodes with different stimulation frequencies (100-200 Hz
      at the STN and 20-80 Hz at the NBM) the splitter of the Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation
      system will be used.

      Study Design: Prospective single center Phase 1b study with double-blind randomized delayed
      activation of basal nucleus of Meynert neurostimulation (staggered onset design)

      Planned Number of Subjects: 12 patients

      Planned Number of Sites / Countries: Single center in Germany

      Primary Endpoint: Safety of combined bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and basal nucleus of
      Meynert (NBM) stimulation as determined by spontaneously reported adverse events.

      Statistical Methods Primary Statistical Hypothesis Sample size considerations: Emre et al
      NEJM 2004 found a 2.1±8.2 point improvement on the ADAS-cog with rivastigmine treatment
      compared to a worsening of 0.7±7.5 points with placebo after 24 weeks (baseline 23.8±10.2
      points). There is currently no data to estimate treatment effect size and variability of NBM
      DBS. Clearly such small mean differences in combination with comparatively large standard
      deviations shown by the rivastigmine study are detectable with appropriate power only with
      sample sizes (2*125 = 250) far away from sample sizes planned for this study. But we hope to
      get hints to considerably larger effects for NBM DBS. Within a purely explorative analysis we
      will test the null hypothesis of equal mean ADAS-cog change scores from visit 1 to visit 2
      for both study treatments (STN-DBS + NBM-DBS versus STN-DBS + sham-DBS) by an analysis of
      covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline ADAS-cog as covariate. Assuming a small to moderate
      correlation between baseline ADAS-cog and ADAS-cog change score from visit 1 to visit 2 a
      sample size of 2*5 = 10 patients ensures a power of 84% to detect a standardized mean
      difference of 2.0 as significant deviation from the null hypothesis of equal mean change
      scores for both treatments at significance level 0.05. That means we are able to detect only
      very large effects as significant, but this is not the main objective of this pilot study.

      This study is exploratory to provide the necessary data for sample size considerations of a
      possible subsequent pivotal trial.
