    
      Participants:

      Participants will be residents, attendees and/or members of assisted living locations and/or
      dementia (or related) day programs. There will be two groups: an art training group and a
      waitlist control group.

      Data Analysis:

        1. For primary measures, t-tests on pre-post difference scores comparing art training and
           waitlist groups.

        2. For possible confounding effects, tests for confounds related to background factors
           (socioeconomic status, education level, gender, activity participation).

      Procedure:

      A randomized controlled trial design will be utilized to assess two groups of dementia
      patients: an art training experimental group and a structured usual-activity waitlist control
      group. The experimental group will participate in a visual art training program and the
      waitlist control group will participate in their usual structured group activities. The
      waitlist control group will receive the art training program once post-testing is complete.
      Before, during, and/or after the art programs and/or control activities, participants will be
      observed and complete assessments.
