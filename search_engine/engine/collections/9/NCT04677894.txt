      pediatric patients, awake fiberoptic intubation is difficult or even impossible . The video
      laryngoscope is a new tool produced by combining video technology and laryngoscope. Published
      studies on the video laryngoscope were mostly performed in adults . In this study, we used a
      Macintosh laryngoscope, which is a routinely used tool in anesthesiology, and a McGrath video
      laryngoscope, which is a type of a newly developed video laryngoscope that has not widely
      been used in the pediatric age group. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of
      Macintosh laryngoscopy and McGrath videolaryngoscopy on hemodynamic parameters in pediatric
      patients who were scheduled to undergo elective dental surgery and required intubation for
      the application of general anesthesia. We also evaluated whether Macintosh laryngoscopy and
      McGrath videolaryngoscopy improved the stress response and whether these approaches
      facilitated the intubation procedure.
