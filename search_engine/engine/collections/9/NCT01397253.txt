      care providers (PCPs) is often suboptimal. Hospital-based information systems can improve
      communication by automating information exchange between hospital physicians and PCPs, and
      perhaps, as a result, improve the quality and safety of health care. MedTrak, the University
      of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic physician communication tool, has proven
      successful and is poised to move forward with an initiative the investigators call virtual
      continuity, allowing PCPs to follow their patients electronically if they cannot do so
      physically. Virtual continuity will include: emails to PCPs triggered by clinical events with
      embedded links to electronic medical record data and communication portals, medication lists
      electronically delivered to PCPs at admission and discharge, and immediate PCP notification
      of discharge with pertinent clinical details. To evaluate virtual continuity, the
      investigators will examine the frequency of discharge medication errors in complex medical
      patients using a pre-post study design of virtual continuity compared to usual communication.
      Medication errors will be ascertained using accepted methods. The investigators will also
      investigate differences in rehospitalization, post discharge emergency department visit and
      PCP follow up rates. The IT cost of implementing and maintaining the virtual continuity
      intervention will also be assessed. Virtual continuity will allow PCPs to participate more
      directly in the care of their hospitalized patients. Improved communication could lead to
      higher-quality patient care and greater patient care safety for hospitalized patients with
      complex medical problems.
