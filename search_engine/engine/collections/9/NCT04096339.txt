      procedures in the order assigned by the randomization sheet. During the procedure, the
      endoscopist and anesthesiologists will collect data including but not limited to vital signs
      (heart rate, blood oxygen level, blood pressure) and level of sedation through the Bispectral
      Index Monitor (BIS). After completing the procedures, the patient will be approached in the
      recovery room by the study coordinator who will administer the Modified Post Anesthesia
      Discharge Scoring System (M-PADSS) scale every 5 minutes until a score of 9 or higher is
      obtained on two consecutive attempts. 24 hours following the procedure, the study coordinator
      will call the patient in order to assess the patient's cognitive function and drowsiness
      after they were discharged from the endoscopy unit.
