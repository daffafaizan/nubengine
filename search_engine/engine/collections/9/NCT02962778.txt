      whether RAS peptides could be used as clinical biomarkers in patients receiving
      antihypertensive treatment.

      Drug-specific RAS profiles first characterized in healthy normotensive subjects (EKBB 255/12;
      ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01771783) are presently investigated in patients with newly
      diagnosed arterial hypertension (EKNZ 2015-081; clinicaltrials.gov identifier (ID)
      NCT02449811). With this observational study RAS peptide profiles will be characterized in
      patients with treatment resistant hypertension. Data generated by this study will show
      whether RAS peptide profiles merit further evaluation as clinical biomarkers in this complex
      patient group.
