      Skin aging, a major concern for females, is closely associated with factors including
      genetics, age and UV exposure.

      Its first signs include reduced epidermal and dermal thickness, reduced water content in the
      stratum corneum causing the "dry look" of skin.

      The ability of dermal fibroblasts to synthesize collagen fibers is reduced bring the
      decreased collagen content, and the intradermal elastic fibers are denatured and lose
      elasticity. The extracellular matrix of the dermis, such as hyaluronic acid, are also
      decreasing year by year.

      These are the primary causes of wrinkle formation, loosening and drooping. The anti-aging
      product used in this study, P29429-01, is developed and manufactured by Orient EuroPharma.
      Its main ingredients include Hesperetin, a citrus bioflavonoid of antioxidant activity
      extracted from citrus peel. It is widely used in cosmetic products. Sodium cyclic
      lysophosphatidic acid, a substance extracted from soybean, increases hyaluronic acid and
      collagen synthesis in the skin to achieve hydration and anti-aging.

      In this study, subjects are subject to a 4-week washout period before using P29429-01 on full
      face twice a day for 12-week. A skin analyzer is used to obtain skin aging indices to assess
      the efficacy and safety of P29429-01.

      Study Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of P29429-01 as a skin care
      product to manage skin aging in women subjects 40-65 years of age who show manifestations of
      facial skin aging. Subjects are to undergo a 4-week washout period before using P29429-01 on
      the face for 12 weeks. A skin analyzer is used to obtain skin aging indices for said
      assessment.
