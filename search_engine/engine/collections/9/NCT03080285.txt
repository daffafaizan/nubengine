    
      In a randomized multi-center controlled clinical trial, children younger than 7 years with
      moderate amblyopia (visual acuity in the range of 20/40 to 20/100) would be included to
      receive treatment with either a conventional patch or an over-glasses patch. The patients
      will be prescribed 2 hours of patching per day for the sound eye. Best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA) and stereopsis will be investigated and ATI questionnaires be collected from
      parents at 5 weeks and 17 weeks after the initiation of treatment.
