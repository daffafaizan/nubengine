      cancer, accounting for about 20-50% of HER2 positive breast cancer. Treatment strategy ranged
      from local therapies to systemic anti-HER2 therapies, prognosis of patients with brain
      metastases remains poor. Previous clinical trials had demonstrated the efficacy of
      trastuzumab and TKIs for brain metastasis.

      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We
      designed the study to explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab
      and abraxane in HER2-positive MBC with brain metastasis.
