      arrest remains a challenge. Previous studies have shown that the cardiac output varies widely
      even among professional helpers. This is especially due to some very different mean
      frequencies of cardiac compression wich vary from 60 to 160/min for paramedics. Aim of this
      study is to investigate whether the use of feedback-devices during cardiac-pulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) can lead to an improvement of the cardiac output and may improve
      survival.

      For this, we examine the impact of different feedback-methods on the frequence-variety on
      manikin by lay rescuers. Overall, we compare three different devices for feedback during CPR.
      The subjects for this study are lay rescuers who perform a 5 minute chest-compression-only
      CPR.
