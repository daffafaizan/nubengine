      production. However, previous studies in healthy subjects have demonstrated that a sudden and
      sustained decrease in tissue oxygen level, aside from an absolute low level of tissue oxygen
      tension, could also act as a trigger for EPO production. To confirm these observations and to
      clarify an eventual role of free oxygen radicals and antioxidants, hypobaric pure oxygen will
      be administered to healthy subjects.

      The major physiologic function of EPO is thought to be the induction of erythropoiesis.
      However, a growing body of evidence indicates that EPO has tissue-protective effects and
      prevents tissue damage during ischemia. In an ex vivo proof-of-concept, protective effects of
      EPO have been shown in human myocardium.

      The second goal of our study is to observe the cardioprotective effects of increased
      endogenous EPO, induced after normobaric oxygen breathing.
