      pancreatodudodenectomy, the incidence of which is estimated between 10 and 40% in the
      literature. Its occurrence leads to an alteration in post-operative quality of life
      (maintenance or resting of the nasogastric tube) and is the primary reason an increase in the
      length of hospital stay and therefore the cost of treatment. In addition, it predisposes to
      the risk of inhalation pneumopathy, which increases the risk of post-operative death. Various
      technical surgical points have been suggested by retrospective studies to reduce its
      incidence (pyloric preservation, respect for the left gastric vein, ante-colic positioning of
      the Child's handle, making a Y-shaped handle) but without ever being validated in randomized
      prospective studies.

      Recently three retrospective studies have highlighted the interest of performing a side to
      side l rather than an end to side gastro-jejunal anastomosis to reduce the rate of
      post-operative delayed gastric emptying.
