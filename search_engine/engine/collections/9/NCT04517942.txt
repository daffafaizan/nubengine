      deliver a universal, inclusive body image program for college students, with benefit above
      and beyond a waitlist control condition. The second trial of the EVERYbody Project aimed to
      further evaluate the intervention using a more disseminable facilitator model: trained
      college student peer leaders. It also utilized a more rigorous comparison condition, where
      peer leaders conducted the two-session EVERYbody Project program or a time-matched video and
      expressive writing intervention. College students within a university in the Pacific
      Northwest United States were invited to participate in programming (universal intervention
      target). Quantitative assessment included a comparison of changes in eating disorder risk
      factor outcomes across randomization conditions at pre- and post-intervention and one-month
      follow-up. Feasibility and acceptability explored the impact of the peer delivered program
      within universal college student audiences.
