      deficit disorder (ADHD) patients compared to healthy subjects under different doses of
      Ritalin (methylphenidate) treatment. All subjects will undergo 1-4 EEG sessions. In each
      session we will use a different dose of Ritalin or placebo. A detailed neuropsychological
      tests will be done during the EEG recording. A powerful machine-learning techniques will be
      used in order to find a specific signature of ADHD and Ritalin treatment in the EEG
      recording.
