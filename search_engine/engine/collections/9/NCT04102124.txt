      to evaluate SHR3680 combined with SHR3162 and SHR3680 single drug to improve Metastatic
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Abiraterone and
      Docetaxel whether the patient's overall survival (OS) is superior to placebo. The Stage I
      part is a dose-escalation and -expansion study. Approximately 18~24 patients in Stage I will
      receive fixed-dose of orally SHR3680 and only one of two dose levels of orally SHR3162. The
      Primary endpoints of the Stage I are incidence of adverse events(AE) and recommended phase 2
      dose(RP2D). The Stage II part is a randomized , double-blind study. Approximately 90~120
      patients in Stage II will receive SHR3162 combined with SHR3680, in which one fixed-dose
      levels of SHR3162 will be selected based on the result of the Stage I.The Primary endpoint of
      the Stage II is overall survival(OS).
