      coronary stent, still on DAPT, undergoing cardiac and non cardiac surgery within 12 months
      from coronary stent implantation.

      The MONET BRIDGE study is designed to assess the use of cangrelor as a platelet-inhibiting
      bridge for patients who discontinue DAPT before cardiac and non cardiac surgery within 12
      months from coronary stent implantation. It seeks to determine if initiation of a prolonged
      cangrelor infusion maintains effective platelet inhibition after discontinuation of P2Y12 and
      whether a cangrelor infusion before cardiac and non cardiac procedures is safe.

      The primary efficacy objective of this study is to demonstrate that a cangrelor infusion will
      maintain levels of residual platelet reactivity (PRU < 208) as measured by Accriva VerifyNowÂ®
      P2Y12 assay.

      The main safety objective is to demonstrate that patients receiving cangrelor infusion before
      cardiac and non cardiac surgery have an acceptable safety profile and can undergo surgery
      without excessive bleeding peri-operatively.
