      population was incorporated from studies that were previoiusly published.

      We will perform a systemic review of previously published data and an updated patient-level
      meta-analysis of studies, including the most recent publications. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, the United States National Institutes of Health
      registry of clinical trials, and relevant websites were searched for pertinent published
      studies. The electronic search strategy was complemented by manual examination of references
      cited by included articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. No restrictions
      were imposed on language, study period, or sample size. The search keywords include "acute
      coronary syndrome", "ACS", "primary", "percutaneous coronary intervention", "PCI",
      "de-escalation", "guided", "guide", "antiplatelet", "P2Y12 inhibitor", "P2Y12", "dual
      antiplatelet therapy", "DAPT".

      Articles were included when they met the following prespecified criteria: (1) included the
      ACS patients who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES); (2) maintained DAPT for 1 year;
      (3) de-escalation strategy of DAPT was clearly defined; (4) clinical outcomes, including
      ischemic and bleeding events, were clearly reported; (5) randomized controlled trials were
      considered for inclusion. Two independent investigators screened titles and abstracts,
      identified duplicated studies, performed full-article reviews, and determined the study
      inclusion. The third investigator supervised the searching process and adjudicated all the
      disagreements.

      After selecting eligible RCTs, we will incorporate all known randomized controlled trials
      requesting individual patient data from the principal investigator of each trial.
