      informed consent. Subjects will be randomized to conventional insertion arm and balloon
      inflated insertion arm. All patients will be sedated according to SNUH endoscopy center
      protocol. Conventional insertion will be done in conventional insertion group, and balloon
      inflation before the start of procedure will be done in balloon inflated insertion arm. After
      the EUS procedure is finished, subject will be moved to a recovery room. As soon as the
      subject is recovered from sedation, throat pain will be assessed in NRS scale and be
      recoreded. Information of insertion failure and balloon damage during insertion will be also
      collected.
