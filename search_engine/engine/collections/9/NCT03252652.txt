      are thromboembolic in nature, arising from atherosclerotic plaques. Several studies have
      reported racial differences in the severity and distribution of carotid atherosclerosis. In
      the United States and Western communities, Extra-cranial carotid artery disease was estimated
      to be responsible for 20-30% of strokes. Little is known about the prevalence and
      distribution of carotid disease among the populations in the developing countries.

      Vascular duplex ultrasound is a useful, cheap and available diagnostic tool for assessing
      cranial vascular disease. Duplex ultrasound can be highly reliable with proper technique,
      without the risk of radiation in other imaging modalities, is well tolerated by all patients
      including those who are claustrophobic in MRI machines, and has much less risks compared to
      conventional angiography studies.

      Although vascular duplex has been used for years yet there is little researches had been done
      on normal population in the developing countries to collect results and compare it to the
      parameters that was collected and reviewed in the western developed populations.

      The parameters that would be used in this study include both the data collected by static and
      dynamic duplex scan which are the intimal-medial thickness, the vessels' diameter, peak flow
      velocity and peak flow volume both systolic and diastolic for either extra- or intra-cranial
      vessels.
