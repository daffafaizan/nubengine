    
      Participants:

      Investigators aim to recruit a minimum of 30 participants aged 65 years or above through
      convenience sampling at an senior activity centre in the Municipality of Aalborg.
      Participants inclusion critiria is age about 65, the ability to stand for 30 seconds unaided
      and the ability to walk 8 meters. Exclusion critiria is severe cognitive impairment (e.g.,
      dementia).

      Procedure:

      Each participant will undergo two testdays separated by approximately two weeks. Both
      testdays have the same number and order of tests and are placed approximately the same time
      of the day. At the first testday descriptive information for each participant is collected.

      Measuring device:

      The Nintendo Wii Balance Board (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) is a small portable force plate
      measuring sway ellipse area and sway speed.

      Analysis:

      Will include intra-rater reliability for each test and agreement between the two.
      Calculations of balance/gait costs will be made to unify the unit and to compare the two
      tests to each other. Results shown by intraclass correlation coeffients and Bland Altman
      plots.
