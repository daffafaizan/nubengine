    
      Phase 1 First-in Human randomized, open-label, active control standard of care study of the
      safety of HBN-1 administered as pharmacologically induced hypothermia as an adjunct to
      standard of care targeted temperature management in adult patients who have experienced
      out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest.

      HBN-1 will be administered as an IV solution according to a weight-based escalating loading
      dose infusion rate scheme involving three sequential cohorts with a loading dose of HBN 1
      administered over 60 minutes (Cohort A), 45 minutes (Cohort B), or 30 minutes (Cohort C). For
      all cohorts, the loading dose will be followed by a 12-hour maintenance infusion of HBN-1.

      Dosing cohorts will include a minimum of 6 subjects randomized in a 2:1 ratio of HBN-1 plus
      standard of care versus standard of care alone. Individual cohorts may be expanded to up to a
      maximum of 12 subjects . If the cohort is expanded, the additional subjects will receive
      HBN-1 + SOC.

      During the loading dose and maintenance infusion, physical exam, temperature, assessment of
      shivering, ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory, blood alcohol level, and neurologic status
      will be monitored.
