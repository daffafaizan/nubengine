      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of
      vorinostat (SAHA) and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable epithelial
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Determine tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine IV over 1-2
      hours on days 3 and 10. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA and gemcitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
