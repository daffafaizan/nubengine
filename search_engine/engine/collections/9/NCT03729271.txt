      with IBS-D who are more likely to respond to rifaximin. Participating patients will complete
      a one week screening period when brief daily survey will be answered. Eligible patients will
      proceed with the treatment phase of the study, when patients will receive a 14 day course of
      rifaximin. All included patients will complete glucose and lactulose hydrogen breath tests
      before and after rifaximin treatment. Biological samples (e.g. blood, stool) will be
      collected at pre-determined time points and patients will answer daily brief survey for the
      duration of the study.

      It is anticipated that 210 patients will be screened to reach a goal of enrolling 110
      patients for the treatment phase of the study.
