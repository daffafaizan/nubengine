      areas, namely, prebiotics, probiotics and post-biotics. The first component, prebiotics,
      involve non-digestible food ingredients, typically oligosaccharides which act by beneficially
      affecting the host by stimulating growth, activity, or in fact both of specific intestinal
      bacteria.

      The probiotic component refers to the augmentation or addition of bacteria to enhance and
      support the various beneficial bacteria that are inherent to the gastrointestinal tract. The
      bio-fermented Microbiotic Composite™ is a consortium of bacteria which can play a significant
      physiological role as a probiotic. This theory, termed the microbial consortium theory
      suggests that rather than a cumulative effect by the bacteria, there is in fact combinatorial
      affect by the use of several species.

      The final component post-biotics, in general, mimic the beneficial health promoting effects
      of probiotics whilst avoiding the risk of taking live micro-organisms within the
      gastrointestinal tract, especially in populations such as infants and the elderly in whom the
      intestinal barriers, as well as, innate immune defenses can be impaired. The term typically
      encompasses a vast plethora of byproducts, know as metabolites, produced and secreted by the
      bacteria in response to their environment.
