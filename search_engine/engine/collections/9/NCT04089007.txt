      Quality of life is reduced due to the daytime consequences of chronic sleep deprivation such
      as sleepiness, fatigue, low mood, and inattentiveness at school. Although this sleep debt
      occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents, it significantly increases their risk of development
      of the chronic health conditions (cardiovascular disease and depression) and forms of
      accidental injury (motor vehicle accidents) that place the greatest demands on our health
      care system. Despite increased recognition of adequate sleep as a key contributor to health,
      there exist few effective interventions to promote sleep in adolescents. This study is
      designed to determine compliance, feasibility and preliminary data on health outcomes
      (nocturnal sleep measured objectively by actigraphy; daytime sleepiness; anxiety; depression;
      unintentional injuries; morning school attendance). This study will be a pilot RCT,
      randomizing 76 adolescents to one of two groups (i.e. 38 per group). Study arms will include
      a control group and intervention group (activity monitoring device with custom application).
      Mobile health, user-friendly low-intensity interventions with wearable sleep sensors and
      tailored feedback may help many adolescents to increase the amount of sleep they achieve.
