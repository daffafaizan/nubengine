      dulaglutide regarding changes in sexuality, the mood and the reproductive axis in healthy
      men.

      The study consists of following two phases:

        -  Phase a (V1a-Ev2a): baseline evaluation (V1a), application of the trial medication
           (dulaglutide or placebo) during 4 weeks (V1a-V4a), evaluation of the primary and
           secondary outcomes (V2a-V4a, Ev1a), followed by a washout period of at minimum 28 days
           before evaluation of the last secondary outcome (Ev2a) and cross-over

        -  Phase b (V1b-Ev2b): baseline evaluation (V1b), application of the trial medication
           (dulaglutide or placebo) during further 4 weeks (V1b-V4b), evaluation of the primary and
           secondary outcomes (V2b-V4b, Ev1b), followed by a washout period of at minimum 28 days
           before evaluation of the last secondary outcome (Ev2b) and study end after study
           termination visit (STV).
