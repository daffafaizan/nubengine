      study. After obtaining informed consent and performance of screening procedures, patients who
      met all inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to one of two treatment regimens as
      follows:

        -  75 µg/kg treatment regimen

        -  225 µg/kg treatment regimen

      For each treatment regimen there were two phases:

        -  Phase A (Initial phase)

        -  Phase B (Treatment phase)

      The assigned treatment regimen was the dose administered in Phase A and was the starting dose
      in Phase B.
