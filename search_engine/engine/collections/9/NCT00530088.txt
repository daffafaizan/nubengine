        -  To determine the response of patients with recurrent dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma
           in situ, or stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or the larynx treated
           with photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium.

        -  To identify the local toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive porfimer sodium subcutaneously followed by photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) comprising laser light delivered by a single or a diffuser (i.e., for broad areas of
      dysplasia) fiberoptic lens fiber. Patients with incompletely treated or missed sites of
      disease may receive another dose of laser light on day 5 without additional porfimer sodium.
      Patients with multicentric disease may undergo additional PDT at least 4-6 weeks after the
      initial treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 1-2 months.
