      consent form. Subsequently, they will be randomly allocated to three groups: (i) group 6 Hz:
      full body vibration (frequency 6 Hz, amplitude 4 mm, five cycles lasting 1 minutes and
      interval between cycles of 1 minute) , (ii) 25 Hz group: full body vibration (25 Hz
      frequency, 4 mm amplitude, five cycles lasting 1 minute and interval between 1 minute cycles)
      and (iii) sham group: The sham vibration will be performed with the platform disconnected.
      Additionally, a sound device will be connected producing a noise similar to that of the
      connected platform for a time equivalent to that of the treatment protocol. The patient will
      be instructed to position himself standing on the platform, with a semi knee flexion in order
      that the vibration wave does not propagate to the head. The allocation will be made randomly
      among individuals, using a random sequence table generated by the website
      www.randomization.com. There will be a washout time of at least one week between one
      intervention and another. All evaluations took place inside the laboratory, which has all the
      equipment for the evaluation. The evaluations will take place immediately before the
      intervention and immediately after.
