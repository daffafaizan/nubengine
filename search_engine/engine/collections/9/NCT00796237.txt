      post-menopausal women and children with cerebral palsy. In addition to the apparent benefits
      on bone health, WBV has been shown to increase muscle strength, postural control, muscular
      blood flow and oxygen uptake in various populations. Therefore, WBV can potentially be used
      as a tool to improve muscle strength, balance, and cardiovascular performance, especially for
      those with relatively low level of functioning. Stroke patients are therefore possible
      beneficiaries of WBV, as they often demonstrate muscle weakness, balance deficits, and poor
      cardiovascular function, in addition to bone loss. Only one pilot study has examined the
      effects of WBV in stroke patients. Van Nes et al.showed that postural stability in chronic
      stroke patients is improved after a few minutes of WBV at 30Hz and 3mm amplitude. The overall
      aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration is beneficial in
      promoting bone turnover, physical fitness and neuromotor performance in patients with
      subacute stroke.
