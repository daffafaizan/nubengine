    
      This study investigated the effects of CarnipureTM, a high-quality L-carnitine ingredient, on
      long term (5 weeks) recovery, muscle damage, and SOD status in a population of males and
      females while training two days per week. The primary outcomes defining recovery were changes
      in serum creatine kinase levels and perceptual changes in recovery. Supporting variables
      included an assessment of strength and power as a functional indicator of recovery. This
      study would be the first to examine the effects of CarnipureTM on long-term recovery. Our
      primary hypothesis was that L-carnitine supplementation would reduce muscle damage and
      improve perceptual measures of recovery. Our secondary hypotheses were that L-carnitine
      supplementation would better sustain strength and power and elevate SOD status.

      In totality, the study will last 5-weeks, consisting of supplementation with maintenance
      exercise performed 2 days per week, at home. Week 5 will consist of a pre-training
      assessment, an intense lower-body strength endurance training day, and subsequent testing
      48-hour testing (Post-Week 5). The baseline testing (will be performed on approximately 10
      subjects per day over the course of 4 days) and will consist of the following measures:

        -  DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) Body Composition Analysis

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      For the first 4 weeks of training, participants will be asked to workout 2 days per week at
      home.

      On Monday of week five, 20 subjects will be assessed on the following measures:

        -  DXA

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      On Tuesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested on Monday, will go through an intense lower
      body, strength endurance protocol, and the leftover 20 subjects will go through the following
      assessments:

        -  DXA

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample

      On Wednesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Monday, will have a day to rest. The 20
      subjects that tested Tuesday, will go through an intense lower body strength endurance
      protocol.

        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample (for blood lactate)

      On Thursday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will have the day off, while the
      20 subjects that tested Monday will be assessed on the following measures:

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      On Friday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will be assessed on the following
      measures:

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      Participation will be sought from 80 male and female subjects ranging from 21 to 65 years old
      who are active (i.e. 30 minutes per week of moderate activity classified as greater than 50 %
      of their heart rate (HR) max 3 days â€¢ week-1). Two cohorts of 40 subjects will be examined in
      the study.

      The supplement will be administered as a dose of 2g of Carnipure (L-carnitine), per day for
      the duration of the study. Placebo and treatment conditions will be administered in visually
      identical capsules. Statistical analysis will be carried out on the entire study population
      and on the female study population independently.
