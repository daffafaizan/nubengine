      diplegia. The treatment includes soft tissue and bony correction. Especially the bony
      procedures e.g. femoral derotation osteotomies have proven to be effective both in short term
      and long term evaluation. Nonetheless there is still a relevant number of patients that
      suffer from over- or under-correction and recurrence over time. The reasons are diverse and
      include false measurement of the derotation in OR.

      The study now evaluates electromagnetic tracking for femoral derotation to improve these
      results.

      The patients are recruited from the outpatients department and included if they meet the
      criteria.

      A baseline rotational CT scan and a 3-D-gait analysis are performed and the derotation
      measured with the EMT system in OR. The results of the measurement is invisible and unknown
      to the surgeon as the system unit is controlled by a technician.

      The surgical procedure follows standard rules and does not need alterations because of the
      study.

      After the operation a second rotational CT scan is performed and the derotation precisely
      evaluated by two raters and later compared to the results of the electromagnetic tracking
      system.
