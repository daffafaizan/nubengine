      consequences. A greater understanding of the immunologic and parasitologic factors associated
      with infection and disease is badly needed, and will accelerate the development of highly
      protective vaccines for both mothers and children. Pregnancy malaria is associated with low
      birth weight, maternal anemia, and gestational hypertension, and both inflammation and the
      fetal response to infection may contribute to these poor outcomes. Childhood malaria is a
      major cause of mortality, and we have found that risk of childhood malaria is related to in
      utero exposure to pregnancy malaria, as well as other host factors like iron status and
      constitutive cytokine levels. Pregnancy malaria is caused by a distinct parasite binding
      phenotype, and as our primary hypothesis in this study we speculate that severe childhood
      malaria parasites may also have distinct features. A longitudinal cohort study will be
      conducted in Ouelessebougou, Mali an area of intense seasonal transmission. Up to 2000
      pregnant women and their infants and 2000 children ages 0 - 3 will be enrolled and followed
      to age 5 years, with clinical evaluation and periodic venous and peripheral blood samples
      obtained. In addition, 3000 febrile hospitalized and non-hospitalized children up to age 10
      years will be enrolled at the Ouelessebougou district health centers or the Gabriel
      Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Pediatric Hospital in Bamako, Mali, with acute and convalescent
      samples being obtained and 500 pregnant women enrolled at the health centers and hospital in
      Ouelessebougou district or the Gabriel Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Hospital in Bamako for a
      case-control study on pregnancy malaria and preeclampsia. Clinical, parasitologic and host
      response (including immunologic) endpoints will be analyzed using appropriate statistical
      methods, including possible confounders, to determine factors associated with infection and
      disease in pregnant woman and young children.
