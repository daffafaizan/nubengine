      critical period. Patients must adjust to changes in their medications, follow up with family
      doctors and other specialists and know what symptoms should prompt a return to hospital. The
      community physicians who follow them rely on information from their hospitalization to
      facilitate this transition, and provide continuity of care.

      Communication between hospital and community physicians is essential to this process, and has
      traditionally been accomplished by a dictated discharge summary. Previous studies have shown
      that while dictated discharge summaries can be inaccurate, incomplete, or untimely, computer
      generated summaries are produced more quickly and accurately. Moreover, database-generated
      discharge summaries are preferred by physicians in the community.

      We have designed a web-based computer program with quality assurance features that
      automatically generates timely discharge summaries. We aim to study this program over a 2
      month period on our general medicine unit by means of a randomized controlled trial. Our
      hypothesis is that community physicians will prefer the computer generated summaries, over
      the standard dictated summaries. If effective, our system could be implemented more widely,
      and would stand to improve communication with community physicians, continuity of care, and
      patient safety.
