    
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, find an
      appropriate dose to optimize safety and efficacy, and evaluate clinical activity of PBCAR20A
      in subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or r/r Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). Before initiating PBCAR20A,
      subjects will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy composed of fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, subjects will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR20A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period
      through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR20A will be followed in a separate
      long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.
