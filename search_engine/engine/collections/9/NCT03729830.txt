    
      STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) -- To obtain data for the Rhythmiaâ„¢ Mapping System in conjunction with
      Boston Scientific Open-Irrigated (OI) Catheters for ablation of Paroxysmal Atrial
      Fibrillation (PAF) according to current international and local guidelines.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE -- To assess acute and long-term outcomes for the Rhythmia Mapping System
      in conjunction with Boston Scientific Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheters to treat de novo
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation. De Novo PAF is defined as subjects undergoing first ablation
      procedure for PAF with no prior left atrial ablation (RF, Cryo, Surgical).

      INDICATION(S) FOR USE -- Study devices will be used per approved Indications for Use for each
      geography.

      DEVICES / SYSTEM USED IN THE STUDY -- The study will include the following Boston Scientific
      Open-Irrigated Catheters in geographies where commercially approved for PAF ablation:

        -  Blazer Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter

        -  IntellaNav Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter

        -  IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter

        -  IntellaTip MiFi Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter

        -  Rhythmia Mapping System Gen 1or Rhythmia HDx, equipped with Software 1.4 or any
           successive commercially approved versions.

        -  IntellaMap Orion Catheter

      CONTROL DEVICE -- There are no control devices in this study

      STUDY DESIGN -- Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter (global), post approval clinical
      study (PAS). All subjects fitting the enrollment criteria, signing the consent and undergoing
      the index procedure with the study devices will be followed up for three years to complete
      the PAS design mandated from the FDA to collect post-market data for Boston Scientific
      Open-Irrigated Catheters and will be followed for three years.

      PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS -- The study will enroll 415 subjects.

      PLANNED NUMBER OF SITES / COUNTRIES -- The study is global (US, EU, Asia-Pacific) with 25-50
      centers. A minimum of 50% of the sites will be selected from the US. No study site will be
      allowed to contribute more than 41 subjects (10% of the 415 enrollments requirement).

      FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE -- Study Follow-ups are at: pre-discharge, 1 month (phone check), 3 months
      (blanking period), 6 months (phone check), 12 months, 24 months and 36 months.

      STUDY DURATION -- Study is expected to be completed in approximately five years (12-24 month
      enrollment period with three year follow-up).

      PARTICIPANT DURATION -- The study duration for each subject is expected to be approximately
      three years.
