      and a critical passage for the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence. Vaginal cuff dehiscence is a
      severe adverse event and occurs more frequently after total laparoscopic hysterectomy
      (0.3-3.1 %) compared to abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy

      Barbed suture is a new type of sutures introduced to facilitate laparoscopic suturing.When
      compared with conventional smooth suture, barbed suture has external barbs that anchor the
      suture to the tissues and prevent the retrograde movement of suture thread during suturing.
      Consequently, laparoscopic suturing can be performed easily without the need for suture
      locking, without applying traction on suture thread by the assistant and without tying knots
      at both ends of the suture line In gynecology, barbed sutures have been used in minimally
      invasive ,myomectomy hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy and sacrocolpopexy. There is a growing
      body of evidence that the use of barbed sutures in these procedures facilitates laparoscopic
      suturing and significantly reduces suturing time, total operating time and intraoperative
      blood loss To date only two small randomized controlled trials compared the effectiveness of
      the bidirectional knotless barbed suture versus standard suture in the repair of vaginal cuff
