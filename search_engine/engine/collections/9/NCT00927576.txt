      attention, and executive function in large groups of control subjects and in patients with
      chronic mild and moderate/severe TBI. This extensive battery of neuropsychological tests
      (NPTs) and subjective rating scale measures were obtained at study entry from the TBI cohort.
      NPT and rating scale data were compared to those obtained from control subjects to
      characterize the cognitive deficits following mild, moderate and severe TBI. .

      Normative data were obtained by regressing the influences of age, education, and computer use
      on scores to create normed z-scores on different NPTs,. We hypothesized that patient with TBI
      would show deficits on tests of memory, attention, and executive function relative to their
      predicted z-scores (based on the aforementioned regression functions) and that deficits would
      be more pronounced in patients with severe TBI than in patients with mild TBI.
