      employment that lead to obtaining and maintaining employment over time in spinal cord injury.
      There are no current studies that examine how the level and intensity of supported employment
      services by Veterans with SCI impacts employment outcomes. This extension will allow the
      examination of longitudinal factors associated with successful employment that are not
      possible within the time constrains of SCI-VIP and to extend the cost-effectiveness analysis
      and budget impact analysis to include longer term and costs of quality of life outcomes. The
      study will include a more comprehensive qualitative analysis across several sites of factors
      that contribute to program success. The PrOMOTE study will add three more sites. This
      expansion will allow examination of outcomes in areas where there is a high penetration of
      OIF/OEF Veterans as well as sites where there are other vocational programs available.

      Primary HO: Identify factors that predict employment after SCI.

      Secondary HO 1: Determine ongoing effectiveness of SE over time.

      Secondary HO 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of implementation strategy and level of SE model
      implementation across sites.

      Secondary HO 3: Determine costs, health care utilization over time and cost-effectiveness.
