      bronchial airways in atopic asthmatics and atopic healthy controls differ in microbial
      diversity, richness, evenness, or composition of specific bacterial taxa. 2) To determine
      whether inhaled corticosteroid treatment alters bronchial microbial community composition in
      asthmatics.
