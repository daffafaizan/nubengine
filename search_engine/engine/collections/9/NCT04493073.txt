      coherence tomography (OCT-A) between mitomycin- C (MMC)-augmented trabeculectomy and develop
      trabeculectomy with ologen implants to determine whether bleb vascularity measurements during
      preoperative and early postoperative periode could act as surrogate parameters to predict
      surgical outcomes.

      Glaucoma often existent in the elderly population. Measuremets of bleb vascularity beginning
      to become an essential part of the glaucoma specialist's clinical and operative took. As
      investigators continue to collect data both clinically and in the laboratory, these various
      imaging modalities will shepherd surgeons into a more precise and predicable era of glaucoma
      surgeries.
