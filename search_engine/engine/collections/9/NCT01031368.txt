      I. Assess the safety of infusing off-the-shelf non-HLA matched expanded cord blood cells
      following administration of cytarabine hydrochloride (GCLAC) for patients with AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the ability of the product to provide temporary myeloid engraftment.

      II. Assess the kinetics/persistence of potential engraftment.

      III. Assess the kinetics of autologous recovery when compared to historical cohorts.

      IV. Assess the development of alloimmunization.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and cytarabine
      hydrochloride IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Patients receive an infusion of non-HLA matched ex
      vivo expanded cord blood progenitors on day 6. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5 and from day 7 until blood counts recover. Treatment
      modifications may apply according to response.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour and cytarabine
      hydrochloride IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Patients also receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 0
      and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients may receive treatment for 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years
      and then annually for 3 years.
