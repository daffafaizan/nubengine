      at higher pressure on a single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain.
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg
      ±1mmHg or to AIS with an insufflation target pressure of 15mmHg ±1mmHg.

      Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and
      medication use, length of hospital stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal
      CO2 and the frequency of adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled
      population undergoing laparoscopic surgery.
