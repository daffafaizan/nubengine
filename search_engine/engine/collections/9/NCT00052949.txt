      I. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
      recurrent small cell lung cancer treated with imatinib mesylate.

      II. Correlate the presence of c-Kit mutations in tumor tissue with treatment response in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Correlate individual patient variation in clinical (toxicity and/or activity),
      pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters), and/or biologic (correlative
      laboratory study results) responses to this drug with genetic differences in proteins
      involved in drug response (transport, metabolism, and/or mechanism of action).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of prior
      therapy (less than 3 months vs at least 3 months).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily for 28 days. Courses continue in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      *Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for
      up to 3 years after registration.

      NOTE: *Patients who develop CNS metastasis as the only site of disease progression receive
      therapeutic whole-brain radiotherapy and then resume study therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients for stratum I will be accrued within 21 months and
      50 patients for stratum II will be accrued within 25 months for this study.
