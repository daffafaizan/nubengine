      with limited resources, moreover despite an intensive program of care with a
      multidisciplinary dedicated team, the impact on weight loss is moderate.

      The hypothesis is to ameliorate results by using distance monitoring in maintenance phase.

      After a traditional intensive period consisting in a weekly family-based multidisciplinary
      intervention, patients are randomized in two arms, traditional or distance follow-up.

      Traditional follow-up is based on face-to-face multidisciplinary consultations every three
      months.

      The distance monitoring is based on a mobile application dedicated to food behavior change
      and physical activity, with weekly self-monitoring, goal setting, physical activity and
      healthy eating support, monthly weight assessment. Pre-programmed feedbacks "motivational
      strategies" are included.

      After one year of follow-up, adolescents are evaluated for weight loss, compliance and
      quality of life. The two groups will be compared.

      The question is can mobile apps help to monitor and promote healthy lifestyle in obese
      adolescents.
