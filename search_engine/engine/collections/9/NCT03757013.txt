      dermatologists in France practicing in public hospitals (or private clinics) or private
      practice. Patients will be followed over 12 months after initiation of apremilast or until
      discontinuation of apremilast whatever the earlier. Given the observational nature of the
      study, apremilast dosing and duration will be at the sole discretion of the treating
      dermatologist, in accordance with the local label and daily clinical practice. Patient care
      will follow routine clinical practice, involving regular follow-up visits, without any
      mandatory visit. In daily practice, patients are usually seen by their treating dermatologist
      every 6 months. In this study, patients will be followed up at most 12 months after
      apremilast initiation.

      During this study, it is expected to collect data at inclusion (enrolment visit) and around 6
      months and 12 months after apremilast initiation, on electronic case report forms (eCRF) by
      the dermatologist after performing a visit around 6 and 12 months to evaluate the treatment
      response following the apremilast initiation.

      Due to the observational nature of the study, the study protocol does not require any
      specific tests or additional examinations. All assessments will be recorded in the electronic
      case report form (eCRF) according to the normal practice of the treating dermatologist.
      Self-questionnaires will be filled by the patient when visiting his/her dermatologist.

      Total duration of the study is 2 years and 6 months, which includes an enrollment period of 1
      year and 6 months and a follow up period of up to 1 year.
