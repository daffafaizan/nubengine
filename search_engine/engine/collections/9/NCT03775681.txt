      (ERCP) with the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Gastro.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine gastroenterologist satisfaction with the LMA Gastro.

      II. To determine anesthesia provider satisfaction with the LMA Gastro.

      III. To determine the rate of unsuccessful LMA Gastro placement.

      IV. To determine the ability of LMA Gastro to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation
      throughout the procedure.

      V. To determine and describe the rate of adverse events.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients wear Laryngeal Mask Airway Gastro after receiving general anesthesia and falling

      cholangiopancreatography. Patients also complete a 5-minute interview following ERCP
      procedure.
