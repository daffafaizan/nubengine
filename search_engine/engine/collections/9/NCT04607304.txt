      involves collecting breath samples prior to and after consumption of a non-radioactive carbon
      stable isotope (13C) labeled test meal. Breath samples will be collected at times consistent
      with FDA approved labeling. Participant's breath samples will be analyzed on the currently
      approved ABCA GIRMS and on the new ABCA2 GIRMS instruments. The values collected from both
      systems will be used to determine the clinical diagnostic agreement at each individual time
      points and percent agreement in diagnosis between the approved ABCA GIRMS and the new ABCA2
      GIRMS.
