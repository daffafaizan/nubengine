      activity and cellular uptake while being non-immunogenic, has been created to restore miR29a
      levels back to pre-injury levels.

      TenoMiR is unique in directly targeting the key changes in collagen production associated
      with tendinopathy. Unlike other therapies, TenoMiR has a well-defined mode-of-action that is
      supported by a wealth of scientific data. Moreover, treatment with TenoMiR does not require
      invasive biopsies and can be delivered at the point of initial diagnosis initiating recovery
      at the very earliest time.
