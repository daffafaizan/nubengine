    
      Baseline smoking period: Subjects will be required to attend 2 baseline clinic visits where
      baseline assessments will be captured including a record of their cigarette or other tobacco
      intake on a daily basis using an interactive voice response system (IVR).

      Experimental Period: After the baseline assessment, subjects will be randomized to one of
      five experimental conditions: 1) smoking usual brand cigarette controls, who after 8-weeks
      will be offered Camel Snus to use as they will for 8 more weeks; 2) complete substitution
      (i.e., no smoking) and use snus instead ; 3) partial substitution - use of both snus and
      cigarettes as you like. Snus, but not cigarettes, will be provided to subjects at the clinic
      visits. Subjects will attend clinic visits over the next 8 weeks where tobacco use patterns
      and biomarker data will be collected.
