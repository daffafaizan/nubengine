      however, current therapeutic results are still unsatisfactory in those with relapsed disease.
      The purine nucleoside analogue cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) has been shown to
      be a safe and active agent in acute myeloid leukemia. Synergistic interaction between
      cladribine and cytarabine has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies.

      The current multicenter phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
      cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, and idarubicin in the treatment of patients with relapsed
      AML. Adult patients of all age groups can be enrolled in the trial, but elderly patients will
      be treated with a less dose-intensive regimen.
