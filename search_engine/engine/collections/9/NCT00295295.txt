      determinant of osteoporosis later in life. Some disabled children, such as those with
      cerebral palsy, are particularly vulnerable to low bone mass accumulation due to decreased
      mobility and weight-bearing. These children also have poor muscle strength and control, which
      limits function and contributes to the lack of mechanical stimulation needed to build bone
      mass. The most common treatment for these children is physical therapy, which is time- and
      labor-intensive and may not be adequately available to them. Whole body vibration has shown
      promise as an alternative method for stimulating increases in bone mass and improvements in
      muscle. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of high frequency, low magnitude
      vibration on bone and muscle in children with cerebral palsy. This intervention may be useful
      as a noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment for low bone mass and poor muscle function in
      these children.

      This study will last 1 year. All participants will visit the hospital 3 times, at study entry
      and Months 6 and 12. At each visit, height and weight will be measured, muscle strength and
      balance will be tested, and bones and muscles in the spine and lower leg will be imaged with
      computed tomography (CT), a special x-ray machine. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. For this study, all participants will be asked to stand for 10 minutes
      every day for 1 year. For Group 1, a vibrating platform will be used for the 10-minute
      standing sessions during the first half of the study but not during the second half of the
      study. For Group 2, this will be reversed and the vibrating platform will not be used during
      the first half of the study but will be used during the second half of the study.
