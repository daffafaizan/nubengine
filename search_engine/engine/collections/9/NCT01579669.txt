    
      The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate patient-centered care tools for autistic
      adults and their primary care providers (PCPs). One tool will allow autistic adults and/or
      their supporters to provide individualized information to PCPs about how being on the
      spectrum affects their healthcare and possible strategies to facilitate quality care. Another
      tool will capitalize on the power of patient narrative to educate PCPs about autism. These
      tools and other resources will be housed on an interactive website for autistic adults,
      supporters, and PCPs. The research team will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      using the new web-based patient-centered care tools with autistic adults and their primary
      care providers. This study will provide data for a future trial testing the effectiveness of
      these tools in improving the health of autistic adults by increasing patient-centered care
      and patient activation.
