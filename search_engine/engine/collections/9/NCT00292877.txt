      greater than 2%) is responsive to corticosteroid treatment. It occurs alone or in association
      with asthma or in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In most
      patients the eosinophilic bronchitis responds to treatment with inhaled steroids but in some
      it requires a minimum dose of prednisone to keep it controlled. At present, there is no
      outstanding drug which can have a prednisone-sparing effect.

      Interleukin (IL)-5 is a cytokine specifically focused on the development, differentiation,
      recruitment, activation and survival of the eosinophil. The specificity of IL-5 has raised
      the possibility that blocking it's activity, using humanized monoclonal antibodies, may be
      useful therapy for eosinophilic bronchitis. Such an antibody (SB-240563) has been introduced
      for clinical trial. The investigators will compare its effect versus placebo in patients with
      prednisone-dependant symptomatic eosinophilic bronchitis (with or without asthma) before and
      after a reduction in prednisone dose to identify if it has a prednisone-sparing effect.

      The study is divided into 3 sequential study periods. Period 1: symptomatic eosinophilic
      bronchitis (with or without asthma) on the same dose of prednisone for 6-weeks or more.
      Period 2: standardized prednisone reduction (and inhaled steroid if prednisone is
      discontinued during the study treatment) at intervals of 4-weeks until there is a clinical
      and eosinophilic exacerbation or bothersome steroid withdrawl effects. Period 3: washout.

      The patients will be seen every 2 weeks. Intravenous injections of SB-240563 750mg or placebo
      will be given at weeks 2,6,10,14 and 18. Doses of prednisone will be reduced in a standard
      way.
