      are responsible for altered microbial environment (e.g. reduced diversity and number of
      beneficial bifidobacteria and higher populations of enterobacteria and clostridia).

      Research over the past two decades has provided evidence that administration of probiotics
      (live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
      the host) could be used to optimise gut microbiota and prevent and treat a range of diseases,
      as well as enhance immune function. Somewhat less documented and more recent concept is the
      use of prebiotics (nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by
      selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one, or a limited number of bacteria in
      the colon). Prebiotics are naturally available in breast milk and in certain vegetables but
      can also be synthetic oligosaccharides of which the best known and the most researched
      examples include fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). B-GOS is a
      low molecular weight GOS mixture, shown to increase the number of probiotic bacteria,
      especially bifidobacteria, in younger and older adults, irritable-bowel sufferers and
      overweight adults. B-GOS also significantly decreases the colonisation and pathology of
      salmonellosis and incidence and duration of traveller's diarrhoea.

      Our aim is to investigate the potential of B-GOS to beneficially influence the wellbeing and
      ageing in healthy adults (52-65 years old). The assessment would consist of various
      questionnaires covering quality of life, bowel function, mood and sleep and blood markers of
      inflammation and ageing.
