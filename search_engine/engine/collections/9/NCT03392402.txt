      of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) classified according to the Bethesda System for
      Reporting of Thyroid Cytopathology. This does not allow for the definitive diagnosis of
      cancer in significant proportion of tumors, so called indeterminate nodules (Bethesda class
      III, IV and V). These patients require surgery to establish a definitive diagnosis, leading
      to unnecessary operating procedures in at least 2/3 of subjects.

      Molecular classifiers could significantly improve thyroid preoperative diagnostics, although
      they are not optimal and provide either high specificity to the detriment of low sensitivity
      or conversely, relatively low specificity with high sensitivity. The classifiers could be
      based on gene expression or mutations present in FNAB specimen.

      In the present study the investigators plan to assess the improvement of classification power
      by molecular gene-expression-based multi-feature classifier when added to standard clinical
      parameters indicating the risk of malignancy (Bethesda class, tumor size, patient age and
      sex). Participants will undergo FNAB with prospective collection of material for molecular
      testing and simultaneous preoperative recording of all clinical parameters. The patients will
      be operated on or followed-up according to the clinical guidelines. The comparison of a
      predictive power of clinical criteria to the combined clinical-molecular classifier will be
      carried out by the group of investigators blinded to the results of final surgery.
