      determined using a method known as Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). No patient related
      data will accompany these isolates, nor will any related identifiers. These isolates will be
      tested using standardized susceptibility methods. We will then grow each isolate and test via
      approved laboratory standards (E-test, AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) to the drug linezolid.
      Those determined to be resistant using this approved methodology will be saved until 20
      isolates are identified. For resistant isolates found, analytical and molecular techniques
      will be performed to determine the mechanisms of resistance and whether resistant isolates
      are coming from a single source/being transmitted from person to person.
