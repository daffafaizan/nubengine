      cure is surgical resection. Studies suggest that lung resection is associated with right
      ventricular (RV) dysfunction, predisposing to complications and post-operative dyspnoea.
      Studies of RV function following lung resection have been hampered by the limitations of the
      techniques used. In addition the mechanism of RV dysfunction has remained elusive.

      In this prospective observational study the RV response to lung resection will be
      characterised by sequential assessment of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) measured
      using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR is non-invasive, involves no ionising
      radiation and due to its high spatial resolution is the gold standard for assessing RV
      volumes. Comprehensive CMR and echocardiographic assessment of the pulmonary vascular - RV
      axis will allow us to interpret peri-operative changes in RVEF in the context of RV
      contractility and loading indices. In addition, contemporaneous blood samples will be taken
      for measurement of biomarkers of myocardial and endothelial dysfunction and systemic
      inflammation.

      With increased understanding of the mechanisms involved, it may be possible to prevent RV
      dysfunction; reducing complication rates, hospital stay and costs and ameliorating long term
      dyspnoea.
