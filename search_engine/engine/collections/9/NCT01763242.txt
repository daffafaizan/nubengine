    
      CKD Stages 3 to 5 Subjects will be randomised and stratified according to Age, Gender, CKD
      Stage, Known Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes and ESA Type into EMAN vs. Control

      Details of EMAN synchronization and Dosing:

      Monthly dose of ESA is calculated by:

      Monthly dose = present dose x (28/present frequency (days))

      Synchronization will be achieved by using the formula: "Synchronization dose of ESA =
      (28-Days until next injection is due)/28 x monthly dose of ESA

      The dose of ESA/C.E.R.A. should be adjusted to maintain the individual patient's haemoglobin
      within a range of 11± 1.0 g/dL of the reference haemoglobin concentration ie. between 10.0
      and 12.0 g/dL

      Haemoglobin Value Corrective Adjustment

        -  A single value >13 g/dL Interrupt treatment until Hb falls below 12 g/dL then re-start
           treatment at 50% of previous dose

        -  A single value <9 g/dL Increase dose by 50%

        -  Difference between two consecutive Hb values indicates ≥2 g/dL increase Reduce dose by
           50%

        -  Difference between two consecutive Hb values indicates ≥2 g/dL decrease Increase dose by
           50%

        -  >11.5 g/dL and <13 g/dL AND deviation from reference value is >1g/dL. Reduce dose by 25%

        -  <10.5 g/dL and >9 g/dL AND deviation from reference value is >1g/dL. Increase dose by
           25%

        -  >12 g/dL Reduce dose by 25%

        -  <10 g/dL Increase dose by 25%

      Statistics:

      Audit of present practice suggests CKD patients achieve only 30% on target (Hb 10-12g/dL)
      while well audited dialysis units in our service can achieve 60% at target.

      If an improvement from 30% to 60% is expected in the EMAN verses Control arm then 100
      patients (50 in each group) would be required to show a significant difference p<0.05 with
      85% power.

      Patients will be analysed on an intention to treat basis Primary and Secondary Endpoint data
      will be compared between study and control groups using unpaired student t-tests after
      normalisation of data as required and/or chi squared analysis.

      Statistical significance will be taken at p<0.05.
