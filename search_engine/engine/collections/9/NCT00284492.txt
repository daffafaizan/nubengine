      acupuncture-care together with self-care is more effective than self-care alone, to relieve
      climacteric complaints among women who seek alternatives to hormonal replacement therapy
      (HRT). Study design is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. Study
      participants are postmenopausal women who document a mean value of 7 flushes/24 hours and who
      are not using HRT or other prescribed medication that may influence climacteric complaints.
      The treatment group will receive 10 sessions of TCM acupuncture-care and self-care; the
      control group will engage in self-care only.

      The duration of intervention period is 12 weeks with evaluations at baseline, 4, 8, 12 weeks,
      and follow up at 6 and 12 months after baseline. Primary endpoint is change in daily hot
      flush frequency in the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks; secondary endpoint is health
      related quality of life. N in each treatment group: 143 (286 altogether).
