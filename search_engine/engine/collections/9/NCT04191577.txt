    
      Approximately 66 male and female subjects with Parkinson's disease, on a stable dosage of
      levodopa but with an average of ≥ 2 h total OFF time/day and not less than 1 h per day, will
      be enrolled. Following baseline safety and efficacy assessments, subjects will be randomized
      to receive once-daily doses of either low-dose CVN424, high-dose CVN424, or matching placebo.
      All subjects not randomized to placebo will initiate treatment with a low-dose of CVN424 on
      Day 1; the low-dose arm will continue to receive their low dose each day, while the high-dose
      arm will increase their daily dosage to the high-dose CVN424 beginning on Day 8 ±2 days and
      continuing thereafter. Study drug will be self-administered each morning as an oral
      suspension. Subjects will continue their other PD medications.
