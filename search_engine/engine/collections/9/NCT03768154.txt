      Units (ICUs) in Japan and Peru. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or legally
      authorized substitute decision maker. Moderate-to-severe ARDS patients who are planned to
      turn to prone positioning, based on the attending physician's decisions will be included.
      Prior to initiating the protocol, patients will be sedated deeply with sedatives and/or
      opioids. Ventilator settings, physiological data, esophageal pressure and diaphragm activity
      will be recorded and physiological measurements will be collected for 5 minutes in supine
      (Measurement 1: Supine + spontaneous effort) . Patients will be paralyzed with a continuous
      infusion of rocuronium, and Measurement 2 (Supine + paralysis) will be recorded. The critical
      care team in the ICU change the position from supine to prone. After waiting for at least 1
      hour in prone positioning, Measurement 3 (Prone + paralysis) will be recorded. Continuous
      infusion of rocuronium will be gradually decreased (and can be terminated) until spontaneous
      breathing will be observed without reaching an excessive level. The presence of spontaneous
      breathing will be evaluated by the negative swing of esophageal pressure, and Measurement 5
      (Prone + spontaneous breathing) will be recorded.
