      objective of this study is to obtain survival and outcome data on the Zimmer Hip Resurfacing
      System. This will be assessed by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and
      adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility and survivorship, and to
      confirm the safety and efficacy of the Zimmer Hip Resurfacing System. Serum metal ion levels
      (cobalt and chromium) will also be collected pre-operatively and again at 6 months, 1 year, 2
      years and 5 years. This procedure will offer an option to these patients who would otherwise
      require and likely outlive a conventional total hip replacement.
