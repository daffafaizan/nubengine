      B fractures, using compression screws and a neutralization plate. In the elderly,
      pre-existing co-morbidities, osteoporosis and poor skin conditions may give a high
      complication rate, including wound complications, symptomatic hardware and hardware failure.
      Due to concerns with complications related to ORIF, the technique with intramedullary
      fixation has been introduced. This method may simplify the management when poor skin
      conditions and osteoporotic bone, and has the potential to reduce the risk of soft tissue and
      hardware complications. Previous studies have showed that intramedullary fixation is probably
      the best choice for treating unstable ankle fractures in elderly patients, but more studies
      are needed to conclude the superiority to standard plate fixation.
