      often bad responders to conventional chemotherapy included cisplatin.

      The investigation of the EGFR expression may allow identifying new molecular targets for
      novel therapeutic strategies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin.

      Several publications in the literature for primary lesions and one publication for metastatic
      lesions showed that EGFR was expressed in 80-90% of SCC of the skin. Immunohistochemistry
      studies performed at the Gustave Roussy Institute confirm these data: they found an
      over-expression of EGFR in 90% of patients with metastatic disease. These results are in
      favor of the investigation of cetuximab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC
      of the skin expressing EGFR.

      Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against EGFR administered weekly by intravenous
      route; it may be prescribed as out hospital to patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      SCC of the skin expressing EGFR.

      Due to the low occurrence of locally advanced or metastatic SCC of the skin, a multicenter
      trial will be required.
