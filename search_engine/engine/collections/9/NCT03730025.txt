      in mental computation, leading to inappropriate or delayed resuscitation. Previous studies
      evaluated a free-of-charge mobile application (NeoTapAdvancedSupport, NeoTapAS) to help HR
      assessment in a simulated scenario of neonatal resuscitation. NeoTapAS showed good accuracy
      in estimating HR and could be a useful tool in resource-constrained settings.

      Another potential advantage of using NeoTapAS may be the anticipation of HR communication
      during resuscitation, because it avoids mental computation and possible errors due to the
      stressful situation. In addition, prompt HR assessment may lead to anticipating resuscitation
      interventions. However, these hypotheses remain to be demonstrated.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the promptness in HR communication using NeoTapAS
      compared with mental computation in a high-fidelity simulated newborn resuscitation scenario.
      In addition, the impact of NeoTapAS on timing of resuscitation procedures will be
      investigated.
