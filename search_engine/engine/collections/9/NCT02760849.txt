      I. To examine changes in female sexual function with the strategy of interval salpingectomy
      and delayed oophorectomy (ISDO) compared to the strategy of risk-reducing
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for patients who carry genetic mutations that predispose them to
      ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the onset and severity of menopausal symptoms with ISDO compared to RRSO.

      II. To estimate quality of life with ISDO compared to RRSO. III. To examine participants'
      satisfaction level and cancer worry level with their choice of prophylactic procedures.

      IV. To estimate the impact of ISDO compared to RRSO on mental health, including depression,
      anxiety, and sleep quality.

      V. To determine the compliance with ISDO compared to RRSO. VI. To estimate the number of
      fallopian tube, ovarian, or primary peritoneal malignancies and other malignancies over the
      course of the study.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo ISDO.

      ARM II: Patients undergo RRSO.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 months, 1 year, and
      2 years.
