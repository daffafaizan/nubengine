      facilities have had mixed results, and alternative approaches need to be considered. The
      present intervention was designed with the results of previous studies in mind, and as such,
      does not focus on labeling only healthy food choices. Instead, the present intervention aims
      to encourage consumption of nutritionally well-balanced meals using an environmental cue in
      military dining facilities.
