      female, of any ethnic background.

      SpO2 and pulse rate measurements reported by ViSi will be compared with simultaneous
      measurements of blood SaO2 and pulse rate made by an FDA-cleared CO-oximeter and pulse
      oximeter, respectively. The paired measurements will be made in a well-controlled environment
      under optimal laboratory conditions.
