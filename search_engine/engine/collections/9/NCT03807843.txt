      proposes to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational live recombinant
      measles-vectored chikungunya vaccine (MV-CHIK) delivered in 2 vaccinations, 28 days apart
      compared with saline placebo. After providing informed consent, individuals will be screened
      for eligibility including verification of previous exposure to chikungunya virus. They will
      then be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either MV-CHIK or saline placebo in a
      1:1 ratio. This study will be conducted in two Steps, first in up to 30 individuals ages 21
      to 50. Then, pending a favorable review of the available vaccine safety data, in up to 30
      individuals ages 51 to 65.
