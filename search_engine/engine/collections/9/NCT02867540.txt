      the anastomosis site and in the ileum in patients with Crohn's disease who have had
      ileocolonic resection.

      Assess the value of diffusion sequences of MRI enterography for the diagnosis of recurrence
      at the anastomosis site and in the ileum in patients with Crohn's disease who have had
      ileocolonic resection.
