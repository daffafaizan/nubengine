      large-scale sampling and feature VOCs extraction to establish database. The other is called
      Sniff Phone aim at clinical real-time VOCs detection assisted by software. About 10,000
      patients will participate in the subject of Breath Screener in batches. First, 7000 patients
      will have a definitive diagnosis and exhaled breath collected. Feature VOCs of specific
      tumors will be extracted from these samples and employed to build predictive model by using
      discriminant factor analysis (DFA). After the predictive model had been completed, 3000
      definitively diagnosed patients will participate in validating the specificity and
      sensitivity of the prediction model. With the assistance of Breath Screener clinical database
      and software services, Sniff Phone is more suitable for clinical real-time detection for its
      small and convenient design characteristics. At last, Breath Screener and Sniff Phone will
      continue enriching databases and improve diagnosis efficacy in their clinical applications.
