      women is important because the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia
      increases with age and women live the longest. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study
      examined the impact of randomization to hormone therapy (conjugated equine estrogen alone or
      in combination with medroxyprogesterone vs. placebo) in a subset of participants aged 65-79
      years at enrollment into WHI and the WHI Hormone Trials. WHIMS revealed an increased risk of
      all-cause dementia and MCI plus poorer global cognitive function among women randomized to HT
      compared to those receiving placebo. WHIMS ECHO is a prospective, observational study of the
      remaining cohort of WHIMS participants following cessation of treatment. Annual cognitive
      assessments of learning, attention, memory, working memory, executive function and language
      are conducted by telephone by trained staff and adjudication of incident cognitive impairment
      (MCI and dementia) continues. This enables the continued monitoring of long-term effects of
      randomization to HT on cognition and identification of predictors of cognitive aging and
      resilience in older women.
