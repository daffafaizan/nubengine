      health and environmental exposures. In recent years, microbial networks responsible for
      localized malodors such as halitosis or axillary odor have been mapped by using next
      generation sequencing approaches. Intestinal microbes responsible for psychologically
      debilitating systemic malodor (whole-body and extraoral halitosis), however, remain to be
      identified. Even a relatively straightforward disorder of choline metabolism
      trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is thought to exhibit complex host-gene microbiome interactions and
      has not been sufficiently studied.

      Proposed controlled pilot study aims to explore the dynamics of microbial communities in
      remission and flare-up periods. Better knowledge of the important aspects of disease
      fluctuation should enhance patient care and, combined with our prior data, will help to
      develop new therapies and treatments.
