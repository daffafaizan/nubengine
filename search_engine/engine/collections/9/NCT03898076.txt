      with T1D using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system for last three months. Past 15 days
      of CGM data will be analyzed and different glucose variability features such as time in range
      (TIR), coefficient of variation (CV), mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), mean of
      daily differences (MODD), continuous overall net glycemic action (CONGA) will be extracted. A
      machine learning model will be developed to predict HbA1c in 2-3 months advance based on
      these 15 days of CGM data. The model is using linear regression, penalized regression (Ridge
      regression, Lasso regression and Elastic net regression) in combination gradient boosting to
      calculate predictive A1c
