      hypertrophy and cardiac failure. Aldosterone may have an important role in the development of
      myocardial hypertrophy and remodeling. Animal studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of
      aldosterone antagonists on myocardial hypertrophy, and human studies have shown significant
      survival benefit in a non-dialysis population with congestive heart failure. This study
      evaluates the effect of spironolactone (an aldosterone receptor antagonist) on cardiac
      hypertrophy in the end-stage renal disease population.
