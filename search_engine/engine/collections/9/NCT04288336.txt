      I. To determine whether men treated for localized prostate cancer adhere to a long-term
      (months-years) daily intermittent fasting regimen.

      II. To measure the levels of metabolic and prostate-cancer derived microparticles in the
      serum of men that practice a daily intermittent fasting regimen after treatment for
      localized, high-risk prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning when patients' PSA is detectable up to 24 months after surgery, patients follow a
      daily intermittent fasting routine consisting of restricting the daily eating period to 8
      hours (e.g. between 1PM-9PM) followed by 16 hours of prolonged nightly fasting for up to 1
      year or until secondary therapy commences.
