      disability is caused by vision loss due to glaucoma. We are recruiting 100 patients with
      glaucoma and 20 healthy (have no eye disease) individuals to be enrolled in this study. The
      healthy study participants will be enrolled in order to describe how a healthy individual
      will perform on the test designed to assess one's performance when completing ten activities
      of daily living.

      Clinical testing will be conducted by binocular and monocular visual fields, contrast
      sensitivity and visual acuity. The NEI-VFQ 15 Quality of Life Questionnaire will be used to
      measure patients perception of how well they are doing.
