1747. the problem of albuminoidalbuminoid is the main constituent of theinsoluble fraction of the lens proteins.albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens hasbeen fractionated on deae-cellulose in7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractionsare very similar to those from the corre-sponding fractions from a-crystallin.albuminoid can be regarded as an insolublea-crystallin.  an undiluted ground lensis clear but becomes turbid on dilution.  ifalbuminoid is present in the normal lens,it does not cause turbidity even when thecellular structure is disrupted.  it isperhaps more likely that the albuminoid isformed on dilution of the lens mush.the high concentration of proteins in the lens,especially in the nucleus, entails a highdegree of order, which will be destroyedon dilution  this phenomenon may well beconnected with the precipitation of thealbuminoid.
