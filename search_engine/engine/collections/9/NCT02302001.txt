      postoperative pain and discomfort within the first two weeks after the operation. Minimizing
      this pain and discomfort and ability to return to normal function soon after the operation
      has been the goal of numerous interventions. Minimal injury no touch dissection techniques
      have proven results regarding morbidity. ERBEjet is a novel dissection using a jet of local
      anesthetic infused saline fluid with a built in coagulation function used for dissection of
      soft tissues. The study is designed to randomly perform ERBEjet Breast augmentation operation
      unilaterally on breast augmentation and mastopexy augmentation patients undergoing
      traditional sub pectoral dissection technique on the contralateral side. Patient's record
      pain scores at regular intervals in the postoperative period. Physical examination performed
      by blinded practitioners assess discomfort and tenderness scores within the two weeks after
      the operation.
