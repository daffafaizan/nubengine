      manifold systems to reduce the amount of contrast used in catheterization procedures, while
      maintaining fluoroscopic image opacity.

      No study has assessed use of the system in CTO PCI. It would be expected that savings in CTO
      procedures may be less than non-CTO procedures due to catheter sizing and number of open
      guide injections required. Open guide injections through larger catheters do not provide for
      the as much resistance, therefore decreasing the need for contrast to be diverted
