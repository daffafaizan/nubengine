      movement disorder that can occur in anyone exposed to drugs that block dopamine receptors,
      including first and second generation antipsychotics and antiemetic agents. There is no way
      to prevent TD except preventing exposure to the inciting agents and there are no approved
      symptomatic therapies. Propranolol is an FDA-approved Î²-blocker with limited data supporting
      its use as a treatment for TD.

      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of propranolol in the treatment of TD in
      a double-blind, cross-over prospective manner. Patients with a diagnosis of TD will be
      randomized to propranolol or identical placebo. The patients will be treated for eight weeks,
      complete a one week washout and then crossed over for another eight weeks. Hence, the
      subjects will be their own controls. Participation in this pilot trial will provide placebo
      controlled blinded data that will assist in planning a larger phase II trial. If propranolol
      is found to be an effective therapy, it will fulfill a great need in the treatment of TD with
      a medication that is known to be safe and inexpensive.
