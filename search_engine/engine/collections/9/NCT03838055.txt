    
      Consecutive patients with- and low risk endometrial cancer will be approached for eligibility
      for inclusion in a study evaluating the detection rates of pelvic metastatic disease by
      detection and removal of Sentinel lymph nodes only, i.e with no further lymphadenectomy.

      A re-staging will be performed in case of metastatic Sentinel lymph nodes to guide adjuvant
      treatment.

      The detection rate will be evaluated from a non-inferiority perspective against the expected
      rate of nodal metastases based on detailed final histological data.

      Adverse events related the intervention ( Injection of tracer (ICG) and removal of sentinel
      nodes), time for the intervention, and an objective evaluation of lymphatic complications
      (lymphoedema) will be performed in addition to the use of a validated lymphoedema QOL
      questionnaire.
