    
      This study is specifically designed to evaluate the potential effects of ingestion of the
      novel food ingredient on cardiac safety. The objective will be fulfilled by assessing cardiac
      parameters including heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG/QT interval in healthy adult male
      subjects following a single dose oral administration of the test article.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that a single oral dose of 150 mg of
      the test article does not have an effect on the Fridericia-corrected QT ECG interval (QTcF)
      exceeding 10 milliseconds (msec).
