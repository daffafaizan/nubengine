    
      Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DE-PLANЄ program for the
      primary prevention of type-II diabetes in high-risk population seen in primary care centers
      (Osakidetza) in which such intervention is implemented, compared to usual care control
      centers.

      DESIGN AND METHODS: A phase IV cluster randomized prospective clinical trial, conducted in 14
      primary care centers from Osakidetza, which will be randomly assigned to intervention or
      control group, that will collect a sample of 2534 followed for two years, aged 45 to 70 years
      without diabetes but with high risk of developing it (FINDRISC scale> 14), identified by a
      screening system. Nurses in intervention centers (GI) will implement DEPLANЄ for 12 months, a
      structured educational intervention on healthy lifestyles (diet and physical activity), while
      patients of the control centers will receive standard care for the prevention and treatment
      of type-II diabetes.

      ANALYSIS: The feasibility will be reported as the reach, adoption and implementation of the
      program. The attributable effectiveness of the program will be determined by comparing the
      changes in the incidence and risk of developing diabetes in healthy habits quality of life,
      observed in patients exposed to DE-PLANЄ intervention and of patients from control centers.
      The incremental cost-utility of DE-PLANЄ program will be also analysed.
