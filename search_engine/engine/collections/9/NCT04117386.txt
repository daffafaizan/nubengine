      recurrent pterygium and the association of HPV types collecting from conjunctiva swab and
      urine. The second purpose is to compare a quantity of cytokines including IL-6, IL-18 and
      growth factor including VEGF found in tears of patients with primary and recurrent pterygium
      to participants with free of ocular disease Primary hypothesis

      - The prevalence of HPV infection in primary pterygium is difference with prevalence in
      recurrent pterygium patients.

      Secondary hypothesis

        -  Ocular HPV infection has association with HPV genitalia infection.

        -  Tears cytokine and growth factor level (IL-6, IL-18 and VEGF) are higher in pterygium
           HPV infection than non-HPV infection and also more than normal population
