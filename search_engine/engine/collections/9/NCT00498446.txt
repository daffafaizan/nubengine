      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (veCMR) of the pulmonary artery and aorta (Qp/Qs). Imaging
      the secundum ASD en face could potentially enable direct flow measurement and, additionally,
      provide valuable information regarding ASD size, shape, location, and proximity to other
      structures.

      Methods: Patients referred for possible transcatheter ASD closure underwent a comprehensive
      standard evaluation including transesophageal and/or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), and
      invasive oximetry. CMR was performed in parallel and included direct en face veCMR after an
      optimal double-oblique imaging plane was determined accounting for ASD flow direction and
      cardiac-cycle interatrial septal motion.

      We hypothesized that En face veCMR using an optimized imaging plane can accurately determine
      ASD flow, size, and morphology, and that it would provide information incremental to
      comprehensive standard evaluation.
