      programs, offer great promise, but little is known about how such interventions should be
      designed to increase their efficacy

      The primary purpose of the current study is to test the effect of providing users of
      automated web-based smoking cessation interventions with the option of negotiating and
      re-negotiating the quit date.

      The investigators propose a 2-arm RCT with 1500 adult study participants that all receive a
      best practices web-based smoking cessation program designed for use on smart phones
      (web-app). The intervention includes a ten day/session preparation phase (participants
      continue smoking) as well as a four week post-cessation follow-up phase (14 sessions). The
      post-cessation phase will only be given to participants that report an initial quit attempt.
      Participants will be randomized to two versions of the intervention: 1) A version that does
      not provide participants with the option of negotiating the quit day (the preparation phase
      is fixed to ten days/sessions); or 2) a version that provides the participants with the
      option of negotiating/re-negotiate the quit day on three occasions. The three occasions are
      on the first day/session of the intervention, on the fourth day/session of the intervention
      and on the eleventh day/session of the intervention. The primary outcome is making a quit
      attempt.
