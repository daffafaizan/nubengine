    
      Objective To assess the accuracy of a POC G6PD test as compared to a reference assay in
      detecting G6PD activity

      Endpoints

        -  Sensitivity and specificity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD test compared to the Pointe
           Scientific test kit for identifying G6PD deficient individuals and women with
           intermediate G6PD activity

        -  Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of G6PD activity and the Pointe
           Scientific test kit

        -  Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of hemoglobin (Hb) and HemoCue
           201+, a point of care reference haemoglobin assay

        -  Comparison of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test results for capillary and venous samples.

      Population 250 male and female participants 18-65 years of age presenting at the clinic for
      care. Individuals who have received a blood transfusion within the last 3 months, according
      to self-report, will be excluded.
