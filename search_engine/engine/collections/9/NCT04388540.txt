      deficiency in school-age children reduces IQ (1); thus, its critical to avoid iodine
      deficiency in this age group. In countries effected by iodine deficiency, its sustainable
      elimination through iodized salt can contribute to socioeconomic development. The goal to
      eliminate iodine deficiency was first adopted globally at the World Summit for Children in
      1990, and in 1994, WHO and UNICEF concluded that salt iodization is a safe, cost-effective
      and sustainable strategy to control iodine deficiency (2). In 2005, the World Health Assembly
      called on national governments to report on their iodine nutrition every three years.
      However, before the present survey, the ten countries included in this project had no data on
      iodine status in their populations, and household access to adequately iodized salt was also
      unknown. Thus, the study objectives were:

        -  Assess the distribution of iodine intake of school-age children and their iodine status
           by measuring urinary iodine concentrations;

        -  Assess the iodine content of household salt and of seasoning powders;

        -  Based on the above, provide the preliminary evidence base on which to make initial
           recommendations for iodine strategy/programs in the region.
