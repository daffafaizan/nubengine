      A combination of thermal therapy with a self-management exercise have shown a positive effect
      in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee. This study aimed to compare the
      effectiveness of topical heat pack versus focal application of heat therapy at the
      acupressure points in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.

      A randomized control trial was conducted in 76 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee,
      diagnosed by an experienced orthopedic surgeon. Following inclusion and exclusion selection,
      patients were randomly allocated to group 1 (Heat Pack) or group 2 (Thermal Gun). All
      patients received 30 minutes of treatment in each session, twice a week for 4 weeks. They
      also received an education program and taught home knee exercises. Outcome measurements were
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity, muscle power, knee ROM, WOMAC and SF-12v2.
