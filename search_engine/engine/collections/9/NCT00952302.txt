      patient survival. Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is also a major cause of morbidity
      at high altitude. Hypoxia causes pulmonary hypertension through hypoxic pulmonary
      vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling. These processes are thought to be regulated at
      least in part by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors, which
      coordinate intracellular responses to hypoxia throughout the body.

      HIF is regulated through a cellular degradation process that requires iron as an obligate
      cofactor. In cultured cells HIF degradation is inhibited by reduction in iron (by chelation
      with desferrioxamine) and potentiated by iron supplementation. In humans, we have recently
      shown that, in laboratory experiments lasting 8 hours, acute iron supplementation blunts the
      pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, while acute iron chelation with desferrioxamine
      enhances the response.

      This suggests that iron may also affect the pulmonary artery pressure response to hypoxia
      over longer time periods. The purpose of this study is to investigate this link between iron
      and the pulmonary artery pressure response to hypoxia, through a study conducted at high
      altitude allowing concurrent exposure of larger numbers of participants to environmental
      hypoxia. We wish to explore the extent and the time-course of the effect of iron on pulmonary
      artery pressure. Cerro de Pascu (4,340 m) in Peru provides the unique ability to make rapid
      transitions from sea level to high altitude (6-8 hours by road), together with the requisite
      research facilities. Also, one part of this study involves recruitment of patients with
      chronic mountain sickness, of whom there are many living in Cerro de Pasco.
