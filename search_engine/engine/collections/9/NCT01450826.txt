      will be stratified by grade of tumor (1 or 2 versus 3 or 4) and the number of prior
      progressions (0 or 1 versus 2). Within each of the 4 strata defined by these factors, a
      permuted block randomization scheme will be used to assign patients to receive either
      aprepitant in combination with ondansetron or ondansetron alone.

      Though the study is comparative, the goal of the study is to determine whether aprepitant is
      worthy of further investigation in this setting, and not to make definitive statements about
      the comparative effectiveness of ondansetron treatment with or without aprepitant.
