      malignancies prior to Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) will receive a dose escalated
      hypofractionated Total Marrow Irradiation (TMI) (12 Gy in 3 fractions, daily, on 3
      consecutive days).

      The current project is a joint initiative in translational and clinical medical research
      between the Radiation-oncology workgroup and the Bone Marrow transplant workgroup of
      University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG).
