      (CPAP) after extubation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery can reduce hypoxemia and
      re-intubation rate.

      Primary end point: to reduce the rate of re-intubation.

      Secondary end point: to reduce the incidence of atelectasis, pneumonia, sepsis, the mortality
      rate, the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.
