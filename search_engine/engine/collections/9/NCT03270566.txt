    
      A 6-month parallel group assessor-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial of an
      ion-exchange water softener for the prevention of eczema in neonates, with an embedded
      mechanistic study.

      The overall rationale is that by installing a domestic water softener around the time of
      birth, the infant will be exposed to softened water rather than hard water for bathing and
      that this will be less irritating to the skin than hard water and so associated with a lower
      risk of eczema development. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of
      conducting a subsequent definitive RCT that will investigate whether installation of a
      domestic water softener around the time of birth can prevent eczema in high-risk babies. The
      secondary objective is to explore the likely mechanisms by which water softeners might
      prevent eczema.
