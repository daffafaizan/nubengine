      This registry is a longitudinal, multicentre, observational registry study, with continuous
      and ambispective collection of clinical and laboratory data. The patients will be followed
      for 5 years, regardless of the therapeutic modifications occurring thereafter.

      Target population:

      Patients initiating JAK inhibitor therapy for inflammatory rheumatic disorder.

      Number of patients and centres :

        -  The objective is to include, per drug available on the market, at least 300 to 500
           patients with RA and at least 100 to 150 patients with psoriatic arthritis. If a JAK
           inhibitor is approved in a new indication of chronic rheumatic disease by European
           Medicines Agency (EMA), the number of patients to include for each molecule in this
           indication will be adjusted as a function of the prevalence/epidemiology of each
           disease. Products currently available (baricitinib and tofacitinib) will be considered
           at the start of this registry; then every new indication for an already approved drug or
           every new drug in the same therapeutic class starting from the date they are placed on
           the market will be considered.

        -  More than 80 centers in France (hospital-based, public and private practice) will
           participate.
