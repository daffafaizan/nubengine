      Hospital Center. Were included 33 patients presenting with treatment-naive keratoconus.
      Patients responded to a questionnaire that assessed eye rubbing habits, family history of
      keratoconus, history of atopy. 2 groups were separated: group 1 constituted by 15 eyes with
      no eye rubbing, and group 2 constituted by 18 eyes with moderate or severe eye rubbing. The
      following informations were collected: best visual corrected acuity (BCVA), spherical
      equivalent value (SEV), corneal opacities or Vogt striae. For each eye were performed an
      anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) to determine the OCT stage for keratoconus (Fourrier domain OCT
      classification, 2013), and a Scheimpflug camera imaging to determine the maximal keratometry
      (Kmax) and the minimal corneal thickness (MCT).
