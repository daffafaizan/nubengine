    
      This clinical trial utilizes the prospective, multicenter, single-arm target value trial
      design, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Firehorus vertebral artery
      rapamycin-target-eluting stent system (hereinafter referred to as Firehorus) in clinical use,
      for which 5 (or more) institutions will be selected as Clinical Trial Centre.Subjects will be
      screened in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the this protocol and
      will be treated with Firehorus. Immediate stent implantation success rate of all subjects
      after surgery will be recorded, DSA angiographic follow-up will be performed at six months
      (±30 days) after surgery to assess the incidence of stent restenosis ( stenosis ≥ 50%) of the
      subjects, and the subjects will be followed up at 30 days (±7 days), 6 months (± 30 days), 12
      months (± 30 days) after surgery , so as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Firehorus in
      clinical use. The expected participating duration of each subject from enrollment to complete
      the follow-up is 12 months (± 30 days).
