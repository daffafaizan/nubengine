    
      An advanced practice nurse (APN) will meet twice weekly with the patient and family for the
      first 4 weeks of the intervention to initiate the motivation-based dialogue and therapeutic
      interaction; this will be followed by once weekly visits during weeks 5-8 of the
      intervention; and monthly visits during weeks 9-through end of therapy. The physical
      therapist (PT) will meet at least once weekly with the patient and family during weeks 1-4 to
      initiate the prescriptive tailored exercise program; subsequent visits to reinforce and
      modify the program will occur at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least
      once monthly during weeks 9-135 of the intervention. The PT will visit at least once weekly
      during weeks 1-4, at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least once monthly
      during weeks 9-135. During weeks 9-135 of the intervention, the APN will call between the
      monthly in person-visits, if needed to those randomized to the MAP group to assure fidelity
      to the intervention and to provide booster support to the intervention where needed.
