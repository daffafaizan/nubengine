      pathological data along with blood, biopsy tissue and urine during standard routine scheduled
      medical visits for transplant preparation or monitoring. The blood will be used for next
      generation sequencing in the Verici Dx laboratory to create transcriptomic profiles to
      validate performance characteristics of three Verici Dx sequencing immune-phenotype signature
      risk score tests. The research biopsy tissue and urine are for secondary or exploratory
      objectives. To allow comparison with current accepted standard approaches to identify kidney
      transplant injury or rejection, digital images of stained tissue sections taken from
      surveillance or for-cause biopsy tissue will be evaluated in a central pathology laboratory
      for the purposes of this study. Enrolled subjects will continue in the study for 24 months
      during which the planned validation of the acute clinical and subclinical rejection tests
      will complete after 6 months of follow-up; subjects will be followed to 24 months for the
      validation of the Verici Dx blood-based fibrosis risk prognostic test. After 24 months,
      patients will be followed through ANZDATA and UNOS registry data for later development of
      fibrosis or for graft loss or death.
