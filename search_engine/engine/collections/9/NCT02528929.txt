      secondary-care practice. There are various triggers including diet. There is a growing number
      of people taking a gluten-free diet (GFD) of their own volition even in the absence of
      coeliac disease (CD). The investigators aim to assess whether a GFD could be of benefit to
      patients with IBS-D, previously naive to the effects of gluten and in whom CD has been
      excluded as per normal duodenal biopsies. The investigators will also assess whether certain
      factors may predict a clinical responder such as the presence or absence of at-risk coeliac
      serology.
