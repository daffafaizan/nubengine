      conventional and model-based infusion strategy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia
      (IV PCA) in patients who undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP)

      Group A: conventional IV PCA, Group B: model based IV PCA

        1. Primary endpoint: comparison of postoperative analgesic requirements in patient
           undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) between conventional
           patient controlled analgesia (PCA) (Group A) and effective-compartment based dosing
           strategy of PCA (Group B)

        2. Secondary endpoint: 1) VAS analysis between two groups, 2) postoperative nausea and
           vomiting analysis between two groups, 3) complication evaluation between two groups
