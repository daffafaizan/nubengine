    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Test the psychometric, clinical, and cross cultural validity and reliability
      of the quality-of-life questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) in conjunction with the
      esophageal cancer-specific module EORTC QLQ-OES-24 in patients with esophageal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by treatment (potentially
      curative vs purely palliative). Patients receiving potentially curative treatment are further
      stratified according to study treatment (esophagectomy alone vs esophagectomy plus adjuvant
      or neoadjuvant chemo/radiotherapy vs radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy).
      Patients receiving purely palliative treatment are further stratified according to study
      treatment (intubation/laser/ethanol injection vs palliative chemo/radiotherapy without
      endoscopic relief of dysphagia). Patients are administered two questionnaires: (1) The EORTC
      QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) is a 30-item questionnaire about patient ability to function, symptoms
      related to the cancer and its treatment, overall health and quality of life, and perceived
      financial impact of the cancer and its treatment. (2) The EORTC QLQ-OES-24 is a 24-item
      esophageal cancer-specific questionnaire supplementing EORTC QLQ-C30 with information about
      disease and treatment-related symptoms and side effects, dysphagia, nutrition, and social and
      emotional effects of esophageal cancer. Both questionnaires are administered once before and
      once during or after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 370 patients (170 with locoregional disease, 200 with metastatic disease)
      will be accrued for this study.
