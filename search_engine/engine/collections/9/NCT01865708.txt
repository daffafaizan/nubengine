      investigators will test this hypothesis by addressing the following aims/objectives:

      Specific Aim 1:

      Quantify blood alcohol levels after a 1 hour 74% ethanol lock in urinary catheters utilized
      in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Compare cellular components in urinalyses after the introduction of the ethanol locks.

      Potential study subjects will be recruited from the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta -
      Egleston Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Children that are anticipated to have an indwelling
      urinary catheter for >48 hours will be included. For this pilot study, the investigators will
      enroll 10 patients. Subject ages will range from 6 months to 17 years. Children who are on a
      service other than Critical Care Medicine will have clearance from the primary team prior to
      approaching for enrollment. The consent process will take place prior to or during the
      initial 24 hours of urinary catheter placement.
