    
      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced lung or other cancers,with written consent for
           this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of HER2, Mesothelin, Lewis-Y, PSCA, MUC1,
           GPC3, AXL, EGFR, Claudin18.2, or B7-H3 of the tumor by western blotting or IHC;

        3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells, activate the T cells and
           transfect the T cells with HER2, Mesothelin, Lewis-Y, PSCA, MUC1, GPC3, AXL, EGFR,
           Claudin18.2, or B7-H3 targeting CAR, amplify the transfected T cells as needed, test the
           quality and killing activity of the CAR-T cells and then transfer them back the patients
           via systemic or local injections, and follow up closely to collect related results as
           needed;

        4. To enhance the killing capability, CD4+ T cells are genetically engineered to express
           TGFÎ²-CAR and secret IL7/CCL19 and/or SCFVs against PD1/CTLA4/Tigit; CD8+T cells are
           constructed to express HER2/Mesothelin/Lewis-Y/PSCA/MUC1/
           GPC3/AXL/EGFR/Claudin18.2/B7-H3-DAP10-CAR with knockdown of PD1/HPK1;

        5. Other cancers with these cell surface antigen expressions are also recruited if needed;

        6. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
