      women' delivery outcomes. All participants filled the Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the baseline
      assessment. Then they were randomly assigned into the emotional management (EM) group and the
      usual care (UC) group. The baseline evaluation began at 31 weeks of pregnancy and the mother
      was followed up to 42 days postpartum. Each subject received the EM package In the EM, and
      the UC was given only routine prenatal care. PHQ-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
      scale（EPDS）were used for assessment.
