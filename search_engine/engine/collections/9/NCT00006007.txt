        -  Assess the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium in combination with gemcitabine in
           the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer who have received an anthracycline
           and a taxane in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting and no more than 1 chemotherapy
           regimen for metastatic disease (unless these were a taxane and anthracycline).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine time to progression and overall survival of these patients receiving this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. pemetrexed disodium
      IV is administered over 10 minutes 90 minutes following gemcitabine on day 8. Treatment
      continues every 21 days for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression. Patients achieving a complete response receive 2 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
