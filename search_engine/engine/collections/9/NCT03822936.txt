    
      Enrolled subjects will undergo to 3 cycles of Folfirinox before re-evaluation of the lesion.
      Then, 4D planning and imaging with respiratory gating end rescanning technique will be
      adopted to calculate the optimal treatment plan to carbon ions radiation therapy: 38.4
      Gy[RBE] is the prescribed dose to CTV. 4.8 Gy[RBE]/fraction will be delivered 4 times a week
      in two weeks. 4/6 weeks after hadrontherapy, after a CT scan with contrast, patient will
      undergo to a surgery. After 4/6 weeks, Gemcitabine will be administered for 6 cycles.

      Secondary endpoints of the trial are overall survival, resectability rate (operable vs
      borderline operable), acute toxicity within 3 months, 3-6 months, over 6 months.
