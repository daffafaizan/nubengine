      aims to examine how the gut microbiome and skin biophysical properties are shifted in those
      with acne vulgaris. In particular, this study will assess the influence of oral spore based
      probiotics on the skin sebum production and will assess how probiotics influence the gut
      microbiome and the blood levels of short chain fatty acids.
