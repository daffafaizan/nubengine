      symptoms of uterine fibroids.Follow up studies of this new method have reported relief of
      menstrual bleeding by 85-90 % of the patients six to twelve months after treatment.Other
      studies have suggested laparoscopic bilateral occlusion of uterine arteries as an equal
      effective alternative, but to our knowledge there is no randomized studies published.

      Patients recruitment : Women with symptoms of uterine fibroids referred to the clinic,who
      express a desire to avoid hysterectomy.

      Study hypothesis: Laparoscopic occlusion of uterine vessels and UFE have equal effect on
      bleeding symptoms.

      Gynecological examination, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed
      preoperatively and after 1,3 and 6 months. Clinical follow up is planned after 1,3,6,12,24,36
      and 60 months.A validated bleeding chard, Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart(PBAC)is filled in
      by the participants during the last menstruation period before treatment and before each
      control. A standardized questionnaire to assess the bleeding amount,pressure symptoms, pain,
      adverse events, other complains and patients satisfaction is also used.
