    
      This is a prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), comparing an experimental group
      (EG), submitted to a PNE/HyP based psychological intervention, and a control group (CG),
      submitted to usual treatment and care.

      After recruitment and evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients entering the study
      will sign the Informed Consent. Baseline evaluation is performed at 1 month pre-surgery and,
      afterwards, patients are randomly assigned to EG (PNE+Hyp plus usual care) or CG (usual care
      only). The EG will be submitted to 3 pre-surgical and 1 (or 2) post-surgical reinforcement
      sessions. At 1 month post-surgery, the intervention group will be subdivided and participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive a reinforcement session or no intervention at this
      point. The psychological intervention sessions are based on the educative principles of Pain
      Neuroscience Education and on Hypnosis strategies for the promotion of pain control, positive
      coping strategies and psychological variables.

      Patients will be evaluated on 6 moments: T0 - baseline, 1 month pre surgery; T1 - post
      intervention/24h before surgery; T2 - 72h post-surgery; T3 - 1 month post surgery; T4 - 6
      months post surgery; T5 - 12 months post intervention. Patients will fill in self report
      measures and perform physiological evaluation to analyse relevant bio-markers (salivary
      cortisol and Î±-amylase) that are related to stress levels and SNS functioning and translate
      the impact of psychological interventions on physiological parameters.
