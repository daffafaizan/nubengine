      pruritus is a common and bothersome symptom among the patients. Current therapies for uremic
      pruritus, including dialysis modification, topical treatment such as emollients and topical
      analgesic agent, phototherapy, acupuncture, and gabapentin. However, the efficacy of these
      treatments remains poorly defined.

      In our experiment, the investigators tried to find an effective way to control uremic
      pruritus through Chinese traditional medicine. "Xiao-Feng-San" is a common Chinese herbal
      preparation, composed of 13 herbs, which is used to treat patients with dermatitis. The
      component of "Xiao-Feng-San" has immunomodulatory activity. "Shian Fang Hwa Ming Yiin" is
      another common Chinese herbal preparation, composed of 12 herbs, which is used to treat
      patients with carbuncles and acne. The component of "Shian Fang Hwa Ming Yiin" has
      anti-inflammation and anti-microbial effect.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment effect of Xiao-Feng-San and Shian Fang
      Hwa Ming Yiin on uremic pruritus among hemodialysis patients in this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study design.
