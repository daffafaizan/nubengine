      most pulmonary diseases. However, the associated high expenses, radiation exposure , and its
      limited possibility for bedside use are a limitation. Transthoracic ultrasonograghy is used
      progressively for evaluation of pulmonary diseases. Its non invasive nature , relatively low
      price ,portability for bedside use, and high reproducibility of results allows for
      incorporation of imaging findings with clinical data. Although Transthoracic ultrasonograghy
      is not an alternative to High resolution computed tomography,it can potentially provide
      useful supplemental information in certain specific situations ,such as for rapid bedside
      diagnostic assessment of dyspneic patients. B-line is a common and significant abnormal sign
      used for diagnostic appraisal by Transthoracic ultrasonograghy, but it cannot define the
      exact underlying pathologic feature on a lung ultrasound. When the lung parenchymal pathology
      reaches the lung surface ,certain characteristic changes of the pleural line can be detected
      by means of the good imaging made possible by high-resolution Transthoracic ultrasonograghy
      ,but the application and strength of pleural line abnormalities in the differential diagnosis
      of lung diseases has not been adequately explored . Existing literature on the illustration
      of the pleural line is scarce ,and the shape of pleural line has not been adequately
      investigated and described ,especially in comparison with Computed tomography findings. Most
      studies that have investigated pleural lines are confined to the sub population with
      interstitial lung diseases.
