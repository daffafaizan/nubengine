      (n=27) groups based upon their weaning outcome. Before weaning, the RSBI values were
      determined under the patients disconnecting from the ventilator (RA-no ventilator) and still
      connecting to the ventilator with 4 different settings (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 21
      or 40% combined with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 0 or 5 cm H2O). The patients
      were extubated after completing the weaning trials. Successful weaning was defined as
      patients free from the ventilator for over 48 hours.
