      examination. A variety of methods have been evaluated to date to provide the patient with
      relaxation/distraction during the examination. Especially the use of relaxation music.
      However, the previous studies refer to a subjective assessment of the participants after the
      examination. Here at least one potential bias is to be assumed from the post-procedural
      euphoria through the use of propofol and/or midazolam. Pain reactions express themselves
      explicitly in autonomous function. In contrast to our previous work, the present study uses
      biopotential signals for the objective operationalization of stress reduction.

      The activity of the sympathetic - autonomic nervous system is operationalized by
      biopotentials fixed to the body surface:

        -  in the face area (corrugator, zygomaticus)

        -  on the hand (skin conductance, temperature)

        -  on the torso (electrocardiogram) The satisfaction of the patient and endoscopist with
           endoscopical procedure were asked using questionnaires.
