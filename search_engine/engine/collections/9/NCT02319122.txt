      neuron syndrome, walking pathologies and muscle weakness are leading signs of disability in
      children with cerebral palsy. Moreover, the gradual decline in muscle strength is part of the
      aging process and can be particularly devastating for people with motor disabilities.
      Therefore muscle-strengthening programs are indicated for children with cerebral palsy. There
      is evidence that lower extremity muscle strength can be increased by Progressive Resistance
      Training (PRT) in children with cerebral palsy. However, PRT is time consuming and therefore
      not always feasible for children with neurologic disorders. Moreover, it does not influence
      the anaerobic capacity needed for everyday activities in children. High Intensity Interval
      Training (HIIT) is a time efficient method, which increases both aerobic and anaerobic
      capacities. The aim of this randomized, stratified, single-blinded study is to compare two
      home based strength-training protocols (HIIT and PRT) and their effects on muscle strength,
      gait and aerobic and anaerobic capacity in children with cerebral palsy.
