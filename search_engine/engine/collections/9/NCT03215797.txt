      outcome.Goal directed therapy was proved by multiple studies to be a goal therapy in
      maintaining a stable hemodynamic state. Nevertheless, as the population worldwide is aging,
      elderly presenting for surgery are also increasing. This population is known for the multiple
      comorbidities and physiological changes which makes them prone to dehydration and
      hypotension. That's when we are going to use either Norepinephrine in one group or
      Phenylephrine in the other and compare the effects of both vasopressors.

      Parameters we are going to use are: Hemodynamic (HR, MAP, CO, CI, SVV, SV); Tissue
      Oxygenation and perfusion (DO2, VO2, ERO2, CRT, Lactate, blood gas); Urine output.
