      tissues. If changes are documented, this study would provide evidence supporting current
      models of tissue injury following radiotherapy. In addition, these data may provide a
      mechanistic rationale for clinical approaches to ameliorate the toxicities of radiotherapy.
      Finally, if a correlation exists between tissue oxygenation and toxicity, the rapid and
      simple tissue oxygenation test may provide a quantitative measure of toxicity and allow
      earlier and more precise assessment of both toxicity and efficacy of ameliorative therapies.
