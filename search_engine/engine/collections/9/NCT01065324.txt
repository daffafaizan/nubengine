      deeply into the small intestines by fixation of the soft, redundant small intestines with an
      inflatable balloon over the tip of the overtube. However, the inflation of balloon might
      stimulate the intestinal mucosa, and the deep manipulation of intestinal segments might also
      compromise the intestinal barrier function. According to our preliminary experience of
      balloon-assisted enteroscopy (which is among the first groups in Taiwan), we experienced a
      significant case of suspected post-procedural bactermia patient. Besides, there is also a
      published case report from the UK reporting Streptococcus milleri bacteremia which is
      suspected as bacterial translocation after balloon-assisted enteroscopy. However, currently
      there is no original study focusing on the intestinal barrier / permeability defects or
      bacterial translocation. This is a timely and novel research topic in the current developing
      era of balloon-assisted enteroscopy.
