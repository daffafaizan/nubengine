      work. I normal the individual undergoes five nights of receiving 1.5ug/kg of chloral hydrate.
      On day 6 the individual receives 2.5 micrograms/kg of Dichloroacetate (DCA) and kinetics are
      drawn. After 30 days the subject comes back and receives 1.5ug/kg of chloral hydrate for five
      nights and has kinetics drawn on night one and five. On days 6-9 the subject returns for a
      blood draw. After 30 days the same process as above is done except the subject receives 1gram
      of chloral hydrate for five nights and 25mg/kg of Dichloroacetate one day then 30 days later
      the subject receives 1gram of chloral hydrate for five nights and has kinetics done on night
      one and five and blood samples drawn on days 6-9
