      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (confirmed complete response and partial response) in
           patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma
           treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin^®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, SYT-SSX translocation, HER2/neu expression, and monophasic and
           biphasic phenotype with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years from study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-40
      months.
