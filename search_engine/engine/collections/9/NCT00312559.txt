      after the study is completed. The effects of yoga will not be on the control group. Data on
      physical function will be derived from assessments including strength, balance, flexibility,
      ROM. gait, posture and functional analysis performed in the Georgia Holland Cardiopulmonary
      and Neuromuscular Research Lab. Questionnaires related to quality of life, depression and
      falls will determine psychological impact or yoga training. Vital signs, pulmonary function
