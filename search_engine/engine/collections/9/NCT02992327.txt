      evidence that a biomarker in human blood can help clinicians determine a specific patient's
      clinical outcome from a concussion. This in turn will help clinicians and concussion
      specialists with designing treatment protocols very early after the initial injury that could
      have significant impacts on the health of the patient.

      This study has several important benefits to the scientific community. Concussion treatment
      today is uncertain. Some patients are back to baseline one or two days post injury whereas
      other patients are experiencing debilitating symptoms for months after the injury. Until the
      patient begins to report symptoms, the course of treatment cannot be determined. Other
      biomarkers for concussion diagnosis are being evaluated, but this is the first biomarker to
      show promise for patient stratification and earlier intervention and treatment for the subset
      of cases at high risk of suffering brain damage and persisting dysfunction after concussion.
      Currently, no prognostic method exists for identifying at an early and potentially treatable
      stage the small subset of concussion sufferers at risk of diffuse axonal injury and
      persisting brain functional impairment.
