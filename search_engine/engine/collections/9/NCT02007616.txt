      brain training with video games in a series of cognitive tasks. Two groups of healthy older
      adults participated in the study. The experimental group received 20 1-hr video game training
      sessions using a commercially available brain-training package (Lumosity) involving problem
      solving, mental calculation, working memory and attention tasks. The control group did not
      practice this package and, instead, attended meetings with the other members of the study
      several times along the course of the study. Both groups were evaluated before and after the
      training (experimental group) or a similar period of time (control group) using different
      cognitive tasks in a 2 (Group: Experimental, control) x 2 (Time os assessment: Pre, post)
      mixed factorial design.
