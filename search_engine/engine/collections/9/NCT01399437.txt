      in schizophrenia. Specifically, the aim is to test whether broad monitoring deficits may be
      based on a disruption of the so-called sentinel function of the default network. Because the
      default network is modulated by nicotinic compounds, such finding would implicate a possible
      remediation strategy.<TAB>

      Study population: 24 people with schizophrenia, 24 matched healthy control subjects.

      Design: A group comparison of attention task performance and associated brain activity as
      measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

      Outcome measures: Measures of attention task performance (reaction time, accuracy), BOLD
      signal within regions of the default network, degree of temporal association of BOLD signal
      with trial-by-trial reaction time.
