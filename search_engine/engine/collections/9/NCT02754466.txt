    
      Schoolchildren, aged 6-8 years old, from the six public schools of a deprived suburban area
      of Bras√≠lia, Brazil will be recruited. In the stage 1 of the study, an epidemiological survey
      of the oral health status and an anthropometric evaluation of the children will be performed.
      Potential patient for study's stage 2 will be recruited. Quality of life surveys, patterns of
      oral hygiene and socio-demographic data will be collected.

      Children with restorative treatment needs will be included in the study's stage 2. In this
      second stage, primary molars with deep dentin lesions will be treated according to two
      techniques for selective excavation of carious dentin: subjective criteria or using an
      objective criteria (polymer burs). For both groups restorations will be performed using a
      high-viscosity glass-ionomer. In shallow and medium depth dentin lesions, carious dentin will
      be excavated using hand instruments only (ART approach) and restored using two materials: a
      high-viscosity glass-ionomer or a combination of a self-etch adhesive and a bulk fill
      composite.

      All children will be followed up (study's stage 3) to assess efficacy of the restorative
      interventions and impact of the restorative treatment on children's quality of life and
      development.
