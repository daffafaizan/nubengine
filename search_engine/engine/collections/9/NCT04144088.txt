      by adapting to Western diet and lifestyle. Previous studies have demonstrated the
      relationship between hyperuricemia with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular
      disease and chronic renal disease. While Western medicine shows promising effects in treating
      hyperuricemia and gout, we are searching for an alternative in traditional Chinese medicine
      with both safety and efficacy in treating hyperuricemia.

      We conducted a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults with
      hyperuricemia. Sixty patients with serum uric acid level more than 8 mg/dl were enrolled.
      Patients were then randomized into three arms: Traditional Chinese Medicine formulae:
      "Wu-Ling San", "Yin-Chen Wu-Ling San" or placebo for 4 weeks. Efficacy and safety were
      evaluated at Week 2, 4 and 8. Primary endpoint was the serum uric acid<6 mg/dL at Week 4.
      Secondary endpoints were the differences between groups in serum uric acid at Week 2 and 8,
      serum SGPT, SGOT, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, fasting blood
      glucose, body weight, blood pressures and frequency of gouty attack at Week 4.
