      care plus an early palliative care intervention} (EPC) to be delivered by a nurse over a
      twelve-month period. The EPC will include one nurse-led palliative consult in a two-hour
      house call and followed by 11 monthly 30-minute phone assessment plus usual care. The study
      aims are to determine whether EPC will lead to lower symptom burden, higher quality of life,
      lesser resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) & greater patient
      activation. Mixed-methods framework will be utilized to analyze the audiotapes of the
      encounters between the research nurse and the patient during the twelve intervention sessions
      and to assess whether the information that is provided to participants differs by patient
      ethnicity and cognitive levels.
