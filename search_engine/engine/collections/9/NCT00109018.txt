      risk factor assessment is limited in its ability to predict which patients will have an
      event. The endothelium is known to play a central role in vascular homeostasis and nitric
      oxide (NO) is believed to be the main component responsible for normal endothelial function.
      Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress leading to reduced NO bioavailability and
      subsequent endothelial dysfunction is an important factor in the progression of vascular
      diseases. Further investigation of NO metabolites in blood may provide insight into the
      mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction and disease progression. Preliminary data suggest that
      although plasma nitrite levels are decreased in CAD patients and correlate with endothelial
      dysfunction, the nitrite within red blood cells and whole blood is compensatorily increased.
      Since this new measure is more reproducible and convenient to measure, it may serve as a
      biomarker of endothelial dysfunction. A prospective study of nitrite and other novel NO-based
      assays, proteomics, and current biomarkers linked to endothelial function phenotype will
      allow further investigation into the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and permit
      development of future markers of atherothrombosis.
