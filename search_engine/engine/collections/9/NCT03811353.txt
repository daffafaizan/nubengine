      pediatric patients with chewing disorders.The internal consistency, test-retest reliability,
      and criterion validity of T-MOE will be investigated. The internal consistency will be
      assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 %
      confidence intervals will be calculated for test-retest reliability. The criterion validity
      of the scale will be determined by assessing the correlation between the T-MOE and Karaduman
      Chewing Performance Scale and Tongue Thrust Rating Scale.
