      therapy with conventional facemask (from the beginning to minute 10), HFNC (with a flow of 40
      L/min from minute 11 to 20, 60 L/min from minute 21to 30, 80 L/min from minute 31 to 40, 100
      L/min from minute 41 to 50, 80 L/min from minute 51 to 60, 60 L/min from minute 61 to 70, 40
      L/min from minute 71 to 80), conventional facemask again (washout, from minute 81 to 90) and
      CPAP (10 cmH2O, from minute 91 to 100). Lung ventilation will be evaluated with electrical
      impedance tomography (EIT), which measures thoracic impedance variations related to changes
      in lung aeration. At the end of each 10 minutes-period the following data will be collected:
      electrical impedance tomography data (to calculate the global inhomogeneity index, Î”
      end-expiratory lung impedance and tidal impedance variation), hemodynamic parameters,
      respiratory rate, SpO2, pain (numerical rating scale), level of sedation (Ramsey score) and
      patient comfort (modified Borg scale). An arterial blood gas will be collected at the end of
      the following steps: baseline facemask, HFNC 40 and 100 L/min, washout facemask and CPAP.
      Data about anesthetic/analgesic drugs and ventilation parameters will also be collected.
