      with anthracycline-resistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the
      qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Determine the clinical pharmacology of this regimen in these patients. IV.
      Determine the rationale for the dose and chosen schedule of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive annamycin liposomal IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      continues every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-30
      months.
