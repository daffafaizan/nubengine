      parameters obtained with a technique of transpulmonary indicator dilution after major
      thoracic intervention, including pneumonectomy and lobar resections. The important parameters
      of hemodynamics were monitored throughout the intervention and 48 hrs postoperatively,
      including extravascular lung water index, global end-diastolic volume index, etc.
