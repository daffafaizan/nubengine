      Shandong province, Hubei province and Guangdong province, which locate in northern, central
      and southern parts of China, respectively. Women who attend routine pregnancy diagnosis in
      hospitals or maternal healthcare centers will be invited to take part in this study. At least
      800 women who meet our eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomly assigned to the
      intervention group (n>=400) and the control group (n>=400). A three-dimension comprehensive
      intervention strategy, which incorporates intervention measures simultaneously to individual
      postpartum woman, their family members and community environment, will be utilized to
      maximize the effectiveness of intervention. Regular visiting and follow-up will be done in
      both group; nutrition and health-related measurements will be assessed both before and after
      the intervention.
