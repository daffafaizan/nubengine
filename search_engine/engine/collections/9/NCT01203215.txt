      one of three groups: (1) Choose to Move (CTM), a gender-targeted intervention (2) Jumpstart,
      a motivationally-tailored print-based intervention, or (3) Wellness contact control group.
      Objective and self-report measures of physical activity and psychosocial mediators of change
      were assessed at 3 months to evaluate the efficacy of the programs and maintenance of these
      programs will be conducted by examining a 9 month follow-up phase. This design allows a
      direct comparison between two print-based physical activity self-help programs. The use of
      non face-to-face interventions is critical to reach the large numbers of women in United
      States who are not physically active. Tailored print materials (i.e., Jumpstart) will enable
      participants to have information that is matched to their level of motivation, and thus might
      be expected to be more efficacious than a standard self-help intervention.
