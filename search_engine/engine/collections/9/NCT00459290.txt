      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of mifepristone in patients with recurrent or
           persistent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the potential impact of platinum sensitivity, initial performance status, and
           age on prognosis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral mifepristone once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
