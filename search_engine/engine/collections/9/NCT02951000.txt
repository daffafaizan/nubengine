      pain, wound healing and long term cosmetic results.

      Primary outcome measure is if the lack of a platysma-Suture decreases the postoperative pain
      (detected by the visual pain score 0-10) and reduces the pain medication (detected by the
      cumulative NSAID and opioid treatment per patient). The second Question to be answered is if
      the cosmetic scar result (detected by the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Score) 6 month
      after thyroidectomy is better in the intervention group (no Platysma-Suture) or not.
