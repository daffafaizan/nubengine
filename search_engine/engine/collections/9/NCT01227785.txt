      Study purpose I:

      To evaluate and document appropriate clinical performance of the INCEPTA (DR and VR)
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system and the INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization
      therapy ICD (CRT-D) system and associated application software.

      Study purpose II:

      Demonstrate the clinical relevance of chronic ambulatory daily median Respiratory Rate Trend
      (RRT) in HF patients

      Study Device

        -  INCEPTA (DR and VR) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system (Models F160,
           F161, F162, F163)

        -  INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD (CRT-D) system (Models P162, P163, P165)

      Indication ICD / CRT-D Indication according to standard clinical practice

      Study Objectives

      The study has two primary objectives, linked to the respective study purposes:

      For purpose I:

      The objective is to collect data on the clinical performance of the INCEPTA ICD and CRT-D
      devices during standard clinical use at implant, pre-discharge and at a 1-month post-implant.
      Clinical performance included analysis of pacing thresholds, pacing impedance, sensing
      thresholds, number of successfully converted VT/VF episodes, induced episodes detection
      times, spontaneous episodes, wanded telemetry, adverse events (AEs) and product experiences.

      For purpose II:

      The objective is to show that daily median respiratory rate increases more in patients who
      experience an HF-event (Group 1) than in patients who do not experience an HF-event (Group
      2).

      This is a prospective, multi-centre, field following study.

      Up to 35 study centers in the International geography will enrol 120 patients.
