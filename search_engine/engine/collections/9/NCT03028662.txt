      alcohol dependence. One of the current behavioral techniques to improve inhibitory abilities
      of these patients is the alcohol Approach Avoidance Task (AAT). However, this technique could
      be more efficient if patients, before training in this task, were exposed to a variety of
      alcohol-conditioned stimuli (retrieval) and take advantage of the window period of
      reconsolidation of these memories to carry out this task (extinction training). This project
      will attempt to show the pattern of brain connectivity underlying retrieval-extinction
      learning, its relationship with markers such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and
      their usefulness to reduce relapses of individual with alcohol dependence. To carry out this
      study 115 patients with alcohol dependence who will be randomized into three groups: Group 1
      (N = 35) where the extinction training is performed within the window period (10 minutes);
      Group 2 (N = 35) extinction will take place outside the time window (6 hours); Group 3 (N =
      35), these subjects will be exposed to "non-retrieval" but with extinction-training within
      the window period. Changes in connectivity will be assessed with Electroencephalogram (EEG)
      at baseline and after 4 training sessions, using the HERMES platform. BDNF levels will be
      determined as peripheral markers of neurogenesis. These changes will be are correlated with
      relapses in the 12 weeks of follow-up.
