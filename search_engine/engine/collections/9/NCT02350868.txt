    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will evaluate MPT0E028 in
      subjects with advanced solid malignancies. Subjects will be treated with oral doses of
      MPT0E028 in consecutive, 28-day cycles, and will be evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects
      who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may continue to receive
      MPT0E028 at the discretion of the principal Investigator for up to 6 cycles. The Sponsor will
      keep providing drug for extension cycles to subjects whose disease is controlled at the end
      of 6th cycle until the end of the study or until the early study termination determined by
      sponsor. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the end of
      Study.
