      I. To determine the safety/feasibility of delivering chemotherapy after definitive
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for selected stage/situations of non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 1-year progression free survival in the sub-population of patients with
      stage IB/II NSCLC, i.e. the "curative intent" subgroup of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy every other day for up to 14 days for a
      total of 5 fractions. After a break period of about 30 days, patients will then start
      chemotherapy. Patients will receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day
      1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30-40 minutes on days 1,
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
