      accumulating clinical evidence favoring the use of hypo fractionation, SBRT regimen might
      constitute a much more convenient non-invasive and highly efficient outpatient therapy.
      Although the proposed extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy approach was expected to provide
      excellent local control of the primary prostate cancer, a proportion of patients with
      intermediate- or high-risk disease may have recurrences with local recurrence or distant
      metastasis in the future, requiring strategies to minimize systemic disease. Ga-68 PSMA
      PET/MR has high accuracy in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. In this protocol,
      pretreatment Ga-68 PSMA PET/MR and CT scanning were performed in all patients as well as the
      imaging fusion before delineating the target. This study would explore the simultaneously
      integrated boost or equential integrated boost to the dominant intraprostatic nodule based on
      Ga-68 PSMA PET/MR in SBRT.
