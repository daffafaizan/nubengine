      that 48% of the women with mastalgia have serious difficulties in their sexual life, 36% have
      physical activity difficulties, 13% have social activity difficulties and 6% have work or
      school activity difficulties. The etiology of the mastalgia is not clear. Because of the
      women with mastalgia tested out lots of examinations for the etiology. Also this problem has
      financial load because of the unknown etiology.
