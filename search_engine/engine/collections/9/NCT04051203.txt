      worldwide. In most patients with concussion, symptoms improve within 3 months. However, in
      some persons, symptoms persist. The cause(s) of post-traumatic headache are not entirely
      clear, which limits treatment options. Sometimes, these headaches are caused by irritation to
      the greater occipital nerve, and pain originating from this area is called "greater occipital
      neuralgia". These headaches are often treated with steroid injections to the affected nerve.
      However, the effect of the injection is usually short lasting and may not provide adequate
      pain relief.

      Therefore, other methods of treatment have been sought out. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is an
      emerging biologic treatment. PRP contains high concentrations of platelets, growth factors,
      and anti-inflammatory molecules. PRP acts to reduce inflammation and encourage tissue repair
      at the site of injection. PRP is created by collecting a person's own blood, centrifuging it,
      and extracting the platelet-rich layer of plasma. This platelet rich mixture is then
      re-injected into the affected area. PRP is used as a safe and effective treatment in many
      fields, and is most commonly used in arthritis. PRP has recently been studied as a potential
      treatment for peripheral nerve disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

      Post-injection, a daily headache diary provided via mobile application (Secure RedCap)
      available in iPhone or android device will be provided to record daily records of numeric
      pain rating scale, headache frequency and medication-use.
