2091. modern methods of treatment of visceral amyloidosis in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis (russian)the immediate and long-term results oftreatment during 1945-1962 of 414 patientswith pulmonary tuberculosis complicatedby amyloidosis were studied.  hormonal(corticosteroid) therapy is the pathogenetictreatment for visceral amyloidosis andis indicated in the proteinuric and earlyedema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis whenthe functional capacity of the kidneys andthe liver is still adequate.  in the azotemicphase of amyloidosis, hormonal (corticosteroid)therapy is not indicated, since itleads to rapid deterioration in the patient'scondition.  since hypoxemia is one of themain factors in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis,oxygen therapy is rational patho-genetic therapy for patients with pulmonarytuberculosis complicated by hypoxemiaand with symptoms of the proteinuric oredema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis(without ascites), in the form ofsubcutaneous introduction of oxygen or oxy-geno-peritoneum.  in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis surgical interven-tion on account of the main processis indicated only in the early stages of amyloi-dosis when pronounced functionaldisorders of the kidneys and liver are absent.  co-joint therapy using protein vitamins(particularly ascorbic acid), hormonal (corticos-teroid) preparations, oxygen anddesensitizing agents and elimination of all foci ofinfection is indicated in treatmentof pulmonary tuberculosis with even the earliestsigns of amyloidosis.
