    
      Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting in the lack of
      ability to produce blood-clotting factor IX (FIX). Individuals with hemophilia B suffer
      repeated bleeding events, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes leads to death
      due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. This chronic joint disease can have
      significant physical, psychosocial, and quality-of-life effects, including financial burden.
      The current treatment is intravenous infusion of FIX protein products, either
      prophylactically or in response to bleeding.

      The approach being tested in this study uses a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus
      (AAV), which in nature causes no disease, to deliver the human factor IX (hFIX) gene to the
      liver cells where FIX is normally made. Recent data of a gene therapy study showed
      preliminary encouraging results with the approach of using an AAV vector carrying the factor
      IX gene. This study will seek to determine the safety and kinetics of a single IV infusion of
      SPK-9001 (a novel AAV vector carrying a high specific activity factor IX variant).
