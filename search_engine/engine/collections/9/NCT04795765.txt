      consecutive enrollment design. The sample size for this Registry will include at least 500
      patients treated for VCFs across approximately 10 sites. A total of 300 patients will be
      treated with the SpineJack system and 200 patients will be treated with other vertebral
      augmentation (VA) procedures, such as BKP or VP. Sites within the U.S. may include healthcare
      professionals (HCPs) that are surgeons, pain physicians and/or interventional radiologists.
