      ulcer disease. The advent of specific drugs to cure ulcer disease now extends life until
      metastases from the non-beta-islet cell tumor cause death. The present study proposes to
      continue to test the effect of combined chemotherapy with streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil and
      doxorubicin in biopsy-proven cases of metastatic non-beta-islet cell tumor in patients with
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. We published our initial experience with this protocol in 1988.
      An objective response was observed in 40% of patients.
