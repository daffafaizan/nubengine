      flow-obstructing coronary artery disease (CAD).

      Recently, multi-detector CT (MDCT) has emerged as a new modality that offers a non-invasive
      means to directly visualize coronary anatomy and any CAD. Studies have shown that MDCT has
      excellent sensitivity and a high negative predictive value in detecting significant CAD.

      The purpose of this study is to compare MDCT with nuclear stress testing for detecting CAD in
      previously undiagnosed patients.
