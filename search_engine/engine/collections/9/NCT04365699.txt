        -  To characterize serial measures cardiac structure and function and in-hospital survival
           in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection

        -  To develop predictive models of cardiac risk in hospitalized COVID-19 infection patients

        -  To assess safety of treatment with AT-001 plus standard of care on in-hospital survival
           in patients with COVID-19

        -  To characterize the effects of treatment with AT-001 plus standard of care on
           in-hospital mortality, progression of acute lung injury requiring mechanical
           ventilation, and serial measures of cardiac structure and function
