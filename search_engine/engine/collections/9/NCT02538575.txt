      utility of this test is described in several chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension). The distance performed during
      the 6MWT and / or desaturation during the 6MWT is a prognostic factor that contributes to the
      assessment of patients for lung transplantation indication.

      The 6MWT is practiced routinely in cystic fibrosis centers but its usefulness in this disease
      has not been shown. Also the results of this test are not part of the decision-making
      criteria for lung transplantation.

      A single-center study performed in adults CRCM at Cochin Hospital suggests the prognostic
      value of the 6MWT in patients with adult's cystic fibrosis.

      The principal objective of this study is to assess the prognostic of 6MWT as part of the
      cystic fibrosis. The primary endpoint will be to assess the survival without lung transplant
      during the follow up period of 3 years. In this context, this prognostic tool could be used
      to help to determine the best time to consider a lung transplant in cystic fibrosis patient.
