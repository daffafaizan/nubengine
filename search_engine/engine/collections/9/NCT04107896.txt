      in elderly men. Selective α1-adrenergic antagonists are now ﬁrst-line drugs in the medical
      management of BPH. This Hospital based randomized controlled clinical study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of the new α1-blocker silodosin in the treatment of symptomatic benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Ambulatory patients of age between 50 to 70 years, who were
      diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia, were divided into two groups after fulfilling
      selection criteria. After informed consent & random sampling by lottery, silodosin 8 mg was
      given to group A (study) & tamsulosin 0.4 mg was given to group B (control). Total 149
      patients were enrolled in this study but 8 patients were lost during follow up. Hence 141
      patients completed the study, during the period of June 2017 to August 2018.
