      in the study. Each participating individual will undergo two weeks of eligibility screening
      followed by 4-week double-blind treatment. The number, severity and duration of NLC will be
      measured daily as documented in a designated, structured sleep dairy. Quality of life and
      quality of sleep will be assessed by SF-36 and PSQI questionnaires, respectively, to be
      completed twice - at enrollment and within one week of the end of the treatment period.
