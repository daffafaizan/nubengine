      cancer staging, but also for assessment of response to therapy. So far, PET/CT is a key
      method to assess cancer-related changes of metabolism in tumors, which is crucial for
      response evaluation and to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Limitations of
      PET/CT include the assessment of sclerotic bone metastasis, which often do not show increased
      tracer uptake. Certain organ metastasis (especially in brain and liver) are also barely
      detectable due to physiologically increased uptake. Moreover, both CT and administration of
      radioactive tracer are associated with radiation exposure for patients. Whole-body MRI
      (wb-MRI) including functional techniques (e.g. Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) to evaluate
      cell density) enables a functional staging and therapy assessment without use of ionizing
      radiation. Advantages to assess sclerotic bone lesions and organ metastases have been
      confirmed in recent literature. Limitations of MRI include detection of lesions in organs
      with high susceptibility and motion like the thorax.
