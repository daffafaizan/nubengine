    
      This is a single center, non-randomized study of the Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent
      coated with sirolimus (140Âµg/cm2) and formulated for fast or slow release. The sirolimus
      coated stent is mounted on the Raptor OTW SDS. Approximately 30 patients with de novo or
      restenotic native coronary artery lesions <=18mm in length and >=3.0 to >=3.5 mm in diameter
      by visual estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be treated with the sirolimus
      coated Bx VELOCITY stent(s). Patients will be followed for five years post-procedure and will
      have a repeat angiography at 4 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 48 months.
