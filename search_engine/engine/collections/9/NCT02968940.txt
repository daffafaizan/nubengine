    
      The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antibody of
      the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) isotype that specifically targets and blocks the Programmed
      death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).

      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells,
      resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.
