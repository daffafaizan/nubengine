      standard BoNT treatment, the peak-dose benefits are seen at about 4-6 weeks after the
      administration of injections. rTMS will be introduced during this peak-dose period (about 6
      weeks after BoNT or T1).The effects of combined therapy at about 10 weeks after BoNT
      injections (T2) and at about 12 weeks after BoNT injections (T3) will be examined along with
      the physiological effects at these time points.
