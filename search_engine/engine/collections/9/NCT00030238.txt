      have an increased risk for a number of other obesity-related co-morbid conditions (such as
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Type 2 Diabetes) as well as for all-cause mortality. The
      total cost attributable to obesity amounted to $99.2 billion in the US in 1995 and this
      figure, like the prevalence of increased body mass, is rising at an alarming rate. At the
      same time calcium intake in the US adult population is far below the RDA (recommended daily
      allowance) and much below the daily optimal calcium intake recommended by the 1994 NIH
      consensus conference. An analysis of the NHANES III database suggests a strong inverse
      association between relative risk of obesity and calcium intake. Further, both prospective
      studies in animal models, and retrospective analyses of human studies suggest calcium
      supplementation may play a role in minimizing yearly weight gain, and may possibly induce
      small weight losses.

      In order to test the relationship between calcium intake and body weight, we propose to
      conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of calcium
      supplementation (1500 mg/day of supplementary calcium vs. placebo) in adults with a BMI
      greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2). We will study the effects of supplemental calcium on
      body weight, body composition, and obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as insulin
      sensitivity and lipids. The effects of such supplementation on blood pressure will also be
      systematically evaluated. A control group of untreated, healthy, adults will also be enrolled
      for comparisons to study subjects.
