      renal function, even when baseline UA levels are within the normal range. UA activates the
      renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), increases oxidative stress and promotes
      inflammation. As a consequence, higher UA levels are associated with metabolic abnormalities
      (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia), cardiovascular disease (hypertension, endothelial
      dysfunction, arterial stiffness, cardiac diastolic dysfunction) and kidney function
      abnormalities (hyperfiltration - a marker for intraglomerular hypertension, proteinuria).
      Thus pharmacologic UA lowering may promote renal and cardiovascular protection. The
      mechanisms underlying these protective effects in humans, prior to the onset of clinical
      disease, remain unknown.

      This study is focused on the prevention of complications in young, normotensive type 1
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with normal renal function and UA levels. The study will
      examine the effect of UA lowering with febuxostat (FBX) on renal hemodynamic function,
      vascular function and urinary inflammatory biomarkers. Based on substantial supportive
      pre-clinical and epidemiological data, we hypothesize that lowering UA levels that are within
      normal range at baseline will: 1) ameliorate hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic of
      T1DM, and reduce renal and systemic hypertensive responses to hyperglycemia; 2) ameliorate
      endothelial function abnormalities characteristic of T1DM; 3) reduce urinary inflammatory
      cytokines/chemokine excretion.
