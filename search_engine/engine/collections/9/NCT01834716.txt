      groups: aerobic exercise group and non-aerobic exercise group. All subjects will be trained
      on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), using the Body Media armband, and
      exercise diary. Subjects will also complete an online food questionnaire.

      Subjects assigned to the aerobic exercise group will work with an exercise trainer who will
      provide individual training (six half hour sessions) until they are proficient at the use of
      the equipment and understand goals. Subjects will return to Brooks Family YMCA at their
      convenience, but at a minimum of four times per week. Subjects will complete the exercise
      journal daily and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire on a
      monthly basis.

      Subjects assigned to the non-aerobic exercise group will attend supervised classes on toning
      and stretching at a minimum of four times per week. Subjects will complete the exercise
      journal daily and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire on a
      monthly basis.
