      and those randomized to the 100 mg and 200 mg VRs will not be told their group assignment.
      Participants will insert one VR to be used continuously for 13 weeks (100 mg VR or 200 mg VR)
      or one VR (25 mg VR) to be replaced every 4 weeks for 8 weeks, then worn for an additional 5
      weeks for a total of 13 weeks. Participants will continue follow-up for an additional one to
      three days after final VR removal.
