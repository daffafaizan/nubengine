      There were approximately 232,000 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the US in 2005. Most
      patients present with localized disease and undergo curative therapy, either radical
      prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). Although most men are cured after this therapy,
      approximately 30,000-50,000 annually in the US will develop recurrence after RP. For most of
      these patients, recurrence will be defined by biochemical recurrence (BCR), a rise in PSA
      with no other documented evidence of recurrence. Patients with BCR typically receive
      radiation therapy to the prostate bed. However, about 50% of these patients will develop
      distant recurrence outside of the pelvis and require systemic therapy.

      Satraplatin is a third generation orally administered platinum compound. Early clinical
      studies demonstrated activity in tumors of the ovary and lung in addition to prostate cancer.
      Satraplatin has shown activity in prostate cancer in Phase II studies and has been evaluated
      in a pivotal Phase III study (The SPARC trial)as a single agent as second line therapy.
