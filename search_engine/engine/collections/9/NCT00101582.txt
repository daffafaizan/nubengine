    
      This study consisted of 2 phases. The acute oral mucositis (OM) evaluation phase includes the
      time from randomization to the time of severe OM (WHO Grade 3 or 4) resolution (up to Week 12
      or up to Week 15 for participants whose severe OM is not resolved at Week 12). In the acute
      OM evaluation phase, participants were randomized to receive either a single IV dose of
      palifermin or placebo at 180 Î¼g/kg, 3 days before the start of radiotherapy, plus 7
      once-weekly palifermin or placebo doses at the same dose level during a 7-week
      radio/chemotherapy course. In the long-term follow up phase, participants are followed until
      death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. The long-term follow up phase is still
      ongoing.
