      development of the vascular and nervous systems in the body. A role for VEGF in ALS has been
      suggested from observations in animal models of the disease as well as observations of a
      dysregulation of VEGF production in patients with ALS.

      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF165 in
      the form of the drug product sNN029 can improve motor function and prolong survival in
      patients with ALS, and in this first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 3
      months will be evaluated.

      Assessments will include:

        -  Electrocardiograms, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests

        -  Adverse events and withdrawals related to adverse events

        -  Possible pathological changes in the brain, spinal cord or retina identified through
           magnetic resonance imaging and funduscopy

        -  Possible signs of intracranial bleeding or loss of blood-brain-barrier integrity through
           measurements of bilirubin and albumin levels in cerebrospinal fluid collected through
           lumbar and cervical puncture

        -  Device performance as characterized by catheter tip placement (determined by imaging)
           and infusion accuracy (pump residual volume)

      The secondary objective of this study is:

        -  To explore the effect of ICV administration of sNN0029 on the time course of Amyotrophic
           Lateral Sclerosis related parameters including:

             -  Disease activity as measured by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating
                Scale

             -  Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D rating scale

        -  To explore the levels of VEGF165 in cerebrospinal fluid collected through lumbar and
           cervical puncture.
