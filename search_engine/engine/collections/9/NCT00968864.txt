      the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several clinical trials have shown that
      the use of T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) reduces GVHD in alternative
      donor transplants. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of CD34 positive
      selection and T cell depletion using the CliniMACSÂ® Device as the only GVHD prophylaxis to
      prevent severe acute GVHD in recipients of an alternative donor PBSC transplant. Mismatched
      related donors will match at least 3 of 6 Human leukocyte antigens(HLA)(haplocompatible) and
      unrelated donors will match at least 6 out of 8 HLA antigens with the transplant recipient.
      The conditioning therapy including chemotherapy, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), +/- total
      body irradiation (TBI) will be based on the patient's diagnosis. The transplant recipient
      will be followed for 5 years after transplant for GVHD, engraftment, post-transplant
      infections, disease relapse, and overall survival. In addition, this study will serve as a
      platform for a companion study of therapy to accelerate immune recovery after transplant.
