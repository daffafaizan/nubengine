      changing protease inhibitors in a treatment regimen, the choice of available RT inhibitors is
      often limited by prior exposure, toxicity, or pharmacologic interaction with the protease
      inhibitors. This study addresses the question of whether to continue 3TC or substitute the
      nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DLV when adding IDV to therapy for
      patients previously treated with ddI or d4T plus 3TC who have greater than 500 copies/ml of
      plasma HIV-1 RNA. Although the activity of DLV as monotherapy or in combination with
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is of limited duration due to rapid emergence of
      resistance, it is possible that DLV will contribute significantly to the activity of 3-drug
      regimens that include a new RT inhibitor plus a protease inhibitor.

      Patients with greater than 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml are randomized to 3 treatment arms as
      follows:

      Arm I: d4T + ZDV placebo + DLV + IDV Arm II: ZDV + d4T placebo + 3TC + IDV Arm III: ZDV + d4T
      placebo + DLV + IDV Treatment on all arms is given for 24 weeks. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97:
      The study is no longer partially blinded, and placebo agents are no longer given; treatment
      duration is now 48 weeks.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/24/98: study duration is now 96 weeks.]
      Rollover patients from ACTG 306 with greater than 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml previously assigned
      to ZDV/3TC are nonrandomly assigned to Arm I; those previously assigned to ddI/3TC or d4T/3TC
      are randomized to Arm II or III. Non-rollover patients are randomized to Arm II or III.
      Rollover patients from ACTG 306 with 500 HIV-1copies/ml or less continue on their previously
      assigned regimen [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/98: current regimen must be ZDV/3TC, ddI/3TC, or
      d4T/3TC.] for the study duration or until an increase occurs. If this increase occurs,
      patients previously assigned to ZDV/3TC are nonrandomly assigned to Arm I for the remaining
      study weeks, while those previously assigned to either ddI/3TC or d4T/3TC are randomized to
      Arm II or III for the remaining study weeks. Patients who received ddI/d4T or ddI/3TC in ACTG
      306 are stratified by whether patients received monotherapy or combination therapy during the
      first 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97: 48 weeks]; [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/24/98: 96 weeks.]
      of ACTG 306.
