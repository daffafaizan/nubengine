      with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), recurrences are still common,
      especially in patients with unfavorable clinical, pathological and/or molecular features.
      Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity when
      added to ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of ribociclib to standard adjuvant ET on
      invasive disease-free survival in patients with HR+, HER2- intermediate-risk EBC.
