    
      The study will take place over two separate visits spaced about 1 week apart.

      During the first visit participants will undergo informed consent. They will then be randomly
      assigned one of two test conditions, (a) standard control, or (b) voice recognition control.

      For both conditions participants will be allowed to train on the control scheme until they
      are comfortable with it's usage. Subjects will then be asked to manipulate common objects as
      a test of improved control and utility. Functional outcome measures will be utilized to
      standardize the tasks performed and evaluate the advantages of voice control.

      On the second visit participants will be assigned the alternate condition, allowed to train
      with the control scheme, and run through the same set of functional outcomes measures.

      Upon completion of the second visit participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire.
