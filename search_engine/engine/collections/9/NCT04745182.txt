    
      This is a single-arm proof-of-concept trial of a phone-delivered positive
      psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention, with content adapted to midlife
      persons. Midlife adults with low physical activity were recruited from outpatient clinics,
      completed baseline outcome measures (including wearing an accelerometer to measure activity
      for one week), completed the 12-week MASTERY intervention, and then completed a follow-up
      session to obtain repeat outcome information. The intervention, which involved weekly phone
      sessions with a trained study team member, included the completion of PP exercises, setting
      physical activity goals, and completion of activities to reduce midlife-specific stressors.
      The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability, and secondary outcomes included
      accelerometer-measured physical activity and self-report outcomes.
