      the duration of the QTc intervals and the plasma concentrations of carmoterol; 2) expand the
      available information on plasma pharmacokinetics and urine excretion for inhaled carmoterol
      at the proposed therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses; and 3) generate additional safety
      information.
