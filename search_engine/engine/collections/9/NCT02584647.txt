      sarcomas. Due to its rarity, few MPNST-specific prospective trials exist, and treatments are
      largely based on extrapolation from results from other sarcoma subtypes. Since the molecular
      pathways driving pathogenesis within sarcoma subtypes are distinct, these treatment options
      are likely suboptimal at best. Targeted therapies that block key pathways known to drive
      MPNST will likely result in superior tumor responses with limited toxicities.
