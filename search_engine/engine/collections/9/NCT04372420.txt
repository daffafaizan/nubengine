      recorded and the evaluation of bone fill was performed after 6 months by using ImageJÂ®
      software. After 6 months, the bone fill obtained with rhBMP-2 was higher when compared to
      PRF. From this trial conducted over a period of 6 months, the unique properties associated
      with rhBMP-2 in absorbable sponge makes it a potential agent to be used as a graft material
      for Grade II furcation defects.
