      and optionally cleft palate, leading to severe upper airway obstruction and failure to
      thrive; occasionally even to sudden infant death. Treatment approaches are heterogeneous,
      some are considerably invasive; few have been evaluated by objective tests.

      In a longitudinal cohort study, we want to assess the effect of the pre-epiglottic baton
      plate on upper airway obstruction and failure to thrive using objective criteria
      (mixed-obstructive apnea index assessed by polysomnography, standard deviation score for body
      weight) upon admission and 3 months after hospital discharge. The pre-epiglottic baton plate
      is the main treatment approach currently used in Germany for this condition and practised
      standard care in the three participating study centers.

      These data will help to compare the effect of the main treatment currently used in Germany
      with international data on more invasive treatments used in this rare condition.
