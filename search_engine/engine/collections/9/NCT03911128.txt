      children and young adults with ALL. ALL in young people has excellent outcome with >90%
      survival in children and about 75% in young adults. However, patients still die of disease -
      after relapse as a result of under-treatment.

      Furthermore, a considerable fraction of younger patients are over-treated: All patients risk
      treatment-related death and some suffer long-term side-effects or secondary cancer. The rates
      of death from disease and death from therapy are almost the same for children. To show
      improvement with such good survival, large populations are needed.

      Study groups from the five Nordic countries, Estonia and Lithuania (NOPHO), the UK (UKALL),
      the Netherlands (DCOG), Germany (COALL), Belgium (BSPHO), Ireland (SHOP) and France (SFCE)
      have designed a common treatment protocol as new standard of care for children and young
      adults with ALL. The risk-stratification is based on a novel, personalised algorithm using
      clinical characteristics, genetic changes in the leukaemia and response to therapy.

      The protocol will, based on a personalised risk-approach, define a platform for diagnosis and
      treatment onto which randomized as well as non-randomised interventions and translational
      studies can be added.

      High-risk B-lineage patients may be stratified to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T)
      therapy as an alternative to high-risk blocks and stem-cell transplant to reduce the
      side-effects.

      Translational and other therapy-related research will be promoted by the common master
      protocol.
