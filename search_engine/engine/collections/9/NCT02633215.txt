      of tissue damaged in the acute phase have been disappointing, highlighting the need for
      effective therapeutic interventions after neurologic damage has occurred. Data from animal
      and human models have suggested that sensory input plays an important role in motor output,
      possibly by influencing cortical plasticity. However, in spite of the advances to date,
      little is known about the extent to which sensory input in the form of peripheral nerve
      stimulation can be successfully combined to physical training especially in poorly recovered
      stroke patients. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained peripheral nerve
      stimulation coupled with functional motor training, to improve hand motor function in stroke
      patients with severe motor deficit. The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with
      severe motor deficit receiving hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy
      will have improved motor function compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and
      task-oriented therapy, and the degree of this behaviorally-measured effect will correlate
      with the neurophysiological effect measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation.
