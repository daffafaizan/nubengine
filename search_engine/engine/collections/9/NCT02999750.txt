      if a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-based therapy / best PFS achieved by
      prior therapy) will be > 1.0 thus generating a patient cohort with this very property.
      Thereby, the null hypothesis (that â‰¤ 40 % of this patient population would have a PFS ratio
      of > 1.0) will be evaluated with each patient being his own control. For tumor types with
      high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.
