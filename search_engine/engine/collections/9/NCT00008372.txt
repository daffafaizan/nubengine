      platinum-refractory small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour once a week for 4
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
