      days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline (2 h flight) and by bus (2 h ride)
      to the ALMA base camp located at 2900 m near San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile.
      Participants will stay there for the next 7 nights and they will spend the days (6 total; 6-8
      h daily) at the telescope station at 5050 m while undergoing testing as described above at
      the first and the last day at 5050m. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050 m will be by car (1 h
      ride, one way). After the first 7 day altitude sojourn participants will return to the
      Santiago area (520 m) for a 7 day recovery period. A second altitude sojourn with an
      identical schedule as the one described above and a final low altitude stay of 3 days will
      follow.
