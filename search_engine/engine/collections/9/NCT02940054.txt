      general practitioners (GPs) for RED-Flags Index validation.

      The project is divided into two phases.

        1. retrospective phase (4 weeks). All the general practitioners participating to the study
           will extrapolate from their patient's database, the total number of patients with a
           Crohn's disease diagnosis performed in the past. The date of diagnosis will be
           indicated. No other information will be provided. These data will be then analyzed to
           obtain, for each GP, the total number of CD diagnosed in each semester.

        2. retrospective phase (6 months). GPs will administer the RED-Flags questionnaire to all
           patients that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, after informed consent signature.
           All these patients will be then referred to the nearest referral center, to be evaluated
           by a gastroenterologist specialized in CD, to confirm or exclude a CD.
