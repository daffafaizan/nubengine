      to mechanical stimulus. The pain maps will be created by combining IR images, photographs,
      and clinical input, and will be correlated with patient co-morbidities. The IR images will
      assess for areas of inflammation and increased skin temperature. Pain maps will be created
      with patient response to mechanical stimulation with a cotton swab and will be overlaid on
      the thermographic images. Through this combination of measurements, the investigators plan to
      expand the diagnostic tools used in patient care as well as on the classification of this
      heterogeneous disorder.
