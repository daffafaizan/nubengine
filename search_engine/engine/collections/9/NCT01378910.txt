      Several phenotypic and genotyping tropism tests have been developed in the recent years.
      Phenotypic assays (i.e. TrofileTM and ES-TrofileTM) have been used.in most clinical trials.
      Genotypic tropism testing, however, is easier, cheaper and faster than phenotypic methods,
      and can be performed in a local HIV laboratories.

      Viral RNA amplification is difficult in subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels <500-1000 copies/mL.
      In these cases, the optimal source of genetic material is peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC)-associated proviral DNA. Whereas genotypic tropism testing in proviral DNA is
      technically feasible, it has not been validated as a tool to predict sustained virological
      response to CCR5-antagonist therapy in subjects with undetectable viremia.

      As of today, maraviroc is the only CCR5-antagonist approved for HIV treatment. It has few
      drug interactions and a good security profile, particularly in terms of lipid and glucose
      metabolism. Therefore, it might be an adequate alternative for HIV-1-infected individuals
      with suppressed viremia who experience antiretroviral-related toxicity or metabolic problems.

      This study will evaluate 48-week virological outcomes in aviremic subjects with an R5 virus
      by proviral genotypic tropism testing who switch the "third drug" of their regimen to
      maraviroc.
