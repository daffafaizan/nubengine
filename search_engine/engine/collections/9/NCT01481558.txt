      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients received six sessions of intervention during
      two weeks and were evaluated at baseline, at week one and two, and after one week without
      intervention. Clinical raters, patients, and caregivers were blinded. The primary outcome was
      apathy. Global cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms were examined as secondary outcomes.
