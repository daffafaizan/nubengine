        -  Five hours OGTT- 6 subjects in each group that have C-Peptide positive lab result at
           screening and consent to the OGTT (Appendix 3) This data will address the sources and
           nature of blood glucose variability across the progression of PD and T2D. The data
           collected in this study will enable investigation into CGM-data artifacts that speak to
           the state and management of PD and T2D. Possible applications enabled by these data sets
           include: compliance with drug regimens and other lifestyle recommendations, drug
           titration and/or escalation/de-escalation, and diagnosis and/or treatment throughout the
           progression of the disease.
