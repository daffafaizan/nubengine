      teleconsultations and/or access to various public services (cultural events, education,
      etc.). In the context of long-term hospitalisation, they can be used for various purposes,
      such as access to cultural events, university activities, contact with patient's home and
      maintenance of family links. Some studies have analyzed the use of these robots and their
      effects in academic settings or the suitability of their use with elderly populations for
      continuing care.

      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the interest for the parent-child relationship of
      the use of a telepresence robot during the hospitalisation in protective isolation for a long
      period of a patient with young child(ren).

      We propose to conduct this observational, multi-center prospective study aiming at evaluating
      the parent-child relationship following the setting up of a mobile telepresence robot for
      patients with children aged 15 years or less and hospitalised in long-term protective
      isolation.
