    
      To achieve the proposed objective, it will be performed a randomized, triple-blind (patients,
      therapists, and outcome assessors), placebo-controlled trial.

      Seventy-two patients with chronic non-specific low back pain will be randomly allocated to
      two treatment groups: 1. Active PBMT or Placebo PBMT.

      In both groups, six treatment sessions will be performed twice a week (at the same time of
      the day), with intervals of three or four days between sessions, during three-week period.
      The patients will be treated by a blinded therapist.

      The outcomes will be obtained at stabilization phase (during 2 weeks), baseline, end of
      treatment, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the last treatment session, and 7 days after conclusion
      of treatment. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor.

      Statistical analyzis:

        -  The Fischer's Exact Test will be conducted to compare the proportion of successes
           between groups.

        -  The Unpaired t-test will be used for demographic data.

        -  Repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to analyze pain intensity. The level of
           statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.
