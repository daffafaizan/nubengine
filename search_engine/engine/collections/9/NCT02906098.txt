      key-factor for the prevention of periodontal disease progression is the establishment of
      periodontal infection control, by means of adequate daily oral hygiene. Hence, a main task
      for dental professionals is to educate and motivate the patient to such beneficial behavior.
      A hypothesis for the current study is that patient centered health promotion programs based
      on cognitive behavioral theory and principles and with a directive communicative approach,
      i.e. motivational interviewing techniques, add positive and lasting effects to standard
      educational interventions on self-performed periodontal infection control.

      This randomized clinical field study involves 30 professionals (dental hygienists) and about
      350 adolescent patients at 16 dental clinics in the Västra Götaland Region, Sweden. The
      approach in the evaluation is on patient-centered outcomes and health economics.
