      improving the treatment options in case with hopeless teeth in the esthetic zone by immediate
      implants is a need by both practitioners and patients.

      Current guidelines, today, restricting such treatment to only thick (+ or = 1mm) buccal bone
      plates. However, the literature shows that less than 10% of the community have such criteria,
      making it a high risk but needed procedure.

      Soft tissue and bone remodelling after extraction is an inescapable fact. Immediate implant
      placement cannot prevent soft tissue and bone remodeling around implants (Ara√∫jo et al. 2005,
      Chen et al. 2009), but implant surface treatment and modifications might enhance the
      maintainability of the supporting structures around the dental implant due to its faster
      integration, better stimulating the vascular components at the site. This could be tested by
      the crestal and buccal bone changes, pink esthetic score and ostell readings.
