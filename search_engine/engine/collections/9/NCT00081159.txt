      Primary

        -  Compare the clinical efficacy of hormonal ablative therapy combined with doxorubicin and
           zoledronate with or without strontium chloride Sr 89, in terms of progression-free
           survival, in patients with androgen-dependent prostate cancer and bone metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the
      number of bony metastases (â‰¤ 6 versus > 6). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive hormonal ablative therapy comprising luteinizing
           hormone-releasing hormone agonist (e.g., leuprolide or goserelin) continuously during
           study treatment OR bilateral orchiectomy. Patients also receive doxorubicin
           intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 2 courses; zoledronate IV over
           15 minutes on day 1 every 28 days for 6 courses; and a single dose of strontium chloride
           Sr 89 IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive hormonal ablative therapy, doxorubicin, and zoledronate as in
           arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 20 months.
