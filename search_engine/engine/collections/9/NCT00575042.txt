      patients with PBC treated for 1 year. A randomized design would not be feasible at this stage
      of the research. Two sites are enrolling patients: University of Florida, Gainesville, and
      Mayo Clinic Rochester, with the first as the coordinating site. The total number of patients
      to start treatment will not exceed 20. Our endpoints are 1) surrogate markers of disease
      activity -serum alkaline phosphatase and immunoglobulin M; 2) a well validated prognostic
      index -Mayo risk score and 3) the NIDDK quality of life questionnaire.
