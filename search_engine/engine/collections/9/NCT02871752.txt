    
      The current study proposes to examine the efficacy of couples-based mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) on positive and negative psychological responses to active surveillance (AS)
      and AS adherence, with a larger, more geographically representative sample of men on AS and
      their spouses. We will compare the MBSR intervention condition (Group A) with a health
      promotion and wellness condition (Group B) in a sample of prostate cancer patients and their
      spouses. We will evaluate its efficacy on self-reported measures of positive and negative
      psychological responses to AS.

      PRIMARY AIM Examine longitudinal change in positive and negative psychological responses to
      AS between groups over time.

      SECONDARY AIM Observe the relation between positive and negative psychological responses to
      AS and AS adherence between groups over time.

      THIRD AIM Explore dyadic factors on positive and negative psychological responses to AS and
      AS adherence between groups over time.
