    
      Double blind, randomised, Placebo and Standard Care controlled, single centre study. Each
      subject receives a total of 6 wounds, two incisions and four punch biopsies. Each subject
      serves as their own control, i.e. Arm 1 incisions/biopsies randomly received one of two
      treatments and Arm 2 incisions/biopsies received the same treatments as for Arm 1 but in
      reverse. The randomisation of the treatment allowed for control of possible positional
      effects on healing/scarring. Healed scars from incisional wounds excised from Arm 1 and Arm 2
      after 6 months for histological analysis.
