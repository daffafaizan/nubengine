      three groups. The first group was ultrasound group, the second group was PH group and the
      third group was placebo US group. Continuous ultrasound with a frequency of 1 MHz, an
      intensity of 1.0 W/cm2 was used in the US and the PH groups. PH group received 0,1%
      dexamethasone. Placebo group received a frequency of 0 MHz, an intensity of 0 W/cmÂ²
      ultrasound. Treatments were administered for 5 days a week, a total of 10 sessions. All
      patients also wore night splints during treatment. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Boston
      Symptom Severity Scale, Functional Capacity Scale, grip strength and
      electroneurophysiological evaluations were compared before the treatment, after the treatment
      and three months later.
