      subcutaneous space resulting in potential tissue injury. This prospective controlled study,
      will assesse the diagnostic utility of using intravenous diluted sodium bicarbonate to
      confirm placement of intravenous (IV) catheters in ventilated children. Diluted sodium
      bicarbonate will be created using undiluted standard 8.4% (1 meq/mL) sodium bicarbonate mixed
      in a 1:3 ratio with sterile water to achieve a final diluted concentration of 2.1% (0.25
      mEq/mL). In 20 ASA I-II mechanically ventilated children age 2-8 years, the effects of 1
      ml/kg of diluted 2.1% sodium bicarbonate or 0.9% normal saline,injected in a randomized
      order, will be analyzed. All children will have venous blood samples taken prior to injection
      and 10 minutes after injection for analysis of venous blood pH and electrolytes.
