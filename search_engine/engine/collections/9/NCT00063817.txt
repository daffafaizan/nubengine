      transplantation, only kidney transplantation provides a potential cure. After a kidney
      transplant, the body's immune system recognizes the kidney as foreign and tries to attack and
      destroy it in a process called rejection. To avoid rejection, participants must take
      medications called immunosuppressants or anti-rejection drugs. It is believed that by
      transplanting bone marrow at the same time as a solid organ such as a kidney, a state of
      "mixed chimerism" (a mixing of the donor and recipient's immune system) can be achieved.
      Mixed chimerism may prevent rejection without the need for anti-rejection drugs.

      Participants in this study will receive a simultaneous bone marrow and kidney transplant from
      the same living related donor in an attempt to establish mixed chimerism. Prior to
      transplantation, participants will undergo a "conditioning regimen" involving
      cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, radiation to the thymus gland, and four immunosuppressive
      medications: cyclosporine A, a man-made antibody known as rituximab to suppress B cells, a
      short course of steroids, and a T-cell depleting antibody known as MEDI-507. MEDI-507 is an
      investigational medication that has not been approved by the FDA. The primary goal of the
      study is to investigate the safety of the conditioning regimen and its ability to promote
      mixed chimerism so that the transplanted kidney is not destroyed. The study will also
      determine whether participants with mixed chimerism can eventually be safely removed from
      long-term immunosuppressive therapy following transplantation.

      Participants will be assessed before and after transplantation and will be followed â‰¤36
      months.
