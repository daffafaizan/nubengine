      after hip or knee replacement surgery treated with Rivaroxaban 10 mg/d are investigated.

      Plasma samples are obtained by blood collection before, after 2 hours and after 12 hours
      after Rivaroxaban dosing in steady state (on 3rd - 5th day).

      Several techniques, including clot-based tests, chromogenic assays and ELISAÂ´s are used for
      coagulation assays in our coagulation laboratory Frankfurt/Main. The influence of Rivaroxaban
      on different coagulation assays should be investigated in our coagulation laboratory.
