      and in the China. The management of HCC calls for a multidisciplinary approach and the
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm is the staging system most widely applied and
      is endorsed in clinical practice guidelines.

      For BCLC stage A/B HCC beyond Milan criteria, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is
      commonly used to the standard treatment. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect
      and high relapse rate of resection for these patients treated with TACE.

      The clinical benefits of immune-based therapies for HCC are emerging. Early clinical data
      already support a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with TACE. Moreover, data
      from the CheckMate-040 trial strongly demonstrated that anti-programmed-death-1 antibody
      (anti-PD-1) has clinical activity and is tolerable in patients with HCC.

      This study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy Sintilimab Injection
      combined with TACE-DEB in patients with BCLC stage A/B HCC beyond Milan criteria as
      neoadjuvant therapy.
