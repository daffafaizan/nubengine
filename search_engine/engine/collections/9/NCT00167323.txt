      serious clinical challenges and treatment difficulties and is associated with severe
      disabilities, morbidity, and heightened risk for suicide. Despite the recent increased
      attention to the problem of psychiatric comorbidity with alcoholism and other substance use
      disorders, little research has been conducted on this complex form of comorbidity, especially
      in regard to effective treatment approaches.

      Enhancing treatment engagement, adherence, and retention is perhaps the most challenging
      clinical concern faced by clinicians caring for this population. Poor adherence is a major
      clinical problem among bipolar disorder with alcoholism. Poor adherence is associated with
      substantial medical expenses and loss of productivity.

      Factors interfering with treatment adherence range from access to treatment, to health care
      providers disposition towards these patients, and to symptoms related to both bipolar
      disorder and alcoholism. Enhancing motivation for treatment and improving treatment adherence
      are essential components for an initial treatment intervention for this population. Our
      proposed treatment intervention is based on the principles of Motivational Enhancement
      Therapy and also integrates psychosocial and pharmacotherapy interventions that have been
      successfully used with alcoholism and other addictive disorders. It is practical and easy to
      learn and administer in the framework of general clinical care by health professionals with
      varied educational backgrounds.
