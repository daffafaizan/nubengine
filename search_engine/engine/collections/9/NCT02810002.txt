      boots (DEFINITE-REGULATOR) or standard issued boots (modified Belleville 390 TROP).

      Overuse injuries and foot injuries will be monitored over a period of 14 weeks. The
      intervention group will wear experimental infantry boots and the controls will wear standard
      issue boots.
