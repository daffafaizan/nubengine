      the efficacy and safety of CC-5013 plus oral pulse high-dose dexamethasone and oral pulse
      high-dose dexamethasone therapy alone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
      Subjects in the CC-5013/Dex treatment group took 25 mg of CC-5013 orally once daily on Days 1
      to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28-day cycle;
      Subjects in the Placebo/Dex treatment group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each
      28-day cycle. Subjects in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily
      on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy.
      Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on
      Days 1 to 4 for the remaining cycles.
