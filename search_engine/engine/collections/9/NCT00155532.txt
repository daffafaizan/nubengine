      lupus, we will study a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort by evaluating the extent of
      cutaneous innervation. Patients are recruited from the rheumatologic clinic, and various
      neuropsychiatric syndromes are diagnosed based on clinical judgement following detailed
      history taking and neurological examinations. Skin biopsy with PGP 9.5 immunohistochemistry
      will be performed following established procedures after informed consent is obtained, and
      punches of 3 mm in diameter will be taken from the lateral side of the distal leg, 10 cm
      above the lateral malleolus. Intraepidermal nerve fibre densities will be compared with
      results of immunological, pathological, psychophysical, and electrophysical studies to
      understand the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in SLE.
