    
      In this randomized controlled trial, 84 pregnant women aged at 18-40 years with gestational
      age of <12 weeks will be recruited and divided into 2 groups.

      Demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle data as well as blood samples and urine samples will
      be collected at baseline and in the last month of pregnancy. Moreover the cord blood will be
      collected at birth.

      Fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin, lipid profile (serum
      concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride(TG)), inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6,
      TNF-α, hs-CRP) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, TAC), calcium:creatinine ratio are going to
      be evaluated at the beginning and in the end of the interventional period in pregnant women.
      Inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), hs-CRP) and oxidative stress
      markers (MDA, TAC) will be determined in cord blood as well.
