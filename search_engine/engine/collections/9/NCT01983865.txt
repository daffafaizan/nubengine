      patients with allergic rhinitis upon exposure to birch pollen in an environmental challenge
      chamber during a 4 hour challenge period with different concentrations of birch pollen versus
      placebo.

      Subjects with allergic rhinitis to birch pollen will be recruited from the Fraunhofer ITEM
      database or the surrounding communities. After the screening evaluation eligible subjects
      will undergo six challenge sessions in the environmental challenge chamber at intervals of at
      least one week. In order to determine dose response, the concentration of birch pollen in the
      atmosphere of the challenge chamber will be varied from 1000 birch pollen/m³ in the first
      period, 2000 birch pollen/m³ in the second period, 4000 birch pollen/m³ in the third period,
      8000 birch pollen/m³in the fourth period to 0 birch pollen/m³ (only air) in the fifth period.
      In order to investigate reproducibility in addition to dose response, a challenge with one
      concentration previously used will be repeated in period six. The dose will be chosen by the
      Investigator according to the observed nasal symptoms. According to previous experience with
      grass pollen (Dactylis glomerata) the target symptom level for TNSS is around 6. Therefore,
      the dose to study reproducibility will be chosen where the average mean TNSS of the last two
      hours will be closest to six. If two doses are equally close, the higher dose will be chosen
      because this will allow to optimize the particle monitoring technique. In this regard, it is
      better to have a high particle concentration in order to separate specific particles from
      unspecific particles (originating from the subjects themselves).
