      of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (ABX/GEM) in patients with histological documentation of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are determined by central radiological review to
      have "category 2" borderline unresectable LAPC. We will investigate the feasibility of
      administering ABX/GEM in terms of safety and efficacy, and will study activity both in terms
      of radiological response and the feasibility of downstaging patients to "category 1" status,
      in order to attempt resection after up to 6 cycles of combination treatment. In addition to
      adding to data on the safety and tolerability of this combination, peri- and post-operative
      morbidity following this treatment will be evaluated. As part of the trial, detailed
      correlative studies will be undertaken to evaluate the mechanism of action of the
      combination, at a tissue level, a circulating biomarker level and a radiological level.

      We propose that the tumour shrinkage (response) seen in Stage IV pancreatic cancer patients
      as a result of ABX/GEM may translate to a realistic prospect of downstaging borderline
      unresectable LAPC tumours sufficiently to enable resection. Notionally, even in the absence
      of a classical partial response by RECIST criteria (â‰¥30% reduction in sum of longest
      diameters) a beneficial outcome may arise from any tumour shrinkage sufficient to permit the
      tumour to be separated from major vessels thus rendering it resectable. Such an outcome may
      significantly alter the poor survival outcomes in this group of patients. The PRICKLE
      clinical study paradigm is useful for evaluating novel agents and combinations that show
      impressive activity in the pre-clinical or advanced setting and offers an opportunity for
      detailed correlative translational studies to evaluate activities of therapy.
