    
      Phase 1b

        -  To determine the dose of vorinostat that can be safely combined with gemcitabine and
           docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas.

        -  To characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of vorinostat when
           combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas.

      Phase 2

        -  To determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine and docetaxel in combination with
           vorinostat in patients with advanced sarcomas. The hypothesis is that gemcitabine and
           docetaxel + vorinostat will be safe and will improve the 6-months progression-free rates
           (PFR) of the combination by 20% (from 20% to 40%).

        -  To determine the objective response rate, progression-free, and overall survival of
           patients with advanced sarcomas treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel + vorinostat;

        -  To develop a predictive molecular signature of response to treatment in advanced
           sarcomas.
