    
      A double blinded randomized study comparing 2 intrathecal mixtures for labour analgesia.

      94 multiparous parturients in active labour who have given informed consent would be
      recruited into the study. They would be randomly allocated into 2 groups using simple random
      sampling. An Assistant would know the code and prepare the intrathecal solutions.

      Baseline vitals would be taken and patient's pain score noted. Due protocol would be followed
      and a combined spinal epidural sited but with the epidural not activated until the effect of
      the spinal wears off.

      Routine monitoring would be done and various parameters and indices noted. Where the effect
      of the spinal lasts the duration of labour thus no need to activate the epidural, this would
      also be noted.

      Data would be analysed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.
