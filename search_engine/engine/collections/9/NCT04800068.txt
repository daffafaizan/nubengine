      metastatic prostate cancer at the time of initial diagnosis and staging of patients with
      high-risk prostate cancer and at the time of biochemical recurrence. In addition, available
      data show superiority of metastatic lesion detection with [Ga-68] PSMA-11 PET over
      conventional imaging. This improved lesion detection has a direct impact on selection of
      anti-cancer therapy and thus may improve patient outcomes.

      Under expanded access IND, enrolled patients will receive a clinical [68Ga] PSMA-11 PET/CT or
      PET/MR for evaluation of their cancer. Imaging exams must be deemed clinically indicated by a
      referring provider. Patients will be responsible for the cost of the imaging exam. Access is
      limited.
