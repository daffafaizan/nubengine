      prior to emergency endoscopy to improve the quality of examination in patients with upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding.

      One hundred and twenty-two patients admitted within 12 hours after hematemesis will be
      randomly assigned to receive erythromycin infusion or gastric lavage by nasogastric tube
      prior to emergency endoscopy. The endoscopic procedures will be recorded on Digital Video
      Disc (DVD). Two endoscopists blinded to the cleansing strategy will assess the quality of
      examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract by using scales designed by Frossard and
      Avgerinos .

      Secondary endpoints will be the need for a second-look endoscopy, the mean number of blood
      units transfused, the need of surgery or arteriography, and the mean duration of
      hospitalization
