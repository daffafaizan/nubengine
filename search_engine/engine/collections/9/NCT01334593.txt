    
      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of chemoradiotherapy on pre-operative fitness of patients
      prior to major colorectal cancer surgery.

      Design: Patients will act as their own case-control.

      Patients will be consented at the earliest available opportunity following the decision that
      they have surgically treatable disease and they consent to pre-operative NACRT. Consent for
      the study will be gained as an outpatient. At "visit 1" patients will undergo CPET, as is our
      current standard practice, prior to commencing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. As part of the
      assessment, they will have pulmonary function testing (static lung volumes, lung diffusing
      capacity). They will then undergo 6 weeks of long course NACRT, as is standard current
      practice at our institution. At "visit 2", approximately four to six weeks following
      chemoradiotherapy another CPET test will be repeated. This is also current standard practice
      at our institution. Data from visit 1 and visit 2 will be compared in a paired manner. A
      statistician will be consulted to assess the degree of normality of the data, the statistical
      tests to use, and for power calculations. At no point will any treatments be postponed or
      changed solely for the purposes of collecting data for the research.
