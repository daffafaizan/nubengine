    
      To evaluate the effect of Arabic gum (Acacia gum) and Licorice (Glycyrrhiza Glabra)
      mouthwashes in comparison to Chlorhexidine mouthwash on reducing caries incidence
      (development of new caries lesions), antimicrobial efficacy and the prevalence of oral side
      effects (adverse events) in high caries risk patients.

      P: Population with high caries risk patients I1: Arabic Gum mouthwash I2: Licorice mouthwash
      C: Chlorhexidine mouthwash O1: (Primary outcome) incidence of new caries lesions O2:
      (secondary outcome) antimicrobial efficacy O3: oral side effects (adverse events) from
      mouthwash use
