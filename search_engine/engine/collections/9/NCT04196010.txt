    
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive CI-CLAM consisting of cladribine and cytarabine via continuous intravenous
      infusion (CIV) on days 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, or 1-6 depending on dose level assignment, and
      mitoxantrone via CIV on days 1-2 or 1-3 depending on dose level assignment. G-CSF may be
      added at the discretion of the treating physician, as per standard of care. Patients that do
      not achieve a response of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission (CR)
      after the first cycle are eligible to receive a second cycle of CI-CLAM. Treatment continues
      for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
