    
      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) can occur before, during and after anti-cancer treatment. In
      fact, up to 40% of patients report fatigue at diagnosis, 80%-90% during chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy, respectively and 20%-50% in the post-treatment phase.

      All cancer patients should be screened for the presence of CRF at the first oncological visit
      and subsequently during and after the anticancer therapies.

      If the patient refers CRF, it could be quantified with one of the validate instruments
      available; the possible determinants could be identified and corrected if possible, to reduce
      their impact on patients CR.

      The most evaluated pharmacological treatments of CRF include psychostimulants
      (methylphenidate, modafinil, armodafinil) and dexamethasone. Non-pharmacological treatments
      include physical exercise, psychological therapies and complementary therapies such as
      agopuncture, yoga, ginseng.

      The aim of the present study is to verify the efficacy of American Ginseng in preventing or
      reducing the intensity of moderate-severe CRF in a homogeneous population of breast cancer
      women submitted to adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide after
      surgery.
