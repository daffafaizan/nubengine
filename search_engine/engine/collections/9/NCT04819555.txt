      will be taken during hospitalisation for diagnostic confirmation or during the quarterly
      multidisciplinary consultations planned for these patients in the classic follow-up set up
      within the ALS centres of the FILSLAN network. This sample will be integrated into the
      standard management of ALS patients, which includes a neurological examination and
      paraclinical explorations, including a biological assessment.

      The patient will then be reviewed during the standard multidisciplinary follow-up
      consultations. Information to the patient on his or her C9orf72 or SOD1 genetic status will
      be included in the quarterly multidisciplinary consultations for the classic follow-up of ALS
      patients.

      It should also be noted that the data (ALSFRS-r score, weight, FEV) collected during the 6
      and 12 month consultations will be processed for the purposes of this research.
