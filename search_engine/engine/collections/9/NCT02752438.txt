    
      Although High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) has been used in case of unresponsive
      to conventional mechanical ventilation both in children and newborns, there is no data on its
      success and the factors that affect its success in the literature.

      The aim of the study is to define the factors that affect the success of HFOV in newborns who
      do not respond to conventional mechanical ventilation through an online registry among
      neonatal intensive care units in Turkey.
