      disabling symptoms. Aerobic, balance and strength training have already been proved effective
      in rehabilitation, especially for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis. Fifty-two Persons with
      Multiple Sclerosis will be randomly allocated to an experimental group or to a control group
      following usual care rehabilitation programs. Experimental group will follow a circuit
      training rehabilitation program which combines high intensity aerobic training with balance
      and strength training. The study aims to verify the effects of the circuit training program
      on fatigue and on balance in different contexts with respect to usual care rehabilitation
      programs and to investigate effects of rehabilitation on immunological markers.
