      regulates lipid transport and metabolism. Only one common non-synonymous polymorphism (A227G)
      leading to an amino-acid exchange in the exonic region of the L-FABP gene has been previously
      identified. Experimental elevations of free fatty acids (FFAs) have been shown to impair
      insulin mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP). Deletion of the L-FABP
      gene shows no obvious phenotype in mice receiving a low fat chow diet, but leads to decreased
      hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the prolonged fasted state, which exposes mice to an
      increased fatty acid flux to the liver. The function of the L-FABP gene may be altered by
      polymorphisms in coding regions of the gene, probably leading to modifications in hepatic
      triglyceride accumulation and hepatic insulin resistance.We hypothesize that carriers of the
      A277G SNP, when compared to matched wild-type subjects, may show altered responses of hepatic
      glucose production upon exposure to increased peripheral fatty acid concentrations, as
      achieved by lipid / heparin infusions. Because it is known that free fatty acids potently
      increase insulin secretion, we use somatostatin clamps in our experiments, followed by
      replacement of postabsorptive insulin and glucagon concentrations.
