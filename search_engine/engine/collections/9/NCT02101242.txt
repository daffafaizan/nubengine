      cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing surgery in general anaesthesia. These
      fluctuations will be monitored using the a non-invasive monitoring system based on the method
      of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

      Regional cerebral hypoxia is considered one of the possible precipitating factors of
      postsurgical cognitive impairment (as seen in patients with postoperative cognitive deficit
      or postoperative delirium), but without monitoring it may easily remain undetected. A
      differentiated analysis of fluctuations is gained by calculation of the area under curve
      (AUC) of a defined deviation from individual baseline regional cerebral oxygen saturation
      (rSO2) over time.

      When deviations are detected, they will be treated in this study according to their
      clinically apparent cause (e.g. hypotension/hypovolaemia, anaemia, low cardiac output) in
      accordance with current standard operating procedures (SOPs) to re-elevate regional cerebral
      oxygen saturation (rSO2) to within 20% of baseline.

      Among these procedures are

        1. Elevation of systemic arterial pressure by application of vasopressors

        2. Consideration of systemic (pulse oxymetric) oxygen saturation

        3. Adjustment of artificial ventilation subject to endexpiratory concentration of carbon
           dioxide (CO2)

        4. Transfusion of concentrated red cells in case of Hemoglobin (Hb) <7-9 g/dl

        5. Transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE/TEE) and assessment of
           centralvenous oxygen saturation in case of suspected myocardial insufficiency

      which should be applied to patients of the 3 defined groups as needed.

      This explorative project is a pilot study.
