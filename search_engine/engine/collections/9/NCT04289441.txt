      particularly in developed countries, and primary prevention of allergic disease has proved an
      elusive goal. There is increasing evidence that the airway microbiome influences the
      development of wheezing and childhood asthma. Probiotics are increasingly considered as a
      promising treatment for the correction of dysbiosis, reduction of systemic inflammation, and
      modulation of allergic diseases. The aim of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the
      efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve B632 (DSM 24706) and Lactobacillus salivarius LS01 (DSM
      22775) in the prevention of asthmatic allergies in human subjects.
