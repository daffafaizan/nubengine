      (4FPCCs) result in more rapid correction of coagulopathy and greater likelihood of achieving
      hemostasis in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists who require emergent operations or who
      are bleeding. 4FPCCs have not been studied in the pre-hospital setting as a primary
      resuscitative adjunct. The investigators believe the effects of Kcentra to prevent or treat
      coagulopathy early after injury combined with its ability to treat the endotheliopathy of
      trauma and prevent organ failure will results in improved outcomes in severely injured trauma
      patients with hemorrhagic shock. The investigators have chosen to study a population of
      trauma patients in severe hemorrhagic shock (SBP < 70mmHg) because this population is at
      greatest risk for developing acute coagulopathy of trauma and has the greatest potential to
      benefit from the proposed therapy.
