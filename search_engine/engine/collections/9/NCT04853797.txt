      neuropathic and inflammatory pain processes through their hyperfunction and/or
      overexpression, and HCN channels may play a significant role in migraine pathophysiology, as
      both an inflammatory and a neuropathic component has been hypothesized to contribute to
      migraine, and HCN channel activity is facilitated by cyclic nucleotides, e.g. cAMP and cGMP
      (molecules thought to be central in migraine pathophysiology) and increases in extracellular
      K+ concentration causing Ih current amplification. Indeed, increases in cAMP or directly
      opening adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channel) by levcromakalim leads
      to migraine attacks in a high proportion of patients, suggesting a crucial role for these
      channels in migraine pathophysiology. KATP channel activation leads to hyperpolarization,
      which in turn could increase the open probability of HCN channels. To uncover the role of HCN
      channels in migraine, the researchers will investigate the anti-migraine effect of
      ivabradine, the only HCN channel blocker available for clinical use, on levcromakalim-induced
      migraine.

      The investigators anticipate that this project will contribute greatly to the current
      understanding of migraine pathophysiology and the hypothesized role of HCN channels in
      migraine pain mechanisms. This is of great interest in future research, as such knowledge is
      an important prerequisite for further investigation and understanding of intracellular
      signalling mechanisms in migraine, which in turn will lead to the development of more
      effective and mechanism-based drugs.
