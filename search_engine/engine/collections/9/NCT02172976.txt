    
      This is a phase II/III randomized multicenter study. Patients with resectable pancreatic
      carcinoma will be randomized in Arm A (surgery plus adjuvant gemcitabine, 6 cycles) or Arm B
      (4-6 cycles FOLFIRINOX neoadjuvant, 4-6 cycles FOLFIRINOX adjuvant).

      Primary endpoint is the overall survival, secondary endpoints are progression-free survival,
      perioperative morbidity and mortality, rate of R0 resections, tolerability and feasibility of
      neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and others.
