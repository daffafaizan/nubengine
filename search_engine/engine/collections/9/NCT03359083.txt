      the task of stabilization and mobilization. Studies related foot movement disorders usually
      focus on subtalar joint. The reason for this is that subtalar joint transmits the rotations
      which in leg to the foot. One of the deformities affecting the foot and subtalar joint is pes
      planus. Kosashvili et al. have shown that grade 2 and 3 pes planus can affect the lower limb
      biomechanical alignment, resulting in an increase in perceived pain associated with the knee,
      hip and pelvic region. Problems related to foot and ankle can affect the balance of
      individuals as well as affect the pelvic region. Sung et al. have shown that the postural
      stability and balance of individuals with pes planus are worse than those without pes planus.
      Studies showing that foot-ankle postural disorders negatively affect physical fitness and
      motor performance of individuals are also present. Akaras et al. have stated that the
      increase in pronation in the hindfoot affects individuals' leap and agility performance
      negatively. It has shown that leg-related problems can affect upper. However, there is no
      objective study of ultrasonographic imaging of core muscles in foot-ankle problems. The aim
      of this study is to investigate the relationship between foot-ankle characteristics and
      lumbopelvic control, balance and physical performance in healthy young adults.
