      population. In many developing countries, this condition is regarded as major public health
      problem. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose related
      with a condition of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. As Diabetes
      progresses, medications are necessary to control glucose levels.

      The aim of this study was to investigate whether the infusion of a medicinal plant (Cissus
      verticillata L.) would be as effective as a regular drug (glibenclamide) in reducing glucose
      levels in blood and saliva of type 2 Diabetes patients. Several medicinal plants have been
      used as potential medication for controlling glucose levels in Diabetes patients. Few studies
      have explored this effect related to Cissus verticillata L.infusion, though it has been
      indicated by folk medicine of some Latin American countries.
