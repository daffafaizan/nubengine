    
      This Registry was designed to assure that the benefits and knowledge gained by studying
      clinical outcomes associated with the use of percutaneous orthopedic procedures outweigh the
      potential risks to the patients. The primary objective of this Registry is to observe the
      improvements in subject-reported clinical outcomes for these procedures used to treat
      musculoskeletal disorders. Secondary objectives include evaluating post-treatment
      complication, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention. Patients receiving
      percutaneous orthopedic treatments are asked to enroll before receiving treatment and
      complete a set of baseline questionnaires regarding pain and functionality of the area of the
      body being treated (i.e. knee, shoulder, spine, etc). Follow-up outcomes are collected at 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and annually 2-20 years post-injection.
      Subjects are withdrawn from the Registry prematurely if a surgical operation occurs.
