      are alternated at each site and the sequence of groups at each site is randomly assigned.

      The first group receives a 90-minute, 1-person cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and
      obstructed airways management instruction.

      The second group receives the same instruction plus a 1-hour social support discussion.
      Ongoing support is provided with weekly phone calls to assess caretaker status and answer
      questions regarding the infant's health.

      The third group learns CPR using a self-paced multimedia learning module. The control group
      receives the standard CPR instruction at hospital discharge. Participants are followed at 2
      weeks, then at 3 and 6 months.
