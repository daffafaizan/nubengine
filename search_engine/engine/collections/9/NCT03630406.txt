      SUI or vaginal wall weakness and prolapse. Each participant undergoes 3 laser treatments 4
      weeks apart.

      Assessment of vaginal elasticity via vaginal tactile imaging will be performed at 3 different
      points:

        -  Before the first treatment session (baseline).

        -  Before and after each treatment session.

        -  3 months post final treatment. Every patient will serve as her own control. Demographic,
           gynecologic and obstetric history will be obtained from patients' electronic files.
