      60% or higher were randomly allocated and divided into 2 groups. The experimental group was
      treated with MSAT and the control group was treated with intramuscular injections of
      diclofenac(NSAID). All administrations were limited to 1 session, and comparisons were made
      of measurements before and after treatment. Primary outcomes were measured by the
      NRS(numerical rating scale) of back pain in active movement. Secondary outcomes were measured
      by the NRS of radiating pain, ODI scores, and the patient's global impression of change(PGIC)
      etc. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to measure primary and secondary outcomes
      with the exception of ROM and SLR at 2, 4, and 24 weeks after treatment.
