      clinical response to amphotericin B treatment in the AIDS patients is generally good,
      administration difficulties and toxicity detract from its usefulness. Oral treatment with
      ketoconazole overcomes these limitations of amphotericin B, but does not appear to be
      effective for primary treatment in patients with AIDS. Itraconazole is a triazole compound in
      which preclinical studies have demonstrated activity against Histoplasmosis capsulatum.
      Preclinical studies have also shown that itraconazole appears effective in the treatment of
      histoplasmosis. The frequency of adverse reactions to itraconazole has been low in several
      studies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in up to 20 percent of patients with
      histoplasmosis, and appears to have a poor response to amphotericin B treatment. Itraconazole
      has been used successfully in a small number of patients with cryptococcal meningitis,
      supporting a study of its use in CNS histoplasmosis.

      At least 30 patients with AIDS and an initial episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are
      selected for this study. Up to 5 patients will have a diagnosis of CNS histoplasmosis.
      Therapy with all other systemic antifungal agents must be halted before study entry. Patients
      receive itraconazole for 3 days followed by daily oral doses for a total of 12 weeks.
      Patients who are doing well clinically, without evidence of clinical failure or dose-limiting
      toxicity, are permitted to continue maintenance therapy to prevent relapse at a reduced dose
      for an additional 12 months. Patients who are being treated for CNS histoplasmosis will
      continue to receive itraconazole.
