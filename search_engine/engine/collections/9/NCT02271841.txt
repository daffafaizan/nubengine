      Variability Index (PVI) into their practice. It also seeks to establish whether the
      introduction of the PVI in the clinical practice is associated with a modification of the
      practice. In this scope, the intent is to see the impact of introduction of PVI monitoring on
      anesthesiologist practices, and to do this by comparing their survey response both before and
      after use of PVI in their surgeries, and to see how clinical practices for GDT and outcomes
      may have changed. To that end, the intent is to conduct this at sites with no current
      experience in use of PVI parameter, so that one can closely follow the change in clinician
      practice as PVI is adopted.
