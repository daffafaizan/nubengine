      and is associated with the premature development of atherosclerosis, and increased risk of
      stroke. A classical perspective of cardiovascular risk does not adequately explain all of the
      cardiovascular events associated with obesity. Elevated plasma levels of plasminogen
      activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) are one of the biochemical hallmarks for obesity and
      likely contribute the increased risk of atherothrombotic events in patients with obesity. The
      central hypothesis of this proposal is that the increased risk of atherothrombotic events in
      patients with obesity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that vascular PAI-1 excess
      promotes the development of intravascular thrombosis. We will test the hypothesis that
      secreted factors from adipocytes have autocrine, paracrine and endocrine effects that have a
      deleterious effect on the fibrinolytic system, either by enhancing PAI-1 production or
      impairing endothelial t-PA release. From a public health perspective, there is no greater
      threat to America's cardiovascular health than the epidemic of obesity. It is anticipated
      that this study will provide new insights nto the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the
      development of fibrinolytic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in obesity.
