      feedback report for family physicians, and determine whether in-person detailing sessions
      offer additional benefit in changing ordering practices. Group practices (i.e. all physicians
      practicing at the same address) of family physicians and general practitioners will be
      stratified by community of practice within Eastern Health, then randomized into one of four
      groups: 1. A usual QCNL feedback report alone, 2. A usual QCNL feedback report plus in-person
      detailing, 3. A new feedback report alone, 4. A new feedback report plus in-person detailing.
      Communities with fewer than five physicians will be grouped with similar communities for
      stratified randomization purposes.

      Physicians will be provided a semi-annual (every 6 months) report card outlining the number
      of CT scans, ultrasounds and plain x-rays they ordered per 100 patients for whom they were
      the primary provider. We will assume that the primary provider is the most frequent biller of
      primary care services. Participants will receive a link to the report card via email from the
      Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (NLMA) by a two-step process: The initial email
      gives a brief description of the report and contains a link which then redirects the
      clinician to a secure web page that displays the individual clinician diagnostic imaging
      utilization in a prior one year period compared to the aggregate of their peers in the same
      region. Physicians in the detailing groups will be contacted to arrange a single in-person
      session with one of their colleagues to discuss the detailing reports.
