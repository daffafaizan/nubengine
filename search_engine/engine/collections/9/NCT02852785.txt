      groups of subjects with specific characteristics. To load the upper extremity during PNF D2
      for flexion and extension directions, elastic tubing (Thera-Band) will be used as resistance.
      Selection of the two resistances will be according to a self-perceived ability of the
      subjects to consistently move a maximal amount of resistance (color) during PNF D2 flexion
      and extension tests for 15s and 30s, respectively. Each subject will be permitted to sample
      various resistances in order to assist in selecting the most appropriate load, with no more
      than three practice repetitions permitted per each resistance sampled.

      To perform the tests, subjects will be sited in a standard chair without armrests, with their
      feet and lower legs placed on another standard chair, positioned just in front of their chair
      and the non-testing arm placed across the thoracic wall, to minimize the participation of the
      legs and trunk to upper extremity performance during testing. Elastic tubing will be anchored
      to a stable base to perform the diagonals (Thera-Band door anchor accessory or the opposite
      foot). Five repetitions of each test on both sides will be performed, in two different
      moments (5-10 minutes apart). A rate of 2 seconds per repetition will be employed during
      recordings using a metronome. A rest period will be given between trials to avoid fatigue. To
      perform the tests, subjects will begin/end with their hand on the contralateral hip and
      end/begin at head height and shoulder width. A marker will be placed in the latter position
      to standardize the start and end of hand position. The order of the tests (PNF D2 flexion and
      extension) and side (symptomatic/dominant and asymptomatic/non-dominant) will be randomized.
