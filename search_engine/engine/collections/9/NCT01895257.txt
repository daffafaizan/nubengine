      simplified maintenance chemotherapy has a benefit in terms of time to progression (TTP)
      compared to simplified chemotherapy maintenance alone, in patients with stable disease after
      3-6 months induction therapy. We would like to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this
      approach and to investigate if this strategy has the potential to increase the outcome of the
      patient.

      Primary end-point:

      - Time to first progression (TTP1 overall)

      Secondary end-points:

        -  Time to global progression (TTP1 + TTP2), Time to second progression (TTP2), TTP1 liver
           only

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)

        -  Overall Survival (OS)

        -  Safety

        -  Ro resection rate

        -  Quality of Life

      Exploratory analysis:

      - Prediction and evaluation of SIR-spheres treatment response (only for Belgian centres)
