      by 8% sevoflurane with 6 L flow of 100% oxygen. IV cannulation was attempted at 2 min in the
      first child in each group. The time for cannulation in the next child was stepped up or down
      by 15 s depending on positive or negative response, respectively, in the previous child.
      Children were recruited till a minimum of six pairs of failure-success sequence which was
      obtained in the group. The mean of midpoints of the failure-success sequence was calculated
      to obtain the time for cannulation in 50% of the group.
