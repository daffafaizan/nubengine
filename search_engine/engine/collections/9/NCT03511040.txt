      approach to the target segment for mechanical assistance and the treatment of vasospasm.

      The LOVIT study is a European prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm feasibility
      trial designed to determine the safety and angiographic effectiveness through 30 days post
      treatment with Lumenate Intraluminal Device in the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm. The
      primary objective of the study is to support the CE-mark vasospasm label claim for the
      Lumenate Device. The study will be enrolled at up to 8 European sites with study subjects
      being followed for 90 days post-treatment.
