      very important role in cancer immunotherapy. A desirable property for a dendritic cell
      vaccine directed against cancer is the ability to efficiently prime na√Øve, tumor associated
      antigen specific T cells into potent CTLs. Results of studies in healthy volunteers have
      shown that IL15 DCs are particularly efficient at priming functional melanoma specific CD8+ T
      cells. The use of IL15 in the manufacture of the DC vaccine could result in an improved
      immunotherapy product.
