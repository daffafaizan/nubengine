      early AD dementia defined as MCI and mild Alzheimer's dementia. The study is 40 weeks in
      duration, including a safety and efficacy evaluation 4 weeks after the last dose of study
      drug. Subjects with resolved adverse events at Week 36 will have a safety telephone call at
      Week 40. Subjects with unresolved adverse events at Week 36 will have a safety in-office
      visit at Week 40.

      The study protocol will include two sentinel subjects in each of the three blinded dose arms.
      Sentinel dosing will be implemented by randomly assigning one study subject to each of the
      three dose arms in a blinded manner, treating those subjects with study drug, and observing
      them for at least 48 hours after treatment. If no unexpected serious adverse events are
      observed within 48 hours after the third subject receives treatment, three additional
      subjects will be enrolled, with one subject each assigned randomly to each of the three dose
      arms. Again a 48-hour observation period will be observed following treatment to document any
      unexpected safety events that may occur. Should no unexpected serious adverse events occur
      within 48 hours after the sixth subject receives treatment, the remaining subjects will be
      assigned to the study dose cohorts according to the blinded randomization scheme and the
      1:1:1 randomization ratio.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment arms and will receive one dose of study
      drug every 4 weeks during the 32-week dosing period for a total of 9 doses of study drug. The
      primary objective is the safety and tolerability of study drug. A key secondary objective is
      the change in brain metabolism as assessed by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in the
      resting state.
