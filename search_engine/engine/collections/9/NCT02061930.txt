      vital determinants which may affect the short- and long-term aesthetic outcomes.

      For this reason, the pink aesthetic score (PES) was introduced for the evaluation of
      peri-implant soft tissues by FÃ¼rhauser in 2005 and modified by Belser as PES/WES in 2009.

      So far, a series of clinical studies have confirmed the suitability of PES/WES and PES index
      for the objective outcome assessment of the aesthetic dimension of anterior single-tooth
      implants.

      However, to our knowledge, studies with long term data of the aesthetic outcome evaluation in
      non-augmented healed sites of the anterior maxilla are still rare, for most of the papers
      published recently mainly focused on immediate implant placement after tooth extraction with
      only 1-5 years following up.

      In our previous study, we have evaluated the alterations of soft tissue around
      implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla with original standard PES at the
      time of crown placement and 6 months post-loading .We have found that the aesthetic outcome
      of soft tissue around the single-tooth implant had improved significantly at follow-up
      compared with baseline according to PES assessment. However, the follow up time of the
      previous study was short (6-8 months), long time follow up is necessary to confirm the
      previous hypothesis and observations.
