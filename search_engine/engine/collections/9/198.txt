the carrier state of bacillus subtilis infected with the transducingbacteriophage sp10 .bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis to form a carriersystem . the infected bacteria give rise to infected organisms after sixor more successive single-colony isolations . about 60 of the sporesderived from such an infected culture yield clones that produce phage,and such spores retain their ability to produce phage even aftertreatment with antiserum and heating at 80 . four hours' incubation ofcarrier spores in nutrient broth yields cultures having more than 10infective centers per bacterium . cultivation of infected organisms inmedium containing sp10 antiserum leads to loss of phage and loss ofimmunity to phage infection . dna with a density characteristic of viraldna can be detected in infected bacteria . extracts of infected bacteriacontain a phage-induced deoxyribonuclease activity which attacks bothphage and bacterial dna in vitro . the phage-bacterial complex istherefore best described as a carrier state .the dna of the phage and of b. subtilis are chemically different .enzymatically prepared complementary virus rna has no homology withbacterial dna . the lack of homology of this transducing phage dna withthe dna of its host and the failure to form a truly lysogenicrelationship reinforce previous conclusions that transducing bacterialdna is incorporated into the sp10 virus particle without anyrecombination between viral and bacterial dna .
