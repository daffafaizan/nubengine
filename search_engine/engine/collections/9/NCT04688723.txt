      controlled trial (RBRCT) within the ZON-HR collaboration in 4 of the 6 centers in the
      Netherlands: Maastricht Universitair Medisch Centrum (Maastricht), Zuyderland (Heerlen and
      Sittard), Vie Curi (Venlo) and Radboud Medisch Centrum (Nijmegen). Isala (Zwolle) and
      Canisius Wilhelmina ziekenhuis (Nijmegen) will not be part of this study. This study is
      Investigator initiated with an unrestricted grant from Boehringer Ingelheim (subsidising
      party). This study is also to be noted as a Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS). Patients
      1000 patients with an indication for NOAC, who underwent successful PCI with Drug Eluting
      Stent (DES) in the setting of ACS will be included and randomised at each of the 4 centers of
      the ZON-HR. After randomisation, patients will be treated with Dual therapy with
      Dabigatran/Clopidogrel or with Dabigatran/ Ticagrelor. A total of 1000 patients in 4 centers
      will be included: 250 patients in each center. In each center inclusion and randomisation
      will be executed within 48 hours after PCI. Inclusions are expected to be done within 1 year.
      After inclusion of the interventional (Dual therapy with Dabigatran/Ticagrelor) and control
      group (Dual therapy with Dabigatran/Clopidogrel), follow-up of 1 year is planned.
