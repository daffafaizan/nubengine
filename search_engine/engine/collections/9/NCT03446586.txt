    
      The purpose of this study is to create an electronic registry of phenotypic, laboratory
      information, treatment and outcomes options for tyrosinemia type I. The registry is
      longitudinal in nature including retrospective clinical data from birth to the most recent
      encounter with all data entered in chronological fashion. The goals of this registry are the
      better understanding of the natural history and treatment outcomes of these patients and to
      determine/evaluate biochemical and clinical parameters for monitoring and prognosis of
      tyrosinemia type I.
