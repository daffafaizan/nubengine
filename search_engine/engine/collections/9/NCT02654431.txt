      progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) expressions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human
      breast cancer tissue specimens. Results from the ER/PR test is indicated as an aid in the
      assessment of the hormones status of breast cancer patients. While the ER/PR kit provides the
      antibodies that offer direct visualization and semi-quantification of the protein expression
      through a brightfield microscope, the GenASIs GoPath system is designed to complement the
      routine workflow of the pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic
      slides.
