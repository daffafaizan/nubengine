      associated with changes in the secretory patterns of several hormones including ghrelin,
      growth hormone (GH), and insulin, which have not been examined in the adolescent age group.
      Ghrelin, a primarily gastric hormone, increases appetite and is a GH secretagogue. This study
      will compare the alteration in secretion of ghrelin and GH in overweight and normal weight
      adolescent girls through frequent blood sampling and GH stimulation testing with growth
      hormone releasing hormone and arginine. The relationship between these hormones and insulin
      resistance, measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and body composition,
      measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, will be
      investigated. This study will also determine the postprandial ghrelin response to test meals
      that vary by the type of predominant macronutrient, which may predict the degree of hunger
      and amount of intake at a subsequent meal. Understanding obesity-related changes in ghrelin
      and GH and their relationship to body composition, insulin resistance, and appetite will help
      in the development of strategies to reduce complications of obesity.
