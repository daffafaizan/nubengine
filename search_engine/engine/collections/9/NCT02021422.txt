      recombinant, nonglycosylated form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).
      Anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL -1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to
      the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues
      and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates
      various physiologic effects including inflammatory and immunological responses.

      This is a pilot, prospective, non-randomized, consecutive enrollment study that will enroll
      up to 12 subjects who meet the study defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will undergo standard of care chemotherapy treatment/regimens (i.e., modified
      FOLFIRINOX). Subjects will be dispensed a 2 weeks supply of anakinra the day they begin
      chemotherapy. They will be instructed to begin self-administering the anakinra (study drug)
      injections the day after their first dose of chemotherapy.

      They will have a blood sample collected at baseline and 6 months follow up. If they have
      surgery for their disease, they may have a tissue sample collected for later analysis.
