      (mg/m^2) to 250 mg/m^2 divided into 5 cohorts. Each participant was assigned to a single
      cohort with no intra-participant dose escalation. Phase 1 also included an expansion cohort
      where participants received a flat dose of 200 or 230 mg LY2603618. Participants received
      gemcitabine on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by LY2603618 on Days 2, 9, and 16 of each 28-day
      cycle. The purpose of the Phase 1 portion was to determine the maximum tolerated LY2603618
      dose to be carried into the Phase 2 portion of the study.
