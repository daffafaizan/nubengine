      relatively androgen deficient women with HIV, to determine the effects of testosterone
      administration on lean body mass. The administered dose will be 300 micrograms twice a week
      vs. identical placebo in the form of a transdermal preparation. Secondary endpoints include
      effects on bone density, quality of life, neurocognitive function and menstrual function.
      Open label administration at 300 micrograms twice a week will be initiated for 12 months in
      all subjects following the randomized portion of the study. Assuming a 15% dropout rate and
      25 randomized patients, the probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment
      difference at a two sided 5.000 percent significance level, if the true difference between
      the treatments is 2.7 kg. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the
      response variable, lean body mass by DEXA, is 2.3 kg, as was shown by Choi et al1 over 12
      weeks in HIV-infected women at the same dose of 300 ug 2x/week.
