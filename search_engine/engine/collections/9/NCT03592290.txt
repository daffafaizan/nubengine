      hypovolemia as well as assess changes in peripheral waveforms monitored by the pulse oximeter
      collected from different sites (finger, ear, forehead, and nose), blood pressure, cerebral
      oximetry and peripheral venous pressure during gradual hypovolemia induced by lower body
      negative pressure (LBNP) in healthy volunteers.
