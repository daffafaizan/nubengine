      I. To tailor the Being Present intervention to BCR-ABL-negative MPN and CP-CML patients.

      II. To determine the feasibility of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program with
      live webinars among BCR-ABL-negative MPN patients and their caregivers, and CP-CML patients
      on TKIs.

      III. To determine the acceptability of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program
      with live webinars among BCR-ABL-negative MPN patients and their caregivers, and CP-CML
      patients on TKIs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for differences in the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week web-based
      mindfulness meditation program with live webinars:

      Ia. Based on demographic or clinicopathologic factors. Ib. In patients versus caregivers.

      II. To evaluate for differences in the preliminary efficacy an 8-week web-based mindfulness
      meditation program with live webinars:

      IIa. Based on demographic or clinicopathologic factors. IIb. In BCR-ABL-negative patients
      versus caregivers. IIc. In BCR-ABL-negative patient-caregiver pairs versus unpaired patients.
      IId. Based on level of adherence to the practice instructions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and caregivers receive Being Present intervention consisting of online audio-based
      mindfulness meditation exercise over 15 minutes at least 5 times per week, daily meditation
      reminders, and online webinars over 30-60 minutes every week.

      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up at 8 weeks.
