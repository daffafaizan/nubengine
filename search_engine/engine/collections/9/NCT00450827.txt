    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 (^131I-3F8) and
           bevacizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery after autologous stem cell rescue in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess whole body dosimetry for ^131I-3F8.

        -  Assess tumor targeting of ^131I-3F8 before and after bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 (^131I-3F8).

      Patients receive ^131I-3F8 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses. Patients whose
      blood counts do not recover and whose human antimouse antibody (HAMA) titer < 1,000 U/mL
      after course 1 receive one dose of ^131I-3F8 alone followed by autologous stem cell rescue
      (ASCR) and filgrastim (G-CSF). Patients whose blood counts do not recover and whose HAMA
      titer â‰¥ 1,000 U/mL after course 1 undergo ASCR followed by G-CSF. Patients whose blood counts
      recover and whose HAMA titer < 1,000 U/mL after course 1 receive 3 more courses of ^131I-3F8
      and bevacizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of ^131I-3F8 and bevacizumab until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then every 3-6
      months thereafter.
