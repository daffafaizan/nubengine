      Primary

        -  To estimate the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin with objective
           tumor response (partial and complete response) in patients with advanced, persistent, or
           recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effects of this regimen on progression-free survival and overall
           survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior cisplatin
      therapy as a radiosensitizer (yes vs no).

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1-4 hours on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
