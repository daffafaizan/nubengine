      Studies have shown that drugs in combination with fludarabine have shown more effectiveness
      than fludarabine alone. The addition of ofatumumab to fludarabine-cyclophosphamide
      combination offers potentially a more effective therapy, without additional toxicity.

      The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ofatumumab added to fludarabine
      and cyclophosphamide in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia who have responded
      previously to therapy but later develop progressive disease and require additional therapy.
