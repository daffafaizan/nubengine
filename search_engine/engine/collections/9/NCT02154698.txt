      lung tissue sample: (1) standard 22-gauge, and (2) ProCore 22-gauge. Both of these needles
      are used to get biopsies (samples) of lung tissue. The standard needle has one bevel (angled
      side of the needle formed when it is sharpened to make a point), while the ProCore needle has
      2 bevels. The standard needle is more commonly used and we are doing this study to see if the
      ProCore needle would be more useful.

      The investigator in charge of this study is Dr. Nichole T. Tanner. This study is being done
      at four sites and will involve approximately 200 volunteers.
