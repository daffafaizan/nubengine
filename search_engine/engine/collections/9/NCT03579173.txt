      respiratory indices have on early CF lung disease. This knowledge will guide clinical
      management of infants with CF, who are now primarily diagnosed through newborn screening. We
      hypothesize that respiratory and nutritional indices during the first year of life are
      critical determinants of lung function in infants and preschoolers with CF.

      Aim #1 - To examine the relationship between nutritional status (weight-for-age (WFA) and
      weight-for-length (WFL)) at 6 months of age and lung function at 1-2 years of age in infants
      with CF.

      Hypothesis: Infants with CF with poor nutritional status at 6 months of age will have worse
      lung function, as assessed through the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression
      technique and plethysmography, compared to those with better nutritional indices, defined as
      improved weight-for-age and weight-for-length.

      Aim #2 - To examine the relationship between nutritional status (WFA and WFL) in infants with
      CF at 12 months of age and the lung clearance index (LCI) at 3-5 years of age.

      Hypothesis: Infants with CF with poor nutritional indices at 12 months of age will have a
      higher (worse) LCI at 3-5 years of age compared to those with better nutritional status.

      Aim #3 - To delineate the relationship between passive tidal breathing lung function testing
      in infants with CF at 4-8 weeks of age and subsequent lung function at 6-12 months of age.

      Hypothesis: Abnormalities in passive tidal breathing lung function testing will be associated
      with abnormal infant pulmonary function testing obtained via the raised volume rapid
      thoracoabdominal compression technique and plethysmography at 6-12 months of age.
