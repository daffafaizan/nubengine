      sphingolipid content and on the other hand a disturbed sphingolipid metabolism in the
      epidermis of patients with atopic dermatitis was verified, a double blinded, controlled,
      randomized, cross-over study with a daily supplementation of 3 g milk phospholipids to
      subjects with a mild to moderate atopic dermatitis will be conducted.

      Forty patients will be randomized between two groups of each 20 patients. After an individual
      checkup and a run-in period of 2 weeks, the one group will receive the phospholipid enriched
      dairy product and the second group will be given a placebo dairy product over two month. A
      wash out-period of 4 weeks will follow, and the patients will consume the contrary dairy
      products over two month after a 2-week run-in period again.
