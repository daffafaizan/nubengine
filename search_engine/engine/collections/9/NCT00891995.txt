      improve C-peptide production compared to children receiving routine diabetes management and
      the secondary aim is to determine if allowing the islet cells to be less metabolically active
      will have an impact on the underlying autoimmune process.

      Following completion of the baseline procedures (Mixed Meal Tolerance Test and blood sample
      collection), participants are randomized to either the Standard Treatment Group or the
      Intensive Treatment Group which includes 4-6 days of inpatient closed loop therapy followed
      by outpatient use of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor for diabetes management.

      All subjects will be seen 7 times in the first year and 4 times in the second year for
      follow-up testing. Subjects who are still producing insulin after 2 years may be asked to
      return every 6 months for an additional 2 years.
