    
      This study has the following 2 goals:

      Aim 1: To determine the rates, types, and predictors of medication errors and ADEs.

      Aim 2: To perform a trial assessing the effectiveness of an intervention (CPOE) on reducing
      serious medication errors.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Medication errors and ADEs are frequent in ambulatory pediatrics.

        2. Presence of the following predictors will be associated with higher error rates:
           cultural, racial, socioeconomic, educational, and linguistic barriers to communication,
           understanding, and successful completion of prescribed therapies; complex medical or
           chronic medical conditions; complex medication regimens; non-physician providers with
           limited clinical experience; high provider workloads; and complex prescription refill
           systems.

        3. Prevention strategies, including both technology-based and behavioral/ human
           factors-based interventions, will be effective and cost-effective in reducing rates of
           serious medication errors (defined as preventable ADEs and non-intercepted potential
           ADEs).
