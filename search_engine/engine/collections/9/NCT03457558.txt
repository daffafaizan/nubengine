      low rates of food security. Some of these risk factors include lower levels of income and
      employment. This study consists of a one-time survey using the US Adult Food Security Survey
      and another previously validated survey about perceptions of barriers to healthy eating.

      Our long-term goal is to develop a large SCI food security and perceived barriers to healthy
      eating multicenter study in order to determine if these factors are significant issues in the
      SCI population. We also aim to determine the causes of these issues in order to develop
      interventions to improve the health of all people living with a SCI and potentially reduce
      their health care costs. The purpose of this study is to determine the rates of food
      insecurity in a sample of people living with a SCI and to identify some perceptions of
      barriers to healthy eating in the SCI population. This will also develop preliminary data to
      support a NIH R level grant application for a large, multicenter study to further explore SCI
      food security at the national level. Our central hypothesis is that there will be an
      increased rate of food insecurity in the SCI population compared to other groups in the
      literature, and that this will be associated with income and environmental barriers.
