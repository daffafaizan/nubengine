      the block a standard monitoring will be established. After applying the monitoring the block
      will be performed by an experienced anesthetist in supervision of another experienced
      anesthetist. The nerve stimulator is set on a fixed current of 1.0 mA and a block without
      motoric response on this current is tried. Ultrasound images are saved. After performing the
      regional anesthesia the further anesthetic procedure will be carried out and the surgery will
      take place. After surgery the patients will be transported to the recovery room or
      Postanesthesia care unit.
