      with a diverse group of disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies pulmonary
      hypertension into five groups, with Group I comprising pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (formerly referred to as "primary pulmonary hypertension"). Although not currently a part of
      the WHO classification, exercise-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (EIPAH), defined by
      normal pulmonary artery pressures at rest and elevation of pulmonary pressures with exercise,
      is increasingly recognized as a distinct clinical entity. In some patients, exercise-induced
      pulmonary hypertension may represent a precursor for developing an established elevation in
      pulmonary pressures at rest that defines PAH. Functional PET imaging has not previously been
      utilized to quantify perfusion and vascular compliance in patients with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate regional lung perfusion,
      perfusion heterogeneity, and vascular compliance in patients with both exercise-induced and
      resting pulmonary hypertension using functional positron emission tomography imaging.
      Ultimately, if quantifiable differences between healthy subjects and patients with PAH are
      detected with 13NN and 11CO labeled PET, functional PET imaging may provide a useful imaging
      modality in early diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and monitoring response to therapy. In
      this pilot study, we will recruit 10 adult patients with pulmonary hypertension (5 with PAH
      and 5 with EIPAH) who are on stable PAH-specific therapy (if any), and 5 healthy controls.
