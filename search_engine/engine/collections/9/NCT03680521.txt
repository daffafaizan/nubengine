    
      Sitravatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets multiple closely
      related receptor tyrosine kinase pathways including VEGFR, PDGF receptor (PDGFR), c-KIT, MET,
      and the TAM family of receptors (TYRO3, AXL, and MER). Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody
      directed against PD-1 and blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, thereby
      releasing PD-1-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation (including cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells)
      and cytokine production. Together, sitravatinib and nivolumab may cooperate to elicit greater
      anti-tumor activity than either agent alone, as sitravatinib is predicted to enhance several
      steps in the cancer immunity cycle that may augment the efficacy of nivolumab.
