      lead to viral and bacterial pneumonia and contribute to the bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome. Although the annual influenza vaccine is recommended for lung transplant patients,
      studies have shown that a single intramuscular (i.m.) dose has poor immunogenicity. There are
      no studies that define the effect of intradermal doses in this population. We plan to study
      the immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of influenza vaccine in 50 lung transplant patients
      during the 2006-2007 season. After the initial i.m. injection, a second dose will be given
      intradermally 4 weeks later. Antibody titers will be evaluated by a standard hemagglutination
      inhibition assay. We hypothesize that the second dose intradermally will significantly
      increase the proportion of vaccine responders.
