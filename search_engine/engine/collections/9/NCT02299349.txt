      pain in the majority of TKA patients6-14, too many are still dissatisfied with overall pain
      control13 and adverse drug reactions (dizziness and somnolence) to neuroleptic medications15.
      Additionally, postoperative falls are greater with femoral nerve blocks16, and new
      neurological symptoms are associated with the block17. Bupivacaine liposome suspension
      periarticular injection has large scale national anecdotal support for TKA pain control with
      avoidance of regional block adversity. There is one recent randomized control trial in TKA
      patients favorably comparing periarticular injection with bupivacaine liposome suspension
      versus bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCL)5. To date the clinical use and published evidence most
      robustly supports bupivacaine liposome suspension in patients undergoing bunionectomy or
      hemorrhoidectomy. Additionally, in preparation for shorter hospital stays for total joint
      arthroplasty, a more effective and better tolerated pain management solution is needed.

      Hypothesis Statement:

      Hospitalized TKA patients without a pre-operative femoral nerve block will experience
      improved postoperative pain control and less MSO4 equivalence consumption when receiving an
      injection of bupivacaine liposome suspension versus concentrated multi drug.
