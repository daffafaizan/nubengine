    
      Each patient having bilateral edentulism in posterior maxillae was randomised to receive one
      partial fixed prosthesis supported by one to three implants placed either with a crestal or
      with lateral window sinus lift procedure.

      Eligibility criteria for participants

      Only healed implant sites were considered (at least 3 months after tooth extraction). The
      vertical bone height at the implant sites to be included had to be between 2 to 6 mm and bone
      thickness at least 6 mm as measured on cone-bean computed tomography (CBCT) scans.

      Patients were not admitted in the study if any of the following exclusion criteria was
      present:

      general contraindications to implant surgery subjected to irradiation in the head and neck
      area immunosuppressed or immunocompromised treated or under treatment with intravenous
      amino-bisphosphonates poor oral hygiene and motivation untreated periodontal disease
      uncontrolled diabetes pregnant or lactating substance abusers psychiatric problems
      unrealistic expectations lack of opposite occluding dentition/prosthesis in the area intended
      for implant placement acute or chronic infection/inflammation in the area intended for sinus
      augmentation/implant placement referred only for implant placement who cannot be
      rehabilitated and followed at the treatment centre unable to attend a 5-year post-loading
      follow-up. Smokers were included and patients were categorised into three groups according to
      what declare: i) non-smokers; ìì) moderate smokers, if smoking up to 10 cigarettes/day; iii)
      heavy smokers if smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day.

      Patients were recruited and treated in one private practice in Tirana, Albania by two
      operators: Marco Tallarico who performed all surgical interventions and Erta Xhanari who
      performed all prosthetic and maintenance procedures.
