      will be enrolled to undergo evaluation of the colonic mucosa via sigmoid biopsies.
      Participants will also complete surveys, blood draw and stool collection. Overall goals are
      to identify whether C. difficile is persisting in the colon mucosa after treated infection,
      and whether this, and other clinical and microbiome factors may be playing a role in disease
      recurrence.
