      molecular, genetic, genomic, epigenetics, immunologic, and exposure biomarkers that will help
      elucidate molecular disease endotype within the difficult-to-treat phenotype. This
      information will be used along with clinical, psychosocial, and adherence data to develop a
      personalized treatment plan. Following the personalized treatment plan, study clinicians will
      prescribe the medications through a home delivery or routine pharmacy depending on the
      family's preference and covered by the participant's health insurance. Investigators will
      track disease outcome metrics including exacerbations, symptom-free days, and asthma symptom
      scores to determine the effectiveness of this personalized approach.
