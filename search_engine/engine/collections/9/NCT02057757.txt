      infections are major causes of SARI and can lead to severe outcomes, including
      hospitalization and death. NTZ is a medication that is approved in the United States and
      Mexico to treat gastrointestinal parasitic diseases. This study will evaluate the use of NTZ
      to treat SARI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and
      tolerability of NTZ, in combination with standard care, in treating SARI in people who are
      hospitalized.

      Participants will be hospitalized and study entry assessments will include medical
      assessments, blood collection, and a nasopharyngeal swab or wash. Participants will then be
      randomly assigned to receive NTZ or placebo for 5 days. Participants younger than 12 years
      will receive an oral suspension formulation of NTZ or placebo; participants 12 years and
      older will receive NTZ or placebo tablets. All participants will also receive standard of
      care treatment for acute severe viral respiratory infections, which may include antibiotics
      and/or treatment for influenza. They will be discharged from the hospital based on their
      doctors' recommendations. Participants will record their temperature and symptoms in a daily
      diary, which will be reviewed by study staff during study visits. Follow-up visits will occur
      on Days 3, 7, 14, and 28, and may occur as inpatient or outpatient visits. These visits may
      include the same assessments that occurred at baseline, as well as physical examinations,
      depending on the visit. Participants who are still hospitalized at Day 28 will be followed by
      study staff until they are discharged from the hospital.
