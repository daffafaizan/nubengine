      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Dexamethasone with or
      without Rituximab in previously treated lymphoid malignancies (rituximab will only be
      evaluated in CD20 positive malignancies).

      II. To determine the efficacy of the above regimen.

      III. To determine the ability to proceed to blood stem peripheral blood collection following
      the above regimens (the impact of above regimen on stem cell reserve).

      IV. To determine remission duration.

      All patients are treated with gemcitbine, carboplatin, and dexamethasone. Patients with CD20
      + lymphomas also receive rituximab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 weeks and then every 6
      months for 5 years.
