    
      A UCSF PI-initiated study which includes comprehensive decision support intervention that may
      incorporate clinical, lifestyle, tumor genomic, and germline gene variant data.

      The web and coaching intervention will: 1) summarize key prognostic data elements, 2)
      communicate relative and absolute risks of upgrading/upstaging based on each of these
      elements, individually and in aggregate, and 3) provide tailored educational information for
      informed decision making on treatment options. A key aspect of the intervention will be
      provision of tiered coaching to the men prior to their physician visits to help them enter
      information accurately into the system, understand the results of the prediction model,
      document their questions for their physicians, and prepare them to make better-informed
      treatment decisions. UCSF research team will develop the decision support intervention in
      phases, initially using only clinical variables, BMI (body mass index), and smoking data;and
      then extend it to include information from genomic and genetic inputs, as validation work
      progresses. Variables will be retained based on statistical evaluation of the predictive
      values.
