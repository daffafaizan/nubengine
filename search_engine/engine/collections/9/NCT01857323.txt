    
      The study consists of a screening/run-in period where, after meeting study criteria, patients
      enter a run-in period lasting 7 to 14 ±2 days, during which diary and medication compliance,
      as well as inhaler technique, will be assessed. The run-in period will commence the day
      following the completion of all screening procedures and will continue through to and include
      the day prior to the first treatment visit (TV1) such that a minimum of 7 full days of diary
      data will be collected prior to TV1. The purpose of the run-in period is to assess compliance
      with a BID dosing regimen and with the completion of the diary entries over a minimum period
      of 7 days. Patients who demonstrate adequate inhaler technique and who are at least 90%
      compliant with dosing and completion of the diary on the last 7 consecutive days of run-in
      will qualify for enrollment into the open-label study. The study treatment period will
      comprise 6 treatment visits (TV1-TV6) for all enrolled patients except those in the 5-week
      treatment cohort who will have only 5 treatment visits (TV1-TV5). Patients may continue
      taking their current asthma or COPD medications throughout the Treatment Period. The patient
      will return to the clinic on Days 8 (±1), 15 (±1), 22 (±1), and 36 (±1), and then on Day 50
      (-2) after approximately all 200 doses have been delivered, or until early withdrawal. The
      patient will be deemed to have completed the study if at least 90% of the recommended doses
      contained in Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter were used. A representative sample
      (approximately 15%) of patients will participate in the trial for approximately 5 weeks with
      Day 36 (±1) being the final study visit.
