discussion sur les donnees radiologiquesdans les arthropathies des genouxprofessor marchal acts as moderator.dr. le coeur wonders if the fringed appearance ofcondyles has really a pathological significance; thatappearance could be normal in young children, but,in the opinion of dr. queneau, it seems to be patho-logical in older children.it seems to dr. favre-gilly and dr. queneau thatscalariform traits occur more frequently in haemo-philiac children than in normal ones.dr. le coeur thought that fibrillary decalcificationwas the ultimate stage of decalcification, whereasdr. favre-gilly has the impression that it representsin haemophiliac subjects an early stage anterior tohomogeneous decalcification.according to brinkhous, densification of synovialmembranes are a result of an infiltration of the jointcartilage due to haemosideraemia; this is also theopinion of dr. favre-gilly and dr. izarn.dr. izarn asks if geodes are caused by intra-osseous haemorrhages or necroses; dr. queneau anddr. de mourgues think that anatomical data con-cerning haemophiliac subjects are insufficient forthat question to be answered.
