      human body; where, it is a very important mucosal signaling molecule participating in gut
      motility, sensation, and secretion.The vast majority of the gut-derived 5-HT is produced by
      specialized epithelial cells of The GI tract, called enterochromaffin (EC) cells. EC cells
      produce 5-HT from dietary tryptophan, this process involves the rate limiting enzyme
      tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 1, once produced this 5-HT can be released into the gut lumen,
      surrounding tissue and can enter the blood circulation.5-HT mediates many gastrointestinal
      functions, including secretion and peristalsis, by acting on a diverse range of 5-HT
      receptors. Five of the seven known receptor families of 5-HT (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4 and
      5-HT7) are expressed in the gut.

      5-HT has been evaluated in IBD and in animal models of colitis. An increase in numbers of EC
      cells expressing 5-HT is observed in CD and UC patients and consumption of selective 5-HT
      reuptake inhibitors is associated with microscopic colitis. In the present study, we plan to
      investigate the key elements of mucosal 5-HT signaling in CD patients for a better
      understanding of the role of 5-HT in pathogenesis of IBD.
