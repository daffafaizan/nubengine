    
      This study uses a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised between-groups design to test
      if administration of a serotonin receptor subtype 4 (5HT4) agonist called PF-04995274 has
      positive effects on emotional processing and neural activity in unmedicated depressed
      patients. Participants are patients who fulfill criteria for current episode of Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD), and they will be randomised to receive 7 days treatment with
      either PF-04995274 (15 mg daily), citalopram (20 mg daily) or a matched placebo. Participants
      will come for a Screening Visit, a First Dose Visit, Research Visit One (including MRI scan)
      and Research Visit Two (including measures of emotional processing and non-emotion
      cognition).
