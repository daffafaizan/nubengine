      catheterization. Current practice at our institution in the gynecologic operating room is to
      perform a one time catheterization on patient's undergoing short procedures, yet it is
      unclear if this is a necessary intervention. If patients are asked to void immediately before
      their procedure it would eliminate the need for intra-operative catheterization and eliminate
      a potential source of infection.

      The study is designed to determine whether routine catheterization prior to a minor OB/GYN
      procedure causes symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteria in the urine. Current practice is
      one-time catheterization of patients undergoing minor OB/GYN procedures prior to the
      beginning of the procedure. The investigators hypothesize that this causes asymptomatic or
      symptomatic bacteriuria.
