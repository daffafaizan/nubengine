      TBI, The investigators hypothesized that combination therapy of both drugs will have
      significant effect as it simultaneously will target multiple mechanisms of injury. So, this
      randomized study aims at comparing between the effects of amantadine, citcholine and their
      combinations on arousal and behavioral consequences in early phase of moderate TBI
