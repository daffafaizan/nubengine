    
      MNEMONICH is a disease-specific registry of prospectively collected data obtained from the
      integration and harmonization of preexisting single-center data sets. It was formed to
      provide clinician-scientists around the world a comprehensive database to direct future
      studies toward better understanding of ICH. MNEMONICH will help examine global variability in
      the prevalence of ICH and identify research priorities.

      New data for MNEMONICH will be prospectively collected on a wide range of features including
      demographics, medical history, dates and times of symptom onset, presentation symptoms,
      hemodynamic signs, initial and chronic medical therapy, diagnostic imaging, laboratory and
      genetic analyses, pathological data, and surgical and medical management. Future research
      will be based upon ad hoc analysis of this data.
