      (Nadel 2003), and life expectancy in DS is now 50-60 years. Thus, age-associated cognitive
      impairment and dementia in older adults with DS is an urgent public health concern. The
      investigators propose that nicotinic stimulation is a promising strategy to stabilize or
      improve cognitive functioning in adults with DS, possibly with additional neuroprotective
      effects. The investigators have extensive experience investigating the role of nicotinic
      receptors on human cognition and impairment. This application takes advantage of new insights
      into treating Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-the precursor condition to Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD) in typically developing individuals) with nicotine to propose an open label pilot study
      of transdermal nicotine in middle-aged non-smoking DS patients who show early cognitive
      and/or behavioral changes consistent with MCI/dementia.

      The goal of this study is to establish preliminary evidence for safety, gain preliminary
      evidence as to whether nicotine enhances cognitive functioning in DS adults, and examine
      electrophysiological, biological, and behavioral correlates of nicotinic stimulation effects.

      The investigators propose that positive results on cognitive or functional indices that would
      lead to a larger and longer double-blind trial to test more definitively whether nicotinic
      stimulation may be cognitively and/or functionally enhancing for DS patients. The knowledge
      gained from the translational aspects of this project will guide the development of
      potentially new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first time, data on the
      importance of nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS
      adults. This work also represents the first time that cutting-edge advances in treating
      MCI/AD in the general population are immediately and rigorously applied to those with DS.
