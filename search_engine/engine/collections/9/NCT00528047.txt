      administered intravenously over 1 hr daily for 5 days in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Patients will be evaluated prior to dosing, during dosing and following dosing, on a 28-day
      cycle. Tumor response will be evaluated every other cycle.

      Three patients will be assigned per dose level until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is
      reached or a a Dose-Limited Toxicity (DLT) is encountered. Sequential cohorts of three
      patients will be treated with escalating doses until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is
      reached.
