      I. Validate a model of proactive palliative medicine referral. II. Quantify the impact of
      palliative care aggressive care at the end-of-life (PCARE) versus PCARE + idiographic
      assessment on quality of care and patient satisfaction.

      III. Utilizing CMO data Investigators will create a cost model for patients randomized to
      PCARE versus patients refusing randomization.

      IV. Determine the impact of a proactive model of palliative care consultation at the time of
      diagnosis on family/caregivers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized 1 of 2 arms.

      GROUP I (usual PCARE): Patients complete European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer quality of life-30 (EORTCQLQ-30) and Family Satisfaction with Advanced Cancer Care
      (FAMCARE) questionnaire every 6 weeks for 3 visits.

      GROUP II: (usual PCARE + idiographic assessment): Patients complete EORTC QLQ-30, and FAMCARE
      questionnaire as in Group I and undergo idiographic assessment. Beginning within 4 weeks of
      their visit with the gynecologic oncologist, patients are referred to outpatient palliative
      medicine consultation.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically .
