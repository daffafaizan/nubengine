      be carried out for 3 months for patients with coronary artery disease with percutaneous
      coronary intervention. Three educational lectures on nutrition and a 3-month high intensity
      interval training will be developed in old patients with chronic heart disease. A control
      group will not develop any program. Effectiveness on anthropometric parameters, eating
      habits, physical activity, quality of life, anxiety and depression will be assessed at
      baseline and at 3 months.
