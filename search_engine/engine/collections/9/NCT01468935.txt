      but also for diseases like solid organ cancers. Interestingly, women who have had bone marrow
      transplants have been found to have donor tissue in their endometrium, which raises the
      possibility of cellular therapies using bone marrow derived cells for gynecologic
      indications. Donor engraftment does not appear to occur when transplantations were performed
      with stem cells collected from peripheral blood of the donor. Therefore, the subtype of cells
      from the bone marrow responsible for engraftment is not yet known, nor is the ideal
      transplantation regimen known.

      The immediate aim of this tissue procurement protocol is to obtain endometrial (uterine) stem
      cells from many human volunteers in order to examine the biological properties of those
      cells. We will collect tissue from 3 primary groups of patients: normal controls, patients
      with rare diseases or reproductive disorders, and patients who have undergone hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant. Each volunteer will undergo an endometrial biopsy during an office
      visit. The endometrial tissue will then be studied for a better understanding of their
      biological properties, growth and differentiation. One specific area of interest is to study
      how hematopoietic transplantation impacts endometrial cell function. These endometrial cells
      will be analyzed in-depth in the laboratory to determine if they came from the donor or
      recipient, and if so, which specific populations of cells. Hematologic pre-transplant
      conditioning information will be correlated with these research studies to identify factors
      that may assist with the understanding of adult endometrial stem cell biology.
