      a waitlist control group. Participants in the intervention group will complete the Eat
      Breathe Thrive (EBT) Yoga for Eating Disorder Recovery online course. This course will be led
      by certified facilitators via Zoom and offered over the course of four weeks, comprising one
      two-hour session per week. The course will continue to recruit and enroll participants until
      sufficient power is reached for the study. At Pretest, Posttest 1, Posttest 2, and
      three-months Follow-Up, participants will complete a series of self-report measures (see
      point 12.3). Participants in the waitlist control group will only be engaged in the study
      assessment procedures. However, they will be given the opportunity to take part in the Yoga
      for Eating Disorder Recovery online course that was delivered to the intervention group, once
      Posttest 1 has been completed by both groups.
