    
      Background

      The requirement for licensure became part of the FDA final rules for Human Cells, Tissues,
      and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) (March 29, 2004 and May 25, 2005) in an effort to prevent
      transmission of communicable disease, minimize contamination and preserved integrity and
      function during processing, outline safety and effectiveness requirements for cells from
      unrelated donors or when HCT/Ps are more than minimally manipulated, assure labeling is clear
      accurate and not misleading and monitor and communicate with industry via establishment
      registration. However, as of October 20, 2011, those units that do not meet the manufacturing
      requirements for licensure can only be distributed for transplantation if the transplant will
      occur under an IND research protocol. These units are in current and future inventory at
      domestic and international cord blood banks that cannot be demonstrated to meet licensing
      requirements. In addition to the licensure guidance, the FDA published a guidance in August
      2011 entitled Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Minimally Manipulated,
      Unrelated Allogeneic Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood Intended for Hematopoietic Reconstitution
      for Specified Indications.

      This study is an access and distribution protocol conducted by the National Marrow Donor
      Program (NMDP) for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult
      patients, in which sites wishing to receive NMDP unrelated cord blood units for treatment or
      research must participate with an locally IRB- approved protocol.

      Primary Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of
      greater than or equal to 500/mm(3) after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution
      setting using CBUs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed.

      Secondary Objectives

      In patients receiving non-licensed CBU

        -  Assess incidence of graft rejection

        -  Assess incidence of transmission of infection

        -  Assess incidence of serious infusion reaction Determine 1 year survival after cord blood
           transplantation

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and
           grades III to IV

        -  Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD

        -  Determine CBU-derived engraftment

      Eligibility Criteria

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patients of any age with FDA-specified indications

        -  Signed informed consent (and assent when applicable) obtained prior to study enrollment

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Patients who have licensed CBUs available

        -  Cord blood transplant recipients at international transplant centers

        -  Patients who are enrolled on another IND protocol to access the unlicensed CBU(s)

        -  Patients whose selected unlicensed CBU(s) will be more than minimally manipulated

      Design

      -Treatment description, including pre-transplant conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis, will
      occur per each transplant center s specification.
