      Mesothelioma (MPM). Most of them are small studies investigating the efficacy of single-agent
      immunotherapy in few patients. Given that the combination of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy
      with CTLA-4 has been shown in other cancers to enhance treatment effect, combined checkpoint
      inhibitor treatment has also been investigated in patients with MPM. Although these results
      are encouraging, the response rates seen are moderate compared to what has been documented
      for the combination of checkpoint inhibitors in other cancer indications. An approach to
      further enhance the PFS and response rate in MPM may be to use a vaccine aiming to activate
      an immune response directed against tumor-related antigens, and to combine the vaccine with
      checkpoint inhibitors. The proposed study will evaluate the use of the therapeutic cancer
      vaccine UV1 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab after progression on standard
      first-line chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      The objective of the study is to induce a meaningful progression-free survival benefit in
      patients with MPM after progression on first line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy, by
      treating with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1.

      The primary end-point (PFS) is expected to be analyzed in 2022.
