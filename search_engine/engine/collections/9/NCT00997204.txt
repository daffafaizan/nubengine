      a documented diagnosis of HAE Type I or II were eligible to participate in this trial.
      Eligible subjects included those who had received treatment for HAE with icatibant in
      previous clinical trials, or subjects who had been previously treated with the marketed
      product Firazyr® and subjects who were naïve to icatibant treatment.

      All subjects were trained on the method of self-administration at their enrollment visit
      (Visit 1).For the training sessions, a syringe pre-filled with 3 mL placebo solution was used
      in place of icatibant. Comprehensive educational material and instructions including
      pictograms were developed for the subjects to illustrate the method of self-administration
      and use of the Patient Diary. The training material provided additional information on how to
      self-diagnose an HAE attack and how to decide on the necessity to treat.In addition,
      instructions were provided on what to do in case of a laryngeal attack.
