      tissue tested and other exams to determine if s/he may proceed to the treatment part of the
      study. The subject's tumor tissue will be tested from either a previous or recent surgery or
      biopsy to see if it contains the FRÎ± protein. If the tumor is positive and the patient meets
      all other eligibility, then the subject may proceed to treatment.

      TREATMENT: Study drugs (IMGN853 and bevacizumab) will be given by vein (IV) once each cycle
      on day 1 of 21 day cycle.

      Regular cancer care exams, tests, and procedures will occur. Additionally, an eye doctor
      visit with complete eye examination every other treatment cycle. Subjects will also
      self-administer eye drops as prescribed by the eye doctor.

      Study participation is up to three years.
