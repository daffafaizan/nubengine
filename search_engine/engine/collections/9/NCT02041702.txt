    
      Accent Cardiac MRI study was a prospective, randomized ,multi-center study conducted in Asia.
      Subjects indicated for dual-chamber pacemaker and who signed study consent form were
      considered enrolled and post implant were randomized to either Cardiac MRI Scan Group or
      Control Group.

      Clinical evaluation and device interrogation were performed at baseline, pre- and post-MRI
      scan, and one month post-MRI for all subjects. At 9-12 weeks post-implant, patients in
      Cardiac MRI Scan Group underwent an elective non-diagnostic cardiac MRI scan at 1.5 Tesla (T)
      while patients in Control group underwent device interrogation and clinical evaluation twice
      with a 45-minute waiting period in between. The safety endpoint was freedom from MRI-related
      complications while efficacy endpoint was change in right atrial/ ventricular (RA/RV) capture
      threshold and sensing amplitude from pre-MRI scan to one month post-MRI scan.
