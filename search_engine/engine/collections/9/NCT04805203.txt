      patients, despite the availability of numerous new drugs. The patients are highly susceptible
      to infections, both bacterial and viral, due to a defect immune status, both at the antibody
      level (hypogammaglobulinemia) and the cellular level. This immunosuppression is further
      worsened by the treatments, and especially high dose glucocorticoids used at each phase of
      the disease. Consequently, MM patients are highly susceptible to contract COVID19, and to
      develop a severe form. This has been confirmed in a first study in Spring, showing a
      mortality rate of 37%. Among all MM patients included in the cohort at the time of diagnosis
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection, blood samples will be collected at inclusion, at time of the
      infection acute phase in the most severe cases (when admitted in intensive care units), and
      at recovery. The following immune function tests will be evaluated, gammaglobulin
      measurements, lymphocytes counts, B, T, and NK cells analyses by cytometry, including
      exhaustion analyses. In addition, T cell repertoire sequencing looking for SARS-CoV-2-
      specific T cells, and serologies, will be evaluated at recovery and 6 months after MM
      treatment re-initiation.
