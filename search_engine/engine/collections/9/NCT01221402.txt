    
      This is a phase II, single-center, double-blind trial that will randomize 138 prior CABG
      patients with an intermediate SVG lesion (30%-60% angiographic diameter stenosis) on
      clinically-indicated coronary angiography, and HDL-C<60 mg/dL to ER-niacin at a dose of
      1500-2000 mg daily or matching placebo (containing 50 mg of niacin that can cause flushing
      but has no lipid lowering effect) for 12 months. All patients will receive a statin with goal
      LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), and
      intravascular near-infrared intracoronary spectroscopy (NIRS), and optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) of the intermediate SVG lesion will be performed at enrollment and after 12
      months in each patient, along with exercise stress testing at 1 month and 12 months, B-mode
      carotid ultrasound imaging at enrollment and after 6 and 12 months, reactive hyperemia
      peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) at enrollment and after 6 and 12 months, and with
      peripheral blood sampling performed at enrollment and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, to
      determine whether compared to placebo, administration of ER-niacin will result in:

        1. Reduction of the percent atheroma volume (PAV) of the intermediate SVG lesion at
           12-month follow-up IVUS imaging (primary endpoint)

        2. Reduction of total and normalized total intermediate SVG lesion atheroma volume,
           reduction of atheroma volume in the most diseased 10-mm subsegment of the target
           intermediate lesion, reduction of atheroma volume in the subsegment of the target
           intermediate lesion with lipid core plaque by NIRS, reduction of lipid core burden index
           as assessed by near-infrared intracoronary spectroscopy, increase in fibrous cap
           thickness and reduction in the prevalence and number of microchannels, in the presence
           and extent of necrotic lipid pool, plaque rupture, calcification, and thrombus, as
           assessed by optical coherence tomography, and reduction of angiographic intermediate SVG
           target lesion failure at 12-month follow-up SVG imaging (secondary endpoints)

        3. Increased exercise capacity and reduction in ischemia, as assessed by exercise stress
           testing between 1 and 12 months (secondary endpoint)

        4. Less increase in mean carotid intima-media thickness at 6 and 12 months (secondary
           endpoint)

        5. Greater increase in natural logarithmic scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) at 6 and
           12 months (secondary endpoint)

        6. Greater increase in EPC-CFU/mL of peripheral blood from baseline to 1, 3, 6, and 12
           months post enrollment (secondary endpoint)

        7. Reduction of major adverse cardiac events (defined as the composite of death, acute
           coronary syndrome, or coronary revascularization) during follow-up (secondary endpoint)
