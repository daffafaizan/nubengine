      strong influence of environmental exposures such as smoking, implicate a major role for
      epigenetic mechanisms in modifying AATD disease penetrance. The goal of this study proposal
      is to investigate epigenetic regulation of alveolar macrophage (AM) inflammation and function
      in AATD PiZZ (two Z genes) and PiMZ (one M and one Z gene) patients. The investigators
      proposal focuses on epigenetic histone modifications and gene expression specifically in AM.

      AAT augmentation therapy, which alters disease symptoms, may also modulate AM epigenetics. To
      identify epigenetic regulation of AM inflammation in AATD in the context of AAT therapy, the
      investigators will perform and computationally integrate ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data. This will
      help elucidate the immunomodulatory mechanisms regulating AATD and provide an epigenetic map
      for diagnosis and targeted treatment. The investigators will test the efficacy of
      FDA-approved histone modifying drugs, such as Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) and more
      specific next-generation histone modifiers, such as GSK-J4, to modulate AM AATD-associated
      activity ex vivo.

      The goal of this study is to enroll up to a total of 13 AATD cases and 6 healthy controls.
      All AATD patients will be asked to give a blood sample and/or undergo a bronchoscopy. AATD
      patients will also be asked to undergo a follow up bronchoscopy and/or blood draw after 6
      months if treatment with alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy is initiated to study the
      changes in these markers after augmentation therapy.
