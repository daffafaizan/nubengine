      China aiming to evaluate the efficiency and safety of anti-PD1 antibody (Camrelizumab)
      combined with Paclitaxel(Albumin Bound) and Gemcitabine versus Paclitaxel(Albumin Bound) and
      Gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      The anti-PD1 antibody(Camrelizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody which can specifically
      bind to PD-1 and block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1), allowing T cells
      to recover the immune response against tumors. It is proved to be effective in certain
      cancers such as ovarian cancers and certification proved by Chinese Food and Drug
      Administration(CFDA) includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal
      cancer and liver cancer.
