      recognized from the child's first visit. Child's behavior can be affected by the parenting
      style. There are four types of parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and
      neglecting, each affects the child in different ways.

      Recently parenting styles became very interesting since parents are the primary caregivers
      and they have a great impact on the child's psychological and emotional development.

      However, every parent seeks for a rapid and easy treatment for their children, but if the
      child is uncooperative that will require multiple dental visits , more expenses or he/she
      might undergo general anesthesia which is more expensive.

      Also, the parent-child relationship is very important ,bad relationship can cause
      insecurities, lack of self confidence and trust, resulting in the future a fearful and
      irresponsible man / woman.
