      cessation over a six-month period. Patients will all receive a UPMC Tobacco Treatment Service
      counseling session focused on motivational interviewing prior to participation in the study.
      Upon consent, participants will then be randomized 1:1 to either standard patient-initiated
      follow-up or use of the Kwit app. Participants will be stratified by sex because males and
      females are known to have highly variable responses to existing tobacco control
      interventions. Investigators will systematically assess feasibility using established
      Likert-type items factors such as interaction, features, engagement, trust, and impact.

      If a participant consents to the study, they will be given a brief survey to collect general
      information related to their smoking behavior. After 30 days, a follow-up survey will be
      conducted to assess their current smoking behavior. Participants randomized to the
      experimental arm will be asked additional questions about their use of the smartphone app.
