      study of pediatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with upper
      respiratory infection (URI) symptoms for which the ED physician has recommended supportive
      care only (ie. non-prescription symptom relief). Study duration is approximately one year.
      Subject participation duration is 4 days.

      Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: handheld humidifier group (FDA cleared medical
      device that uses distilled water) & control group. Both groups may use any supportive
      modalities desired such as over-the-counter cold medications (OTCs), room air humidifier etc.

      Primary study objective is to determine if the use of handheld humidifier improves URI
      symptom scores (nocturnal cough, parental perception) and/or reduces use of other supportive
      modalities compared to the control group for the relief of pediatric URI symptoms.

      Three surveys will be obtained from all subjects. The initial survey occurs at the time of
      enrollment (T0). The second and third surveys will be completed by the parent/guardian on
      line or by phone on the first day after ED visit (T-1) and sometime between the 2nd-4th day
      after ED visit (T-2). The survey component includes a validated pediatric cough questionnaire
      with 7 point Likert scale, and a questions regarding any other supportive treatments used for
      symptom relief (the type, frequency and results).
