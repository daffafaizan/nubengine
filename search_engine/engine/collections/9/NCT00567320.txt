      varenicline group, and 20 into the placebo-control group. Assuming significant findings,
      these data will enable us to estimate a possible effect size for carrying-out a larger study.
      For preliminary analysis as a prelude to planning larger controlled studies, we will
      clinically require an effect size of 20% differences in the rates of cocaine positive urines
      or of self-reported cocaine use between the active medication and placebo groups. We will not
      adjust for these multiple comparisons to the placebo group since this is a pilot study, and
      use two-tailed significance level of 0.05 when we employ repeated measures analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) or Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM,see below) for statistical analysis
      over the 16-week study period.

      An Amendment was made and a new Updated consent form to include new FDA findings for study
      medication Varenicline." Varenicline may also cause changes in behavior, agitation, depressed
      mood, suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior." Currently we have 30 subjects who have
      completed this study. This study is suspended due to these new concerns, Department of
      Veterans Affairs and the P.I. James Poling agreed.

      Study has been published. (April 2011)
