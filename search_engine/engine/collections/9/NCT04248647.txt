      weeks, composed of three elements: aerobic and strength training exercise program,
      nutritional counselling and psychological support. The exercise program will be three times
      per week and include a combination of home-based (twice per week) and supervised (once per
      week) sessions. Participants' nutritional status and dietary intake will be assessed by a
      registered dietician/nutritionist, and a whey protein supplement (Immunocal) will be
      prescribed to achieve a daily intake of 1.5 g protein/kg. Psychological support will consist
      of a 90-minute interview/session at baseline and weekly in-person follow-ups before surgery
      aimed at reducing psychological distress and improving adherence to the exercise program and
      nutritional recommendations. Perioperative care will follow the McGill Surgical Recovery
      Pathway, also called Enhanced Recovery Program, which is an evidence-based care plan set up
      by the Surgical Recovery (SuRe) multidisciplinary committee of the McGill University Health
      Centre.
