      mediates chemoradiation resistance, leading to selection of aggressive tumor cell clones with
      the capacity to evade tumor microenvironment by increased anaerobic glycolysis and
      angiogenesis. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which indirectly measures tissue density,
      can be used to determine the likelihood of tumor response to treatment. High ADC before
      treatment has shown to predict an unfavorable response. Tumors with low ADC values on
      presentation generally respond better to treatment. An increased ADC in patients during and
      after nCRT could be used to predict early pathologic response i.e. discrimination of
      "responders and non-responders" to nCRT.
