      I. To develop a novel online mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) treatment for
      distressed metastatic breast cancer patients in the hope of reaching patients otherwise
      unable to participate in traditional interventions due to high symptom burden.

      II. Determine the impact of the intervention on both patient self-report and biological
      symptom measures.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      INTERVENTION ARM: Participants receive online group sessions over 60 minutes for 6 weeks,
      including 15 minutes of practice on that session's topic and daily meditation or yoga for 45
      minutes. At the conclusion of the study period participants participate in mindfulness
      meditation over 3 hours. Participants also receive a content manual and relaxation compact
      disc (CD).

      CONTROL ARM: Participants randomized to the wait-list control condition complete the online
      intervention as in the intervention arm after the initial 6-week period has ended.
