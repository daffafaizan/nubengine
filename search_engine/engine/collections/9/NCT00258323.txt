      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of gefitinib, in terms of median survival and distant metastatic
           disease control, in patients treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant cisplatin,
           fluorouracil, and radiotherapy who are undergoing surgery for esophageal and
           gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic complete and partial response rate in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients and in patients who are disease
           free and receiving long-term maintenance gefitinib.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preoperative regimen: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice a day during days 1-12 (for a
           total of 10 treatment days). Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously and cisplatin
           IV continuously on days 1-4. Patients also receive oral gefitinib once daily on days
           1-28. At 6 weeks, patients with locoregionally confined disease undergo surgical
           resection and then proceed to the postoperative regimen. Patients with a medical
           contraindication to surgery proceed directly to the postoperative regimen.

        -  Postoperative regimen: Beginning 4-10 weeks after surgery or 6 weeks after completing
           the first course of therapy, patients undergo radiotherapy and receive fluorouracil and
           cisplatin as in the preoperative regimen.

        -  Maintenance regimen: Patients receive oral gefitinib beginning on day 1 of the
           postoperative regimen and continuing for 2 years in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
