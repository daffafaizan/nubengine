        -  Determine whether amifostine provides systemic protection against the nonhematologic
           side effects of idarubicin (IDR) during induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia
           (AML), allowing the dose of idarubicin to be escalated.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of idarubicin when amifostine is used as a
           chemotherapy protectant.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of dose limiting hypotension in patients receiving
           amifostine and the ability to offset this side effect with vasoconstrictive agents.

        -  Determine whether any additional side effects of amifostine are dose limiting in
           patients with AML treated with IDR and cytarabine (ARA-C).

        -  Monitor the frequency of alopecia, mucositis, diarrhea, and septicemia involving enteric
           pathogens in these patients.

        -  Determine the requirement for intravenous hyperalimentation in patients receiving
           amifostine, IDR, and ARA-C.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of idarubicin (IDR).

      Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes, followed 15-30 minutes later by chemotherapy.
      Idarubicin IV is administered over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Cytarabine is administered by
      continuous infusion on days 1-7. Patients may receive 1 additional course of treatment, if
      necessary.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated at each dose level of idarubicin. Dose escalation is
      discontinued when 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
