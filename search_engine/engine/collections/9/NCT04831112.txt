    
      This prospective randomized trial will be conducted in all patients undergoing dressing after
      debridement of necrotizing fasciitis wounds. Study will be conducted for 6 months after
      approval IRB. Patient will be inducted through emergency department. After debridement,
      patient will be enrolled in study via simple random sampling for dressing with either EUSOL
      or Honey. Honey quantity for wound will be 4ml per square inch. In patient whose both limbs
      involved by necrotizing fasciitis, after debridement, dressing will be done with honey in one
      limb and EUSOL in other limb. Patient will be enrolled in study whose debridement already
      done.

      EUSOL is solution commonly used for dressing of wounds. Honey is also used for dressing of
      wounds. Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar derived from nectar gathered by a honeybee.
      Honey enhances wound healing by providing moist environment, antibacterial activity,
      deodorizes, decrease inflammation, edema and exudation. Honey increase rate of wound healing
      by promoting angiogenesis, granulation and epithelization. Dressing will be done by residents
      of our ward under supervision of faculty. At first time of debridement pus or tissue will be
      sent for culture and sensitivity meanwhile broad-spectrum antibiotic will be started. Once
      dressing will started, wide wound span will be measured and assessed daily for granulation
      tissue and removal of slough. Questionnaire will be filled by PI for allergic reaction to
      solution, appearance of granulation tissue and hospital stay.
