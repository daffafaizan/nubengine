      criteria will be enrolled in the study from Department of Pediatric Surgery, Mayo Hospital
      Lahore and will be randomly allocated by lottery method into 2 groups by the doctor. Group A
      and B with 86 patients in each group. Group A patients will be undergoing amniotic membrane
      dressing, while group B patients will undergo colloid gel foam dressing. Basic demographic
      information will be noted. Effect modifiers (hemoglobin level, weight and height) will be
      noted.

      In group A, the wounds will be washed with normal saline and then covered with amniotic
      membrane over which a layer of Vaseline gauze will be applied and dressing with gauze and the
      crape bandage will be applied. Every 3-4 days these dressings will be changed and assessed
      for pain, wound infection and wound c/s will be sent. Placentas from clean vaginal deliveries
      and elective C-sections will be taken. Blood of mother will be screened. Amniotic membrane
      will be separated from placenta in a clean sterile bowl. Bowl will be put in refrigerator at
      4 degrees.

      In group B, wound will be washed with normal saline . The wound site will be covered with
      Colloid Gel Foam and gauze, and crape bandage will be applied. Dressing will be changed after
      3-4 days. The outcome (pain score, wound infection,time for skin grafting and hospital stay)
      will be compared in both groups.
