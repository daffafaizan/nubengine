      period. This is a critical period for neurobehavioral development and the establishment of an
      optimal model of sleep-wake cycle is fundamental for brain development.

      The objective of the research is to develop new tools for computer-aided clinical and
      predictive diagnosis and real-time monitoring in neonatology.

      The development of non-invasive sensors based on video and sound images aims to improve the
      short- and medium-term prognosis in perinatal patients.

      To that aim, multi-modal composite indices integrating the image (which is used only to
      generate a quantification of the movement) and the sound to the bioelectric signals already
      available (electrocardiogram, oxymetry, temperature) will be developed to provide diagnostic
      and prognostic information.
