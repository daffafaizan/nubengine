      anaesthetised patients may participate in the study. Pencil-point spinal needle and
      bupivacaine (Marcaine Heavy Spinal 0.5 %) will be used.

      Before the beginning of operation, under ultrasound control, a catheter will be implemented
      to one of the chosen position: the adductor canal (the middle or lower third of thigh) or
      near the femoral nerve (below the inguinal ligament). The local anesthetic solution of 0.2 %
      ropivacaine will be started with an elastomeric pump (5 mL per hour, up to 72 hours) as soon
      as a catheter in the right position.

      The pain will be measured with VAS (visual-analogue scale) 8, 24 and 48 hours after the end
      of operation, and at the discharge. At the same time, i.e.: 8, 24 and 48 hours from the end
      of surgery, the range of flexion and extension in the operated knee will be assessed.
      Moreover, the possibility of patient's sitting, standing up and walking will be noted.

      All parameters will be reassessed before patients' discharge from the hospital. Each patient
      will receive paracetamol (1.0) and metamizol (1.0) intravenously (i.v.) q6h. 5 mg of morphine
      may be given as required, up to 2 dosages per day as a rescue medication.
