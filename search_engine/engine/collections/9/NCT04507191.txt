      cases who attended to Oncology Centre, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt in the period
      from 2012 till 2019. The cases were chosen randomly. All clinicopathological data including
      tumor stage (T), L.N metastases (N), metastasis (M), (FIGO) staging system, ascites,
      recurrence, residual tumor, CEA level, CA125 level, and peritoneal deposits analyzed. The
      investigator followed the clinical outcomes in the form of disease free survival (DFS) and
      overall survival (OS). The mean duration of follow up will be 43.4 months. The OS were
      calculated from the time of diagnosis to death. DFS is the time from the end of therapy to
      first recurrence or metastases. the specimens were stained with PDL1 marker in pathology
      department Port Said university.

      Statistical analysis: Data was analyzed using SPSS software V.16. Continuous data was
      presented in the form of mean (SD) or Median (min-max) according to the results of
      Shapiro-Wilk testing for the assumptions of normal distributions of data. Categorical data
      will be presented in the form of frequencies and percentages. Statistical significance will
      be tested by Welch's t-test, or Mann-Whitney U for continuous data (with respect to presence
      or absence of normal distribution of data). Also, chi square test or Fisher's Exact Test will
      be performed for categorical data (with respect to the minimal expected values in the
      contingencies tables). Correlations of different tumour markers will be calculated using
      Spearman's rho Coefficient. Kaplan-Meier test was used to test for overall survival and
      disease free survival of patients with respect to tumour expression of PDL1. Comparisons will
      be done using Log Rank (Mantel-Cox). Significance level is set at 0.05.
