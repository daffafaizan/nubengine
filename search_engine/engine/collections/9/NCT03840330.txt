    
      Three groups of participants (circuit training based on high-intensity interval training,
      circuit training at moderate intensity and not training group) will enter the study. The
      intervention will consist of a physical exercise program in day centers.

      Intensity progression will be encouraged according to the rate of perceived exertion.
      Progression of exertion will be "very hard", "extremely hard" and "maximal exertion" for HIT
      group, and "light", "somewhat hard" and "hard" for group. Assessment will be undertaken at
      two-time points: baseline and after 16 weeks of exercise training.

      Assessment will include VO2 peak, functional capacity, health-related quality of life,
      cognitive state and daily physical activity.
