    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical activity of imatinib mesylate (STI571) in patients with
           metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the side effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular studies with responsiveness to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI571) twice daily. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-78 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-15
      months.
