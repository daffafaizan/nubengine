      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are world-widely in use in clinics. The investigators
      combined these two types of neuromodulation techniques to increase the effective response of
      a single session of neuromodulation in subjective tinnitus. Experimental groups with 80
      tinnitus subjects consisted of four different treatment groups which are tDCS, tDCS with sham
      TMS, tDCS-TMS and TMS group. Subjects were given 1.5milliampere (mA) tDCS on the bi-frontal
      area and TMS stimulated contralateral single side of the temporoparietal cortex with 200
      pulses at 1herz (Hz) stimulation.
