    
      A single-blind parallel-group pilot randomised controlled feasibility trial with the overall
      aim to develop two internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy interventions,
      therapist-guided and self-guided, for adolescents with mild to moderate Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) and their primary caregivers.

      Patients can be either referred or self-referred. All potential participants are initially
      screened via telephone. This is followed by a face-to-face inclusion assessment. Participants
      who are eligible and have consented will be randomized into one of three trial arms;
      therapist-guided ICBT, self-guided ICBT or TAU. In the experimental arms, participants, e.g.
      the adolescent and at least one caregiver, either receive 10 weeks of therapist-guided or
      self-guided internet-delivered behavioural activation (BA). In the control arm, participants
      receive treatment as usual within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) or
      primary care clinics. The primary endpoint will be at 3-month follow-up.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of the study design and trial
      procedures, including recruitment, withdrawal, drop out and attrition rates. The secondary
      objective is to (a) evaluate the acceptability of the ICBT interventions in regard to
      treatment satisfaction, credibility, reported adverse events, and program use, (b) to provide
      preliminary clinical efficacy data, and (c) to gather qualitative information on the
      experience of undergoing ICBT for depression from the perspective of adolescent patients,
      their caregivers and potential areas for improvement of future ICBT interventions.
