      using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20
      million cells. 5 patients (age 12 to 17 years) with Crohn's perianal fistulas will be
      enrolled.

      Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement
      of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be
      replaced with the MSC loaded Gore fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects
      will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an
      autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.
