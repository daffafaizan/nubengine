      Primary

        -  To establish the safety of calcitriol in patients at high risk of lung cancer.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of calcitriol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 3 months
      in absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and molecular analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
