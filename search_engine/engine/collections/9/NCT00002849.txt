        -  Evaluate M protein and organ dysfunction responses and overall and progression-free
           survival in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis treated with
           dexamethasone/interferon alfa.

        -  Identify prognostic factors that may relate to response and overall survival in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior amyloidosis treatment (yes vs no).

      All patients receive induction therapy with oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20
      every 35 days for a total of 3 courses.

      Maintenance therapy begins within 5-8 weeks (within 10 weeks if patients undergo stem cell
      harvest) of initiation of the third course of induction, as follows: oral dexamethasone for 4
      days every 4 weeks; and subcutaneous interferon alfa 3 times per week. Patients who achieved
      less than a 50% reduction in serum M protein or urinary Bence-Jones protein and who
      experienced less than grade 3 toxicity during induction receive 3 additional courses of pulse
      dexamethasone concurrently with entry to maintenance therapy and the initiation of interferon
      alfa.

      Combination therapy is continued until 2 years from entry; thereafter, interferon is
      administered alone for at least 3 years, toxicity permitting. Patients with stable disease
      after 5 years of therapy may discontinue interferon alfa at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 with prior melphalan/prednisone or
      iododoxorubicin treatment and 50 without) will be entered over 3 years.
