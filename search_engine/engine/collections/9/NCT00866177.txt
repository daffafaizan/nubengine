      I. Determine the response in patients with V600E or V600K BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated stage
      III or stage IV melanoma with low or high phospho-pAKT expression treated with MEK inhibitor
      AZD6244.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify other genetic predictors of sensitivity to MEK inhibition.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to pAKT expression (low vs high).

      Patients receive oral MEK inhibitor AZD6244 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected for correlative laboratory studies. Samples are assessed
      for expression of pAKT, pPRAS40, and PTEN by IHC and mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and
      PIK3CAP by MALDI-TOF. PTEN is sequenced in tumors using whole genome amplification followed
      by high-throughput bidirectional dideoxynucleotide sequencing of PCR-amplified gene products.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
