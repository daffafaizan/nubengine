      results in this small study would provide the data needed to expand the study to validate the
      use in a larger population of pediatric patients. Validating the use of FDOPA-PET imaging as
      an early predictor for response to anti-angiogenic therapy could greatly impact the standard
      of care for treating and evaluating pediatric brain tumors and provide a useful biomarker for
      assessing experimental therapeutics.
