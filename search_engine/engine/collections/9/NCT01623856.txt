      I. To conduct a preliminary investigation of the effects of loci strongly and consistently
      associated in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and validation studies of
      childhood/adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
      autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases on the risk of NHL (lymphoblastic and Burkitt
      lymphomas) in children and adolescents.

      OUTLINE:

      DNA samples are analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism and genotyped by fluorogenic
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allelic discrimination (Taqman) assays using the ABI
      Prism 7900HT reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system.
