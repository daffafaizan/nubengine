    
      In the pre-anaesthesia room, after the implementation of classical monitoring with an oxygen
      mask and a peripheral venous catheter, all patients will receive an antibioprophylaxis
      according to SFAR (French Society of Anesthesia & Intensive Care Medecine) recommendations
      and injection of 10 mg of IV dexamethasone.

      The patients will be then randomized in 2 groups:

        -  ITO group (usual technique): IPACK combined to femoral triangle and obturator nerve
           blocks

        -  Quadriblock group (experimental technique): femoral, sciatic, obturator and lateral
           femoral cutaneous nerve blocks.

      An experienced anesthetist will perform ultrasound-guided blocks 30 minutes before surgery
      with ropivacaine 0.3%, total volume of 70 ml.

      In the operating room, general anesthesia will be induced by intravenous ketamine (0.4 mg/kg)
      and propofol (3 mg/kg). Anesthesia will be maintained with propofol.

      Postoperative analgesia protocol :

        -  Multimodal analgesia will be instituted from the end of the surgery by the
           administration of paracetamol (1 g) and ketoprofen (100 mg).

        -  In post-anesthesia care unit (PACU): oxynorm titration if VRS (pain score) >3 according
           to the centre's usual care.

        -  In ward: systematic per os analgesia with paracetamol (1 g, 4 times a day) and ibuprofen
           (400 mg, 3 times a day); oxynorm (10 mg, lockout interval: 4 h) if VRS (pain score) >3.
