      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage IV (Ia) operable disease (Ib)) by
      observer-blinded readings and compared to the prognostic performance of FDG PET/CT and
      prognostic biomarkers as uPAR.

      Furthermore, uPAR PET/CT will be evaluated in a pilot study in patients with malignant
      pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (Study II) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung
      (LCNEC) (Study III) and correlated with immunohistochemical uPAR expression.
