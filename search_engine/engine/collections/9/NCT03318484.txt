      associated with a major decline in functional status and claudication is the most frequent
      symptom. Current claudication therapies are associated with significant limitations.
      Pharmacotherapy cilostazol and supervised exercise are recommended in 2016 AHA/ACC Guideline
      on the management of lower extremity PAD patients with claudication, but cilostazol may not
      achieve an ideal response rate, and supervised exercise efficacy may be limited by
      co-morbidities and medicare reimburse. Furthermore endovascular procedure may not be
      feasible, durable or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.

      The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that SDT improves PWT by inhibiting
      atherosclerotic plaques inflammation in femoropopliteal arteries PAD patients compared to
      optimal medical care (OMC) within 6 month. An estimated 80 eligible patients will be randomly
      divided into tow groups: OMC and SDT combined with OMC. Recruitment will be performed over 6
      months and patients will be followed for 6 months; the anticipated total study duration will
      be 2 years.

      Finally, this trial investigate the safety and efficacy of SDT in PAD patients with
      intermittent claudication and explore new end-points to evaluate therapeutic effects using
      PET-CT imaging as well as traditional endpoints.
