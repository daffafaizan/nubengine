      number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Unfortunately, there has been limited
      advancement in medical treatments for dementia and new cost-effective approaches are needed.
      The utility of self-management has been proven to be of benefit in certain chronic diseases,
      however, very little work has been undertaken regarding self-management in people with
      dementia.The SHAPE self-management group therapy aims to significantly improve self-efficacy
      in people with mild to moderate dementia and to improve key health and mental health
      outcomes, carer stress and knowledge of dementia.SHAPE comprises a 10 week course delivered
      as group sessions for the participants with dementia. The sessions are designed to develop
      self-management skills and to provide information on the disease process and the development
      of healthy behaviours in a supportive learning environment to prevent problems that are
      common in the later stages of the disease. E-learning resources will be provided for carers
      (study supporters) which covers the similar and complimentary material discussed in the group
      sessions for the participant with dementia.

      This trial uses 2:1 randomisation and will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of
      SHAPE. Participants will be randomised to participate in the SHAPE intervention or continue
      with usual care. To assess the effectiveness of SHAPE at improving self-efficacy and
      secondary outcomes a battery of questionnaires will be administered to the participants and
      study supporters at baseline, 3 months after randomisationÍ¾ after SHAPE participants have
      completed the intervention, and 9 months after randomisation. The answers to these
      questionnaires will be assessed and the results compared between the two groups of
      participants.
