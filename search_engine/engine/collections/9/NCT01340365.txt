      function, and adaptive capacity of multiple physiological systems in older healthy adults.
      Specific Aim #2: To determine the relationships between biomarkers of physiological
      complexity, conventional measures of function and adaptive capacity. Statistical regression
      models will be used to determine relationships, both at baseline and overtime, between a)
      complexity biomarkers and measures of physical and cognitive function, and b) complexity
      biomarkers and adaptive capacity. Elucidating these relationships will further inform the
      interpretation of complexity biomarkers and provide insights into underlying component
      mechanisms contributing to complex physiological dynamics.
