      I. To test, in a randomized controlled trial, the ability of the enhanced lymphedema (LE)
      detection program (ELED) versus arm circumference alone to detect early/reversible LE.

      II. To compare the severity of LE in terms of changes in arm circumference at the site of
      greatest difference and L-Dex change, between the two detection modalities.

      III. To assess the agreement between patients' self-report of swelling (mild, moderation and
      severe) and the extent of circumferential measurement/bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS)
      difference.

      IV. To compare the percentage of subjects with complete resolution of signs and symptoms of
      LE following treatment with a compression garment between the enhanced vs. standard detection
      groups.

      V. To determine compliance with LE preventive care and treatment.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms: those undergo arm circumference measurement only and
      those undergoing undergo arm circumference measurement and bioimpedance spectroscopy.
      Measurements taken at 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, and 34 months.

      In both arms, if lymphedema is diagnosed, patients are given a compression garment to wear
      daily for 6 weeks. If lymphedema does not improve after 6 weeks, patients undergo complete
      decongestive therapy over approximately 1 hour three times a week. Patients complete remedial
      exercises comprising active, repetitive range of motion of the involved extremity and light
      aerobic conditioning until extremity volume stabilizes or improves. Patients are also
      instructed to perform exercises at home.

      After completion of study, patients diagnosed with lymphedema are followed up for 1 year.
