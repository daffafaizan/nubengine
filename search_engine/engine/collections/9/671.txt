effects of adrenalectomy onthe parathyroids in nephrectomized ratsrat parathyroids were studied both after nephrectomy and after com-bined nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.  as early as 24 hours afternephrectomy there were morphological indications of increased para-thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlargedcell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy andadrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higherthan after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenalscould induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of theparathyroids.
