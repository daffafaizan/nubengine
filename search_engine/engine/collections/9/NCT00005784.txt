    
      This 'Evaluation and Treatment Protocol' will allow the retinal specialists at the NEI to
      identify, follow and provide "standard of care" treatment to patients with various retinal
      diseases. A primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with
      retinal diseases for possible participation in new clinical trials and epidemiological
      protocols. Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of retinal
      diseases, the retinal specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research hypotheses
      about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The availability of
      cohorts of patients with a spectrum of retinal diseases will be valuable for the training of
      retinal fellows, an important mission of the NEI. The ability to provide long-term follow-up
      and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols.

      The retinal specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those retinal
      diseases that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in
      the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.
      Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of
      care for each retinal disease.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be
      entirely voluntary. No more than 150 patients will be accepted in this "Evaluation and
      Treatment Protocol."
