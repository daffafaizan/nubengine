    
      Subjects will be healthy volunteers who are recruited by word of mouth. At their office visit
      with the Nurse Practitioner (NP), the subject's history and medication list will be reviewed.

      The NP will randomize subjects into groups: one group with the PTNS on the right and sham on
      the left; the other group with the PTNS on the left and sham on the right. There will be a
      maximum of 30 subjects tested, and up to 50 people screened. The subjects will have 1 session
      for the testing of the PTNS vs sham that will include 15 minutes of stimulation as noted
      below. All participants will be blinded to the therapy they receive as described below.
