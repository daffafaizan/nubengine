      conventional, targeted lead placement for BurstDR™ during the trial evaluation period with
      the St Jude Medical™ Invisible Trial System. Subjects will be blinded to treatment group and
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio as follows:

      Group 1 (AB): anatomic lead placement followed by BurstDR™ stimulation during an initial
      trial evaluation period Group 2 (TB): targeted lead placement followed by BurstDR™
      stimulation during an initial trial evaluation period

      If the subject qualifies for permanent system implant according to pre-defined criteria after
      the initial trial evaluation period, the subject will exit the clinical investigation and
      continue their treatment per the physician's standard of care. Subjects who do not qualify
      for permanent system implant according to pre-defined criteria after the initial trial
      evaluation period may participate in an extended trial evaluation period, per physician
      discretion, during which they will be programmed with tonic stimulation. Subjects continuing
      to an extended trial evaluation period will be followed through the completion of the
      extended trial period. At the end of the extended trial evaluation period, subjects will exit
      the clinical investigation.
