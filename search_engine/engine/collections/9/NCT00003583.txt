      etoposide, and radiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. II.
      Evaluate the response rate to this combination by these patients. III. Evaluate the overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV
      daily on days 1-3. This course is repeated every 3 weeks for a total for 4 courses. Patients
      also receive concurrent radiotherapy 5 days per week for 5.5 weeks starting with the first
      course of chemotherapy. Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes 15-30 minutes prior to
      each dose of chemotherapy on days 1-3. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks, then every 3
      months for 9 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20 patients accrued into this study.
