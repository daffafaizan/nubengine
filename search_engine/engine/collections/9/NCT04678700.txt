      together with the measures of social isolation, has contributed to act from a new therapeutic
      paradigm with the implementation of telematic rehabilitation programs.

      On April 6, 2020 the online platform was born under the name "Respiratory Physiotherapy;
      telematic assistance in patients with COVID-19 sequelae".

      We want to quantify the Chest Physiotherapy online program.

      Hypothesis; An online respiratory physiotherapy program offers improvements in quality of
      life, dyspnea and anxiety to patients who have suffered COVID-19.

      Objectives; General objective; To improve the pulmonary function of patients who have
      suffered from COVID-19 infection through an online respiratory physiotherapy program.

      Secondary objectives;

        -  To improve the sensation of dyspnea; quantified by the Malher and Borg scale

        -  To Normalize Breathing Rate

        -  To Improve oxigenation; pulse-oximetry

        -  To Improve the quality of life; quantified Euroqol- 5D

        -  To Improve the feeling of anxiety; quantified by the STAI questionnaire

      METHODOLOGY/STUDY DESIGN; This is a program that was born under a very special need and
      circumstance, as is the coronavirus pandemic. The aim was to use respiratory
      tele-rehabilitation through an online platform with patients affected by coronavirus.

      The study is voluntary, the patient can stop the program at any time he or she considers
      appropriate. All of this is informed in the consent form that you give us, duly signed.
