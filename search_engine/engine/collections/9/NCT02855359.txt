      plus RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or
      denintuzumab mafodotin plus RCHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone)
      to assess the safety of these 2 combination regimens. Part B of the study is designed to
      evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of denintuzumab mafodotin in combination with
      either RCHOP or RCHP (Experimental Arm) compared with RCHOP alone (Comparator Arm).
