      Tinnitus that persisted more than six months without improvement can be called chronic
      tinnitus. One report proposed the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. In addition, tinnitus
      patients suffered from insomnia, irritability, anxiety and/or depression.

      Current management of tinnitus is a drug-based treatment and/or nutritional supplementation.
      Music therapy, hearing aid therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), were also applied
      for patients with tinnitus. Even though, success rates of various tinnitus treatments were
      still unsatisfactory till now.

      This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Yoga on the tinnitus handicap and sleep
      quality in humans. We selected adult participates with chronic tinnitus (>6 months). All
      participates performed Yoga exercise once per week at outpatient department under the
      guidance of a professional teacher, and performed once daily by themselves at home for 12
      weeks. Questionnaires of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were
      measured before the start of this study, at the end of this study, and 1 month after the end
      of this study.
