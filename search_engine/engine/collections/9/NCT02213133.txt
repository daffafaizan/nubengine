    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study of the SINE selinexor given
      orally to patients diagnosed with advanced SCC of the head and neck, lung, or esophagus who
      have experienced relapse and/or metastasis following multiple prior chemotherapy treatments
      (<2 lines of therapy).

      Patients will receive fixed doses of selinexor tablets twice weekly in 28-day cycles.
      Patients may continue from one cycle to the next without interruption as along as all
      criteria are met and no reason for discontinuation occurs.
