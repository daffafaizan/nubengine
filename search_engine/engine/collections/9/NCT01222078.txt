      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of re-dosing at 6 months with an 8 consecutive day
      series of otelixizumab intravenous (IV) infusions in 8 adult subjects with newly diagnosed
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although it is hoped that the Î² cell preserving effect of
      otelixizumab will be long-lasting, it is possible that the effect may decline over time and
      thus T1DM subjects may require re-treatment. Six months is the minimum time expected between
      treatments.

      After baseline assessments, eligible subjects will receive 8 consecutive days of otelixizumab
      infusions, each given over a 30 minute period. Prophylaxis for cytokine release syndrome AEs
      will be given. At Month 6, following a review of any new medical conditions, concomitant
      medications, lymphocyte count, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) viral load and other re-dosing
      eligibility criteria, subjects will be re-treated with the same dosing regimen. Subjects will
      be followed for 24 months in this study.
