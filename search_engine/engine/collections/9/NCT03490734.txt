      specificity and persistence of neurobehavioral adaptions that occur in the initial period of
      repeated consumption of a branded sugar sweetened beverage (SSB). Half of Americans consume
      SSBs on any given day.

      Regular SSB intake is considered a contributing factor to excess energy intake, weight gain,
      and obesity, which impacts 70% of Americans. A contributing factor to repeated SSB
      consumption is sugar intake causes the release of dopamine (DA) and opioids in the striatum,
      providing positive reinforcement. As such, multiple brain-based models of food reward-driven
      obesity have been proposed, largely focusing on the striatum and executive functioning. These
      brain-based models of obesity have elucidated risk factors for overconsumption of high-sugar
      foods; however, data supporting these competing models rely heavily on observational studies
      in small samples.

      Importantly, previous reports from the investigators lab and others directly implicate eating
      behavior patterns as a vital contributor to aberrant neurobehavioral responses to food
      stimuli. However, without experimental evidence, there are fundamental gaps in the
      investigators knowledge about the neurobehavioral adaptations that occur as an individual
      begins to regularly consume a SSB prior to weight change.

      As observational data suggest, it is also crucial to examine individual difference factors
      that may exacerbate or protect against adaptations associated with regular SSB intake, as
      well as whether these adaptions are specific.
