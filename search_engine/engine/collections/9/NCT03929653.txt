      standard treatment options have a very poor prognosis. In recent years, the application of s
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has rapidly expanded the breadth and depth of understanding
      of the molecular mechanism of tumors, laying a foundation for the development of precision
      medicine for tumors. Researchers can build a molecular phenotype of advanced refractory solid
      tumors by NGS. Some retrospective study shows that Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) therapy model
      brings therapeutic hope. So, investigators hope that this therapy model combined with NGS may
      provide treatment recommendations for advanced refractory solid tumors patients. Those
      recommendations may include some off-label targeted therapies. This study seeks to evaluate
      the clinical value of the personalized therapy model with the guidance of MTB after NGS, and
      to track patient outcomes, including ORR (Objective Response Rate), PFS (Progression Free
      Survival), OS (Overall Survival) and ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction).
