      (80% versus 30%) reduces the risk of a composite of surgical sites infection and potentially
      oxygen-related wound complications. Secondarily, the investigators will assess the
      incremental cost benefit of 80% versus 30% oxygen. As a safety measure, enough oxygen will
      always be given to maintain oxygen saturation (as determined by pulse oximetry) â‰¥95%.
