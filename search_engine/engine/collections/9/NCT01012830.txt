      potent reversible acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor with additional unique properties
      including NMDA-receptor antagonist properties, neuroprotective and antioxidant effects. In
      animal studies, HupA was shown to possess greater inhibitory, longer-lasting, and more
      selective effects on AChE activity than donepezil. In clinical studies HupA improved memory,
      mood, and activities of daily living in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Adverse effects
      have been reported at a very low rate in all the clinical trials, and are mainly cholinergic,
      such as dizziness, nausea, gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches and depressed heart rate.
      Thus, HupA is an attractive option which may have beneficial effects not only on cognitive
      but also functional domains of schizophrenia.
