      angiography will be selected from the Norwegian Registry of Invasive Cardiology (NORIC). This
      is a national quality control registry run and controlled by the Norwegian Institute of
      Public Health (www.fhi.no). All CT coronary angiograms will be reanalyzed using advanced
      post-processing analysis software to assess coronary artery plaque burden, distribution and
      composition. Through linking with the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cause
      of Death Registry (www.fhi.no) we will be able to assess the association between long-term
      prognosis (5 years) and coronary artery plaque features.
