      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL
      and B-PLL.

      II. To define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL
      and B-PLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.

      III. To determine the feasibility of measuring pharmacodynamic markers of 17-DMAG including
      the Hsp90 client proteins Akt and IKK-alpha/IKK-beta.

      IV. To determine if FoxD3 and downstream genes such as EPHA7 and ID4 are re-expressed in CLL
      cells following treatment with 17-DMAG.

      V. To correlate pharmacokinetic features of 17-DMAG with response, toxicity and
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      VI. To correlate risk parameters such as ZAP-70 with response to 17-DMAG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
