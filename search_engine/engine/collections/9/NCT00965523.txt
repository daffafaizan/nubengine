    
      Study 224 (Extension Period) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of E7389 by
      collecting data from subjects who continued receiving E7389 after being transferred from
      Study 221 (Core Period). Thus, efficacy analyses performed in Study 221 were updated and
      reported with the additional data collected in Study 224. Objective response rate (ORR) and
      the number of subjects with adverse events are reported as outcome measures because these
      were the outcome measures of Study 221 which is a main study in the combined data. Also,
      safety analyses performed in Study 221 were updated and reported with the additional data
      collected in Study 224.
