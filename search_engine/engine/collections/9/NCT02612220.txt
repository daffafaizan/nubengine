      preoperative imaging, surgical technique, and perioperative management have markedly improved
      outcomes and extended the indications for hepatic resection within the past three decades.
      However, liver resection remains associated with substantial morbidity and mortality of up to
      60% and 10%, respectively. The outcome of patients undergoing hepatic resection is closely
      linked to the amount of intraoperative blood loss. Hemorrhage from the resection surface
      contributes significantly to the amount of blood loss. In addition, bile leakage from the
      resection surface presents a persistent clinical challenge. In fact, bile leakage remains the
      most frequent complication after hepatic resection with an incidence of 5 - 25%. Various
      topical agents have so far been suggested to facilitate hemostasis with the ultimate aim to
      improve perioperative outcome. However, none of these agents has so far gained wide
      acceptance, possibly due to their impractical method of application. Furthermore, these
      'hemostatic agents' have been primarily designed to improve hemostasis and showed no effect
      on perioperative complications and in particular the incidence of bile leakage.

      The present randomized controlled trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of BioFoam®
      Surgical Matrix in patients undergoing elective liver resection. In contrast to other topical
      agents, the surgical adhesive BioFoam® Surgical Matrix may not only accelerate hemostasis but
      also facilitate sealing of bile ducts and thus has the potential to reduce the incidence of
      postoperative complications.
