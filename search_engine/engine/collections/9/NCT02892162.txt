      treatment for patients suffering from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), use of catheter
      ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PerAF) remains controversial due to
      unsatisfactory long-term success rates (15% - 28.4%).

      The investigators' study indicated that the upper area of the left atrium (LA) plays an
      important role in PerAF, with the LA roof and mitral isthmus appearing to serve as main
      substrate in progression from PAF to PerAF and maintenance of fibrillatory activities. The
      investigators therefore hypothesized that AF should not be initiated or sustained if the
      latter crucial regions for AF maintenance are abolished. This was confirmed using a stepwise
      pure linear ablation protocol, consisting of a line across the LA roof and extending along
      the anterior wall of pulmonary veins (PV) antrum to mitral valve annulus (MVA) without PV
      isolation; the approach appeared safe and effective with long-term (5.2 years) follow-up
      success rate of 40% for PerAF.

      This study will evaluate efficacy and safety of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation
      (CPVI) + LA roof linear ablation + LA anterior wall (LAAW) linear ablation combined with high
      density mapping and contact force sensing techniques for perAF. This study is expected to
      provide a practical and guided catheter ablation strategy with maximized safety and efficacy
      through use of contact force sensing technique, which will be accepted by other qualified
      electrophysiology laboratories.
