      I. To determine maximally tolerated dose of brentuximab vedotin that can be combined with
      ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To gain a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the above regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of the above regimen.

      II. To determine the ability to proceed to peripheral blood stem cell collection following
      the above regimen (the impact of above regimen on stem cell reserve).

      III. To assess the impact of this regimen on biomarkers from the microenvironment in Hodgkin
      lymphoma tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8;
      ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2; and etoposide IV over 1
      hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients planning to go on to consolidative high-dose
      therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may undergo peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) mobilization following the 2nd course of study therapy at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
