      intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3 year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) endpoint.
      Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) upon the
      presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant DME) as noted by OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography)
      imaging and examination. In addition, subjects who meet the re-treatment criteria will be
      eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days.
