      improving functional regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added
      effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).

      Objective - This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program
      (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with sub-acute stroke.

      Methods - Seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to the self-regulated
      constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT; n=25), constraint-induced movement therapy
      (CIMT; n=27) or conventional functional rehabilitation (control; n=24) groups, and completed
      the trial.

      The SR-CIMT intervention was two-week therapist-guided training using the SR strategy to
      reflect on the relearning of functional tasks with CIMT. Outcome measurements were for upper
      limb function (Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, FMA), daily task
      performance (Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Lawton IADL) and
      self-perceived functional ability (Motor Activity Log, MAL) at pre and post intervention
      intervals, and at one month follow up.
