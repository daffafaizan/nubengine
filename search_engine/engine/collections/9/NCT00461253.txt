    
      This is a community-based case-control study in Germany and Finland. Cases will be identified
      from cancer registries, tumor centers and breast centers. Matched controls will be accrued
      from the same region as the case came from. Breast cancer cases and their controls are women
      under 50 years of age without known history of malignancies.

      Cases are women with a breast cancer who are younger than 50 years of age at cancer
      diagnosis. The breast cancer was diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2007. Only alive
      cases and cases in a sufficiently good health status to be interviewed are eligible for the
      study.

      Controls are women without a breast cancer diagnosis who are younger than 50 years of age at
      the time of the interview. About 3 controls matched by year of birth and region will be
      allocated to each case.

      A standardized questionnaire will be used for all breast cancer cases and controls. The
      questionnaire will be mailed to cases and controls.

      Study participants will be asked for their informed consent. Data confidentiality according
      to national laws will be ensured by the field organizations.
