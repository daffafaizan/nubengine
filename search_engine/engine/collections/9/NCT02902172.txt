      will be randomized to either Ibuprofen use or acetaminophen use during the postpartum period.
      Standard blood pressure monitoring in the postpartum period will be followed to help
      determine if there is a significant rise in the women who use NSAIDS in the postpartum period
      versus those that use acetaminophen.

      Groups will be divided into women with chronic hypertension, women with chronic hypertension
      with superimposed preeclampsia, women with preeclampsia without severe features, women with
      preeclampsia with severe features, women with gestational hypertension without severe range
      blood pressures, and women with gestational hypertension with severe range blood pressures.

      Recruitment will last 36 months. Patients will be monitored during their postpartum stay
      (typical 2 days) with blood pressure measurements. An additional 12 months will be needed for
      data analysis and publication.
