      cardiovascular disease with increased disease-associated mortality has led to the hypothesis
      that the endothelial status of these women is characterized by early onset of aging. We want
      to investigate the relationship between endothelial aging and pregnancy disorders such as
      pre-eclampsia, which are dominated by endothelial dysfunction. Do endothelial changes precede
      pregnancy and cause pre-eclampsia and later accelerated cardiovascular aging, or does
      pre-eclampsia trigger premature endothelial aging in affected individuals for the first time?
      The aim of this study is to investigate the cardiovascular health of women 10 to 20 years
      after pre-eclampsia and to compare it with that of women with uneventful pregnancies. In
      addition, the potential long-term endothelial protective effect of the NO-donor
      pentaerytrithyltetranitrate (PETN) is investigated.

      This in vivo study will be extended in vitro by the analysis of senescence induction in
      endothelial cells after pre-eclampsia associated stress. Additionally, the potential
      protective effect of PETN on stress-induced senescence will be evaluated.

      The ultimate goal is to establish a prospective long-term study on the effect of PETN on
      vascular health in women with pre-eclampsia to assess whether treatment of en-dothelial
      dysfunction during pregnancy could reduce endothelial aging and thus premature cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality in millions of women.
