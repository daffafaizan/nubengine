    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of phenoxodiol combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel
           in patients with recurrent late-stage ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
           peritoneal cancer that is refractory or resistant to platinum and/or taxane drugs.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms according to medical history.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive phenoxodiol IV over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2 and cisplatin IV
           over 1 hour on day 2.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive phenoxodiol as in arm I and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks or at the end of study participation.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
