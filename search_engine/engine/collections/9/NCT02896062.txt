      participants is developed. The program is comprised of four different sessions and is
      provided to member of the German armed forces. One session lasts approximately 1.5 hours and
      sessions are applied on a weekly basis. Each session deals with a different topic, addressing
      all major categories of sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disorders,
      sleep-related breathing disorders) and teaching ways of self-help and information on when to
      seek medical treatment. The program is evaluated by a cross-over study design with treatment
      and waiting control groups. After the treatment group has finished the course, the waiting
      group attends the sleep coaching session. All subjects fill in sleep logs and several
      questionnaires prior to (t0) and after the treatment group has finished the sleep coaching
      (t1), after the waiting group has finished the course (t2), and in a 3-month follow-up
      session (t3). Furthermore, sleep is recorded according to the AASM-standard criteria for two
      consecutive nights each at the time-points t0, t1, and t2. Subjective and objective sleep
      quality will be compared across the time-points, and between groups. In total, at least 48
      participants are included in study.
