      waiting for a renal transplantation usually undergo an extensive diagnostic procedure to
      avoid complications after transplantation such as neoplasia or inflammation. In the past
      years, cardiovascular complications before and after renal transplantation have gained more
      attention. We therefore have changed our standard diagnostic procedure before renal
      transplantation and perform stress echocardiography and myocardial scintigraphy. Thus we
      would like to evaluate our new standard diagnostic procedure and observe the results of these
      diagnostic procedures as well as their impact on clinical outcome.
