      DVD, called the PREPARED materials) to help patients with chronic kidney disease make early,
      shared, and informed decisions about kidney replacement therapy. Half of the participants
      will receive the PREPARED materials and half will receive usual care from their doctors.
      PREPARED materials feature patients and their families discussing the pros and cons of
      different treatment options for kidney failure. The investigators will randomly assign
      patients already under the care of a nephrologist to receive the video and book or to receive
      their usual nephrology care. They will measure the degree to which patients in either study
      arm are prepared for kidney failure treatment at follow up.
