      amplification (PMCA) technology that detects minute amounts of αSyn aggregates circulating in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a novel assay with high sensitivity and specificity for the
      early diagnosis of PD. To achieve this goal, we will apply the PMCA to detect the αSyn
      aggregates in the CSF samples acquired from a discovery cohort that consist of
      well-characterized early PD patients (disease duration ≤1 year and Hoehn and Yahr Stage I,
      and DAT-PET and FDG-PET meet the imaging features of PD, n=75) and gender, age-matched
      healthy controls (n=38). Furthermore, we will confirm the findings in a separate confirmatory
      cohort with well-characterized early PD patients (disease duration ≤1 year and Hoehn and Yahr
      Stage I, and DAT-PET and FDG-PET meet the imaging features of PD, n=75), early multiple
      system atrophy (MSA) patients (disease duration ≤1 year, n=38), early progressive
      supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients (disease duration ≤1 year, n=38) and age-matched healthy
      controls (n=38). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
      value, and area under curve of the PMCA for the early diagnosis of PD will be calculated in
      the discovery cohort and be confirmed in the confirmatory cohort, respectively. In addition,
      the clinical characteristics, including motor and nonmotor symptoms of early PD, MSA and PSP
      patients in the two cohort will be comprehensively assessed at baseline and during
      followed-up. To assess the value of the PMCA technology in the evaluation of the disease
      severity and progress, we will perform the partial correlation analysis between clinical
      features of early PD patients and the PMCA T50 defined as the time needed to reach 50% of the
      maximum aggregation.

      Misfolded αSyn aggregates have the potential to serve as a biomarker for early PD. The PMCA
      technology could detect small quantities of misfolded αSyn aggregates by taking advantage of
      their ability to nucleate further aggregation, enabling a very high amplification of the
      signal. This study examines the effectiveness of using the PMCA as a novel technique for
      discriminating early PD from gender, age-matched healthy controls and other early
      parkinsonian disorders (MSA, PSP) by detecting small misfolded αSyn aggregates in CSF.
