      doses provides clinical results comparable to conventional ovarian stimulation regimens, but
      also it results in greater treatment safety by significantly reducing the percentage of
      patients with responses extreme ovaries, and cycle cancellations. These studies have been
      carried out with the premise that an optimal ovarian response results in obtaining 8-14
      oocytes per puncture. Although it has also been shown that larger numbers of oocytes do not
      increase clinical variables such as implantation rates or live newborn per cycle, it is
      possible that these numbers of oocytes are insufficient in specific circumstances, for
      example, patients with a desire to have more pregnancy, patients undergoing IVF cycles with
      PGT-A, or gamete donors. For these reasons, and thanks to the improvements in
      cryopreservation programs and the induction of oocyte maturation with GnRH agonists, it is
      necessary to design protocols for the individualization of doses of medication aimed at
      obtaining greater quantities of oocytes. The objective of this pilot study is the evaluation
      of higher doses of Rekovelle (follitropin delta) aimed at obtaining 17 oocytes in voluntary
      donors.
