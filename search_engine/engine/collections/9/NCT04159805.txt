    
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies, such as those
      targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle specific kinase (MuSK),
      interfere with neuromuscular transmission, resulting in fatigue and weakness.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to treat
      people who have generalized myasthenia gravis.
