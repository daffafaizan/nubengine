      visited the urogynecological department of a medical center for urodynamic evaluation were
      reviewed. Those women who have no complete data of maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume,
      post-void residual volume (PVR) and detrusor pressure at a maximum flow rate (PdetQmax) were
      excluded from this study. Besides, women with cystocele were also excluded. The DU was
      defined when the PdetQmax was less than 20 cmH2O, the Qmax was less than 15 mL/s, and the
      bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) was less than 90 %. The BOO was defined when the PdetQmax
      was not less than 40 cmH2O, and the Qmax was less than 12 mL/s. BVE = voided volume / (voided
      volume+ PVR) x 100%. Those women without DU or BOO were allocated to the non-DU/BOO group.

      STATA software was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction or
      chi-square test was used for statistical analysis as appropriate. Linear regression analysis
      with age adjustment was used to assess the adjusted effect of variables. P < 0.05 was
      considered as statistical significant.
