      with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is determined. PD 0332991 will be
      given orally, starting on Day 1 of each cycle, once a day for 12 days followed by 9 days
      without treatment. Bortezomib will be given by intravenous (IV) bolus or subcutaneously
      (taking 3 to 5 seconds to administer) on days 8, 11, 15 and 18. For dose levels 3a and 4b,
      bortezomib will be administered only on days 15 and 18. One cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21
      days). Subjects will remain on treatment until they meet criteria for withdrawal from
      treatment described in section 5.4 (e.g., DLT, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent).

      The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if applicable), drug preparation, and
      dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers, patients' height, body weight, and body
      surface area, and total drug administered in milliliters and milligrams. Any discrepancy
      between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must be
      recorded in the source documents.

      Treatment will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the
      investigator or identified sub-investigator (s). Treatment will be administered on an
      outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.
      Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6. No investigational or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's malignancy.
