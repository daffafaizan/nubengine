      Participants will be sent home with a tACS device to be used at-home for five days while
      engaged in a multitasking paradigm that is different from the multitasking outcome measure
      used pre/post tACS. After the at-home stimulation is complete, participants return to UCSF
      for a final in-lab assessment of multitasking and sustained attention ability.
