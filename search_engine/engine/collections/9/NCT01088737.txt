      cm of treatment margins to each side of the original scar of the LM or LMM excision. Time
      period between removal of stitches and first administration of imiquimod should be 4 weeks,
      correspondent to approximate 6 weeks post surgery. Imiquimod cream is applied once daily.
      Each patient will begin with the application 3x/week. After two weeks of treatment the
      inflammation response to imiquimod will be assessed. If no or only minor inflammation is
      detectable in the treatment area, the dosing schedule will be increased to 5x/week. After
      four weeks of treatment the inflammation response will be assessed again. If still no or only
      minor inflammation is detectable, application will be extended to daily use. An interruption
      of the treatment with imiquimod cream is considered if severe local inflammatory reaction
      occurs, severe systemic reactions are apparent or if super-infection is observed at the
      treatment area. The primary objective of the study is to investigate the potential of
      imiquimod 5% cream to eliminate possible subclinical lesions of LM that resides after
      surgical excision by determining the long-term recurrence rates. Secondary objectives of the
      study describe the incidence of subclinical residual lesions and local skin reactions.
