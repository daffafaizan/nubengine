      I. To evaluate the safety of linear energy transfer (LET) optimized image modulated proton
      therapy (IMPT) (bio-IMPT) for pediatric patients with ependymoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize advanced multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to identify imaging
      biomarkers of structural and biological changes after proton therapy in pediatric ependymoma
      patients.

      II. To compare quantitative image biomarkers in patients treated with bio-IMPT and standard
      proton therapy using a voxel level analysis.

      III. To test and evaluate the validity of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) models and
      enhance their precision based on prospectively collected clinical image biomarkers.

      IV. To evaluate acute and late toxicities, including pseudoprogression and symptom burden, in
      patients treated with bio-IMPT.

      V. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). VI. To evaluate
      disease outcomes following the use of a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for pediatric
      ependymoma patients with gross residual disease following surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive LET optimized IMPT for up to 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, then every 3 months
      for up to 24 months.
