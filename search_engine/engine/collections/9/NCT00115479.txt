      care reduced morbidity and mortality of surgical intensive care patients. Whether this
      intervention also improves prognosis of medical intensive care patients remains unknown. The
      current prospective, randomized, controlled study will assess the impact of intensive insulin
      therapy on the outcome of patients in a medical intensive care unit. On admission, patients
      will be randomly assigned to either strict normalization of blood glucose (80-110 mg/dl) with
      intensive insulin therapy or the conventional approach, in which insulin infusion is
      initiated only when blood glucose exceeds 215 mg/dl, to maintain blood glucose levels between
      180 and 200 mg/dl.
