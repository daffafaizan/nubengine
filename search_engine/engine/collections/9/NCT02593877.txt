      deaths resulting from uncontrolled bleeding. 1 in 4 of all severely injured and shocked
      patients develop a clotting abnormality termed Trauma Induced Coagulopathy (TIC) within
      minutes of injury, which causes blood to continue being lost from the body faster than it can
      be stemmed. Many more injured patients will go on to develop different types of coagulopathy
      at different times during the course of their treatment, either as a result of their body's
      ongoing response to trauma or as a consequence of their clinical care. Ultimately
      coagulopathic patients have increased blood transfusion requirements and suffer more adverse
      outcomes (e.g. multi organ failure).

      Current management of coagulopathic, haemorrhaging trauma patients comprises the unguided
      transfusion of large volumes of red blood cells and clotting product supplements. Without
      rapidly available and validated diagnostics, products are delivered empirically to patients
      blind to the type and severity of TIC they may have or indeed even if they do not have TIC.
      This study will compare outcomes of viscoelastic haemostatic assay (VHA)-guided resuscitation
      versus conventional management of critically bleeding trauma patients. The hypothesis is that
      goal-directed haemostatic resuscitation of coagulopathic bleeding trauma patients will yield
      improved outcomes and reduced blood product demand, compared to empiric massive transfusion
      therapy.
