      for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Reducing delay would reduce mortality and morbidity but to
      date, interventions to change behaviour have had mixed results. Systematic inclusion of
      behaviour-change techniques (BCTs) or a visual mode of delivery might improve the efficacy of
      interventions.

      Aim To evaluate the efficacy of a BCT-based intervention and to compare two possible modes of
      delivery (text+visual and text-only).

      Design A 3-arm web-based, parallel randomised, controlled trial of a theory-based
      intervention.

      Methods and analysis The intervention comprises 12 BCTs systematically identified following
      systematic review and a consensus exercise undertaken with behaviour change experts. We aim
      to recruit n=177 participants who have experienced ACS in the previous 6 months from a local
      National Health Service (NHS) Teaching Hospital. Participants will be identified by Cardiac
      Rehabilitation staff and invited by letter to take part in the study. Those who wish to take
      part will be asked to access the experiment at a secure web-address and consent re-checked.
      Consenting participants will be randomly allocated in equal numbers to one of three study
      groups: i) usual care ii) usual care plus text-only BCT-based intervention or iii) usual care
      plus text+visual BCT-based intervention. The outcome variable will be the change in intention
      to phone an ambulance immediately with symptoms of ACS â‰¥15 minutes duration assessed using
      two randomised series of 8 scenarios representing varied symptoms before and after delivery
      of the interventions or control condition (usual care).
