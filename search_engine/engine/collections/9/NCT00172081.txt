    
      Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a polypeptide consisting of 84 amino acids that is synthesized and
      secreted by the parathyroid glands, is a principal regulator of calcium homeostasis through
      concerted action on kidney, intestine and bone. Parathyroid hormone exerts its action on bone
      to release calcium into the extracellular fluid as a process of bone remodeling and also to
      maintain the serum calcium concentration, but the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.
      In some circumstances, PTH may exert an anabolic action on bone and can stimulate osteoblast
      proliferation and mature osteoblast function. The net effect of exogenous PTH administration
      on bone turnover depends on the pattern of delivery. A continuous long-term infusion gives a
      net decrease in trabecular bone volume, whereas daily single injections result in a net
      increase.

      NPS Allelix Corp. is developing ALX1-11, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84), for
      the treatment of osteoporosis. ALX1-11 is identical to the endogenous intact 84 amino acid
      human hormone and will be self-administered on a daily basis by subcutaneous (sc) injection.

      Currently, there is no approved therapy for osteoporosis capable of stimulating the formation
      of new bone of normal composition and structure. Most therapies in development are
      anti-catabolic and only prevent further bone loss (e.g., estrogen replacement,
      bisphosphonates, and calcitonins). ALX1-11 has the potential to stimulate new bone formation
      in osteoporotic patients, thereby increasing bone mass and preventing fractures. Patients
      with moderately or severely reduced bone density and a fracture would be expected to benefit
      from treatment, thereby improving functional status and alleviating symptoms.
