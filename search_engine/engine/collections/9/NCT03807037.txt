      management of postoperative AF. However, these are subject to a number of limitations
      including treatment failure, toxicity and pro-arrhythmogenicity. Hence, efforts have been
      made to develop alternative preventive strategies. The understanding of the role of oxidative
      stress as a mechanism for AF development has made way for antioxidant vitamins as novel
      therapeutic and preventive agents.

      In view of emerging evidence on the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory role in the incidence of AF
      and established inhibitory properties of tocotrienols, we postulate that supplementation with
      tocotrienols may exert therapeutic advantage in the safety endpoints of post-CABG. The
      modulation of oxidative stress status and anti-inflammatory via HMG-CoA reductase inhibition
      may work synergistically in affecting the incidence of AF post-CABG.
