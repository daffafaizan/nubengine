           -The endoscopic examinations will each be analyzed by a different endoscopist working in
           a blinded evaluation. An UC activity score will be calculated depending on two scores:
           MAYO and UCEIS.

        -  Notification of Adverse Event (AE) / Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

      Follow-up visit: W12 (12 weeks ± 5 days after D0)
