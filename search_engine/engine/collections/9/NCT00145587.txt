    
      The primary objective of this trial will be answered strictly by those patients enrolled who
      receive a haploidentical stem cell donor graft.

      Patients with a matched sibling donor will be offered participation in this clinical trial
      and will receive a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by the infusion of an
      unmanipulated bone marrow graft. However, data from these transplant recipients will be
      reported in a descriptive manner only.

      Secondary Objectives in this trial include the following:

        -  To describe the outcome of children with MIOP who receive hematopoietic stem cells from
           a matched sibling donor or a haploidentical donor utilizing a uniform approach one year
           from transplant

        -  To estimate the fraction of children with MIOP who have a genetic defect correlating to
           the osteopetrosis phenotype

        -  To assess carrier-state of the genetic mutation in parents with an affected child

        -  To assess carrier-state of the genetic mutation in siblings of affected children

        -  To estimate the effect of age at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on
           the overall outcome of children with MIOP

        -  To describe the kinetics of select cytokine expression before and after transplantation
