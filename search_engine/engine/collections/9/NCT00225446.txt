      spread in the orthopaedic domain, but not in maxillary-facial surgery. The main disadvantages
      of this technique are the necessity to fix a mark on the eyebrow with two transcutaneous
      pins, which is a long and invasive act, and to connect the infrared transmitter which is in
      contact with the patient with the computer in a limited surgery area. In this study, we want
      to show that the new repositioning optic systems are performing similarly to the actual
      validated one, that they permit to suppress the transcutaneous pins and the computer
      connection, and that it reduces the financial cost of this surgery. Neither the surgery
      technique, nor the pre-operative check-up will be modified in the study. The two
      repositioning systems will be used simultaneously during the mandibular osteotomy.
