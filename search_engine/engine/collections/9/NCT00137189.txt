      schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In clinical practice, music therapy is often
      offered to psychiatric patients with low therapy motivation, but little research exists about
      this population. The aim of this study is to examine whether resource-oriented music therapy
      helps psychiatric patients with low therapy motivation to improve negative symptoms and other
      health-related outcomes. An additional aim of the study is to examine the mechanisms of
      change through music therapy.

      Method: 144 adults with a non-organic mental disorder (ICD-10: F1 to F6) who have low therapy
      motivation and a willingness to work with music will be randomly assigned to an experimental
      or a control condition. All participants will receive standard care, and the experimental
      group will in addition be offered biweekly sessions of music therapy over a period of three
      months. Outcomes will be measured by a blind assessor before and 1, 3, and 9 months after
      randomisation.

      Discussion: The findings to be expected from this study will fill an important gap in the
      knowledge of treatment effects for a patient group that does not easily benefit from
      treatment. The study's close link to clinical practice, as well as its size and
      comprehensiveness, will make its results well generalisable to clinical practice.
