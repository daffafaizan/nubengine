      colorectal cancer when treated with cetuximab. II. Determine the safety and toxic effects of
      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression of patients treated with
      this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours weekly for
      6 weeks. Treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.
