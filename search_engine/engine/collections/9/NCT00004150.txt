        -  Compare recurrence-free survival and duration of survival in patients with stage III
           adenocarcinoma of the colon treated with adjuvant high-dose fluorouracil with or without
           leucovorin calcium versus standard fluorouracil with leucovorin calcium following
           curative radical resection.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      regional lymph node involvement (N1 (1-3 pericolic lymph nodes) vs N2 (more than 3 pericolic
      lymph nodes) and participating center.

      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV followed by fluorouracil IV on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours weekly for
           8 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses.

      OR

        -  Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV
           continuously over 24 hours weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 7 weeks for 3
           courses.

      OR

        -  Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV bolus
           and then fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats
           every 2 weeks for 12 courses.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 6 months for 4.5 years, and then annually thereafter
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,600 patients (800 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 3 years.
