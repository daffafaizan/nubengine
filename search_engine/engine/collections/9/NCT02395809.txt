      promising results. However, the technique described is invasive with the need for surgically
      implantable expensive stimulator electrodes.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of posterior tibial nerve stimulation
      (PTN) by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and to compare it to the
      conventional LIS. This non-invasive technique has been proved to be of acceptable results in
      treatment of fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence.
