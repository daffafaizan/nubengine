      multi-stepped turning are common in patients with moderate and advanced Parkinson's disease.
      Compared to appendicular symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity), gait disorders tend
      to be more resistant to medical and regular deep brain stimulation treatment, and greatly
      impairs patients' quality of life and daily living activities. Some stimulation strategies
      have been tried to improve gait in Parkinson's disease patients, but so far most of them
      resulted in concomitant worsening of appendicular symptoms. However, new stimulation
      strategies such as cycling stimulation can potentially improve gait disorders without
      impairment of appendicular symptoms.
