      diagnosis and treatment of GERD is compared to the ordinary clinical pathway consisting of
      the endoscopic/pH-metry approach in patients referred from primary care to GI specialists.

      In Italy, it is a PCP-level, cluster randomized, controlled trial comparing a structured
      clinical pathway versus usual care in patients with GERD. The implementation consists of
      training sessions on the clinical pathway with the selected PCPs (Implementation Group).

      In Sweden, it is a cluster-randomised interventional study performed within daily clinical
      practice for the purpose of assessing the effect of the implementation of the structured
      clinical pathway in patients identified as having GERD. The participating PCCs will be
      randomised (1:1) to implement the structured clinical pathway or handling the patients
      according to local clinical routines.

      In Austria and Spain, it is a cluster-randomized study to be developed within daily clinical
      practice for the purpose of assessing the effect of the implementation of the structured
      clinical pathway on GERD patients . The evaluation study will take place subsequent to a
      prior implementation of a clinical pathway. The implementation consists of a detailed
      explanation by training-materials about the clinical pathway in a selected randomized pool of
      PCCs. The implementation that will be evaluated is outside of the study procedures; it is the
      physician's decision whether to apply it or not.
