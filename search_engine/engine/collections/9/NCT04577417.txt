      disorder in children. Besides core ADHD symptoms (inattentiveness, hyperactivity,
      impulsivity), ADHD also affects the ability to perceive and process sounds. Both
      hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity to loud sounds are common symptoms in ADHD patients.
      With stimulant medication, individuals with ADHD become more tolerant of loud noise than when
      they were non-medicated. It remains unknown exactly how stimulant medication alters the
      loudness perception. The proposed study will use the acoustic reflex to objectively measure
      auditory sensitivity to loud sounds. The aims of this study are to evaluate auditory
      sensitivity in patients with ADHD using acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) and to examine the
      effects of ADHD stimulant medication on ART. Eligible participants will participate in two
      sessions (off-med and on-med conditions) conducted on the same day. ADHD patients will be
      asked to come to the laboratory before taking their ADHD medication. The investigators will
      repeat three tests before and after taking stimulant medication. The investigators will also
      conduct screening tests during and between the first and second sessions. The investigators
      will compare a difference between the two independent groups (ADHD vs. Control) and compare a
      within subject difference between medication conditions (on-med vs. off-med).
