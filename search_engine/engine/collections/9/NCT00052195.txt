      25% of patients with HIV infection in Africa. Unlike pulmonary tuberculosis (pMTB), most
      cases of dMTB are not recognized and death ensues rapidly. Therefore, dMTB may be a more
      important cause of HIV-associated mortality than pMTB in developing countries. Mycobacterium
      vaccae (MV) is an investigational vaccine prepared by heat inactivation of a nontuberculous
      mycobacteria. MV immunization may reduce the risk of HIV-associated dMTB. The purpose of this
      study is to define risk factors for HIV-associated dMTB and to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of an MV vaccine for the prevention of HIV-associated pulmonary and
      disseminated tuberculosis.

      HIV positive patients with prior BCG immunization and HIV negative controls will be entered
      in a 5-year study in Tanzania. Participants will be randomized to receive a 5-dose series of
      MV or placebo over 12 months, with a repeat skin test at Month 14. Baseline evaluation will
      include medical history, chest x-ray, skin tests with purified protein derivative (PPD), and
      blood tests to evaluate interferon-gamma production. Participants with PPD reactions greater
      than or equal to 5 mm will receive 6 months of prophylaxis with isoniazid. Participants will
      be followed every 3 months for 3 to 5 years to assess new pMTB (microbiologic or clinical
      diagnosis) or dMTB (microbiologic diagnosis). Potential risk factors for dMTB will also be
      assessed.
