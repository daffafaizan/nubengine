    
      This is a two arm randomized controlled trial to test the effects of messages communicating
      the risks of indoor tanning delivered via mobile text messaging as a strategy for promoting
      cessation among young adult women who meet screening criteria for indoor tanning addiction.
      Eligible participants are young adult women ages 18 to 30 years who meet screening criteria
      for indoor tanning addiction and have access to the internet and a personal mobile phone to
      complete study procedures. Participants will complete baseline measures and then be
      randomized to the study arms. The text messaging intervention exposure in the intervention
      arm will last for four weeks. The control arm will be given basic indoor tanning education
      information and will not receive any intervention. Follow up assessments capturing study
      outcomes will be administered at 1 month (i.e., immediately post-intervention) and three
      months post-intervention.
