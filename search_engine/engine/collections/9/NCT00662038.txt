    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, extension study for patients with IPF who complete a
      qualifying InterMune clinical trial of pirfenidone. Eligible patients must complete the final
      visit for their qualifying study, have not permanently discontinued study drug in their
      qualifying study, and meet all of the eligibility criteria noted in this protocol.

      Since data from the qualifying study may remain blinded during patient enrollment in
      PIPF-012, all patients will be treated as if they were taking placebo in their qualifying
      study. At the start of PIPF-012 participation, each patient will escalate the dose of
      pirfenidone.

      The duration of treatment for each patient will vary and will continue until pirfenidone is
      commercially or otherwise available in his/her geographic region or the study is terminated
      by the sponsor for reasons outlined in the protocol.
