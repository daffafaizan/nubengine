      The overall aim of the trial is to investigate whether the addition of saracatinib to weekly
      paclitaxel improves efficacy, as measured by progression free survival, compared with
      paclitaxel plus placebo. The trial will also determine toxicity and ascertain whether the
      combination of paclitaxel plus saracatinib should proceed to a phase III trial.

      The toxicity data from Study NCT00610714 (D8180C00015) suggests that a small number of
      patients could experience febrile neutropaenia during their first chemotherapy cycle. To
      combat this, saracatinib (175 mg OD)/matched placebo will begin 1 week prior to commencement
      of chemotherapy, and be given continuously until progression.

      All patients will receive cycles of weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy. One cycle will consist of
      weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest. If there is evidence of
      on-going response after 4 cycles, 3 further cycles of saracatinib/placebo plus weekly
      paclitaxel will be given, unless there is dose-limiting toxicity or the patient requests to
      discontinue treatment. If best response is stable disease after 4 cycles, treatment should be
      discontinued but may continue at the discretion of the Investigator.
