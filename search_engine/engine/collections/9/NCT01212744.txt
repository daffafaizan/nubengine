    
      This 16-week multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability,and efficacy of daily SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. Subjects
      who are naïve to prior treatment with rAvPAL-PEG and who have met the other study eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled at approximately 8 sites in the US and Canada. Up to 6 daily dose
      levels of rAvPAL-PEG are planned and may be assessed during this study (0.06 mg/kg/day, 0.1
      mg/kg/day, 0.2 mg/kg/day;0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day, or 0.8 mg/kg/day). Enrollment will
      begin with the 0.4 mg/kg/day dose level and additional higher or lower doses may be added.
      The additional dose levels chosen for assessment will be based on the safety (systemic
      reaction or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results assessed as related to
      study drug) and efficacy (blood Phe reduction to less than or equal to 60 μmol/L) information
      of at least 3 subjects with at least 2 weeks of daily dosing with rAvPAL-PEG. Initiation of
      dosing at higher or lower dose levels will be per the determination of the Sponsor's Medical
      Officer in consultation with the Investigator.
