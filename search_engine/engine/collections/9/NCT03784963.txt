      devices (CF-LVAD) is dysfunctional angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a complicated process
      controlled by several markers. Previous studies have shown that elevated Angiopoietin-2 and
      TNF-alpha are associated with bleeding events in CF-LVAD patients.

      Fish oil has anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-angiogenic properties. A retrospective
      study of CF-LVAD patients on high-dose fish oil showed a marked decrease in gastrointestinal
      bleeding rates in these patients. Additionally, these patients had lower levels of
      circulating Angiopoietin-2. Fish oil is known to have an effect on the microbiome, and the
      aforementioned effects may be seen in changes of the microbiota.
