      the best method of treatment. The specific aims are

        1. To develop, test and produce 20 novel lightweight hand-held cordless, portable battery
           driven and rechargeable Thermal Coagulators (Liger Medical, Utah).

        2. To evaluate the success / failure rate of Thermal Coagulation in a randomised controlled
           trial comparing thermal coagulation to the existing current standard cryocautery and to
           Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ aka LEEP) as part of a screen and
           treat programme in Zambia.

        3. To evaluate the user satisfaction scores of the Liger Thermal Coagulator cryocautery as
           part of a screen and treat programme in Zambia.

        4. To determine the rate of over treatment of VIA positive women as revealed by
           histopathological examination of the randomly assigned excised treatment cases.

        5. To determine the value of Z scan to predict normality and abnormality in VIA positive
           women randomly assigned to excisional therapy

      In collaboration with a medical devices company in Utah, the engineering performance of the
      Liger Thermal Coagulator has been developed and tested in vitro and in vivo. 200+ Liger units
      have been produced and a randomised controlled trial of the device has been undertaken,
      compared to cryocautery and LLETZ using efficacy and user friendliness as endpoints. The
      inclusion of a study arm of excisional therapy allows to quantify the rate of overtreatment
      in VIA programmes and using the Z scan may allow for a non invasive method of accurately
      predicting normality and abnormality in VIA positive women.
