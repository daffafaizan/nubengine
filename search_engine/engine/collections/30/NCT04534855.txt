      monoclonal antibody, Treprilimab, in patients with local recurrent/residual nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma after re-irradiation.Patients with local recurrent/residual NPC after
      re-irradiation were treated with Treprilimab until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) and secondary end points
      included survival and toxicity.The sample size of this study was estimated on the assumption
      that response rates (RRs) to Treprilimab should be around 25%,based on a report that was
      available at the time this study was planned.Furthermore, the RR to noncytotoxic,
      experimental agents such as pazopanib and cetuximab in similarly pretreated patient cohorts
      was approximately 5% to 10%. This study's design was based on the modiﬁed Simon two-stage
      optimal design (α=0.05，β=0.2,n1=2/22,n2=7/40). If two responses were observed during the ﬁrst
      stage, enrollment was continued until a total of 40 patients was reached. The target lesions
      had to be measurable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Radiologic
      assessments were performed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
      Eligible patients were treated with Treprilimab at a dosage of 240mg intravenously every 3
      weeks until they experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end
      point of this study was objective response by the RECIST criteria , and the secondary end
      points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response and
      toxicity.
