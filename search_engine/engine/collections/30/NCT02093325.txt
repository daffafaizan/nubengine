    
      For the phase III study, a double-blind randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group design
      will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of eltombopag . Each subject will be randomly
      assigned to either Arm A (eltombopag) or Arm B (placebo) in 2:1 ratio.

      The primary objective is to compare the response rates of the two treatment arms, Therefore,
      the two-proportion z test will be considered and sample size can be chosen to achieve an 95%
      power for detecting a clinically meaningful difference at level of significance=0.05. A
      difference of 40% in clinical response is considered of clinically meaningful difference
      between the two treatment arms (75% for eltombopag vs. 35% for placebo). It requires a total
      sample of 83 subjects (55 for eltombopag and 28 for placebo). According to the 10% loss of
      screening failure, 90-100 subjects (60-67 for eltombopag and 30-33 for placebo) will be
      recruited.
