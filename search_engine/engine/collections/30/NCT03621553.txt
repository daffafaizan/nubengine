      hyperactivity leading to granulomatous inflammation. The granuloma cells autonomously convert
      25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25OHD) to the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D (1,25OH2D)
      independent of normal feedback control but dependent on substrate (25OHD) concentration.

      Circulating 1,25OH2D exerts both anti-inflammatory and mineral metabolic actions. Deficiency
      of 25OHD limits substrate-dependent 1,25OH2D synthesis, diminishes anti-antigenic innate
      immunity and augments pro-inflammatory adaptive immunity. Thus, low vitamin-D stores could
      aggravate sarcoid inflammation while repletion of vitamin-D stores could mitigate
      inflammation in sarcoidosis.
