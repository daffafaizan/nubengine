      Following pre-dilatation a BVS will be implanted and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will
      be performed in all patients. After OCT post-dilatation with non-compliant balloons might be
      performed if this is considered necessary by the treating interventionist. Final OCT will be
      performed in all patients. 1:1 Randomization of two strategies before the implantation of
      bioresorbable scaffolds:

        -  OPN strategy (study group): pre-dilatation with OPN NC Â® Super High Pressure PTCA
           (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) balloons

        -  standard strategy (control group): pre-dilatation with a standard (compliant) balloon

      Enrolment:

      Randomization of 50 patients

        -  25 in the OPN strategy (study group)

        -  25 in the standard strategy (control group)
