      (FB-MRI) to measure fetal body composition in the third trimester and 2) determine how the
      FB-MRI quantitative measurements compare to growth parameters at birth.

      1.2 HYPOTHESES AND SPECIFIC AIMS

      To accomplish the investigators' objectives, the aims and hypotheses are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1:

      In a prospective study in women with healthy pregnancies and women with fetuses that have
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and gestational diabetes, the investigators will
      quantify fetal subcutaneous, visceral, and brown adipose tissue volumes and proton-density
      fat fraction (PDFF) using FB-MRI in the third trimester.

      Hypothesis 1: Using a FB-MRI technique the investigators will find the following,

        1. The growth-restricted fetus will have less visceral, subcutaneous, and brown adipose
           tissue volume and PDFF when compared to healthy fetuses and fetuses whose mothers have
           gestational diabetes.

        2. Fetuses whose mothers have gestational diabetes will have a greater subcutaneous and
           visceral adipose tissue volume and PDFF compared to healthy fetuses.

      Specific Aim 2:

      In a prospective study in pregnant women and their fetuses, the investigators will compare
      volume and PDFF measurements of fetal visceral, subcutaneous, and brown adipose tissue
      obtained with FB-MRI to birth growth parameters of these infants.

      Hypothesis 2: The volume and PDFF of fetal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue will
      correlate positively with birth weight and length z-score.
