      after RAGT on patients with lower extremity burn.

      20 patients with burn were randomly divided into 2 groups. RAGT group received RAGT 5
      sessions per week at duration 30 minutes with 30 minutes conventional physical therapy in 12
      weeks. SUBARÂ® (CRETEM, Korea) is a wearable robot with a footplate that assists patients to
      perform voluntary muscle movements. The conventional group underwent conventional physical
      therapy twice a day, 5 times a week in 12 weeks. Main outcomes were functional ambulatory
      category(FAC), 6 minutes walking test(6MWT), visual analogue scale(VAS), isometric forces of
      bilateral knee and ankle muscles, and foot pressure analysis before and after 12 weeks
      training.
