      following nephrostomy placement and within 6 weeks of tumor treatment/resection. Therapy will
      be administered at one of three dose levels in a 3 + 3 design (200 mg/75 ml diluent, 400
      mg/75 ml diluent or 800 mg/75 ml diluent). It is anticipated that at least 3 patients will be
      accrued at both of the 200 and 400 mg dose levels. Assuming acceptable toxicity, the accrual
      target for the 800 mg dose level will be 9 patients. If the maximum tolerated dose is
      determined to be 200 mg or 400 mg, expansion to 9 patients will occur at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) dose level. Drug will be administered on a weekly basis for 8 total
      treatments.
