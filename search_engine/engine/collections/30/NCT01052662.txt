      of current use of illicit drugs are generally high (19.7 %)according to data from the 2007
      National Survey on Drug Use & Health (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration 2008). Young adults start using heroin around this age range, and more
      recently have had increasing rates of prescription-type drug use. Given that young adults
      with opiate dependence who are seeking treatment are relatively treatment na√Øve, have a
      shorter period of addiction, and are more likely to choose buprenorphine over methadone,
      developing short-term buprenorphine treatment alternatives to long-term methadone agonist
      treatment is needed.
