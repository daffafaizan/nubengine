    
      This is a prospective, case-control, study designed to measure the mean difference in cT1 and
      PDFF in patients who have undergone liver biopsy and have confirmed NASH and fibrosis or
      'cases' (N=40) and N=20 patients with neither significant NASH nor significant fibrosis
      'controls'.

      Confirmed cases will be patients who have met the criteria for active NASH with fibrosis
      according to the NAS CRN scoring system (NAS≥4 & F2-3), 'controls' will be those who did not
      meet NASH diagnostic criteria and have evidence of fibrosis of ≤2.

      In addition, in order to investigate the variability of the biomarker investigators will
      assess the 'measurement' error in all participants by performing a repeat 'second' scan in
      the same scanning session, and , in cases only, 'biological' variability by performing a
      repeat scan in controls 2-4 weeks later.

      Suitable patients based on trial inclusion criteria will be identified by the study PI and
      clinical collaborator and invited to receive one or two MRI scans from which cT1 and PDFF
      will be derived using Perspectum's LiverMultiScan software. Baseline scan will ideally be
      performed between 3 days (to allow for recovery from the procedure and time for biopsy
      results to become available) and 6 weeks following biopsy, to minimize the likelihood that
      the patient is in a significantly different pathophysiologic state on the baseline scan day
      than on the biopsy day.

      In order to ensure that the investigators capture information on normal variability and not
      related to intervention they will also capture and record basic information at both
      measurement timepoints (e.g. body weight, waist circumference, details of lifestyle
      interventions).
