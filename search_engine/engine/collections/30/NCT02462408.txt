      ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block for upper limb surgery. A cadaveric
      study was also performed to complement the findings.

      After obtaining approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University Malaya Medical Centre
      (IRB reference no. 949.14 dated 17 October 2012), 46 patients undergoing upper limb surgery
      were prospectively recruited and randomized. A cadaveric dissection was also performed.

      DESIGN: Prospective randomized study

      SETTING: Single centre, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; November
      2012 to October 2013

      INTERVENTION: Ultrasound guided, lateral or posterior parasagittal in-plane infraclavicular
      brachial plexus blocks were performed on patients, depending on randomization. All blocks
      were performed using 21G x 4 inch Stimuplex A (B Braun Medical) without nerve stimulation
      plus SonoSite M-Turbo with HFL38x/ 13-6 MHz linear transducer probe. A 25-ml local
      anaesthetic admixture [Lignocaine 2% (100mg) plus Ropivacaine 0.75% (150mg)] were injected to
      all patients. A total volume of normal saline 0.9% 25ml mixed with methylene blue (0.2ml) was
      used for cadaveric study.
