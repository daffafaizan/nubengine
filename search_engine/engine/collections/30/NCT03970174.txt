      of communication in hospital and care transitions from hospital to home. Care Connector is an
      electronic interprofessional communication and collaboration platform initially designed to
      address communication challenges faced by interprofessional care team. It has been augmented
      to support care transitions through a care transition module (that include the generation of
      provider-facing discharge summary and PODS). This study examines the impact of this care
      transition module on patient/family experience of in-hospital communication and care
      transitions. The quantitative component is a controlled study where baseline data is
      collected on 4 medicine wards. The care transition module is then introduced to 2 of the 4
      medicine wards (intervention) while the other 2 (control) wards continue to operate without
      the explicit use of the care transition module. Data is then collected again on all 4 wards
      to understand impact of patient/family experience, as well as objective outcomes of ED visits
      and re-admission within 30 days. A number of care transition process measures will also be
      obtained. In the qualitative component, we will interview patients/families, as well as
      healthcare providers to understand how technology can or cannot address these issues.
