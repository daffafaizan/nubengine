      tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of providing medically-tailored meals (MTMs) to
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and malnutrition. The
      investigators hypothesize that MTMs will improve symptomatology, functional capacity, and
      serum biomarkers of heart failure in this patient population. There are two primary
      objectives for this pilot study: 1) confirm tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of
      prescribing MTMs, and 2) measure changes in functional capacity, patient-reported health
      status, and biomarkers of nutritional status and heart failure over the course of the study
      period. For this proposed study, the investigators will test the following elements of this
      central hypothesis with 2 aims:

      Aim 1 Tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of prescribing medically-tailored meals:
      Tolerability will be assessed with the validated 28-item dietary satisfaction score
      (DSat-28). Efficacy will be assessed by improvement in patient-reported health status
      questionnaires and feasibility will be assessed by the macronutrient intakes achieved on
      facilitated food recalls.

      Aim 2 Functional capacity and serum biomarkers of nutrition/heart failure: Determine whether
      medically tailored meals improve symptomatology, functional capacity, and serum biomarkers of
      nutrition and heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure.
