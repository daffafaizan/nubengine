      neurophysiology, molecular and genetic biomarker discovery, and brain imaging. This data will
      be utilized to characterize post-traumatic headache and build univariate and multivariate
      predictive models for post-traumatic headache persistence and for the response to
      post-traumatic headache treatment. Some participants might be eligible to participate in the
      clinical trial portion of this study.The clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled investigation of erenumab for the treatment of post-traumatic headache.
      Participants will be randomized when PTH has been present for 35-56 days. The clinical trial
      component of this Focused Program is described in more detail in a separate
      clinicaltrials.gov record.

      Follow-up questionnaires, headache diary data, pain threshold results, and brain imaging data
      will be collected longitudinally during the trial to assess for changes over time and
      associations of such changes with post-traumatic headache treatment outcomes.
