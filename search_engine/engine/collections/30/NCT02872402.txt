      subsequent type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These women are also
      characterized by higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to women
      without prior GDM. Failure to lose the weight gained during pregnancy can lead to increased
      BMI for subsequent pregnancies. As such, the childbearing-age period has been described as a
      potential period of weight gain and represents a critical window for the development of
      obesity, T2D and CVD. Therefore, strategies aiming at preventing postpartum weight retention
      (WR) and early cardiometabolic alterations in women with a history of GDM are of paramount
      importance. Principal investigator have shown that a low diet quality score was associated
      with greater adiposity and lower insulin sensitivity in women with prior GDM. Furthermore,
      less than 10% of women with prior GDM met the recommendations for breastfeeding, nutrition,
      and physical activity. Investigators have shown that attitude and perceived behavioral
      control were significant predictors of the intention to adopt healthy eating. For those who
      did engage in healthy behaviors, lower prevalence of cardiometabolic alterations was
      observed, providing supportive evidence that the adoption of healthy behaviors may be key to
      prevent the progression to an altered cardiometabolic profile.
