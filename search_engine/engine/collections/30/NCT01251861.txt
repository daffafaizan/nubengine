    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the two regimens on the proportion of patients with undetectable
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (< 0.2 ng/mL) at 44 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients with PSA decline >= 85% at 44 weeks on the
      combination therapy arm compared to that of bicalutamide monotherapy arm.

      II. To assess the distribution of best PSA response in each study arm. III. To assess the
      time to PSA progression in each arm of the study. IV. To assess the time to PSA nadir in each
      arm of the study. V. To assess the duration of PSA response in each arm of the study. VI. To
      characterize the PSA slope pre-study, during treatment, and off treatment.

      VII. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in this
      patient population.

      VIII. To determine whether Gleason score has any effect on PSA response to treatment.

      IX. To determine whether prior hormonal therapy has any effect on PSA response to treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Samples of the primary tumor specimen will be retrieved for banking and future analysis of
      the molecular profile of the primary prostate cancer (PC) tissues with emphasis on the
      androgen receptor (AR) and protein kinase B (Akt) upstream and downstream signaling pathways.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo observation on weeks 1-12. Patients then receive bicalutamide* orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on weeks 13-44. Patients with a PSA decline of >= 50% may continue on
      bicalutamide until week 72 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206** PO once per week on weeks 1-44 and
      bicalutamide* PO QD on weeks 13-44. Patients with a PSA decline of >= 50% may continue on
      MK2206 and bicalutamide until week 72 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may begin bicalutamide on weeks 4-11 if the disease worsens.

      NOTE: **Patients on Akt inhibitor MK2206 with a PSA < 0.2 ng/mL by week 12 do not receive
      bicalutamide until PSA rises to >= 0.2 ng/mL.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then every year for up to 10 years.
