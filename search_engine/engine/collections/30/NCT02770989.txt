      for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

      Up to 66 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refractory to at least one
      antiarrhythmic medications (Class I or III) are enrolled. with an expected 10% dropout; 59
      per protocol patients are required.

      The study duration will be 18 month with a 6 month enrollment period and 12 month follow-up.
      Interim follow-up visits are at post procedure, 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months and 12 Months.

      The baseline and follow up tests are standard of care. Additional optional tests are an
      esophageal endoscopy for determination of potential fistula formation and a cerebral MRI for
      micro embolism post treatment.
