      with metastatic colorectal cancer when they have no mutation in RAS genes. In Royal Marsden
      Hospital patients, who are refractory to all standard therapies and have metastatic
      colorectal cancer are offered one of these agents in third line metastatic setting. Whilst
      the mechanisms of response/resistance to these therapies are well studies, they are still
      incompletely understood. The main hypothesis of this study is that finding mechanisms of
      response and/or resistance by using novel techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS)
      and/or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to these therapies will allow better
      patient selection and application of precision medicine in such patients.
