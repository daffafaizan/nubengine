    
      The initial 5-FU dosage will be 500 mg/m^2 administered on day 1 of course 1. We plan to
      treat a maximum of 3 cohorts of research participants (dosage levels - 0, 1, and 2) with
      escalating doses of 5-FU. A cycle is defined as 42 days. The first 6 weeks of therapy will
      constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period.

      Primary objective

        -  To investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) of
           weekly bolus dose 5-FU in children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma

        -  To study the safety of 500 mg/m^2 weekly bolus dose 5-FU in less-heavily pre-treated
           children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To document and describe toxicities associated with 5-FU administered on a weekly bolus
           schedule

        -  To document preliminary antitumor activity in participants with recurrent or refractory
           ependymoma treated with 5-FU

        -  To assess the feasibility of measuring expression level of Thymidylate Synthetase (TYMS)
           in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples using the Quantigene assay

        -  To evaluate the association between specific genetic polymorphisms (e.g., DPYD) and the
           pharmacokinetics of 5-FU
