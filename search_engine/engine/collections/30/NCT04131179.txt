      recent review indicated that the reported suicide rates in South Asia are high compared to
      the global average. These figures are likely to be an under estimate since suicide data from
      many Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) is lacking. There is little official data on
      suicide from Pakistan, where suicide and self-harm remains as criminal act and socially,
      religiously condemned. However, there is accumulating evidence that both self-harm and
      suicide rates have been increasing in Pakistan.

      This is the first RCT of a psychological intervention for self-harm in children and young
      people in Pakistan. It follows from the work of "Multicentre RCT to evaluate the clinical and
      cost effectiveness of culturally adapted manual assisted psychological intervention"(CMAP)
      trial currently taking place in adults who have self-harmed in Pakistan, by evaluating
      whether a similar intervention, adapted for children and adolescents, could be clinically and
      cost effective.
