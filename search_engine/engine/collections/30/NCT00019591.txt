        -  Determine the frequency of immunologic response in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic colorectal cancer treated with ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine with
           or without interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the tumor response and survival time in patients with metastatic colorectal
           cancer treated with vaccine plus interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer
           treated with adjuvant vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to extent of disease.
      Patients with prior locally advanced disease are assigned to treatment group A, while those
      with metastatic disease are assigned to treatment group B.

        -  Group A: Patients are vaccinated against influenza on day -6. Patients undergo
           collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on day -4. The PBMC are cultured
           with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 5 days and CD40 ligand for 24 hours and
           then pulsed for 2 hours with the appropriate peptide to form a vaccine. Patients receive
           ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine IV over 5 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, and
           57.

        -  Group B: Patients undergo collection of PBMC and receive vaccination as in group A.
           Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 2-6 and 9-13.

      Treatment in both groups repeats every 2 weeks for up to 5 vaccinations in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed on days 75, 90, 120, and 365.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
