    
      PD0026 is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-dose study to investigate the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of 14C-labeled tozadenant. The
      primary objective is to determine the mass balance and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of total
      radioactivity in 6 healthy male subjects following a single oral dose of 14C-labeled
      tozadenant. Secondary objectives are to determine the PK of Tozadenant, to identify and
      quantify metabolites of tozadenant, and to gain further information on the tolerability and
      safety of tozadenant.

      The variables related to the radiocarbon activity include the total radioactivity
      concentration in whole blood and plasma; the total radioactivity excretion in urine, feces,
      and expired air; and the corresponding PK parameters.

      The concentrations and the corresponding PK parameters of tozadenant over time will be
      determined in plasma, urine, and feces.

      In addition, the metabolites of tozadenant will be identified and quantified. The safety and
      tolerability variables include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examination,
      standard 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, and clinical laboratory results.

      The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 20 days (Days -21 to -2) and a Study
      Period of 15 days. Therefore, the maximum duration of participation from Screening until
      discharge from the clinic for a subject is 35 days.
