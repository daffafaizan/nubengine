    
      For this study, we will ascertain clinical data and biological samples from a cohort of SCAD
      patients identified using retrospective review of medical records and prospective
      surveillance of Intermountain patients that undergo coronary angiography. The SCAD diagnosis
      will be based on independent review of clinical presentation, cardiac imaging, and
      angiography findings by two cardiologists and a third cardiologist in case of disagreement.
      It is anticipated that we hope to recruit 100 SCAD patients.

      Enrollment of these subjects will be done under the INSPIRE registry. The subjects will be
      asked to sign a consent, provide biological samples, and complete questionnaires related to
      SCAD as part of the INSPIRE registry.

      The SCAD cases will be matched to records in the Intermountain Genealogy Registry (IGR) to
      allow for the identification of possible high-risk SCAD families. Risk of first and second
      degree relatives will also be assessed. The obtained blood samples will be processed, stored
      and genotyped.
