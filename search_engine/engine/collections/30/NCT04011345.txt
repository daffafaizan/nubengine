      and 36).

      Serum and RBC concentrations of total folate, different folate forms and clinical outcomes
      will be measured at baseline and after each treatment period. Dietary folate intake will be
      assessed at baseline.

      The objective of this study is to determine efficacy and potential harm of folic acid
      supplementation, versus no supplementation, in Canadian children with sickle cell disease.

      It is hypothesized that: (1) there will be no difference in mean RBC folate concentrations
      across folic acid and placebo groups after 12-wk, (2) none of the participants will have
      folate deficiency, and (3) compared to periods of no supplementation, during periods of
      high-dose folic acid supplementation participants will show no difference in clinical
      outcomes, but have higher plasma unmetabolized folic acid concentrations.

      Significance: There is a need to determine if the current clinical practice of high-dose
      folic acid supplementation is efficacious, and warranted.
