      lung water content in the extremely preterm population undergoing treatment for significant
      lung disease. For that, the specific aims are to determine the occurrence, evolution over
      time and possible hemodynamic impact of left ventricular hypertrophy and occurrence and
      degree of water retention in premature lungs, after dexamethasone administration. As
      secondary outcomes, this study also investigates the effects of dexamethasone on the ductus
      arteriosus, body growth, and autonomic regulation heart rate variability, as well as other
      important outcomes outlined in this protocol.

      This study hypothesize that in some infants dexamethasone will be associated with the
      occurrence of early and/or prolonged left ventricular hypertrophy, which may be associated
      with changes in cardiac performance. It also hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects
      of dexamethasone would improve inflammation of immature lungs, leading to a decrease in
      interstitial fluid.
