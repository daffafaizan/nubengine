      prior to protocol entry by standard of care testing, including EUS, contrast-enhanced helical
      abdominal CT scan, or MRI. Patients meeting NCCN criteria for potentially resectable
      (borderline or resectable) tumors will be eligible. Subjects are randomized to receive either
      2 cycles of PGH - gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (1000 mg/m2 & 125 mg/m2, respectively: days
      1, 8, and 15) plus oral HCQ (1200 mg PO daily) - or PGH plus Avelumab (PGHA; days 1 and 15 of
      each 28-day cycle), by means of response-adaptive randomization based on Grade IIB or greater
      histologic response.

      Surgical exploration and pancreatectomy is performed if technically feasible and all
      toxicities have resolved. HCQ is taken until the evening before surgery. Avelumab is
      administered every two weeks until up to one week prior to the date of surgery. The Study
      Coordinator informs subjects of the date of operation. Following successful surgical removal
      of tumors, patients are then be free to pursue standard of care adjuvant therapy options, at
      the discretion of their treating physician.
