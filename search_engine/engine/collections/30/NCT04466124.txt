      common cause of cancer death worldwide according to the 2009 Korea Central Cancer
      Registration Annual Report. Excellent survival rate (50-70% 5-year survival rate) can be
      obtained when surgery is performed including liver transplantation, but most (70-80%)
      patients with liver cancer are difficult to get surgery due to liver disease associated with
      cirrhosis. In addition, due to the multi-centric nature of liver cancer in patients with
      cirrhosis, repeated treatment is required. For these reasons, various treatments for liver
      cancer (percutaneous arterial embolization, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency
      heat therapy, and radiation therapy) have been performed.

      Due to recent advances in radiotherapy technology, proton beam therapy (PBT) is a promising
      treatment for liver cancer because it maximizes radiation to tumor tissues and reduces
      radiation doses from surrounding normal tissues due to the distinct physical properties of
      proton beams. Promising therapeutic results and less toxicity have been reported in liver
      cancer. In addition, several genes in liver cancer (SOCS-1, GSTP, APC, VEGF, PD-EGF, HIF-1,
      NOS, b-FGF, LINE-1, p27, TOP2A, Ets-1, Bcl-xL, Osteopontin, CD44, etc.) have been reported to
      be associated with recurrence and prognosis. Therefore, in this study, the investigator is
      going to establish a prospective cohort of liver cancer patients treated with proton beam
      therapy. It be used for analyzing local control, survival, recurrence, toxicity, proton
      treatment plan information, gene expression information, then local control (LC), overall
      survival. (overall survival, OS), recurrence-free surival (RFS), and factors that predict
      treatment-related toxicity.
