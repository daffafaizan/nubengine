      Taiwan population yet. This study is designed to investigate the prevalence of thyroid
      autoimmunity associated with chronic urticaria in Taiwanese population. In addition, we
      intend to find out the change in the level of thyroid autoimmunity after the treatment in
      order to further understand their relationship. We also intend to find out the prognostic
      parameters in patients with the presence of thyroid autoimmunity and chronic urticaria.
