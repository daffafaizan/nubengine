    
      The objective of this post market surveillance study is to obtain outcome data on the Fitmore
      Hip Stem by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records, and
      thus to assess the long-term performance and safety of this implant.

      The Fitmore Hip Stem is a short and curved uncemented stem that allows preservation of the
      greater trochanter and of the gluteal muscles.

      Indication/Target Population: Patients suffering from severe hip pain and disability
      requiring total hip arthroplasty.

      Study Design: A multi-centre, non-comparative, prospective post-marketing study.

      Targeted Number of Subjects: 500. Data Collection: Collection of preoperative,
      intra-operative and immediate post-operative data; follow-up visits at 6-12 weeks, 1, 2, 3,
      5, 7 and 10 years post-operatively.

      Recruitment period: 24 months. Clinical Assessments: Evaluations will be made using the
      Harris Hip Score, the Oxford Hip Score, the SF-12 Physical and Mental Health summary
      measures, the EQ-5D (EuroQol) and radiographically.

      Safety Assessments: Safety will be assessed by appropriate recording and reporting of adverse
      events throughout the study. The Fitmore Hip Stem is CE marked, commercially available and
      has been pre-clinically tested.
