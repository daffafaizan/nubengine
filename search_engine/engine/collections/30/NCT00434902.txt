      evaluate if they had a suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH) on the basis of a tricuspid
      regurgitation jet (TRJ) velocity > or equal at 2.5m/s. In this case, a right heart
      catheterization was performed to confirm or not this diagnosis and its mechanisms. Each
      included patient was followed every year for 3 years: during each visit, a clinical
      evaluation was obtained and a Doppler echocardiography. In case of emergence of a suspected
      PH, a right heart catheterization was performed to confirm or not this diagnosis and its
      mechanisms.

      Three groups of patients were defined: no PH, precapillary PH, and a third group including
      post-capillary PH and hyperkinetic state. These groups were well defined on the basis of the
      results of th Doppler echocardiography and right heart catheterisation.

      Characteristics of patients and their prognosis were evaluated in each group.

      In the same, way, biological study is planned to evaluate some biological markers of the
      mechanism of PH, and prognostic factors.
