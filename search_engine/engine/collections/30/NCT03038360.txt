      a one year follow-up conducted by the Bad Krozingen Heart Center. The objectif is to validate
      a novel predictive model and a diagnostic tool, for the risk stratification of AMI patients
      undergoing PCI. The sample and data collected by eCRF will allow to set up a prototype
      personalized medicine device focusing on Heart Failure (HF) induced by AMI. The primary
      endpoint will be the proportion of patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <
      40% at 6 months. The main secondary endpoint is recovery of regional wall motion measured by
      cMRI at 6 months. Early time point samples, cMRI at day 3 and other clinical patient data
      will be used to estimate the risk associated with patients and the data obtained will be
      correlated with the one year outcome of patients.
