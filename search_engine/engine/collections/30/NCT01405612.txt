      gastroprokinetic activity being developed as an intravenous therapy to be used in the
      treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) hypomotility disorders such as post-operative ileus (POI)
      and gastroparesis.

      POI is a transient disruption of co-ordinated bowel motility that contributes to patient
      morbidity, discomfort and prolonged recovery times. POI most commonly occurs after abdominal
      surgery and annually, POI is the main determinant of length of hospital stay after major
      abdominal surgery and a factor in patient hospital re-admissions, increased healthcare
      resource use and cost, and decreased patient satisfaction. Current strategies to attenuate
      POI are aimed at enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or "fast track". These are multimodal
      care protocols designed to reduce the impact of external and internal factors on POI
      duration. Recently, fewer complications and a quicker return to work and normal activities
      for patients who have had ERAS programmes implemented have been reported. In spite of these
      strategies only up to 20% of subjects undergoing partial bowel resection recover GI function
      within 72 hours after surgery.
