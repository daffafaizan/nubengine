      sensitivity. This is a prospective cohort pilot study to determine daily glycemic
      pharmacokinetics and metabolic influences of myo-inositol supplementation using continuous
      glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and pre- and post-supplement blood work in high risk
      pregnancies and women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitis (GDM). Risk factors
      include: obesity, previous pregnancy with GDM, family history of diabetes, glucose
      intolerance, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women will have a CGMS device placed on
      day one and begin with 3 days of placebo plus folic acid (400mcg) to determine baseline
      glycemia and metabolic levels. For the final 4 days, women with take myo-inositol
      supplementation (4g) plus folic acid (400mcg). The CGMS device will be removed on day 7 when
      final blood work will be obtained. Self-capillary glucose testing 4 times per day is recorded
      to calibrate CGMS glucose values. These observations will help determine the effects of
      myo-inositol on overall mean glucose and other metabolic factors in high risk and GDM
      patients, identify pharmacokinetic discipline in pregnancy, and develop the groundwork for
      future prospective clinical trials for the prevention and/or augmentation in treatment GDM.
