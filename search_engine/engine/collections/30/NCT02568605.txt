      in conjunction with diet-induced weight loss, on reduction in liver fat and injury.

      Primary Objective - determine the change in hepatic injury (fibrosis and inflammation) and
      hepatic fat (percent fat) over 6 months in NAFLD patients treated with prebiotic or placebo
      during weight loss.

      Secondary Objectives - determine the changes in appetite, body composition, glycemic and
      insulinemic responses, quality of life with prebiotic or placebo during weight loss, and
      examine mechanisms related to prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota and lipogenesis.
