      this study is to investigate the possible difference in the occurrence of postoperative
      headache when general anaesthesia is maintained with propofol, versus sevoflurane. Propofol
      acts throught a GABA, and is known to have a therapeutic effect on migraine patients with
      accute attacts. However, its role on postoperative headache has not been studied, when used
      for maintainance of anaesthesia, this study aims to investigate the occurrence of headache
      after anaesthesia and surgery, when patients receive randomly two different anaesthetics:
      propofol and sevoflurane.
