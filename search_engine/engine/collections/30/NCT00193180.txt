      28-day cycle, along with continuous imatinib mesylate. Initially, imatinib mesylate was given
      at a dose of 600 mg orally daily, beginning concurrently with the first dose of docetaxel;
      however, after the first 15 patients were treated it became evident that this imatinib dose
      was not tolerable, and subsequent patients received imatinib mesylate 400 mg orally daily
