      reperfusion, applied to a distant organ, provide protection to the target organ. Dynamic
      cerebral autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral blood flow, has been
      proved to be critical for the occurrence,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular
      disease. In this study, we hypothesis that RIPC provides neuro-protection by means of
      improving dCA.
