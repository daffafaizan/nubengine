      recruited for this pilot study. The women were supposed to undertake a "Paleolithic
      lifestyle" (PL) intervention consisting of a Paleolithic diet and daily outdoor activity of
      at least 30 min duration while undergoing radiotherapy. Body composition was measured weekly
      by bioimpedance analysis. Blood parameters were assessed before, during, and at the end of
      radiotherapy. A control group on an unspecified standard diet (SD) was assigned by propensity
      score matching.
