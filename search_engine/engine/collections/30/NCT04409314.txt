    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of intratumoral hypoxia in patients with relapsed or refractory
      (R/R) malignancies before treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the association between intratumoral hypoxia and clinical responses to CAR
      T-cell therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate intratumoral hypoxia with markers of CAR T-cell activity and toxicity.

      2. To correlate pre-therapy fluorine F 18-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (18F-FAZA) uptake with
      pre-therapy 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake.

      OUTLINE:

      Prior to CAR T-cell therapy, patients receive 18F-FAZA intravenously (IV). Beginning 2 hours
      after injection, patients undergo PET scan over 30-45 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 6 months after CAR T-cell
      therapy.
