      studies show a clear increase ininfarct-related complications due to increased survival after
      MI and aging population. Heart failure is the most prevalent complication after MI, which has
      reached epidemic proportions in western societies. For the period between 2010 and
      2030,according to projections made in developed countries, about 10% increment in all
      cardiovascular disease is being predictedhowever increment in heart failure (HF) would be
      such a dramatic figure which is about 25%. HF is an increasing burden tosociety and
      healthcare systems, since its prevalence and incidence is dramatically increasing. There has
      not been aprospective study that assesses the exact cellular and geometric course after MI in
      human. This study will allow us tounderstand the behavior of cells involved in cardiac repair
      after MI. In addition, it will show us the exact functional andgeometric course after MI.
      Finally, the current study will also provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets via
      genomic andproteomic studies. All together, we envision to find new efficient ways to
      identify/treat patients at risk to develop HF after MI.
