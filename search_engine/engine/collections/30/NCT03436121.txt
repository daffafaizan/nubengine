    
      The investigators will enroll 120 medically stable adult patients who present to two
      Emergency Departments with a chief complaint of acute pain.

      The investigators will randomly assign subjects using a blocked randomization schedule to
      either: 1) a single dose of IV ketamine (0.3 mg.kg) + midazolam, or 2) placebo + midazolam.
      ED providers and patients will be blind to treatment allocation.

      All participants will complete measures of pain and mood scores every 30 minutes, and the
      investigators will record any analgesics administered in the ED until discharge. At 7-days
      and 14-days post- discharge, the investigators will measure summary reports of pain severity,
      mood, and analgesic medication used.
