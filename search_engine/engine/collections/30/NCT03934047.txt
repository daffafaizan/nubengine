      study involve? Participants are randomly allocated to one of three groups. For the
      interventions field, could you please provide a brief methodology for each of your treatment
      arms, and the total duration of treatment and follow-up? Group A: Visual Field Infiltration
      of Tranexamic Acid during the operation of total knee replacement. Group B: No Visual Field
      Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid during the operation of total knee replacement.

      The blood loss, VAS pain scores, length of their hospital stay, swelling and bleeding, and
      range of motion of the affected knee are assessed in the days following surgery.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Participants who are allocated to
      receive treatment with Visual Field Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid may benefit from a
      reduction in blood loss, pain, swelling and blood loss after surgery, shortening their
      hospital stay.

      There is a small risk of discomfort, frostbite or deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a
      major vein in the leg) when using Visual Field Infiltration of Tranexamic Acid.
