      bidirectional barbed suture compared with traditional sutures in the deep closure of primary
      total hip (25) and knee (35) arthroplasties. Complications, time to closure, and length of
      surgery were evaluated. Closure was noted to be significantly faster (9.3 vs 13.6 minutes, P
      b .005) in the barbed suture group. Wound-related complications were similar (3 cases) in
      both groups at 3-month follow-up. Although this study supports the use of barbed technology
      as a functionally comparable and more efficient modality of wound closure with the potential
      for costs savings based on reduced operative time, the cost-effectiveness of its adoption is
      institution dependent and will rely on the optimization of all other perioperative factors.
