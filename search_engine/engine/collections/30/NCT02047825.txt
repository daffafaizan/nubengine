      000 for the past three decades. It is also higher in northern countries and between females
      with a male ratio around 2.0. The highest prevalence rates have been estimated for the age
      group 35-64 years. The estimated European mean annual Multiple Sclerosis incidence rate is
      4.3 cases per 100 000.

      Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms: hypoesthesia, muscle weakness, abnormal
      muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; dysarthria,
      dysphagia, visual problems fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel
      difficulties,cognitive impairment, or emotional symptomatology. The investigators focus on
      the benefits of an intervention on dexterity, strength, coordination and functionality.
