      Afghanistan. Many of these individuals have experienced multiple limb-sparing surgeries and
      orthotic utilization. Many continue functioning with use of their orthosis while others may
      seek delayed amputation. It is unclear if limb salvage or amputation is more advantageous
      functionally or preferred following lower extremity(LE) trauma. The IDEO (Intrepid Dynamic
      Exoskeletal Orthosis) was developed to assist in maintaining high functional performance in
      patients who have experienced high energy lower extremity trauma (HELET) and limb salvage
      surgeries primarily effecting the LE below the level of the knee joint. The IDEO represents
      one "advanced" orthotic option for a traumatized and surgically spared limb however there are
      other "advanced" orthotic options. Problematically, few studies have reported outcomes
      associated with these devices. In the few studies available, sample sizes are small which
      greatly reduces generalizability of study findings. The purpose of the IM ABLE study is to
      determine if advanced (ADV) ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) will enable users to achieve greater
      levels of physical and self-reported function compared with conventional (CONV) AFOs for
      those ambulating at or above the independent community level of ambulation.
