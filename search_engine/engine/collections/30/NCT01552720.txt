      cases per 100 000 population. About 50% of these patients are dead within 48 hours, if
      untreated. To assess the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of
      patients with AAD, the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) was
      established in 1996, and has grown to include about 2000 patients from 26 large referral
      centers to date. All patients from IRAD are caucasians from developed countries wiht advanced
      medical care, however, the proportion of Asian is very low. Data reported by the IRAD in not
      sufficient to reflect clinical characteristics of Acute aortic dissection in China. Clinical
      characteristics of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection have not evaluated to data.
      The aim of this study is to analyze clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with acute
      aortic dissection and clinical trend of acute aortic dissection.
