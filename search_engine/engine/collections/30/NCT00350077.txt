      been the hallmark of burn care in the last 50 years. The danger of exceeding the optimal
      intravenous fluid resuscitation has resulted in severe complications including abdominal
      compartment syndrome, loss of upper airway control, extremity compartment syndromes and
      pulmonary edema. Hig dose vitamin C infusion during the first 24 hours of burn resuscitation
      has been documented to decrease the overall amount of intravenous fluid needed to provide for
      adequate renal perfusion and hemodynamic stability in multiple animal model studies. High
      dose vitamin C is thought to decrease postburn microvascular protein and fluid leakage by
      reducing postburn lipid oxygenation caused by burn injury generated free radicals.
