      testosterone replacement has resulted in improvement in bone mass, muscle strength, quality
      of life and memory function. In the body, testosterone is converted into estrogen. Hence, it
      is unclear whether these beneficial effects are due to testosterone or estrogen. Research has
      shown that inhibition of estrogen production in men results in an increase in testosterone
      levels.

      In this study, patients will be assigned to one of three groups: one group will receive
      testosterone gel and a placebo tablet, one group will receive a 1mg Anastrozole tablet and a
      placebo gel, and one group will receive a placebo tablet and placebo gel. Each group will
      receive a daily dose of calcium with vitamin D. The study requires 6 visits over a 12-month
      period for testing and evaluation. Two of the 6 visits will require an overnight stay in the
      hospital so that an intravenous (IV) line can be placed in the arm to allow samples to be
      drawn throughout the night. Testing will include a cardiac stress test, a glucose tolerance
      test, bone and muscle tests, evaluation of memory function, etc. For the safety of the
      prostate, we will perform a prostate ultrasound at the start and end of the study and we will
      monitor urinary symptoms, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and the prostate exam
      throughout the study.
