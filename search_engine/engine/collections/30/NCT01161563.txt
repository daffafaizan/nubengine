    
      GnRH is given as an injection. Injections of GnRH can be uncomfortable, causing a feeling of
      burning or stinging. The uncomfortable feeling may be caused by differences in the types of
      GnRH and the site of the injection (under the skin of the abdomen, or into the muscle of the
      buttock or thigh).
