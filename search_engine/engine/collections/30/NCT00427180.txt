      is the component actually implanted into the eye, the visual interface, and the Pocket
      Processor The Retinal Stimulator will be implanted into the eye of a blind subject during a
      surgical operation. However, the external components are activated only during the test
      sessions under the control of the investigator team. In a first step of the investigation a
      software controlled system on a PC which is connected to the Pocket Processor via Ethernet
      interface, will generate the defined stimulation patterns (bars, crosses, cubes). During the
      test session, the blind subject is exposed to a series of these stimulation patterns and he /
      she has to describe the visual perceptions. Based on his descriptions and in an interactive
      way, the stimulation signal is subsequently be modulated by changing parameters like
      amplitude, duration of impulse, polarity, number of repetitions or pulse frequency on the PC.

      In a second step the visual interface is equipped with a camera which presents realtime
      images to the subject. Data obtained from the investigation with computer generated patterns
      in the first step are used in the second step to improve the fitting software for the use in
      the camera supported system.

      Finally the system should enable the subject to recognize simple images supported from the
      camera.
