      2018 in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Health Sciences University Zekai Tahir

      their ABO blood type was recorded.

      The neonates were grouped by blood type (O, A, B, AB) and also separated into non-O (A, B,
      AB) and O groups and non-A (O, B, AB) and A groups for comparison of early and late onset
