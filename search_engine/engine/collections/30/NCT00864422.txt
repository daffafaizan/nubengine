      skills. Recently we observed adaptive changes in motor cortical organization in patients with
      chronic back pain, which are closely linked to changes in motor behavior. Although
      pain-related alterations in behavior can be trained and are associated with improved
      symptoms, it remains unclear whether these meaningful functional outcomes are related to
      motor cortical reorganization. Here we investigate the effects of two interventions in people
      with chronic back pain: skilled motor training and a control intervention of self-paced
      walking exercise. We measured motor cortical excitability (motor threshold (MT)) and
      organization (center of gravity (CoG) and map volume) of the deep abdominal muscle,
      transversus abdominis (TrA), using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In addition,
      motor behavior of TrA was assessed during single rapid arm movements. The study helps to
      elucidate the mechanisms of specific motor exercises in chronic back pain management.
