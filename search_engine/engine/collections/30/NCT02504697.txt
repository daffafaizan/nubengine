      multidisciplinary and translational research program that includes 7 Veterans Administration
      Hospitals (VAH), the 4 designated Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and 4 academic
      hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories, along with
      Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores. The DECAMP Coordinating Center
      will facilitate rapid selection, design and execution of clinical studies within this
      multi-institutional consortium. The ACRIN 4704 study will recruit one cohort to achieve the
      aims of this study: a longitudinal screening cohort.
