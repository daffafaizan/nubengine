      cancer combined with cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Further, there have been lots of randomized
      clinical trials assessing the efficacy of surgery + HIPEC for the treatment of locally
      advanced gastric cancer conducted. Nonetheless, to date, the kinds, doses, combinations of
      HIPEC drugs are not clearly been evaluate a criterion. Thus, This study aim to compare the
      efficacy of Lobaplatin and Paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer patients with D2 surgery
      combined with HIPEC. We plan to recruit 231 patients and divide into 3 groups, 2 drug groups
      and 1 control groups, radomly. all patients with advanced gastric cancer receive D2 surgery +
      HIPEC + SOX/XELOX chemotherapy regimen. the mainly experimental variable is HIPEC drugs and
      three groups employ Lobaplatin, Paclitaxel and none respectively. the endpoints of study
      include peritoneal metastasis, overall survival, immune status and perioperative safety
      assessment.
