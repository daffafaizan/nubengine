      Isolation Systemâ„¢ (TGI CIS) device constitutes a feasibility study directed at an initial
      evaluation of the device in a certain clinical population, namely subjects undergoing
      craniofacial fat grafting.

        1. Treat disfiguring craniofacial injuries in 5 subjects with fat grafting enhanced with
           adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) via TGI 1000 isolation methods to improve form
           with a high level of precision. Facial appearance and persistence of treatment effect
           will be assessed using aesthetic grading scales, state of the art 3-dimensional (3D)
           photography, and high resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning with 3D
           reconstruction. Patients will be followed for 24 months after treatment to define long
           term outcomes.

        2. Assess biologic properties of the cells within the fat graft and correlate with clinical
           outcomes. This will include adipose stem cell yield per volume of fat tissue, cell
           proliferation, capacity for adipogenic differentiation, lipolysis, and cell
           sub-population analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry. Results of these assays will
           be correlated with graft volume retention to search for predictors of good clinical
           outcome that are related to variation on adipose biology between subjects.

        3. Measure quality of life in patients before and after autologous fat grafting using
           validated psychosocial measures.
