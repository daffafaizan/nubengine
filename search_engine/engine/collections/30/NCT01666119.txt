    
      This is an open label study in opioid dependent subjects maintained on a stabilized dose of
      Suboxone tablets or films.

      Eligible subjects will be converted to an approximately equal dose of BEMA Buprenorphine NX.
      This dose will be taken throughout the 12-week treatment period with dose adjustments as
      clinically indicated for either the control of opioid dependence or adverse events (AEs).
      Subjects will be monitored for evidence of buccal irritation attributed to the application of
      the BEMA Buprenorphine NX film and opioid dependence control according to the Clinical
      Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction - A Treatment
      Improvement Protocol (TIP 40) guidelines for the use of buprenorphine in the management of
      opioid dependence.

      The total duration of participation for each subject will be up to approximately 18 weeks and
      includes a Screening period (subjects continue to take Suboxone tablets or films), Baseline
      visit, a 12-week open label treatment period (subjects take BEMA Buprenorphine NX films and
      at the Day 84 visit, subjects will return to their prior Suboxone treatment), and a Follow-up
      Visit.

      Vital signs, pulse oximetry, opioid withdrawal symptoms, adverse events (AEs), oral
      examinations, and concomitant medications will be assessed at intervals throughout the study.
      Clinical laboratory assessments, urine toxicology and buprenorphine testing, and 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will also be performed.
