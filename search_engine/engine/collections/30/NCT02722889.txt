      in these diameters (e.g. aneurysm) can lead to life-threatening complications such as
      dissection and/or rupture. In daily practice however (e.g. imaging reports), the
      investigators often encounter patients with elongation of the ascending aorta. Little is
      known about the length of the proximal aorta. Furthermore, the clinical implications of an
      elongated aorta are unknown.
