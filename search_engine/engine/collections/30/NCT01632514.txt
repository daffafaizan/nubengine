    
      Subjects to be submitted to total thyroidectomy will be included in the study. The
      investigators will evaluate serum levels of total calcium, ionic calcium, phosphorus,
      magnesium, creatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, fasting glucose, thyroid stimulating
      hormone (TSH), free thyroxin (FT4), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25 hydroxy vitamin D
      (25OHD), osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal
      propeptide (P1NP). Patients will be randomized to 3 groups: (1) 30 subjects with 25OHD < 20
      ng/mL that will receive 100,000U of cholecalciferol weekly for 4 weeks before surgery, (2) 30
      subjects with 25OHD < 20 ng/mL that will not receive cholecalciferol before surgery and (3)
      30 controls with 25OHD >= 20 ng/mL that will not receive cholecalciferol before surgery.
      Afterwards, the investigators will evaluate immediate postoperative PTH and measure serum
      levels of total calcium, ionic calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, CTX and
      P1NP in first and second postoperative days for further analysis.
