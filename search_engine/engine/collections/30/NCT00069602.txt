      critical to the interpretation of glucose levels in diseases such as diabetes. This study was
      conducted by the DirecNet Study Group to determine whether two FDA-approved continuous
      glucose monitors are sufficiently accurate.

      The study was conducted at five clinical centers and enrolled approximately 20 healthy
      children (ages 7 to 17 years old) who did not have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes nor a history of
      the disease in their immediate families. Each participant was hospitalized for approximately
      26 hours to assess the accuracy of the continuous glucose monitors compared with serum
      glucose determinations.
