      Recent data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Management Closed Claims
      Project [1] show that the percentage of claims resulting from adverse respiratory events,
      though on the decline (42% in the 1980s to 32% in the 1990s), continue to constitute a large
      source of morbidity and mortality in anesthetized patients. In 2005, a closed claims analysis
      of trends in anesthesia-related death and brain damage between 1975 and 2000 showed that out
      of all respiratory events (n=503) responsible for death and brain damage, difficult
      endotracheal intubation (n=115), inadequate oxygenation (n=111) and inadvertent esophageal
      intubation (n=66) were the top three causes [2].
