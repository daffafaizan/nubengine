      randomized on Day 1 via a centralized interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:2 ratio to
      receive placebo or 60 mg AD-35. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety
      information after the first 30 subjects have completed the Day 30 Visit and make any
      necessary recommendations regarding changes to the conduct of the study.

      After the first 6 months of double-blind treatment, subjects initially on placebo will
      transition to active study drug, and all subjects will receive 60 mg AD-35 for an additional
      6 months of open-label treatment.
