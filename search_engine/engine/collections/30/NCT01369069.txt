      type 2 diabetes and glucose concentrations of over 110 mg/dL or no history of diabetes and
      glucose concentrations of 150 mg/dL or higher on initial evaluation. The enrolling sites
      include the Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) sites as well as non NETT sites
      from all over the United States. The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of targeted
      glucose control (treatment group - IV insulin with target 80-130 mg/dl) verses control
      therapy of sub q insulin plus basal insulin with target glucose less than 180 mg/ dL.
