      balance, and cardio respiratory deconditioning that contribute to alter abilities to perform
      activities of daily living. It is the principal indication for total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      Patients' functional state and pain level are generally improved after TKA and the physical
      and functional status pre-TKA are predictive of recovery after surgery. Decreasing length of
      stay at surgery departments and promoting return at home after TKA are recommended. The
      recommendations of the Health Authority in France (HAS) and the new law of finance for French
      clinics contribute to shorter hospital stays and to restrain the conditions of admission to
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation department after TKA.Exercise and education programs
      conducted before TKA could help better prepare patients for surgery, improve functional
      outcome and accelerate functional recovery after surgery thus reducing the length of stay in
      orthopedic departments and facilitate return to home (directly or after a stay in PMR
      departments). The type of program necessary to achieve those goals remains to be defined.A
      systematic review of the literature associated with an analysis of practices about the
      relevance of rehabilitation programs before TKA, concluded that the implementation of such
      programs before TKA was likely to reduce the length of stay in surgery departments and
      improve the rate of direct return to home after surgery but that high quality trials were
      lacking. It also suggested that association of exercise programs with educational ones could
      be more effective than exercise or education alone, particularly for fragile patients with
      impaired functional capacity, co-morbidities and/or social problems.
