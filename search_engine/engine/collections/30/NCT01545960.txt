      this day, however, their scientific and Western anatomical characterizations remain unclear.
      Past studies have suggested that acupuncture points are distinct electrically (increased
      electrical conductivity). To evaluate this claim, this study uses a Scanning Kelvin Probe to
      study the electrical potential of three acupuncture points and their respective adjacent
      controls in 24 healthy individuals. The Scanning Kelvin Probe is a novel device that measures
      the electrical potential of skin without actually touching the skin surface.
