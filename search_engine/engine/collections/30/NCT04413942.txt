      the allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma etc. which remain poorly controlled.
      FB825 blocks the biological pathway of IgE synthesis and thus can be used to treat
      IgE-mediated allergic diseases.

      FB825 was found to be safe when given IV repeat dose in toxicology study in monkey. No
      adverse effects of FB825 were observed in parameters included electrocardiograms for
      cardiovascular, ophthalmic examinations and other clinical, CNS and respiratory safety
      observations.

      The safety and tolerability of FB825 was demonstrated in the US phase I randomized,
      double-blind study with healthy subjects. Also, the FB825 was proved by in vivo study that it
      is able to block the biological pathway of IgE synthesis and thus can be used to treat
      IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Therefore, in this study, the effects of IgE in patients with
      atopic dermatitis receiving FB825 treatment will be investigated. The study will evaluate
      safety and efficacy in adults with atopic dermatitis.
