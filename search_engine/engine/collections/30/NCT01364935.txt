      to use the 3 fertility monitors for duration of 3 menstrual cycles. Additionally, during the
      study the women will be asked to fill in online questionnaires to assess the usability of the
      monitors. As the spouse is often a critical partner in the purchase decision and compliance,
      the investigators will also ask the spouse to complete similar online questionnaires.
