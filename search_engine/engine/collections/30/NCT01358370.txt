    
      The objective of this study is to characterize key aspects of the clinical course of LAL
      deficiency/Wolman phenotype in patients including, but not limited to, survival and growth
      parameters, to serve as a historical control to inform the evaluation and care of affected
      patients and to provide a reference for efficacy studies of enzyme replacement or other novel
      therapies.
