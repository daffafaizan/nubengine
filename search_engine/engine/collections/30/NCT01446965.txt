      death may be responsible for up to 50% of total mortality. Wearable defibrillators may reduce
      sudden death by providing immediate detection and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. This
      study is design to demonstrate a reduction in sudden death measured at three months following
      myocardial infarction among patients who have ventricular dysfunction.
