      circulating fatty acids and lipids are influenced by alterations in carbohydrate amount and
      quality. The investigators intend to evaluate if changes in carbohydrate quantity and quality
      (including sugar) influence circulating even-chain saturated fatty acids or if fatty
      acid-derived indices of desaturation and de novo lipogenesis are more sensitive biomarkers of
      carbohydrate intake. By performing untargeted lipidomic analyses, the investigators aim to
      search for novel lipid biomarkers of carbohydrate quantity and quality. The investigators
      also want to evaluate the influence of moderate alterations of carbohydrate and sugar intake
      on lipoproteins, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory proteins.
