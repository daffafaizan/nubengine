      soluble (sST2) isoform. It has a functional ligand (Interleukin-33) and via ST-2/IL-33
      inflammation and immunity is regulated. Hepatic over-expression of IL-33 has been recently
      linked to liver fibrosis. ST-2 exerts pro-inflammatory effects of IL-33. We aimed to
      determine ability of ST2 to predict fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B.
