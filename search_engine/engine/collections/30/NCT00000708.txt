      Usually AMB is given either alone or with FLC to patients with this infection, but these
      treatments are not always effective and both have toxic effects. Animal studies and
      preliminary studies in humans show that FCZ is active in cryptococcal meningitis and suggest
      that it may be less toxic than either AMB or FLC.

      Patients accepted into the study are randomly assigned to FCZ or AMB. Patients assigned to
      FCZ take FCZ by mouth daily for 10 weeks. Patients assigned to AMB are given intravenous
      injections of AMB daily for 6-10 weeks. Non-AIDS patients assigned to AMB also take FLC by
      mouth daily. The use of FLC in patients with AIDS is decided on an individual basis. Patients
      with AIDS who respond satisfactorily to FCZ receive maintenance therapy to prevent relapse
      for an additional 12 months. Patients with AIDS who respond to AMB may qualify for another
      Pfizer Central Research protocol. Patients without AIDS who respond to therapy are observed
      for 6 months for relapse. During therapy, samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (by lumbar
      puncture) are taken periodically in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug
      treatments and to identify possible toxic effects.
