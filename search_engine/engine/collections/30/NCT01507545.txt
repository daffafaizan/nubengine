      far, the most common digestive system cancer. The number of anticipated new cases in 2011 in
      the US is 141,210, being equally distributed between men and women. Tumor endothelial
      marker-1 also referred to as TEM-1 is expressed in the supportive tissue, as well as, on the
      cells within the tumor. TEM-1, which is a cell surface glycoprotein, and is expressed in the
      stromal compartment (cells) of nearly all human tumors. In preclinical studies, it has been
      shown that TEM-1 plays a key role in tumor growth and the vascularization of tumors. There is
      evidence suggesting an association between the level of TEM-1, 7, 7R, 8 in relation to lymph
      node involvement and disease progression. MORAb-004 is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG1/Îº)
      antibody directed against endosialin/TEM-1. Nonclinical pharmacological studies showed that
      MORAb-004 has the ability to block specific TEM-1 receptor-ligand interactions.
      Immunohistochemistry studies of human tumor biopsy samples demonstrate TEM-1 expression and
      MORAb-004 binding to tumor stromal cells, in particular mural cell compartment of neovessels
      and cancer-associated fibroblasts. All of which suggests a potential effective treatment.
      Researchers hypothesize that an antibody therapy which binds to TEM-1 may be efficacious in
      the treatment of metastatic, colorectal cancer. This clinical trial is a proof of concept
      study to see if an anti-TEM-1 agent is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic,
      colorectal cancer.
