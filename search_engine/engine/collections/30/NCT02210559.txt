    
      Each subject may receive up to six cycles of treatment (each treatment cycle is 28 days).
      Tumor tissue will be collected during resection for biomarker analysis. EUS core tumor
      biopsies will be collected pre/post treatment at participating centers. Tumor response will
      be evaluated by changes in CT scan, FDG-PET, CA 19-9, and NCCNÂ® guidelines.

      Subjects who complete 6 cycles of treatment will be evaluated for surgical exploration for
      possible R0 resection. Subjects who undergo surgery will be evaluated for surgical
      complications for an additional 30 days following discharge from surgery. All subjects will
      be followed for safety for 28 days following their last dose with study drug. Blood samples
      will be collected periodically for the assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD).

      All subjects, including those who discontinue from the study during the treatment period
      without evidence of disease progression, will be followed for at least 28 weeks post End of
      Treatment for disease progression, survival, and follow-on treatment for pancreatic cancer.
