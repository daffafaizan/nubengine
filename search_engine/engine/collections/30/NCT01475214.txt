      urinary NTX and nitrogen excretion and on lower extremity performance over a three month
      period. The lower dose is similar to the dose shown in our recent trial to be effective. This
      study is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in which 138
      healthy men and 138 women, age 60 and older, will take potassium bicarbonate in doses of 1.0
      or 1.5 mmol/kg of body weight or placebo daily for three months. Changes in urinary excretion
      of NTX and nitrogen and in measures of lower extremity performance will be compared across
      the three groups. The safety and tolerability of the interventions will also be evaluated.
      This investigation should provide needed information on the appropriate dosing regimen and on
      the study population that should be enrolled in a future bicarbonate intervention trial to
      assess the long-term effects of this simple, low cost intervention on important clinical
      outcomes including rates of loss in bone and muscle mass, falls, and fractures.
