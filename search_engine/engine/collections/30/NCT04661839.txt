    
      This study will be a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      design to assess safety and PK of COVID-HIGIV in healthy adults.

      In total, 56 healthy adult subjects are planned to be enrolled and randomized into two
      cohorts of healthy adult subjects; 28 subjects in cohort A and 28 subjects in cohort B. The
      enrollment/randomization of study subjects will be first initiated for cohort A. Once all
      subjects from cohort A complete Day 29 visit, an interim analysis will be performed to assess
      initial safety and PK of a single IV infusion of three dose levels of COVID-HIGIV in healthy
      adults.

      Eligible subjects for cohort A will be randomized 2:2:2:1 to four study treatment arms to
      receive a single IV infusion of one of three COVID-HIGIV dose levels or saline placebo,
      respectively.

      Eligible subjects for cohort B will be randomized 2:2:2:1 to four study treatment arms to
      receive two IV doses (28 days apart) of one of three COVID-HIGIV dose levels or saline
      placebo, respectively. Enrollment of subjects for cohort B will be initiated following cohort
      A interim Day 29 analysis.

      The enrollment/dosing of the first seven subjects in the study (from cohort A) will be
      staggered. Available safety data will be reviewed by Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) after
      seven subjects from cohort A have completed at least 72 hours of safety follow-up.

      Subjects in cohort A will be followed up for safety and PK up to 84 days post-administration
      of a single dose, while subjects in cohort B will be followed up for safety and PK up to 28
      days post-administration of the initial dose and up to 56 days post-administration of the
      repeat dose.

      The SMC will perform overall ongoing review of safety data during the study.
