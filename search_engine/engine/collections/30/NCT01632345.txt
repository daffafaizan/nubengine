    
      Part I - Dose-Ranging. Part I will evaluate the (1) safety and tolerability and (2) efficacy
      (antiretroviral activity) of 4 doses of doravirine compared with efavirenz, when each is
      given in combination with TRUVADA® for at least 24 weeks in approximately 200 participants. A
      single dose of doravirine will be selected for further study after all participants complete
      the Week 24 visit in Part I. Participants receiving any dose of doravirine in Part I will be
      switched to the selected doravirine dose and continue in the study for up to 96 weeks, but
      will not be randomized to Part II.

      Part II - Selected Dose. Part II will be initiated after the doravirine dose has been
      selected as indicated above for Part 1. Approximately 120 additional participants will be
      randomized in 1:1 ratio to the selected dose of doravirine or efavirenz, each in combination
      with TRUVADA® for 96 weeks of blinded treatment. Part II will evaluate the safety of the
      selected dose compared with efavirenz, particularly with regard to central nervous system
      (CNS) adverse events.
