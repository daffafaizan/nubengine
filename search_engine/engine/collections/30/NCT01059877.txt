      We are seeking to determine if the provision of brief, repeated exposure to 1072nm infrared
      stimulation of the cortex surface improves cognitive and behavioral functioning as indicated
      by normalization of EEG activity, increased cerebral oxygenation and demonstrated improvement
      on standardized neuropsychological measures.

      Intensive near infrared stimulation has been shown to be effective in accelerating healing of
      injuries and functional modification including increasing blood flow and perfusion. Dementia
      research has suggested that hypoperfusion is a significant underlying mechanism in the
      progression of dementia. Infrared spectroscopy has been shown effective in the non-invasive
      measurement of changes in cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. This study therefore seeks to
      explore whether the increasing of regional cerebral perfusion and oxygenation using infrared
      light stimulation will result in improved cognitive and behavioral functioning.
