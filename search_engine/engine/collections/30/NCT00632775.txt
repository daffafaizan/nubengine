      hospitalized children. The main etiology of hyponatremia in these children has been
      attributed to the use of hypotonic maintenance IV fluids. The practice of providing IV
      solutions containing 20-30 mmol/L of Na is based on "physiological needs" proposed by
      Holliday and Segarin 1957, derived from studies of 61 adults and children. The presence of
      non-physiologic ADH secretion in the great majority of hospitalized children due to nausea,
      stress, pain, and surgical interventions, has confirmed that Holliday and Segar's
      recommendations are frequently inappropriately applied. To avoid the development of
      hyponatremia, it has been suggested that isotonic 0.9% NaCl/dextrose 5% should be the
      standard maintenance IV solution.

      The routine use of an isotonic maintenance fluid solution has not yet been studied, and
      concerns exist regarding the potential for hypernatremia and salt and water overload. If
      isotonic solutions are to be recommended routinely, their overall safety, and specifically
      the occurrence of dysnatremias and volume overload, should be evaluated in a controlled
      prospective trial.
