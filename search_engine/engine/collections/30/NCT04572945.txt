      prevalence of CKD was 9.1% (697.5 million cases) in 2017(1). Diabetes is a leading cause of
      end stage renal disease worldwide. (2) Foot abnormalities and amputation are major health
      concerns as they diminish health-related quality of life and cause financial burden (3).

      KDIGO 2020 defines Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as persistently elevated urine albumin
      excretion (â‰¥30 mg/g [3mg/mmol] creatinine), persistently reduced estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2), or both, for greater than 3 months. (4)
      Diabetic foot is defined as either diabetic peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial
      disease, infection, ulceration, or Charcot osteoarthropathy, or a combination of these
      abnormalities, in a person diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, according to the guidelines of
      International Working Group of Diabetic Foot 2020 (IWGDF). (5) There is a much higher
      incidence of diabetic foot disorder in those with renal disease and outcomes are generally
      poorer (2) as CKD patients are sharing three main risk factors of foot ulceration and
      amputation: neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease and increased susceptibility to infection
      with impaired wound healing. (6)

      this research is conducted as little is known about the potential relationship between
      chronic kidney disease and diabetic foot. This research evaluates the true burden of
      different diabetic foot lesions in CKD patients, assesses the severity of diabetic foot in
      different stages of CKD and the factors that may aggravate it in CKD, for future need to
      modify our clinical policies in management of diabetic foot in CKD patients to provide better
      prognosis and prevent long term disabilities.
