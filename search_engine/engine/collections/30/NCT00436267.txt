      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response in patients with unresectable, newly diagnosed or recurrent
           pancreatic cancer and liver metastases treated with selective internal radiotherapy with
           yttrium Y 90 microspheres, selective external radiotherapy with tomotherapy, and
           fluoroucacil.

        -  Determine hepatic and systemic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of time to progression and survival, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Patients undergo
      selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium Y 90 microspheres on day 2 and selective
      external radiotherapy with tomotherapy on day 3.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
