      trial to assess safety and efficacy of Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 in children diagnosed with
      ADHD, according to the DSM-IV. Following screening, the subjects will be randomized to one of
      two treatment groups:Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 or placebo, in a 2:1 manner. This will be
      followed by an open-label extension, in which Phosphatidylserine-Omega3 will be administered
      to all eligible participants.

      Primary measures of attention and behavior will be evaluated using Conners Rating Scale (CRS)
      teacher- rating scales. As a secondary endpoint, the attention and behavior will be measured
      by CRS and strength and difficulties questionnaires (SDQ) parental- and SDQ teacher-rating
      scales, assessment a continuous performance test (TOVA), and parental Child Health
      questionnaire (CHQ). Improvement in ADHD symptoms will be evaluated by Clinical Global of
      Impression - Improvement (CGI-I). Finally, tolerability will be monitored using Barkley Side
      Effects Rating Scale (SERS) and biochemical parameters, such as fatty acid profile and
      monoamines metabolites will be assessed as well.
