      inserts are surgically placed into the periphery of the cornea through a tiny cut that is
      made on the cornea after numbing drops have been applied. A specially designed instrument
      creates a tunnel by separating the tissue layers in the outside periphery of the cornea, the
      INTACS inserts are placed into this tunnel where they remain. One or two ophthalmic sutures
      will be placed to close the incision. A postoperative care information booklet will be given
      to the patients; patients will be followed by means of postoperative appointments for up to
      12 months after the surgery. The visits/testing schedules are listed below:

      Pre-OR visit (1.5 hours): Visual Acuity (VA), Refraction, Topography, Keratometry, Glare
