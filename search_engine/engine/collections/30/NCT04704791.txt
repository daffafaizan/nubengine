      in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) to minimize systemic embolization risk. Flow
      modeling demonstrates that the anatomy of the LAA results in decreased velocities in the LAA
      apex. Introduction of a 3-4mm shunt in the apex can result in increased velocity, less stasis
      and a lower propensity for thrombus formation. Small (<8mm) inter-chamber shunts can exist in
      humans with no long term hemodynamic consequences in otherwise structurally normal hearts -
      making a strategy of pulmonary artery (PA) to LAA shunt an attractive potential therapy given
      anatomic proximity and gradient differential between the cardiac chambers.

      This will be a 5 patient first-in-human feasibility study. The population will include
      patients undergoing CABG or other cardiovascular surgery with AF and a CHADS2 score >1 in
      whom the treating team deems traditional therapy with anticoagulants is prohibitive or
      ineffective (dialysis or EGFR preoperatively <15, previous bleeding with non-reversible
      pathology, clinically deemed contraindicated to oral anticoagulant). The intervention will be
      PA-LAA shunt creation at the time of surgery. As this is a single arm study there will be no
      comparison group.
