      pruritus. The intensity of pruritus will be evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) score
      (0 [no pruritus]-10 most severe pruritus]) and a detailed questionnaire assessing various
      characteristics of pruritus at baseline . The patients with the intensity of pruritus VAS
      score more than 5 will be randomized to narrow band UVB and control group. Phototherapy was
      administered to the whole body surface 2-3 sessions per week for total 18 sessions in a UV
      irradiation cubicle. The dose increased from 210mJ/cm2 .Doses were increased by 10 % at every
      session. The control group received time-matched exposures to long-wave ultraviolet light.
      The investigator will determine the pruritic intensity at baseline every 3 sessions by VAS
      score and by detailed questionnaire at baseline and after 18 sessions. The blood sample will
      also be collected at baseline and after treatment to determine factors associated with
      improvement.
