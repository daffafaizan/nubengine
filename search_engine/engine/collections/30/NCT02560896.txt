      to family members. The intervention is to offer a deceased research participant's actionable
      germline genetic research finding, and depending upon the choice made by the next of kin, a
      disclosure of the research finding by a genetic counselor in a family conference call. Using
      mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative), the investigators will assess decision making,
      family communication, and actions and responses in individuals from families in which a
      proband is known to have a deleterious germline mutation in one of several known cancer
      susceptibility genes.
