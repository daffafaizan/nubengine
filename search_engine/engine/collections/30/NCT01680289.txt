      practitioners. These systems are based on the use of an acid conditioner to remove the smear
      layer and demineralize the enamel and dentin. After the removal of the conditioner by
      rinsing, a mixture containing the primer and adhesive - i.e. one bottle adhesives - is
      applicated over the demineralized tissues. The polymerization of the adhesive monomers into
      microporosities created by acid conditioning forms the structure knowing as hybrid layer or
      resin-dentin interdifusion zone. A common problem related to total etch technique is the
      incomplete infiltration of adhesive monomers through demineralized dentin, resulting in the
      presence of a zone of unprotected collagen fibrils beneath the hybrid layer that is prone to
      enzymatic degradation. According to some laboratory studies, consecutive application of
      multiple adhesive coats results in quantitative and qualitative improvements in dental
      adhesion. In addition to increasing the values of bond strength to dentin, consecutive
      application of multiple adhesive layers enhances the infiltration of adehesive monomers
      through demineralized dentin, resulting in a more homogenous hybrid layer.
