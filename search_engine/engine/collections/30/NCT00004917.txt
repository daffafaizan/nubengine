      Primary

        -  Determine whether epoetin alfa given during definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy
           improves the local-regional control rate in anemic patients with squamous cell carcinoma
           of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether this drug improves survival in this patient population.

        -  Identify patterns in first failure in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is a significant increase in hemoglobin level between the
           baseline value and the value at 28 days after starting epoetin alfa in these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to stage (I/II vs
      III/IV without chemotherapy vs III/IV with chemotherapy), pretreatment hemoglobin level (9.0
      to less than 11.5 g/dL vs 11.5 to 13.5 g/dL), and gender. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients with stage I or II disease undergo radiotherapy once daily for 6-7
           weeks. Patients with stage III or IV disease undergo radiotherapy once daily for 3.5
           weeks and then twice daily (6 hours apart) for 2.5 weeks for a total of 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning 7-10 days before
           radiotherapy, patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly until the end of
           radiotherapy.

      Patients with stage III/IV disease may receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days
      1 and 22 of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 372 patients (186 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3.5 years.
