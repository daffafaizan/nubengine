      Congestive heart failure (CHF) has become the number one reason for hospitalization in the
      United States. Diastolic heart dysfunction is becoming increasingly recognized as a
      significant factor in the etiology of CHF. Of the total affected population, 70% of patients
      with diastolic heart failure are female, the majority of which are elderly. There is
      currently no effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of diastolic heart
      dysfunction. Existing cross-sectional studies and limited training trials supporting the
      hypothesis that exercise may improve diastolic function have only studied men. There is a
      need for more properly controlled and adequately powered studies examining the effect of
      exercise training on diastolic function, particularly in populations at high risk for CHF,
      such as sedentary, postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A total of 215 sedentary, postmenopausal women at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease
      will be randomly assigned to receive either exercise training or no exercise for six months.
      This study will measure diastolic heart function using novel echocardiographic measurements,
      such as pulmonary vein flow pattern, tissue Doppler, and color M-mode mitral inflow
      propagation velocity. The study will also measure the left ventricular mass.
