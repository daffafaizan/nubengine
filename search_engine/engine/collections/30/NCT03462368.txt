      of periodontopathogenic bacteria with absence of systemic side effects and minimal bacterial
      resistance. Also, it has properties of root demineralization and exposure of collagen fibers.
      These properties may enhance root coverage in procedures of subepithelial connective graft.
      Laser photobiomodulation has the potential to increase healing and repair, this can generate
      gains in the root coverage and dental hypersensitivity.
