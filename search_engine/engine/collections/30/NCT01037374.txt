      anesthesiologists. In our study, the resident class will be our sample population. The
      residents will be randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group will be utilizing
      the new preoperative airway assessment form and the control group will be utilizing the
      standard anesthesia record. Simultaneously, a subset of our anesthesia experts will also be
      assessing patients preoperatively. The five areas of difficult airway management will be
      considered: difficult mask ventilation, difficult supraglottic airway, difficult
      laryngoscopy, difficult intubation, and difficult surgical airway.

      According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the incidence of intubation has
      remained stable throughout the 1980s and 1990s despite attempts to predict its occurrence.
      Many of these cases were considered to be preventable; therefore, a better prediction of and
      preparation for difficult airway management may lead to a reduction in adverse events.
