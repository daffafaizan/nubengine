    
      This is a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial. Participants who meet eligibility
      criteria will undergo baseline testing that involves completing questionnaires and objective
      cognitive tests. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by coin toss) to the
      intervention or control group. After participating in their respective workshops, both groups
      will undergo immediate post-testing and 1-month follow-up post testing. After the final
      assessment, the control group will be given the opportunity to participate in the
      intervention workshop. No further testing of this group will occur, as there will no longer
      be a comparable control group.
