    
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of an
      eight-week self-administered intervention program (bibliotherapy) based on Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy with minimal therapeutic support in the management of chronic pain.

      This study was based on the following hypotheses. In comparison to the control group, from
      pre to post, the self-help program will:

        1. significantly reduce pain-related disability (primary variable);

        2. improve depressive symptoms related to CP (secondary variable);

        3. increase the level of pain acceptance;

        4. reduce psychological inflexibility linked to painful symptoms (process variables).

           It was also expected that:

        5. the improvements would be maintained at three-month follow-up;

        6. participants would have an overall impression of a positive change following the
           intervention.
