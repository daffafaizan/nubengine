    
      Bacteremia is a serious manifestation of Staphylococcus aureus infection with an attributable
      mortality as high as 25% in MRSA bacteremia. More than a third of patients end up with
      complications such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis or pneumonia.

      Overall the outcome of patients with respect to mortality or recurrence is better in patients
      who have an eradicable focus and have received an appropriate antibiotic dose and duration.
      Also complicated bacteremia is more common in patients with

        -  persistent bacteremia or fever

        -  prosthetic device

        -  new murmur

        -  skin findings of a systemic infection

      Based on this evidence, an ID consultation could improve the outcomes of patients with SAB by

        -  Advising adequate antibiotic dosage and duration

        -  Sourcing out and counselling eradication of any focus of infection
