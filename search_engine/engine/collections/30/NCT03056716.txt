      investigators started to recruit patients for the study in June 2009. Pneumonectomy,
      decortication, and diaphragm plication patients were not included in this study. The patients
      were consecutively placed in one of the two groups. In Group I, an apical 28FR size CD, and a
      basal 19FR SD were placed following surgery. In Group II, the apical drain was 28FR, and the
      basal drain was 32FR CDs. Basal drains were removed out when daily serous fluid drainage
      became 200 ml or less, and the apical were removed 48-72 hours following the cessation of air
      leak. The patients were discharged on the day after drain removal. The data concerning
      gender, age, diagnosis, operation side, type of operation, amount of fluid drainage, duration
      of fluid and air drainage, length of hospital stay, and complications if any, were noted.
