    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of ALLN 177 compared with placebo in reducing the urinary excretion of oxalate in
      subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. ALLN-177 is an orally administered
      form of oxalate decarboxylase. The goal of therapy with ALLN-177 is to reduce urinary oxalate
      excretion by decreasing the absorption of oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to 28 days of treatment with ALLN-177 (7,500 units) or
      placebo three times daily with meals. Urinary oxalate excretion will be assessed by 24-hr
      urine collections throughout the study.

      The study allows for approximately 66 subjects. The number of enrolled subjects may be
      increased to a maximum of 100 following an interim analysis.
