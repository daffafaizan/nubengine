      reproductive age. The most frequent cause of iron deficiency in infants at 6 months of life
      is poor nutrition during a period of rapid growth and a diet lacking in iron rich foods.
      Children who suffered from anemia in infancy demonstrated slower cognitive development, were
      low achievers in school and had a high rate of behavioral disturbances.

      The Ministry of Health implements a primary prevention program for anemia. If by making iron
      supplements more accessible would increase parental compliance in acquisition of the iron
      supplement and subsequently reduce the rate of iron deficiency anemia, the result would be
      the immediate application of the finding. It is possible to implement a program whereby the
      supplement will be directly available at the family health centers for purchase by the
      parent.
