      including infant formula, solid foods such as mixed meat and vegetable preparation or
      marketed preparations will be recruited. Children will be recruited in the Lausanne Childrens
      hospital and only be included in the study whenin good general health.

      FreeStyle® Libre Pro Interstitial Glucose Meter will be applied on the last day before
      discharge from the hospital after skin preparation with anesthetic cream (Emla®) during
      hospitalization and measurements will be recorded during 2-5 days.

      It is not intended to measure capillary or venous blood glucose levels during this study.
      However, if blood is collected during hospitalization, blood glucose will be measured in
      parallel with the interstitial glucose measured with the device.

      The child will follow his usual diet without modifications. The amount of food consumed by
      the child as well as the length of the meals will be recorded by the parents. For meals made
      by the parents they will be asked to keep a sample not seen to analyze their carbohydrate
      content. The total carbohydrate content will be measured .
