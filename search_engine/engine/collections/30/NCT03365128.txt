      to mitigate altitude-induced hypoxic events. To do so, the invesitgators propose the
      following aims:

        1. Determine the ability of a portable oxygen storage device to reverse hypobaric hypoxemia
           in volunteers at altitude.

        2. Determine the duration of time that a single portable oxygen container can maintain
           normoxia in normal volunteers at altitude.

        3. Determine the optimum dose and timing of oxygen use to reverse hypobaric hypoxemia.
