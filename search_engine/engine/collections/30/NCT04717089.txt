      The Matched Case-Control study, with the aim of analyzing the clinical efficacy of TMH
      Extended post-anesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 in a value-based healthcare model. We
      included all postoperative patients admitted in TMH Extended post-anesthetic care in PACU
      during COVID epidemics, excluding patients awaiting ICU in the ordinary recovery room or
      patients requiring level 3 intensive care on arrival in the recovery room. Three activation
      periods of æ°´xtended post-anesthetic care in PACU service (10 Feb - 26 Apr 2020 / 27 Jul - 13
      Sep 2020 / 14 Dec 2020 - 28 Feb 2021), and performed case matching with the postoperative
      patient with similar clinical characteristics entering intensive care unit directly in recent
      10 years, with each case matched with specifically 5 control. We evaluate the value-based
      health care efficacy, including the amount of healthcare expenditure based on bed occupancy
      and manpower, rate of elective discharge to intensive care unit from extended post-anesthetic
      care in PACU, rate of unanticipated intensive care admission within 48hrs upon discharge to
      the general ward, and length of hospital stay, and the total number of ICU bed spared.

      The staff attitude survey, with the aim to investigate the staff perception towards the
      implementation of TMH extended post-anesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 pandemics based
      on the Technology Acceptance Model in healthcare. We designed a questionnaire based on
      Technology Acceptance Model, and distributed it to medical and nursing staff involved in
      extended post anaesthetic care in PACU service, and evaluate the perceived usefulness,
      perceived ease of use, social influence of subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control
      of facilitating condition. A differential analysis would be conducted for the evaluation.
