      are reversible by implementing a pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention for older adults
      within primary care practices. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: the
      deprescribing intervention group or usual care; the intervention group will receive a
      pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention, while the usual care group will receive care as
      usually provided by their primary and/or specialty care providers. The target population will
      be primary care older adults with subjective cognitive decline or make at least one error on
      a cognitive screening test, but do not have dementia, and are currently using a strong
      anticholinergic medication. The intervention and follow-up data collection will occur over 24
      months in order to test the long-term impact of the intervention on the planned clinical
      outcomes. Study outcomes include cognition (primary) and safety (secondary) through validated
      self-reported scales.
