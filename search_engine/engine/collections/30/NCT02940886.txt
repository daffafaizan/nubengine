      as inflammatory bowel diseases, menstruating or pregnant women, and subjects who have
      undergone bariatric procedure or surgery. IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of
      life (QoL) burden. Treatment of subjects diagnosed with IDA includes controlling the bleeding
      and replenishing lost iron.

      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose compared with iron sucrose in subjects diagnosed with IDA. In a subfraction of
      35 subjects treated with iron isomaltoside/ferric derisomaltose, ECG and iron will be
      frequently measured.

      The study subjects received either a single intravenous (IV) dose of iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose (1000 mg at baseline) or iron sucrose (200 mg IV injections at baseline and
      repeated according to standard practice or physician choice up to a maximum of five times
      within the first two weeks starting at baseline; a cumulative dose of 1000 mg was
      recommended). The study subjects were monitored for up to 8 weeks from baseline.
