      soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) (massage performed by applying light pressure to the skin
      with a tool) on pain, functionality and performance will be investigated in athletes with
      iliotibial band tightness. There are studies on both IASTM and Foam Roller Massage in the
      literature and they are popular applications recently. However, within our knowledge, when we
      look at the Turkish and English literature, no study has been found that compares these two
      therapeutic massages in terms of pain, functionality and performance.

      Purpose Poor posture, facial traumas and stiffness cause tension in the fascia of that region
      and result in pain. This disrupts the complementary mechanism of the fascia, causing the
      structures attached to the fascia to be out of the normal sequence. Facial problems have an
      important place in athletes. Facial problems cause pain in the athlete, reducing the
      athlete's sportive performance and negatively affecting their functionality. In order to
      prevent these limitations and accelerate the recovery, the rehabilitation process is started
      after the surgery. Various exercises and myofascial massages are routinely applied to
      problems seen in athletes. Myofascial massage techniques can be used in athletes' problems
      for many positive reasons such as effective in a short time, rapid results, high success
      rate, risk-free and painless if experts do. Thanks to the findings to be obtained from our
      study, it is aimed to contribute to the literature with objective, evidence-based results in
      this field.
