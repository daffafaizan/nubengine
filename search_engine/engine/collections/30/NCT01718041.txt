    
      In Phase 1b, separate cohorts of patients will be tested in a single ascending dose format.
      Safety review committee meetings will take place prior to escalating to each increasing dose
      level. Enrolled patients will be monitored for 60 days for safety with PK/PD and safety labs
      collected.

      Two dose levels will be selected after completion of Phase 1b to be tested during Phase 2a (6
      months of continuous VRS-317 treatment). Safety and PK assessments will be made during the
      Phase 2a stage. Patient heights will be measured by stadiometer.
