      reorganization and influences neuronal excitability acting on Trk/A and p75 associated
      receptors. Moreover, recent observations indicated that NGF-induced DO and noxious input
      depend on the interaction of NGF with TRPV1, that is over-expressed in overactive bladders
      and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome. From a clinical point of view, a decrease
      in urinary NGF levels has been detected in patients with DO treated with onab/A. Although
      there are some evidence on the ability of onab/A to improve DO and to reduce bladder and
      urinary content of NGF, how onab/A influences NGF expression and the expression of TrKa, p75
      and TRPV1 receptors is still unclear.
