    
      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of
      subjects with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Eligible subjects will be assigned in a 3:1
      ratio (8 subjects in each cohort) to receive qd or bid treatment for 15 days with oral CF-102
      or with placebo. Dose escalation will occur in 2 sequential cohorts.

      The decision to continue dosing within a cohort (eg, Subcohort 1a to Subcohort 1b), or to
      escalate to a new dose level Cohort (eg, Subcohort 1b to Subcohort 2a) will be determined by
      a blinded independent review of safety data. This review will be conducted by a qualified
      Safety Review Committee comprising the medical monitor, the consulting toxicologist, and an
      independent expert clinician.

      For the first 2 cohorts, subjects will return to the study center for follow-up assessments
      on Days 8, 15, and 22. Subjects dosed qd will receive a total of 15 doses of CF-102. Subjects
      dosed bid will receive a total of 29 doses. The 30th dose has been deleted to accommodate PK
      sampling on the morning of Day 16, 24 hours after the last dose of CF-102.

      For the 3rd cohorts, subjects will return to the study center for follow-up assessments on
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 18.
