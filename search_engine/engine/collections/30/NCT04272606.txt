    
      This study is to assess whether tranexamic acid (a drug that is used to coagulate the blood
      and reduce bleeding) use in lumbar spinal fusion can reduce blood loss compared to placebo.
      Thusly reducing need for transfusion, shorting the hospital stay and improving outcomes. For
      this the study will randomize patients who are receiving elective lumbar interbody fusion
      (PLIF or TLIF) of 2 or more levels for degenerative disc disease (DDD) into 2 groups. Group 1
      would receive tranexamic acid during the surgery while group 2 will receive placebo. Blood
      loss during the surgery and postoperatively (while the patient has a drain) will be monitored
      along with the amount of transfusions needed and the duration of hospital stay.

      The drug or placebo are only given during the surgery. The patient population includes
      elective cases of patient undergoing lumbar spinal fusion of 2 or more levels. Spinal fusions
      are known to be associated with blood loss, especially when the surgeries are long and more
      levels need to be fused.
