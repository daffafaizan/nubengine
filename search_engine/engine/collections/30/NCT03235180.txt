      vascularity imaging for Crohn's Disease (CD) evaluation. Literature evidences demonstrate
      that bowel stiffness is correlated with fibrosis, while bowel vascularity and perfusion is
      correlated with inflammation. Therefore, the investigators expect the combination of shear
      wave elastography and vascularity imaging can increase the sensitivity and specificity of CD
      evaluation.

      Ultrasound is safe, cost-effective, and widely accessible, thus provides an attractive
      alternative to the clinical standard Computed Tomography (CT), risks of radiation)) and
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), more expensive and limited accessibility)).

      Because ultrasound may not be able to image bowel loops deep in the body, its main role is
      for follow-up after initial screening by CT or MRI, especially for terminal ileum, which is
      easily accessible by ultrasound and the most frequently affected bowel segment for CD.
