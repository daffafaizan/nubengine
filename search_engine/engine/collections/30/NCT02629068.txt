      adolescents who are more experienced to help other parents better engage in services for
      their adolescent child. This pilot study marks the beginning of our long-term program of
      research focused on adapting intervention tools for delivery via e-technology platforms as a
      means for optimizing treatment effectiveness for youth. Thus, the proposed study will
      contribute to the scientific literature on the role of parental support in adolescent
      recovery as well as respond to NIDA's call for increased understanding of the feasibility and
      utility of social media as an option expanding the traditional treatment and face-to-face
      self-help groups. The proposed study has the following aims:

      Aim 1: To develop PURPOSE, a social-media based intervention that provides information and
      coping tools for parents/guardians of adolescent children with a SUD. The theoretically
      grounded intervention will be peer-led, and will be developed and refined with feedback from
      experts, providers, parents, and adolescents.

      Aim 2: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of PURPOSE that uses online peer-led
      intervention delivery. Trial testing will be conducted to iteratively refine content and
      procedures in order to optimize the engagement and usefulness of the intervention for
      parents.

      Aim 3: To conduct a pilot control trial to provide preliminary data on this intervention so
      as to determine if social media-based parent support group involvement positively impacts
      parent outcomes (reduced stigma and distress, improved parent monitoring, and increased
      engagement in adolescent treatment) and adolescent outcomes (treatment retention and
      abstinence).
