    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the use
      of the UltheraÂ® System in combination with the 70W Alma Pixel CO2 laser for efficacious
      results in the treatment of abdominal striae rubra and striae alba. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of three treatment groups. Study personnel conducting efficacy measures
      will be blinded to the assigned treatment groups.

      Changes from baseline in overall skin texture and appearance of abdominal striae will be
      assessed at study follow-up visits. 2D images, 3D images and patient satisfaction
      questionnaires will be obtained.
