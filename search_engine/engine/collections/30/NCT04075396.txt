      lung cancer (NSCLC). Lazertinib is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) targets both the
      T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild type-EGFR. The study will be
      conducted in participants with EGFR mutation positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Study Parts A, B, and C are sponsored by Yuhan Corporation under protocol identifier
      YH25448-201 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03046992), and Study Part D is sponsored by
      Janssen Research and Development, LLC under protocol identifier 73841937NSC2001. In Part D,
      Lazertinib will be given to participants outside Korea, including Caucasians, in order to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy (including tumor response) and Pharmacokinetics (PK)
      in participants outside of Korea. The duration of this study will be up to 2 years. Study
      treatment should be held in all participants with suspected (symptomatic) or documented
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive disease, until recovery
      from all infection related symptoms, and documented to be negative for SARS-CoV-2.
