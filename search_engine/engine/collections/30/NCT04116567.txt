      paralysis, high concentrations of oxygen, inadequate level of PEEP, capnoperitoneum,
      Trendelenburg position all result in persistent atelectasis. Lung ultrasound is a safe and
      accurate bedside tool useful to study lung aeration. The aim of the investigator's study was
      to assess the impact of general anesthesia and laparoscopic gynecologic oncologic surgery on
      post-operative atelectasis and related oxygenation changes using lung ultrasound.
