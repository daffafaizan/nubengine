    
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JMT103 in patients with
      bone metastases from solid tumors.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive JMT103 120mg subcutaneously (SC) every
      4 weeks (Q4W), 120mg subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks (Q8W) and 180mg subcutaneously (SC)
      every 8 weeks (Q8W) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will receive the treatment until the
      completion of 48 weeks of treatment, intolerable toxicity, loss to follow-up, withdrawal
      (patient's decision or investigator's decision), whichever comes first.
