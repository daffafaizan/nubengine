      years, is still associated to a post-operative mortality and morbidity: myocardial
      infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, Stroke.

      These complications are often due to ischaemia - reperfusion injury event. Recent studies
      showed that in case of cellular stress (in particular during the reperfusion after ischaemia)
      a not specific pore, called Mitochondrial permeability transition Pore (MPTP), could be
      opened. That caused the loss of ion homeostasis, then cell death as well as by apoptosis as
      by necrosis.

      Prevent the opening of this MPTP during the myocardial reperfusion after coronary bypass, for
      example, is an important objective to improve the cardioprotection.

      The Cyclosporin A, prevents the MPTP from opening. Several studies have shown an
      cytoprotection led by cyclosporin A, after ischaemia reperfusion in several models as
      isolated rats heart, in vivo rats heart and ex vivo myocardial ( atrial ) human tissues.

      Recently, a multicentric study performed in humans, during the acute phase of myocardial
      infarction, showed a reduction of infarct size by approximately 40% in the cyclosporine group
      compared to control group.
