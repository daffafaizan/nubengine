      disorder of unknown cause characterized by chronic edema or acute transient, severe episodes
      of hypotension, hypovolemia, and oliguria. Severe edema results from leakage of fluid and
      macromolecules (200-900 kDa) into tissues. Acute SCLS episodes carry a high morbidity and
      mortality (25-30%). Fewer than 500 cases have been reported worldwide since 1960, although
      the disease may be underdiagnosed due to the nonspecific nature of the presenting signs and
      symptoms and the considerable overlap with other shock syndromes including sepsis,
      anaphylaxis, and angioedema. Approximately 85% of such individuals have a monoclonal
      gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), but the relationship of this finding to disease
      pathogenesis is unclear. This protocol will focus on the pathogenesis of SCLS. Subjects with
      documented episodes of capillary leak will be evaluated in order to correlate both clinical
      and laboratory features that are typical of SCLS. The goal is to identify biological factors
      and/or genetic and molecular events that may predispose to SCLS episodes. We plan to enroll
      up to 270 total subjects, in this study, which includes affected subjects, family members,
      and healthy volunteers. We anticipate that our findings may be a first step toward the
      development of new targeted therapies.
