      ventilation image-guided personalized radiotherapy. The investigators will deliver
      personalized radiotherapy treatments that selectively avoid irradiating highly-functional
      lung regions for lung cancer patients, and follow up patients to assess the safety and
      feasibility. The primary hypothesis to be tested is: 4D CT ventilation image-guided
      personalized radiotherapy can be delivered safely for lung cancer.
