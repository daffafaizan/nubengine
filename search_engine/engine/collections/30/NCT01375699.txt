      cardioprotection would require a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving large numbers
      of patients and many years of follow-up. It is appropriate to demonstrate that concurrent
      administration of sildenafil and doxorubicin is safe and tolerable. Second, in definitive
      studies it might be helpful to incorporate early markers of cardiac injury in order to gain
      early insight into cardioprotective effects, but there are no such established markers. As a
      correlative study, multiple intermediate markers will be tested. In order to investigate
      these candidate markers it is appropriate to study patients receiving doxorubicin alone, as
      early markers of injury may not be apparent in patients treated with the combination. In
      order to accomplish these two goals the trial is a randomized trial involving a
      sildenafil/doxorubicin group and a doxorubicin group.
