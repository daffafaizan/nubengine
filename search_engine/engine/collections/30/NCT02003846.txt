      intensive care units (NICU) use an underwater bubbling system and others use a ventilator to
      generate the pressure. There is no right or wrong way to generate the pressure and both
      methods are approved and accepted.

      The aim of this study is to compare the two systems of Nasal CPAP by placing the baby on each
      for a defined time period and reviewing the infant's vital signs. The investigators expect
      that the pressure generated by bubble CPAP will be better and lead to improved vital signs.
