      treated for major depression using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (according to
      standard care) also will undergo EEG recording before Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation treatment begins, and at the completion of treatment. The Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale will be given to participants by the neuropsychiatrist at baseline and weekly
      intervals till the completion of treatment.

      The neuropsychiatrist investigators expect to see about 12 patients per year who meet
      treatment criteria for Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Therefore, it is
      expected to recruit 24 subjects into the research study over a two-year period.
