    
      In women with endometrioma who plan to undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, surgical
      technique can influence postoperative ovarian function because of removal of normal ovarian
      tissue with ovarian cyst and damage to ovarian tissue during bleeding control after stripping
      of endometrioma. This study is designed to compare hemostatic sealant to suturing in terms of
      hemostatic function, safety and preservation of ovarian function.

      Ovarian function of all patients will be evaluated on pre op, post op 12 weeks, post op 48
      weeks by measuring AMH and ovarian volume. And Hemostatic function will be evaluated by
      measuring serum hemoglobin, blood loss during operation, etc.
