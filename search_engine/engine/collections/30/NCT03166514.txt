      relatively high in dietary fiber. The fiber contained within this product is
      isomalto-oligoshaccaride (IMO) which is a food ingredient with a relative sweetness level
      equal to approximately 60% of sucrose. Chemically, IMO is a mixture of glucose oligomers with
      alpha - (1-6) - linkages. To date, no research has been performed on the glycemic response to
      ingesting IMO in combination with other constituents. Therefore the purpose of this study is
      to determine the glycemic index of the Fitjoy bar.
