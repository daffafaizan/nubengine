      paralysis in patients receiving interscalene brachial plexus nerve block with prolonged
      neural blockade. English speaking ASA 1-3 patients ages 18-80 receiving prolonged
      interscalene nerve block will be randomized into 3 groups first group receiving a perineural
      catheter infusing 0.2% ropivacaine; the second group receiving a single shot injection of
      10mL liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel; n=20) plus 5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine and the third group
      receiving 20mL liposomal bupivacaine plus 5mL bupivacaine (to be determined by the attending
      anesthesiologist). Primary outcome will be incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis
      postoperative day 1 as measured by point of care (POCUS) ultrasound. Secondary outcomes
      include incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis as measured by point of care ultrasound
      (POCUS) in the immediate postoperative period, postoperative day (POD) 1, POD2, and POD3 and
      noninvasive measures of pulmonary gas exchange at pre-op, post-op, POD1, POD2, and POD3.
      Additionally, the investigators will look at pain scores (scale of 0-10) and opioid
      consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) at previously defined time points listed above.
      Furthermore, the investigators will record known side effects of interscalene blocks
      including hoarseness and Horner's syndrome.
