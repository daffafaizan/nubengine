      macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, the choice of treatment remains largely
      controversial. For these patients, transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE) is
      recommended as a palliative therapy.

      On the other hand, many authors still believe that hepatic resection is the only potential
      curative treatment in these patients because it is still feasible to remove all macroscopic
      tumors safely at surgery. With advances in surgical techniques, more large/multiple HCCs are
      now resectable, and long-term results have been reported that ranged from 30% to 58% at 5
      years; even patients with large bilobar multiple HCC could reach a survival rate of more than
      20% at 5 years after hepatic resection.

      Until now, there have been only a few studies that compared the outcomes of hepatic resection
      and TACE in the treatment of multiple HCCs, and these have reported controversial results.
      Some studies showed that hepatic resection had survival benefi t over TACE, but other studies
      showed the opposite result ( 11-15 ). Therefore, the investigators performed this prospective
      study in consecutive patients with large/multiple, and resectable HCCs to compare the
      outcomes in patients who underwent hepatic resection or TACE as the initial treatment.
