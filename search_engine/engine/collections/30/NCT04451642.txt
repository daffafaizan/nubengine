      or combined with general anesthesia. Due to ultrasound, peripheral nerve blocks have been
      increased their importance in locoregional anaesthesia. They provide excellent intraoperative
      and postoperative analgesia, decreasing the need for intravenous opioids which increase
      postoperative nausea and vomiting which may prolong hospital stay.

      However, peripheral nerve blocks may be associated with postoperative complications,
      especially neurological ones. Classically, interscalene brachial plexus block produced a 100%
      incidence of phrenic nerve paralysis with resultant pulmonary compromise. Little literature
      has published a following of complications.

      The primary study objective is to analyze retrospectively the use of peripheral nerve blocks
      in the current practice of a specialized regional anaesthesia division. The secondary
      objectives are assessed the patients characteristics of our sample, local anaesthetic dose
      used, the peripheral nerve block operator, the nerve location technique, the surgery and the
      complication rate after peripheral nerve block.

      This is an observational, retrospective and unicenter study. 1346 patients scheduled for the
      surgery needed a peripheral nerve block were enrolled.
