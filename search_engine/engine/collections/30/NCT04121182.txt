      Depending on the series, 9 to 50% of residents with pneumonia should be transferred. This
      reflects the difficulties faced by nursing home care teams in these situations. The
      respiratory symptomatology of nursing home residents is difficult to grasp and the prescribed
      antibiotic therapy is often considered inappropriate (25% to 75% of cases). Prevention of
      resident pneumonia, such as vaccination against pneumococcus remains poorly practiced,
      influenza vaccination teams or vitamin D supplementation.

      In addition to the risk of mortality, lung diseases are often the cause of a rapid functional
      decline. Preventing pneumonia in nursing homes is therefore an important issue in the
      prevention of dependence, the quality of life, the health care system (use of hospitalization
      and transfer to emergencies) and health expenditure. In this vulnerable population, a
      prevention intervention seems particularly relevant.

      In this research project, the investigators hypothesize that a multi-domain prevention
      intervention for pneumonia carried out by nursing teams in nursing homes can reduce the
      incidence of pneumonia. They also believe that this action would reduce emergency transfers
      and health expenditures.
