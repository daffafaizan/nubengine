      Delivery System to consistently deliver dialysate of the appropriate quality for infusion.
      The safety will be evaluated by comparing the adverse event rate in the DBB-EXA ES
      Hemodialysis group (investigational) vs. the standard dialysis group (control).

      The study population will include eligible adult patients diagnosed with chronic renal
      failure requiring routine dialysis treatments for a minimum of 90 days and with a minimum of
      3 weekly sessions. Treatment duration will be at the discretion of the investigator. The
      duration of study participation for each subject is approximately eight (8) weeks; four (4)
      weeks of routine dialysis and four (4) weeks of treatment dialysis. The expected total study
      duration across all subjects (from recruitment to last subject visits) is approximately five
      (5) to six (6) months, dependent upon subject recruitment/enrollment and meeting 360
      evaluable treatments. A minimum of 30 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study
      ensuring a minimum of 360 evaluable treatments in the treatment arm.
