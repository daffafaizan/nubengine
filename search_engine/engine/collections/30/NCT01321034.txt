    
      Open-label 12-week study, 1g/20 mg day of Niacin/Laropiprant for 4-weeks followed by 8
      additional weeks of 2 g/40 mg day. Subjects with normal Lp(a) will be use as comparative
      group for the other two groups, so no placebo group is required is this study.

      Subjects: volunteers from the Lipid Clinic of Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet of
      Zaragoza, Spain. Subjects were selected according to their previously determined
      Lp(a)concentration. All volunteers before any study procedure will have to give written
      inform consent to a protocol previously approved for the Ethical Committees of our
      institutions.

      Biochemical determinations: lipids: total cholesterol and triglycerides; lipoproteins:
      HDL-cholesterol, Lp(a); apolipoproteins: Apo A1 and apo B and safety biochemical parameters
      (glucose, uric acid, creatinine, liver and muscle enzymes will be measured at baseline and at
      the end of the two treatment periods (weeks 4 and 8).

      An adverse experience questionnaire will be done in each visit. Genetic analysis: apo(a)
      genetic polymorphism responsible of the Lp(a) size variability will be analyzed by a
      PCR-based methodology (Lanktree et al. J Lipid Res 2009; 50: 768-72 ).
