      favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause
      of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel
      biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early
      primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular
      interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in
      later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular
      health in the longer term.

      We have thus designed the Early Vascular Study to investigate the long-term impact of early
      life exposures, with a particular focus on the impact of preterm birth, in the presence or
      absence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in the mother, on the cardiovascular system in
      young adulthood. This study also allows investigation of the long term impact of perinatal
      interventions used in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures
      of cardiovascular structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular
      phenotype. This is combined with blood sample collection to study changes in molecular and
      metabolic markers and pathways.
