      fertility and early pregnancy loss. Classical methods of conducting prospective pregnancy
      studies with preconception enrollment to answer these questions are time-consuming in terms
      of recruitment efforts and expensive to carry out. The purpose of this project is to assess
      the feasibility of conducting an Internet-based prospective pregnancy study with
      preconception enrollment in the United States using the gold standard data collection
      approach of daily diaries during the trying to conceive period. We will accomplish this by
      enrolling 200 females of reproductive age who attempting to conceive and following them for
      up to 12 months and through pregnancy for those who become pregnant. Feasibility will be
      assessed by measuring: the number of women who screen eligible, the number of women who
      enroll, and compliance with journal use over time. We will also estimate the incidence of
      infertility, pregnancy and pregnancy loss as well as compare the demographics of women who
      enroll to the demographics of women who participate in community-based prospective pregnancy
      studies with preconception enrollment. The data from this project will be used to assess the
      feasibility of launching a larger prospective pregnancy study that is appropriately powered
      to examine the impact of preconceptional lifestyle factors on the incidence of infertility
      and early pregnancy loss.
