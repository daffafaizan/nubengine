    
      IMCgp100 is a bispecific biologic incorporating an engineered T cell receptor (TCR) specific
      for a peptide antigen derived from the protein gp100 presented in the context of HLA A2 on
      the surface of melanoma cells. The TCR is fused to an anti-CD3 antibody single-chain variable
      fragment (scFv) that recruits and activates non-melanoma specific T cells (killer T cells) in
      physical contact with the cancer T cell. This is a Phase I study designed to assess the
      safety profile and establish a tolerable dose of IMCgp100 in HLA A2 positive malignant
      melanoma patients. The study has two treatment arms with different treatment schedules,
      weekly or daily dosing. Each treatment arm in the study has two parts. In the first part,
      dose escalation, the safety and tolerability of the drug are examined and the optimal dose of
      drug is established. In the second part of the trial, participants will receive an extended
      course of treatment with a view to assessing the effect of the drug on disease.
