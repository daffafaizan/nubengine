      conditions are usually characterized by repeated exacerbations and remissions. The underlying
      cause of majority of these conditions is not clear even though an autoimmune mechanism has
      been implicated. Various studies have reported an altered immunological profile in these
      patients. An underlying immune mechanism has been thought to be playing a role in at least
      some of the ocular inflammatory diseases. In addition, evidence from literature also suggests
      inflammatory disease may be an important mechanism leading to Age related macular
      degeneration and Diabetic retinopathy, two leading causes for vision loss. However, very
      little is known about the involvement of immune components in these patients.

      This protocol proposes to test for proliferative cell mediated and humoral responses against
      self-antigens from patients with ocular inflammatory diseases, AMD and diabetic retinopathy.
      Patients will be recruited from other ongoing protocols. An attempt would be made to find any
      correlation between the clinical disease and the immunological findings. These findings will
      not be used for diagnostic nor therapeutic purposes.
