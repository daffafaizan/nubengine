      defective lymphocyte apoptosis, which is clinically characterized by prominent nonmalignant
      lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and overt autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia,
      autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Additionally, ALPS patients have a
      significantly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma
      (HL). The diagnosis of lymphoma is particularly troublesome in ALPS because many ALPS
      manifestations overlap with clinical features suggestive of lymphoma. Therefore, individuals
      with ALPS may undergo repeated biopsies during the course of the disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose
      positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is a noninvasive
      test that may help us discriminate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy in patients with
      ALPS.

      For patients with ALPS and clinical symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, such as a sudden
      increase in focal lymphadenopathy and/or systemic B symptoms associated with lymphoma, we
      want to investigate whether FDG-PET/CT is useful in determining a plan of action by assisting
      in locating the most active lymph node and determining whether a surgical biopsy is
      warranted. Under this protocol, FDG-PET/CT scans will be done to rule out lymphoma. A lymph
      node biopsy may be necessary to determine the pathology of the lymph node and will not be
      done for research purposes alone.
