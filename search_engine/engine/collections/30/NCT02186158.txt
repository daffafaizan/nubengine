      placebo, single-center. One group would be treated the placebo group, and another would
      receive an adjuvant treatment by vitamin C : 500 mg twice a day by intra-venous way from the
      first day to the second included, and then 500 mg twice a day by oral way from the third day
      to the seventh. For each patient, the study's duration is 7 days, which is the mean stay of
      hospitalization. During those 7 days, we will make clinical exams and blood tests at d0, d2,
      d4 and d7. The vitamin C blood level will be measured at d0 and d7.
