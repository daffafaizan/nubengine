      the spinal column , and the number of people affected is much higher across the world.
      Osteoporosis is the main cause of fractures of the vertebral bodies. Other causes of
      vertebral fractures include malignant processes including benign lesions (hemangioma) and
      malignant lesions (metastatic cancers, myeloma), infections and trauma; however, osteoporosis
      is by far the main cause of this problem.

      In a normal person, the vertebral bodies are composed of a porous structure called trabecular
      or spongy bone encapsulated within a thin external cap of cortical (dense) bone. In a person
      with osteoporosis, the trabeculae that form the central porous bone become thinner and
      weaker. When this occurs, the vertebral bodies begin to fracture and become deformed. This
      deformation of the vertebral bodies is classified into three types, according to the shape:
      wedge, biconcave, and crush. The degree of severity of these deformations is classified as
      grade A1.1, grade A1.2, or grade A1.3

      The Crosstrees PVA™ Pod™ is a device designed to percutaneously provide controlled delivery
      of PMMA bone filler material during vertebral augmentation. The Crosstrees PVA System for
      Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) is designed for use with Crosstrees Fortibrae PMMA.
      The system is novel in providing the ability to control the delivery of PMMA to the vertebral
      body without the need for an additional permanent implant to remain within the patient. The
      Crosstrees System for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation will be used with Crosstrees Access
      Tools, which are regulated as Class I exempt orthopedic manual surgical instruments.
