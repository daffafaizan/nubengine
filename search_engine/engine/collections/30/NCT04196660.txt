      (midwife or spouse), the pregnant woman put her head on her partner's shoulder, and they
      swung left to right accompanied by calming music. During the labor dance, the partner
      accompanied the pregnant woman's swinging movements and massaged the pregnant woman's sacral
      area at the same time. The study showed a positive effect of labor dancing on decreasing
      birth pain and improving satisfaction and neonatal outcomes whether the dance was performed
      with the spouse or the midwife during the intrapartum period.
