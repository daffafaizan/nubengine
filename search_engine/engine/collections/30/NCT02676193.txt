      tobacco industry communicates product attributes, including reassurances about risk. The
      industry uses branded imagery on packs to influence consumer perceptions of their product,
      while at the same time the tobacco control community uses health warning labels to
      communicate harmful and potentially harmful constituents and risks of tobacco products. The
      World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is a treaty
      enacted to ensure that every person is informed of the health consequences and addictive
      nature of tobacco consumption. Article 11 of the treaty requires Parties to implement large,
      rotating health warnings and urges governments to restrict or prohibit the use of Industry
      logos, colors, brand images or promotional information on packaging other than brand names
      and product names displayed in a standard color and font style. Study Objective: To conduct a
      randomized trial of the effect of cigarette pack design on 450 smokers of popular cigarette
      brands aged 21-65, who are committed to continue smoking (no intention to quit in the next
      6-months). These committed smokers will be randomized to have their cigarettes packaged in
      one of 3 study arms: a) blank pack design with all marketing materials removed (BP), b) blank
      pack with a large graphic warning label (AM: Australian model) and c) standard pack with
      marketing materials intact (ST: US model).
