      participants with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive,
      platinum-based cCRT or sCRT. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) in the
      intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The secondary endpoints are as follows: 1) Overall survival
      (OS); 2) 1, 2, 3-year OS rates; 3) PFS rates at 12-monthand 18-month; 4) Objective response
      rate (ORR), 5) Duration of response (DoR); 6) Time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM); 7)
      Adverse effects (AEs) and severe adverse effects (SAEs) ;8) Quality of life (QoL).Exploratory
      objective is to explore potential biomarkers associated with efficacy.
