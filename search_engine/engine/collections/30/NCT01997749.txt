      alternative energy substrate to glucose in the form of ketone bodies. Feeding the brain
      ketone bodies can potentially benefit a stroke patient's brain in several ways:

      Stroke is characterized by impaired blood and oxygen supply to brain cells. This can cause
      glucose to convert to lactate which is toxic for the brain. Decreasing glucose availability
      to brain cells may thus potentially decrease the area of damage in the ischemic penumbra
      (perifephery of the stroke). Compared with sugar, burning ketone bodies requires less oxygen
      to produce the same amount of energy, suggesting that brain cells could have a potential
      greater chance of surviving during circumstances of reduced oxygen supply. By decreasing
      mitochondria activity, ROS synthesis is also decreased, which can help decrease the necrotic
      area around the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, the ketogenic diet does not induce an
      increase in blood sugar which could be an advantage since many stroke patients are admitted
      with hyperglycemia associated with a worse outcome.
