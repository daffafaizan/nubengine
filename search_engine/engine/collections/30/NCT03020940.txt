        1. To evaluate the safety of cefuroxime axetil dispersible tablets in the real world of the
           widely used population,

           Rare or even very rare, new, unanticipated adverse reactions, while revealing adverse
           reactions

           Should be susceptible to risk factors and susceptible populations.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of cefuroxime axetil dispersible tablets in the treatment of
           the relevant site of infection, including

           Including empirical therapy and targeted therapy, to further evaluate the widespread use
           of cefuroxime dispersible tablets

           The validity of the crowd in the real world.

        3. To investigate the clinical application of cefuroxime axetil dispersible tablets for the
           safety management of drug use.

           Clinical management should provide more clinical clues and basis.

        4. For the relevant treatment areas of guidance and consensus revision, clinical pathway
           design provides a reference.

        5. To further improve the safety of cefuroxime axetil dispersion tablets level, the basic
           medical security capabilities and Market vitality.
