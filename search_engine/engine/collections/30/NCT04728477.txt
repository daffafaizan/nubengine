      phone application ( camera of the smartphone will be obstructed by the patient's right index)
      and the values measured by reference method used (the radial arterial line)

      All patients admitted in the intensive care unit at Erasme Hospital Brussels, Belgium will be
      recruited and if they have an arterial line for at least two days

      The OptiBP Application is a mobile application installed on a mobile phone which is a
      non-invasive data-logger intended to acquire physiological data from patients. By applying
      the patient's finger on a smartphone's camera, a movie is generated and transformed into
      values of diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure.

      Three measures will be taken (spaced by one minute) with both methods each hour for 5 hours
      and this will be done for 2 days.

      The patient's blood pressure will be measured in parallel with the mobile application and
      with the reference equipment (arterial line).

      Then, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability of
      the data obtained with the novel mobile application.

      The goal is therefore to compare blood pressure values as obtained by the analysis of the
      data recorded by the OptiBP Mobile Application, against simultaneous measurements provided by
      the arterial line (gold standard)
