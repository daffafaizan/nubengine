      technique (e.g. 3mm versus 5mm scopes; vaginoscopic versus traditional speculum insertion
      approach), so score results reflect relative improvement in tolerability between groups, and
      they do not have as control an examination expected to be free of suffering.

      To the investigators' knowledge there has to date never been an adequate judgement of the
      proportion of women in the group where pain is felt and should therefore be expected. Focus
      has always been put on the group of patients who are pain free (or where it is deemed
      acceptable).

      Stating office hysteroscopy is painless because VAS score is halved by miniaturization seems
      an arbitrary statement for a small, but never the less important group of women.

      It should be interesting to investigate factors which might contribute to pain in office
      hysteroscopy despite the fact the majority of the group will bear mild or no pain. The
      investigator believes that although reduction of scope size has brought about significant
      reduction in distress, it remains a painful procedure for some patients and therefore
      subjecting them to this ordeal may be regarded as an aggression; pain control interventions
      to reduce suffering might be considered (anxiolytic drugs, local, para-cervical or even
      general anaesthesia could be of interest in selected cases).
