    
      A multi-center, randomized, sham (placebo)-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the
      efficacy and safety of FlowOx. This is done by comparing the increase in pain free walking
      distance compared to sham (placebo) device in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      and intermittent claudication.

      This study is conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of FlowOx™ compared to a sham
      FlowOx™ (placebo) device treatment. FlowOx™ can provide intermittent negative pressure (up to
      - 40 mmHg INP [intermittent negative pressure]) which is known to improve blood flow. The
      same device will also work as a sham (placebo) device by less negative pressure exerted by
      the device (in the range of -10 mmHg).

      Daily home use of FlowOx™ for 2 hours (divided into minimum two sessions of 1 hour) per day
      in PAD-patients with intermittent claudication (stage II acc.to EMA, equivalent to Fontaine
      stage IIb in Germany) relative to sham (placebo) will be provided over a period of 12 weeks.

      This efficacy study is evaluating the clinical effects of INP on patient with intermittent
      claudication with special focus on changes in pain free walking distance and quality of life.
