      rotavirus vaccine in South Australian children. It is important to confirm the benefits of
      the vaccine post licensure to ensure the best health care options for children. Between July
      2007 - June 2008 at the Women's and Children's Hospital, there were approximately 2000
      gastroenteritis patient samples analysed, with approximately 200 of these confirmed as
      rotavirus positive (10%). The current vaccines available in Australia (Rotarix® and RotaTeq®
      ) are licensed for administration in infants up to six months of age as safety data is not
      yet available for older children. It is therefore important to determine whether vaccination
      according to the current Australian Standard Vaccination Schedule can also demonstrate a
      positive change (less disease and less severe disease) in the burden of rotavirus disease in
      older unvaccinated children.
