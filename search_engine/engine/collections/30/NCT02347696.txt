      evidenced that Non-Alcoholic Fatty liver Disease (NAFLD) reaches a prevalence of 30%,
      especially among aged and male individuals. Being a crucial outcome of several metabolic
      alterations, it becomes imperative for Public Health to adopt strategies aimed to control the
      factors responsible for NAFLD onset.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of two programs of different intensity
      level of physical activity, of low glycemic index Mediterranean Diet and of the interaction
      of both, on NAFLD score and on the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane.

      Study participants responding to the inclusion criteria of this trial will be chosen both in
      the hospital setting and in the general practitioners' clinics. At the enrollement,
      anthropometric and biochemical variables will be measured, as well as bioimpedenziometric and
      calorimetric parameters; participants will also undergo Fibroscan-CAP to measure the outcome
      and will be asked about their medical history and life-style. Subjects will be randomized to
      the different arms of the trial and be followed-up at the end of the sixth and the twelfth
      week of enrollement.

      All data will be statistically analysed by applying the Chi-Square test and t-test for
      discrete and continuous variables, respectively. As it deals with the analysis of data
      repeatedly measured on the same subject, the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) will be
      applied to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the outcomes.
