      difficulties in implementing effective interventions to prevent disability, to promote
      adherence to lifestyle recommendations and to perform seamless follow-up at home. A
      technological solution addressing this challenge and improving individual participation would
      be welcome. Our aim is to evaluate an instrument for supporting physical activity and
      monitoring multiple parameters of frailty (a pre-disability condition) in frail elderly
      persons. The investigator and collaborator are therefore developing a solution to monitor key
      parameters of frailty during subject daily life and to promote walking. This tools are :

        1. connected soles to evaluate different parameters of the volunteer walking

        2. connected weighing machine to evaluate the volunteer weight and equilibrate

        3. machine to measure gripping force because gripping force is correlated to physical
           condition.

      The primary aim is to assess the acceptability of the solution for the follow up and the
      motivational coaching of frail patients at home. Results from this study will also be used to
      elaborate the design of a further larger national multicenter randomized control trial
      assessing the efficiency of the solution to prevent disability.
