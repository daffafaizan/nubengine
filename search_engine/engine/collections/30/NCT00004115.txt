        -  Determine the efficacy of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody HMFG1, in terms of survival,
           in patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma in remission after debulking surgery and
           platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate this treatment regimen, in terms of the time to relapse, ECOG performance
           status, frequency of hospitalization, changes in concurrent medication, and incidence
           and severity of adverse events, in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard therapy (observation).

        -  Arm II: After imaging studies of the peritoneal cavity to verify adequate fluid
           distribution, patients receive yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody HMFG1 intraperitoneally
           over 1 minute.

      Quality of life is assessed in all patients prior to randomization, at weeks 4 and 8, at 3
      months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      Patients in arm I are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Patients in arm II are followed weekly
      for 6 weeks and at weeks 8 and 12. All patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients (210 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
