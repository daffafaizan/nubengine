      disease, and improving endothelial function is an important target for therapy. Accumulating
      evidence suggest that insulin resistance in patients with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome
      may impair endothelial function, uncovering a proinflammatory, and proatherosclerotic
      vascular phenotype. The GATE study (Glitazones And The Endothelium) is a randomized, double
      blind study to evaluate the effects of rosiglitazone vs. placebo on endothelial function when
      employed as an add-on therapy in diabetic patients currently treated with oral therapy. We
      hypothesize that the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, will improve endothelium-dependent
      vasodilatation, and that this effect will be related to improvements in insulin sensitivity,
      with concomitant reductions in whole body insulin resistance. Furthermore, the beneficial
      effects of rosiglitazone will be additive to existing oral therapies that may modulate
      endothelial function, such as metformin. Since endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role
      in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, these studies may provide the
      rationale and impetus for aggressive treatment of insulin resistant patients with glitazone
      therapy.
