      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP. This study was designed to find cytokines relevant to UCB therapy.
