      using of Complior device. Complior is a mechanographer who calculates pulse wave velocity
      (PWV). Pulse wave velocity is a reflect of arterial stiffness and it's correlate with
      endothelial dysfunction. For BHI, a Philips echograph is used before and after 30 second of
      breath holding.

      Study protocol is :
