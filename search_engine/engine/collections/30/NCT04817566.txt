      (PCCI), which may occur in several cognitive domains and persist for many years. These
      declines in cognitive functions can lead to psychological distress and affect overall
      patients' quality of life. The goal of the present study is to assess behavioral effects of a
      multi-session cognitive training combined with high-definition transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) in women with PCCI. First studies have shown positive effects of cognitive
      training on trained and untrained functions and the subjective perception of stress, however
      the effects are small and transfer effects are inconsistent. A promising approach to elongate
      and increase the effects of cognitive training is to combine the training with tDCS.
      Therefore, in this study women with PCCI will participate in a three-week cognitive training
      with concurrent online high-definition tDCS application. Cognitive performance (primary), as
      well as Quality of Life scores and Sleep data will be examined before, during and after the
      intervention. In order to draw conclusions about the effect of tDCS in addition to cognitive
      training, a control group, receiving sham stimulation during training, will be assessed. A
      Follow-up session to assess long-term effects is planned four weeks after the post
      assessment. The results of the study will offer valuable insights into efficacy of combined
      tDCS and cognitive training intervention in women with PCCI in order to establish its
      potential to induce improvements in cognitive functions, and to beneficially affect
      patient-reported outcome measures.
