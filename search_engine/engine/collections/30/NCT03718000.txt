    
      A single-blinded randomized control trial:

      Adults (age 18-75y, BMI â‰¥ 18.5kg/m2) were randomized to either a control or daily
      self-weighing (DSW) group. There were 3 testing visits: pre-holiday (v1: within 7d before
      Thanksgiving), post-holiday (v2: within 7d after New Year's Day), and a follow-up (v3: 14
      weeks after v2). The DSW group were given Wi-Fi scales that provide graphical feedback of
      daily weight. They were instructed to perform DSW during the holidays and to try not to gain
      weight above baseline weights. Anthropometrics were measured at each visit.
