      cryoablation and sham block with an intervention group receiving cryoablation and ESP
      catheter. The primary outcome is total oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption within the
      first 48 hours of recovery including intra-operative usage. Secondary outcomes to be
      evaluated would include pain scores, functional milestones like time to extubation, time to
      first PO intake, time to ambulation, time to chest tube removal, length of ICU and total
      hospital stay, complications, and patient satisfaction.
