      instructions among males. Physical-therapy students will be recruited to complete a survey
      and non-invasive transabdominal ultrasound assessment.

      A bladder filling protocol will be implemented to ensure subjects will have sufficient fluid
      in their bladders to allow clear ultrasound imaging. This protocol involved subjects
      consuming 600-750 ml of water in a 1 hr. period. The participants will be tested in a
      crook-lying supine position with a pillow under their heads for comfort.

      All participants will be given six different verbal instructions to contract pelvic floor
      muscles. Each contraction will be performed 3 time with rests of 10 sec between contractions.
      While the first 2 contractions for each verbal instruction will be held for 3 sec. the last
      contraction will be held as long as the participant can conduct and the time of contraction
      will be measured as well. The pelvic floor contraction will be measured by assessing bladder
      displacement via diagnostic ultrasound.

      To image the pelvic floor a 5 MHz curved linear array transducer (Mindray M5) will be placed
      in the transverse plane immediately suprapubically over the lower abdomen angled at 15-30
      degrees from the vertical. An on screen caliper and measurement tool will be used to measure
      bladder displacement.
