    
      The study is a randomized, parallel group, unblinded, multicenter study that compares two
      approaches [home-based, portable monitoring (PM) versus attended, laboratory-based
      polysomnography (PSG) (Lab)] in adults, at least 18 years of age, with a moderate to high
      probability of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and who have been referred to sleep medicine
      specialists at AASM-accredited sleep centers for evaluation and/or management. The study is
      designed to compare the utility of the two approaches (PM group vs. Lab group) for the
      diagnosis and management of OSA in adults. Approximately 372 eligible adults will be
      randomized at screening to either the PM or Lab arm (186 per arm), undergo baseline OSA
      testing to confirm diagnosis and study eligibility, then receive positive airway pressure
      (PAP) titration studies to determine the level of pressure needed to treat their OSA. For
      qualifying participants, the titration study will be lab-based in the Lab group and be
      home-based using a commercially available portable, automatic PAP device (APAP) in the PM
      group. All qualifying study participants will have access to study CPAP equipment and
      supplies to treat their OSA. Primary outcomes (time from diagnosis to effective treatment,
      patient outcomes, and relative resource utilization) are determined at 1 and 3 months after
      starting CPAP treatment. Study participants who complete all of their study visits will keep
      their CPAP machine at the end of the study.
