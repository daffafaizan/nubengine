    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients without PET-evidence of extrapelvic metastases, to evaluate whether the
      addition of enhanced systemic therapy to standard of care (SOC) salvage radiation therapy
      (RT) could prolong progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. For patients with PET-evidence of extrapelvic metastases, to evaluate whether the
      addition of metastasis-directed RT to enhanced systemic therapy and SOC salvage RT could
      prolong PFS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in each arm. II. To evaluate event-free survival (EFS)
      in each arm. III. To evaluate time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression using
      Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) 2 criteria in each arm.

      IV. To assess the incidence of adverse events with the addition of enhanced systemic therapy
      in patients without PET-evidence of extrapelvic metastases.

      V. To assess the incidence of adverse events with local ablative metastasis-directed RT for
      PET-positive metastatic disease in patients with PET-evidence of extrapelvic metastases.

      VI. To estimate the detection rate of PET/CT at the patient and regional level, and to
      evaluate its concordance with the follow-up Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
      conventional imaging modalities (CIM) considered standard-of-care per institution, including
      CT, bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET imaging performed as PET/CT
      and/or PET/MR using 11C-choline and/or 18F-sodium fluoride.

      VII. To determine the distribution of PET-positive lesions among anatomic sites (prostate
      fossa, intrapelvic soft tissue/lymph node, extrapelvic soft tissue/lymph node, and bone
      metastases) in patients with post-radical prostatectomy (RP) biochemical recurrence (BCR),
      correlated with PSA (level, doubling time, velocity) and other relevant clinical parameters.

      VIII. To determine the value of repeat PET at 12 months (PET2) to assess response to therapy
      (enhanced systemic therapy +/- focal RT and/or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) compared
      to standard response assessments (PSA and CIM).

      OUTLINE:

      STEP 0: Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo SOC PET/CT scan at
      baseline. NOTE: Patients randomized to Arms C or D below undergo a repeat fluciclovine F18
      PET/CT at time of second PSA recurrence or 12 months after completion of enhanced systemic
      therapy.

      STEP 1: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms based on results of fluciclovine F18 PET/CT in
      Step 0.

      ARM A (PET NEGATIVE FOR EXTRA PELVIC-METASTASES): Patients undergo SOC external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) for 6 months. Patients also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously
      (SC) or leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM) for 6 months starting up to 3 months prior to
      EBRT but no later than the first fraction of EBRT. All treatment continues for 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (PET NEGATIVE FOR EXTRA PELVIC-METASTASES): Patients undergo SOC EBRT and receive
      goserelin acetate SC or leuprolide acetate IM as in Arm A. Patients also receive apalutamide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: (PET POSITIVE FOR EXTRA PELVIC-METASTASES): Patients undergo SOC EBRT and receive
      goserelin acetate SC or leuprolide acetate IM as in Arm A. Patients also receive apalutamide
      PO QD as in Arm B.

      ARM D (PET POSITIVE FOR EXTRA PELVIC-METASTASES): Patients undergo SOC EBRT and receive
      goserelin acetate SC or leuprolide acetate IM as in Arm A and apalutamide PO QD as in Arm B.
      Patients also undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or 3-dimensional (3D)
      conformal radiation therapy (CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (including
      volume modulated arc therapy [VMAT]), and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) over 3-5
      fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for years 1-3
      and then every 6 months for years 4-5.
