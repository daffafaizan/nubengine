      surgery. First trials showed a good correlation between SSI and aching procedures and a
      negative correlation to the dosage of Remifentanil. The first evaluation studies were
      performed under Propofol and Remifentanil anaesthesia. A different site of use for the
      Surgical Stress Index could be the intensive care medicine. 'Analgesia and Sedation are
      essential elements of intensive care treatment and relevant for patient outcome... There is
      therefore a need to monitor and define the level of sedation and pain and to provide the
      critically ill patient with adequate analgesia and sedation.' (j. martin 2002). Although the
      Ramsey Sedation Scale was never proven for validity and reliability it is an often used score
      for measurement of sedation quality. (Ramsay 74, Hansen-Flaschen 94, Jacobi 02, Martin 04).
      The Behavioral Pain Scale showed , apart from systolic blood pressure and heart rate, to be
      reliable and valid for measuring pain in noncommunicative, mechanical ventilated intensive
      care unit patients. (Payen 01, Jacobi 02, Aissaoui 05) These scales need to be performed a
      few times a day to be up to date and therefore time consuming for the intensive care staff.
      The Surgical Stress Index could be a non-invasive, bedside and online tool for measurement of
      sedation and/or analgesia in this complex patient group.
