      follow up ultrasound exam.

      Doppler measurements will be performed but will be hidden from the clinicians. After the
      conclusion of treatment, data on Doppler would be vevealed in order to see if positive
      Doppler after Cytotec is predictive of failure of treatment or the need in several doses of
      cytotec.
