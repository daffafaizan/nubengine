      patients who undergo endonasal endoscopic approach surgeries of the skull base. Patients will
      be followed before surgery and up to twenty-four months post-surgery. The primary goal of the
      study is to assess the alterations to patient quality of life following endoscopic endonasal
      surgery using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. Secondary goals are to better
      understand the time course of normal healing and patient/procedural risk factors associated
      with poorer quality of life outcomes.
