    
      Objective of this feasibility trial is to assess safety and initial effectiveness of ExAblate
      MRgFUS in the treatment of low to intermediate risk, localized (organ confined) prostate
      cancer tumors.

      ExAblate treatment will be implemented as a focal tumor-selective therapy, directed at
      pre-defined volume(s)/sector(s) in the prostate, (identified as cancerous by mapping biopsy
      with or without multi-parametric MRI), rather than a whole gland or hemi-ablation treatment.

      Safety: evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate's MRgFUS
      focal treatment of low risk organ confined prostate cancer. The risk of ExAblate
      treatment-related incontinence and impotence will also be assessed in this study.

      Effectiveness: determine the tumor control effect of ExAblate's MRgFUS focal treatment of low
      risk organ-confined prostate cancer (confirmed by TRUS-guided Transperineal Mapping Biopsy
      results).
