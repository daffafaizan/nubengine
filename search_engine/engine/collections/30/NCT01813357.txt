      placebo once daily for 96 weeks.

      Participants will undergo blood tests and ultrasounds of the arteries of the neck (carotid
      intima media thickness) prior to starting Rosuvastatin and then after 1 and 2 years on the
      drug to determine what effect it has on markers of inflammation, cholesterol levels and
      thickness of blood vessels.
