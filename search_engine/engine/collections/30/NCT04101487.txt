      are more than 230,000 children suffering from chronic malnutrition and 32% of children under
      five are stunted. Previous studies have shown that inadequate dietary diversity is strongly
      associated with stunting in children under two years of age. An interventional package
      including cash transfers and education has the potential to improve dietary diversity and
      long-term outcomes such as improved growth and reduced rates of stunting among children.

      The investigators' objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a cash transfer and nutrition
      education program delivered by community health assistants to increase dietary diversity
      among children 6 to 23 months of age in Grand Gedeh County, Liberia. The investigators will
      conduct a pilot, cluster randomized trial in 45 communities. The investigators hypothesize
      that a multi-pronged interventional package aimed at strengthening the household environment
      will result in improved dietary diversity for children 6 to 23 months of age. Moreover, the
      investigators also hypothesize that unconditional cash transfers will result in improved
      dietary diversity for children 6 to 23 months of age in Grand Gedeh County, Liberia.
