      tremor, slowness of movement, rigidity as well as postural instability and gait difficulties
      (PIGD) motor features. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation is a key pathological factor in
      PD. Advancing PD is associated with disabling PIGD motor features, in particular freezing of
      gait (FoG). This is further complicated by fear of falling resulting in pervasive
      sedentariness where avoidance of physical activity leads to deconditioning, thereby
      aggravating a downward functional spiral. The dopaminergic medication-refractory nature of
      PIGD motor features in advancing PD implicates non-dopaminergic brain pathologies.

      The investigators have novel preliminary data showing that non-acute vestibulopathy may be
      another important factor contributing to PIGD motor features in PD. Unlike sporadic
      intermittent vestibular disorders with a more acute onset, chronic bilateral vestibular
      dysfunction of older age. The investigators preliminary data suggest that vestibulopathy may
      be a critical determinant of imbalance and gait problems in PD (scientific premise). However,
      these preliminary observations need to be confirmed in a larger study using more dedicated
      assessment methods (knowledge gap). Closing this gap is important because of the potentially
      high clinical translational impact if preliminary findings can be verified. The investigators
      will also explore whether stimulation of the vestibular system may help to improve PIGD in a
      small exploratory pilot biomechanistic sub-study.
