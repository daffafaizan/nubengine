    
      The BIOTRONIK BIOFLOW-V clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled
      trial combining data on the randomized subjects with data from two historical studies by
      employing a Bayesian approach.

      Subjects with CAD that qualify for PCI with stenting will be screened per the protocol
      inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve a total of up to 1,400 randomized subjects.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by study center, to undergo
      percutaneous coronary revascularization with either the Orsiro Sirolimus Eluting Stent System
      (treatment group) or the Xience Everolimus Eluting Stent System (control group).

      Subjects may receive treatment of up to three target lesions, one or two target lesions per
      target vessel, for a maximum of two target vessels. The target lesion(s) must be de novo or
      restenotic lesion(s) of â‰¤ 36 mm in length in native coronary artery(ies), with a reference
      vessel diameter of 2.25-4.0 mm. Treatment of restenotic lesions is allowed provided that the
      target lesion was previously treated with PTCA only. All treatment with study stents is to be
      performed during a single index procedure. Note: Concurrent treatment of non-target lesions
      during the index procedure is not allowed.

      Randomized subjects will have clinical follow-up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and at 2, 3,
      4 and 5 years following the index procedure.

      To assess the non-inferiority of the Orsiro stent compared to the Xience stent, BIOFLOW-V
      randomized subjects will be combined with historical subjects from the BIOFLOW-II and
      BIOFLOW-IV randomized trials employing a Bayesian approach. Only subjects who meet all
      clinical and angiographic eligibility criteria of the BIOFLOW-V trial will be included in the
      analysis.
