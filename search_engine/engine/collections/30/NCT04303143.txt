      characteristic of many chronic conditions is the neurology/ biology/ symptomology may change
      slightly or signficantly over time. So an initial process/plan that worked well for affecting
      a SUDS discomfort level, may no longer work or work as well.

      DAX is designed to be adaptive such that as matters that affected the initial SUDS conditions
      may have changed, shifted, grown or otherwise be different.

      (Examples are increased lesions with MS). Where initial patterns were created with a certain
      set of neural condition and pathways. But now days/weeks later, with new pathways created,
      can a previously installed DAX pattern adjust and shift to accommodate the new neural
      patterns based on participants willingness and self-instruction, or does it require
      professional adjustment.

      Example participant given strong post-hypnotic suggestions/anchor/etc to squeeze right hand
      in certain way to bring relief to leg discomfort. Initial testing shows working. Now time has
      shifted, maybe new pathways or other chronic conditions have changed. Can the DAX processes
      the participant has been taught handle these changes or does it require a professional to
      re-apply/boost or incorporate new details to get significant changes to reported SUDS
      discomfort values.
