      malignant germ cell tumours

      Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion/exclusion:

      Intracranial Germ Cell tumours of any histology and intracranial site and dissemination

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Main residence in one of the participating countries

        -  Primary diagnosis of an intracranial germ cell tumour

        -  Written consent for trial participation, treatment according to the protocol and consent
           for data trans-fer

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Tumour entity other than primary intracranial germ cell tumour or CNS GCT as second
           malignancy

        -  Primary diagnosis pre-dating the opening of SIOP CNS GCT II in the participating country
           of registration

        -  Medical, psychiatric or social conditions incompatible with trial treatment or treatment
           according to protocol is not intended

        -  Participation within a different trial for treatment of germ cell tumours and/or
           concurrent treatment within any other clinical trial. The only exceptions to this are
           trials with different endpoints, involving aspects of supportive treatment which can run
           parallel to SIOP CNS GCT II without influencing the outcome of this trial e.g. trials on
           antiemetics, antimycotics, antibiotics, strategies for psychosocial support etc.

        -  Pregnancy and lactation

        -  Any treatment not given according to protocol prior to registration

      TREATMENT:

      GERMINOMA

      Chemotherapy:

        -  Non-metastatic fully staged germinoma (± teratoma) Two courses (1 and 3) of Etoposide
           and Carboplatin, alternating with two courses (2 and 4) of Etoposide and Ifosfamide
           Note: Bifocal germinoma (pineal+suprasellar) are treated as non-metastatic germinoma, if
           stag-ing shows no additional dissemination

        -  Metastatic or incompletely staged germinomas (± teratoma) Do not receive chemotherapy in
           this protocol

      Radiotherapy:

        -  Non-metastatic pure germinoma in PR/SD After Chemotherapy: 24 Gy (15 fractions) to whole
           ventricles with a 16 Gy (10 fraction) boost to tumour bed (total tumour dose 40 Gy)

        -  Non-metastatic germinoma in CR After Chemotherapy: 24 Gy (15 fractions) to whole
           ventricles

        -  Metastatic or incompletely staged pure germinoma 24 Gy (15 fractions) to craniospinal
           axis with a 16 Gy (10 fraction) boost to tumour bed and any intracranial metastases and
           spinal deposits (total tumour dose 40 Gy)

        -  Non-metastatic germinoma plus teratoma (incompletely resected) After Chemotherapy: 24 Gy
           (15 fractions) to whole ventricles; 30.4 Gy (19 fraction) boost to tumour bed (total
           tumour dose 54.4 Gy)

        -  Metastatic germinoma plus teratoma (incompletely resected) 24 Gy (15 fractions) to
           craniospinal axis ; 30.4 Gy (19 fraction) boost to tumour bed and 16 Gy (10 frac-tion)
           boost to metastases (total tumour dose 54.4 Gy)

      NON-GERMINOMA (± TERATOMA)

      Chemotherapy:

        -  Standard risk non-germinomatous malignant GCT Four courses of Etoposide, Cisplatin and
           Ifosfamide (standard treatment )

        -  High risk non-germinomatous malignant GCT Two courses of standard Etoposide, Cisplatin
           and Ifosfamide, followed by two dose intensified courses of Etoposide, Cisplatin and
           Ifosfamide with stem cell support

      Resection of residual tumour after 3 courses chemotherapy (if indicated), followed by: 4th
      course. If vi-able cells are found in the resected tumour specimen patient is transferred to
      the high risk arm

      Radiotherapy for standard and high risk non-germinomatous malignant GCT:

        -  Patients with localised disease at diagnosis After Chemotherapy: 54 Gy focal
           radiotherapy in 30 fractions

        -  Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis After Chemotherapy: 30 Gy (20 fractions)
           to craniospinal axis with 24 Gy (15 fraction) boosts to tumour site and any intracranial
           metastases (total tumour dose 54 Gy) and 20.8 Gy (13 fraction) boosts to spinal deposits
           (total dose 50.8 Gy)

      SPECIAL ASPECTS:

      Central response evaluation on a national basis:

      Germinoma: In all patients with localised germinoma a central national radiological review is
      mandatory for response evaluation to chemotherapy and decision if only ventricular
      irradiation or an additional tu-mour boost has to be performed.

      Non-Germinoma: After three courses of chemotherapy to evaluate response to treatment and to
      deter-mine necessity of surgery in case of residual before radiotherapy.
