      borderline resectable cases with the intent of facilitating a curative surgical intervention.
      This includes providing margin adjacent to un-resectable vessels and sterilizing regional
      lymph nodes. Unfortunately, due to the radiosensitivity of adjacent small bowel and stomach,
      the total dose of radiation used is modest due to the risk of toxicities associated with
      higher doses. Pulsed low-dose-rate (PLDR) radiation improves the safety of radiation through
      breaking it up into small pulses. This increases the repair of DNA damage in normal tissues
      while remaining effective in cancer cells. Multiple prior studies have shown PLDR to be safe
      in the setting of re-irradiation, where additional radiation with conventional techniques is
      associated with severe toxicity.

      PLDR radiation will be given in 2 doses to 6 patients at each dose level:

      Dose level 1: 56 Gy- given over 6 weeks Dose level 2: 66 Gy- given over 7 weeks Standard
      chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, will be administered once a week for the duration of
      radiation.

      This treatment will be followed by standard surgery to remove the cancer after consultation
      with a surgeon.
