      analysis of the serum and tissue VEGF levels has been performed, we hope to determine a
      threshold level of VEGF in blood and tissue that modifies the prognostic implications of the
      presence of ganglionic micrometastasis, which increases the viability of these implants.

      If the investigators determine this threshold and demonstrate that high levels of this
      molecule, both in blood and tissue, increase the rate of recurrence in patients with lymph
      node micrometastases, would be suggested a change in the indications for adjuvant treatment
      in patients in whom it is not currently indicated (stages I-IIA and IIB without other factors
      of poor prognosis) considering that they have an independent bad prognostic factor such as a
      high level (above our threshold) of VEGF. This allows the investigators to select those
      patients who would benefit from chemotherapy treatment despite not being indicated according
      to the current treatment guidelines (NCCN 2018).
