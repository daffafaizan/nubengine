      administration of an analgesic and anti-inflammatory could help to lessen the perception of
      pain, hence decreasing the patient apprehension.

      Previous clinical trials have shown that the use of NSAIDS as a premedication prior to
      endodontic treatment was effective in reducing the pain and increasing the anesthetic
      success, since as high as 80% of the patients with pre-operative pain experience pain after
      endodontic treatment.

      In this study, Celebrex (Celecoxib) 200mg will be given to the patients 1 hour before
      initiation of the treatment, and its effect on reducing the pain will be compared with a
      placebo.

      Celebrex being a selective COX-2 inhibitor, it will spare the physiological tissue
      prostaglandin production while inhibiting the inflammatory prostaglandin production thus
      allow for effective analgesia with fewer side effects than Non-Selective NSAIDS (nsNSAIDS).
