      and Education Network (ChiLDREN). ChiLDREN is investigating rare cholestatic liver diseases
      of childhood: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT), Alagille's Syndrome (AGS), progressive
      familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), bile acid synthesis defects and mitochondrial
      hepatopathies (all previously studied by the Cholestatic Liver Disease Consortium [CLiC]);
      biliary atresia (previously studied by the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium [BARC]);
      neonatal hepatitis; and cystic fibrosis liver disease, which is studied by a new branch of
      ChiLDREN known as the Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease (CFLD) Network.

      In this protocol, mitochondrial hepatopathies in children and young adults will be
      investigated. The focus will be on respiratory chain defects (RC) and defects of fatty acid
      oxidation (FAO). There is little known about the full spectrum of severity and long-term
      natural history of mitochondrial hepatopathies. Moreover, these disorders have not been
      subject to prospective, rigorous clinicopathological scrutiny.
