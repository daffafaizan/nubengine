      diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus (DTPa-IPV) vaccine or
      co-administration of GSK Biologicals' combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTPa)
      vaccine and Sanofi-Pasteurs' inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Vaccines for both groups will be
      administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Two blood samples will be collected during the
      course of the study: prior to vaccination and one month after the third vaccine dose.
