    
      Healthy adults with abnormal visual fields will be offered to participate Subjects will have
      a complete ophthalmic examination including dilated fundus examination.

      Subjects with clear explanation for a visual field defect (e.g. optic neuropathy or retinal
      disorder) will be excluded from the study the subjects will be randomly assigned to the study
      group and control group using a 1:1 allocation.

      Subjects in the study group will be provided with a single tablet of methylphenidate 10 mg to
      be taken orally 2 hours before repeating their visual field test.

      The control group will not receive any placebo Both groups will repeat their visual fields.
      Both groups will fill out a short questionnaire to evaluate their experience in the second
      visual field test.

      The study group will also fill out a screening questionnaire to rule out previously
      undiagnosed attention deficit disorder.

      Two experienced ophthalmologists will separately interpret the visual fields results and
      compare the first and second visual fields of each subject, while being blinded to which
      group he was in.

      Subjects will be provided with their test results and the ophthalmologist interpretation.
