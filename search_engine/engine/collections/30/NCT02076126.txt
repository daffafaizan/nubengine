    
      In at least 135 preterm infants with gestational age 24-32 weeks we will collect gastric
      aspirate and hypopharyngeal secretion. The infants are stratified into three groups:
      gestational age 24-25 weeks, 26-29 weeks and 30-31 weeks.

      The aspirates will be frozen at -20 centigrade and lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S) will be
      analysed retrospectively using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.

      The infants will be monitored for the first five days with regard to possible development of
      RDS.

      Clinical and biochemical data will be compared retrospectively.

      There a no intervention procedures.
