      standard. In the recent years the Visible Ear Simulator has been used as an introduction to
      mastoidectomy in the Danish temporal bone course curriculum before letting the participants
      move on to dissection training in order to maximize the yield from the dissection training.
      Instructors have the impression that participants perform better in dissection after the
      simulator training session has been introduced. Our pilot study suggests that participants
      perform better in the simulator compared to traditional dissection training. This could be
      due to a reduction of the cognitive load in the virtual simulator.

      These observations lead to the hypothesis that virtual simulation training of mastoidectomy
      provides an effect that improves performance in traditional dissection training.
