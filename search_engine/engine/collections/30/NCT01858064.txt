      remitted ADHD. We predict that neural functional connectivity; specifically decreases in
      connectivity between the posterior cingulated cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as
      decreases in anticorrelations between the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, will predict greater response to stimulant treatment.
