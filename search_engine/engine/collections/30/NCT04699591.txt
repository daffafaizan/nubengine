    
      The following will need to be completed before the investigational treatment can begin:

        -  Your medical history will be reviewed to make sure domperidone is a safe option for
           treatment

        -  You will have a physical examination, including heart and breathing rates, blood
           pressure, height, weight, and an ECG. An ECG measures the electrical activity of the
           heart over a period of time. This is a non-invasive procedure and involves attaching
           sticky pads to your chest and recording your body's electrical activity on a machine.
           The study doctor/nurse will explain this in more detail to you.

        -  You will have up to 3 teaspoons of blood drawn through a needle in the arm to make sure
           it is safe for you to receive domperidone.

        -  You will have a pregnancy test if you are female.

      If your tests results are acceptable, the following will happen to you:

        -  You will take domperidone 4 times per day. The dose will be calculated by your doctor
           according to your weight.

        -  Every two months for the first year, you will have a physical examination, including
           heart and breathing rates, blood pressure, height, weight, up to 3 teaspoons of blood
           drawn through a needle in your arm to measure blood levels, and an ECG.

        -  You will also have an ECG anytime there is an increase in the amount of domperidone you
           are taking.

        -  After the first year, if you are benefitting from taking domperidone you will have a
           physical examination, blood draw and ECG every six months until you stop taking
           domperidone.
