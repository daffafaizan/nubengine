      diabetes lowers renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in a manner similar to an ACE
      inhibitor. This is a physiology study, focused on evaluating hormonal changes in the
      circulating and tissue RAS when compared to placebo.

      Subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity and normal kidney function will undergo evaluation
      of their circulating and renal-vascular RAS activity and urinary protein at baseline, after
      withdrawing interfering medications, while on a controlled electrolyte diet, and in
      controlled posture settings. They will then randomly receive a study medication (calcitriol
      or placebo) for 3 weeks followed by a re-assessment of their RAS parameters. The main
      outcomes that will be evaluated following calcitriol/placebo include measures of the
      circulating renin activity (primary), as well as measures of the renal-vascular RAS (renal
      plasma flow) and urine protein (secondary)

      The primary outcome is the change in the plasma renin activity when sodium restricted, before
      and after intervention. Secondary outcomes include the change in renal plasma flow and urine
      protein when sodium loaded, before and after intervention.
