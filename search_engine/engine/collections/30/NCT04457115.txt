      techniques, ESP block and TPV block, in the post-operative pain-control after radical
      mastectomy.

      We will also evaluate both intra and post-operative opioid consumption, the incidence of
      PONV, the length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction with the anesthesiology technique and
      the incidence of chronic pain 6 months after surgery.
