      advanced and primarily inoperable breast cancer or for patients with potentially
      chemosensitive tumors. In clinical routine surgical treatment follows the pre-operative
      chemotherapy. However, recent studies have demonstrated that shrinking tumors need less
      surgical treatment indicating that patients with pCR could potentially be spared of surgery
      in the future.

      Up to now, prediction of pCR after NACT, i.e. diagnosing a pCR without surgery, is based on
      tumor biology at diagnosis, the applied NACT regimen and breast imaging results; all with
      mediocre accuracy. This prospective, monocenter diagnostic trial aims to explore if minimal
      invasive biopsies (MIB) might overcome this diagnostic challenge.

      From September 1st, 2014 to February 15th, 2015 the investigators performed ultrasound guided
      vacuum-assisted minimal invasive biopsy (VAB) on 50 breast cancer patients after NACT and
      directly prior to surgery. To analyse VAB pathologically results were categorized as follows:
      residual vital tumor cells (invasive, in situ, both, lymphangiosis carcinomatosous) present,
      (significant parts of) the tumor bed present, neither vital tumor cells nor (significant
      parts of) the tumor bed (indicating a non representative VAB). The results were compared to
      those of the pathological examination of surgical specimen.
