      there was still a minority of patients who suffered from persistent postoperative pain.
      Dislocations of hip leading to revision surgeries were as well observed in some patients.

      This study mainly measures the orientation of acetabulum cup post total hip arthroplasty.
      Using "Liaw's Version", a new and accurate standardization method, investigators are trying
      to analyze acetabulum cup anterversion change postoperatively.

      As previously known, the anteversion of acetabulum cup determines the range of motion,
      stability, and the function after total hip arthroplasty. Cup malalignment increase
      impingement, dislocation, cup migration, and polyethylene wear. Finding a pattern may help
      the early diagnosis of acetabular loosening.
