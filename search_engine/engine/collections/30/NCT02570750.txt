        -  Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with several extracutaneous
           manifestations and significant comorbidities (among others cardiovascular disease,
           metabolic syndrome, obesity and depression).

        -  An increased prevalence of smoking among psoriasis patients, as compared with healthy
           subjects, has been observed in several studies

        -  More recent studies suggest that cigarette smoking may trigger the development of
           psoriasis through oxidative, inflammatory and genetic mechanisms.Furthermore, smoking is
           associated with the clinical severity of psoriasis

        -  Smoking also contributes to higher morbidity and mortality from smoking related
           disorders in these patients There is now some evidence that patients with psoriasis who
           smoke tend to be less responsive to treatment
