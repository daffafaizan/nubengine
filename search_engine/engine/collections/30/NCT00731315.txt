      and has been successfully integrated into the clinical work flow at this clinic for over 2
      years. The computer-based module is housed in a freestanding kiosk with a touch-screen
      monitor and audio handset to allow patients with low literacy and minimum computer skills to
      complete the module. A printer in the kiosk provides a summary of the patient's responses to
      each question in the module, as well as a prescription for the clinic physician to sign and
      return to the patient.

      It's important to emphasize that the computer only "fast-tracks" women who will be treated
      with antibiotics. All other women see the provider as usual. Also, all women who are eligible
      for computer treatment may opt to see a provider instead.
