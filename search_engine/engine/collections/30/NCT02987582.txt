      The proposed study is a non-controlled, open-label, repeated measures intervention study. It
      is a two year feasibility study.

      Procedure:

      Recruitment

      Participants will be recruited through the Mount Sinai Academic Family Health Team. Patients
      who experience symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, may be referred by any member of the
      family health team, self-referrals through the family health team will also be accepted.
      Patients will be screened for eligibility for the EFM Group by the group facilitators.
      Patients may participate in the EFM group and refuse to participate in the research study.

      When patients agree to participate in the group intervention, patients will then be asked
      about interest in participating in this research. Group facilitators will provide details
      about the study. Interested patients are given the consent form to review. The group
      facilitator leaves the room and the research associate will then come into the room to obtain
      written consent.

      Intervention

      The group will run for 8-weeks. Each group session is 2 and a half hours. Half way through
      the intervention there will be a 5 hour retreat on the weekend. A typical group format
      includes 20-40 minutes of meditation, followed by 10 minutes of independent journaling. Then
      group members will have time to report on recollections from meditation and facilitators will
      provide feedback. There is a break and the second part of the group focuses on a didactic
      teaching topic. Topics change each week. EFM groups will run between September 2016 and June
      2018.
