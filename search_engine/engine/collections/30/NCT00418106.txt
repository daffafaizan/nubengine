      premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment. The first challenge
      is promoting neonatal growth through providing a careful balance of nutrition to caloric
      expenditure for premature infants. The second challenge is supporting parents in the
      intensive, technology driven environment of the NICU to merge physiologic care with
      parental-infant interaction through touch, communication, and maternal intervention. The vast
      majority of mothers with premature infants express breast milk for early feedings, however
      milk production tends to diminish three to four weeks after delivery. The practice of
      skin-to-skin holding is thought to promote the mother's ability to produce breast milk, but
      had not been empirically tested. This study will examine the relationship of kangaroo holding
      on mother's breast milk production and composition.
