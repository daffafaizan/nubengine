      literature occuring in 1:1000 to 1:5000 concentrates. Bacterial contaminated concentrates can
      in fact cause severe infections in patients. therefore this study initially intends to detect
      contamination with "bacterial DNA" in platelet aphereses concentrates. All sample donations
      are also examined by blood culture for contamination. To exclude already existing "infection"
      of the donor one tube of whole blood is taken in addition to the other legally required
      samples for the production of pharmaceutical medicine. All samples are anonymised before
      passed on for analysing.
