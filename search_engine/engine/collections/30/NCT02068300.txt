      more. All patients assess the risk of severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness using
      hypoglycemic awareness questionnaires (HYPO score). The patients who are treated with insulin
      agent were inserted sensor of continuous glucose monitoring systems under the skin during
      three days. We were analysed the correlation between 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and HYPO score.
