      and assessing the workflow and readiness of these clinical sites; 2) implementing the Gabby
      program for a period of 6 months at each of these clinical sites; 3) assembling a
      preliminary, revised, and final implementation toolkit; and 4) broadly disseminating the
      toolkit and results of the implementation. Input from a Gabby Toolkit Advisory Board will
      guide implementation efforts and toolkit development to be used for wider dissemination into
      other clinical based sites.

      Data sources will include qualitative and quantitative methods, such as surveys/ assessments,
      key informant interviews, system-generated data, learning communities, and implementation
      logs. Evaluation will focus on site recruitment, training, and engagement; client engagement;
      clinical risk reduction; toolkit, technical assistance, and support resources; and
      dissemination efforts.
