      (SCS) have been used to treat DOC. Although these techniques have been shown to increase
      patient response, there are still some limitations. For example, DBS requires craniotomy and
      may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection. In addition, the complexity
      and cost of these technologies also limit their potential applications.
