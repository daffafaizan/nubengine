      C/S. Different types of fluids can be used in order to achieve this. Also the timing of fluid
      replacement is important. In the present study patients were separated into 4 groups. Each
      receiving a one of two fluids in different times. ( Colloid pre-load, colloid co-load,
      crystalloid co-load and crystalloid pre-load.) The effect of overall hemodynamics and the
      incidence of hypotension are evaluated. Also peripheric monitors like perfusion index and
      plethysmographic variability index are evaluated for correlation.
