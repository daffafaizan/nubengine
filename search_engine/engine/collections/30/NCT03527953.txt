      different bulk-fill restorative resin materials in Class II restorations. Forty patients with
      at least three approximal lesions in premolar and molar teeth will be participated in the
      study. A total of 120 Class II cavities will be restored using Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill
      (n=40), SureFil SDR flow + Ceram X mono (n=40), and everX Posterior + G-aenial Posterior
      (n=40) with their respective adhesives according to the manufacturers' instructions. All
      restorations will be placed by one operator. The restorations will be evaluated at baseline
      and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months using modified USPHS criteria by one examiner. The
      restoration groups for each category will be compared using Pearson's chi-square test, while
      Cochran's Q test will be used to compare the changes across different time points within each
      restorative material (p<0.05).
