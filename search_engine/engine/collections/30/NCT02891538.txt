    
      Part 1: Blood draw prior to surgery, followed by surgical resection, and surgical pathologic
      specimen will be archived. After surgery, patient will be seen in 4-12 weeks to determine if
      adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, in which case patient will receive adjuvant therapy. At
      this visit a blood draw will be done.

      Part 2: If the patient is stage 0/1/2 and no plan for adjuvant treatments, then the patient
      will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to EGCG 900 mg daily vs observation (standard of care) for
      1 year. Patients randomized to the EGCG arm, will start EGCG within 4-12 weeks of surgery and
      take EGCG 450 mg PO twice a day. Blood draw will be done at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 months.
      Colonoscopy will be done at 1 year from diagnosis, at which time normal colonic tissue
      biopsies as well as any resected polyps will be collected.
