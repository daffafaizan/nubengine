    
      This is a screening protocol for healthy volunteers to participate in research studies
      conducted by Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV).

      Malaria-related morbidity and mortality have a major economic impact in endemic regions and

      present a substantial health risk to non-immune travelers and people living in endemic areas.
      To stem the worldwide impact of this devastating disease, a safe and broadly effective
      malaria vaccine and improved antimalarial therapeutics are urgently required.

      This screening protocol is designed to continuously evaluate potential healthy volunteers to
      build a pool of volunteers who may participate in future and ongoing LMIV malaria drug,
      vaccine, or controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) trials. A complete medical history and
      blood and urine samples will be obtained to evaluate whether volunteers are eligible for
      study-specific screening.
