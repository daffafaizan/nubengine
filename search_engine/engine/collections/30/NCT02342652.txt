    
      This is a Phase 1, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 stage study design with 2
      multiple dose cohorts of healthy elderly subjects.

      Randomisation will be in a 3:1 ratio to ensure that 6 subjects receive ASLAN003 and 2
      subjects receive placebo in a fed condition. Up to a maximum of 16 subjects (two cohorts) are
      planned in this study.

      Subjects will be randomised to receive ASLAN003 100mg or matched placebo once daily for 14
      consecutive days.

      After 8 subjects have completed 14 days of dosing, the Investigator, and the Sponsor will
      review the available safety and PK data from all subjects before deciding to proceed with
      stage 2 of the study. In Stage 2, a further 8 subjects will be randomised to receive ASLAN003
      100mg or matched placebo once daily for 14 consecutive days.

      Following a screening visit that must fall within 28 days prior to the first dose of
      Investigational Product (IP) for both parts, subjects who qualify (according to the
      protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be admitted to the study centre on
      Day -1. Dose administration for each study part will commence on Day 1.

      The subjects will stay at the study centre throughout the 14 days of dosing (D-1 toD15). Full
      PK blood collection will be done on D1, D8 and D14, and single trough PK blood collection on
      D4 and D11. All subjects will be discharged on D15 and asked to return for single PK blood
      sampling on D16, D17, D18, and D19 (+5days post-dose), with full outpatient visit including
      safety follow up and lab test on Day 19.
