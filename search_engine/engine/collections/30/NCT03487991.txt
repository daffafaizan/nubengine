      Aim 1. To confirm the effects of neighborhood and posttraumatic stress, and nocturnal
      vigilance on nocturnal autonomic balance determined by complementary biomarkers.

      Hypothesis 1a - Neighborhood disorder and posttraumatic stress symptom severity will be
      inversely correlated with indicators of autonomic balance derived from analyses of heart rate
      variability and cardiac impedence, and nocturnal/evening urinary noradrenergic excretion
      ratios.

      Hypothesis 1b - These relationships will be partially or fully accounted for by nocturnal
      vigilance and the frequency and intensity of pre-sleep disruptive cognitions assessed in real
      time, and strategies for coping with sleep disruptive thoughts.

      Aim 2. To determine relationships of nocturnal autonomic activity to biomarkers of
      inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

      Hypothesis 2 - Indicators of nocturnal autonomic balance will correlate with morning levels
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules; and pulse wave velocity.

      Aim 3. To determine if sleep is improved 6 months after receiving personalized
      recommendations for adaptively modifying sleep-related behaviors, and if improved sleep and
      reduced pre-sleep cognitive arousal are associated with more favorable nocturnal autonomic
      balance and endothelial function.

      Hypothesis 3a - Reduced frequency and intensity of sleep disruptive cognitions and improved
      sleep efficiency will be more likely in the group that received personalized feedback and
      recommendations for sleep.

      Hypothesis 3b - Reduction of disruptive pre-sleep cognitions, and increased sleep efficiency
      will be associated with improved autonomic status at night and a more favorable profile of
      cardiovascular risk biomarkers.
