      five seconds each, separated by a five second interval rest (Week 0/Baseline). One week
      following cryotherapy, subjects were randomized 1:1 to either additional treatment with
      sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily or no additional treatment. Those subjects randomized
      to additional treatment received sinecatechins 15% ointment BID for up to sixteen weeks, or
      until complete clearance of all EGW, whichever occurred first. Additionally, subjects were
      advised to maintain safe sexual practices and have all recent sexual partners examined for
      EGW. Subjects were followed every 8 weeks for a total of 16 weeks (Table 1). EGW lesion
      counts were conducted at all study visits by the same qualified blinded evaluator.
      Additionally, at each visit local skin reactions, change in concomitant medications, and
      adverse events were assessed. Any subjects who received sinecatechins 15% ointment and
      discontinued prematurely were asked to return for an End of Study Visit. Females of
      childbearing potential underwent a urine pregnant test at all visits during study treatment
      period. Subjects that met complete responder criteria as above, were additionally followed
      and assessed at Visit5/Week 41 and Visit 6/Week 65 to assess for wart recurrence.
