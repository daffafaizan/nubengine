    
      A single center, matched pairs, case controlled, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy of
      auto local bone mixed with β-calcium phosphate + hydroxyapatite using interbody fusion
      assessment on multi-axial CT scan. Its active comparator is auto local bone.

      Anterior bridging bone between anterior grafted bone and inserted cage will be assessed by
      using newly developed anterior bridging cage as well as interbody bone bridging between two
      vertebral bodies on multi-axial reconstructed CT scan.

      The patients undergoes arthrodesis surgery will have two cages, one augmented with auto local
      bone will be located at left side of disc space and the other cage augmented with auto local
      bone mixed with β-calcium phosphate + hydroxyapatite at right side of disc space.
