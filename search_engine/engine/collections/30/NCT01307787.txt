      self-management combined with intensive exercises is not clear. In the present study the
      investigators developed a group-based program for people with RA consisting of physical
      exercise to increase physical performance (i.e. aerobic capacity and muscle strength)
      combined with an educational program to improve disease self-management (self-reported health
      status and self-efficacy). The investigators called it the 'FIT program'. The aim of the
      present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the effects of the FIT program on
      aerobic capacity, muscle strength, self-reported health status and self-efficacy, in a
      population of people with RA. The investigators hypothesized that the FIT-program would have
      beneficial effects on physical performance (ie. aerobic capacity and muscle strength) and
      disease self-management (i.e. perceived health status and self-efficacy components) compared
      to a waiting list control group (WLCgroup).
