    
      Design: A two-arm prospective randomized controlled trial.

      Population: Patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), clonal cytopenia of
      unknown significance (CCUS), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasia
      (MPN).

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Dept. of Hematology at
      Rigshospitalet in Denmark. Patients will be identified and screened by their physician.
      Patients who are eligible for study inclusion will hereafter be approached, informed and
      recruited by the primary research investigator. Included patients will be randomized and
      allocated 1:1 to an intervention group or a control group.

      The intervention group will have a predetermined consultation appointment planned to assess
      medical status and symptom control. Seven days prior to the scheduled visit, the patient will
      receive an electronic invitation via RedCap to complete and send PRO data (HM-PRO). Prior to
      each appointment PRO data will be evaluated by a nurse from an algorithm deciding one of
      three tracks for the patients.

      The control group will receive standard care in the outpatient clinic. The patient has a
      predetermined consultation appointment at the hospital one time a year with a doctor to
      evaluate medical status and symptom control.

      Data Collection: The questionnaires will be distributed and completed by patients
      electronically via REDCap consisting of clinical data, PRO data (HM-PRO) and endpoint
      measures (see below).

        -  Primary outcome: Change in QoL measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30, global health domain, at 12
           months.

        -  Secondary outcomes: Change in symptoms of depression and anxiety measured by HADS,
           change in symptom burden measured by MDASI symptom scale and clinical data outcomes at
           12 months.
