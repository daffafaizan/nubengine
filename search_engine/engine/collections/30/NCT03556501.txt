      collections and their imaging studies (including CT, MRI, EUS, and direct endoscopic
      visualization) to compare these techniques, develop standardized methods for analyzing these
      imaging studies, and use this information to enhance management of patients with pancreatic
      collections. There is very limited published literature on these peripancreatic lesions that
      compares all three of these modalities and thus we aim to study it in detail.
