      teaching ear surgery. Subjects will be randomized to training in the usual fashion and
      training in the simulation environment. Subjects performance will be tested in a standard
      fashion by dissecting cadaveric temporal bones (human ears) before and after training. The
      subjects will also perform a dissection in the virtual environment before and after training.
      The results will be tabulated to compare the different training arms. There is minimal risk
      associated with the projects and is limited to exposure to cadaveric material. Current
      training techniques utilize cadaveric material so exposure to this type of material is
      already a part of the standard training process and this study should not constitute an
      increased risk beyond what is encountered during their regular training. Demographic
      information will be obtained for each of the study subject on age, sex, information regarding
      previous otologic training, year of training and prior experience using computers. The
      anticipated benefits to society will be that future otologic surgeons can obtain operative
      experience in a controlled and non threatening environment. They will have access to a
      greater number of variations in pathology. This will allow each novice surgeon to obtain
      significantly more experience outside the operating room prior to working with live patients.
      This will result in less risk to the patient and better trained ear surgeons.
