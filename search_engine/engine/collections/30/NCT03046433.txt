      for Asthma) reported that nearly 300 million were diagnosed with asthma, while in China even
      reach to 30 million. In recent years, the prevalence of pediatric asthma and severe cases in
      China has increased considerably. In 2013, the third national survey carried out in 43 cities
      in 27 provinces and found that asthma prevalence among children aged 0-14 years old reached
      to 3.02%, with the highest prevalence in Shanghai (7.57%), while in year of 2000, the rat was
      1.09%. However, the research about mechanism, risk factors, individualized prevention and
      treatment strategy of asthma in China is still not perfect and there is no basic data and
      multicenter cohort study. Therefore, this multicenter cohort study is conducted, in order to
      set up a complete database, biobank and long term follow up of Chinese children, and
      establish foundations for basic research and precise medicine.

      Pediatric patients more than or equal to 6 years old diagnosed with asthma will be recruited
      in this study. After evaluating the baseline, the patients were followed up. Visiting doctors
      and filling in a questionnaire for every three months, the clinical symptoms, physical
      examination, will be detected. Chest X ray, blood tests, lung function test and FeNO test
      would be done when necessary. And, biological samples of blood, urine and throat swab will be
      collected when recruiting and finishing follow-up. The trial will be completed in 60 months,
      with 4000 subjects recruited from 8 hospitals.
