      unique exercise intervention with low-velocity movements. Few studies have addressed the
      effects of TC on arthritis symptoms and function. TC for Arthritis was modified specifically
      for people with OA and consists of a standardized set of forms.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-dose TC for Arthritis on
      physical function, pain, and stiffness in individuals with OA.

      Twenty-seven older adults with OA (mean age-81.3 years) completed an 8 week non-randomized
      controlled pre-post test quasi-experimental design study of TC for Arthritis. Physical
      function, pain, and stiffness were measured at baseline and 8 weeks for the TC and control
      groups using the WOMACâ„¢ 3.1 Index. Qualitative data from interviews and participant
      observations were analyzed in order to understand the participants' expectations and
      experiences with TC.
