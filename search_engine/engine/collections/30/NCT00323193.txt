      physical activity psycho-educational intervention (called MOVE!) for overweight and obese
      Veterans with serious mental illness. The study hypothesizes that MOVE! will result in weight
      loss and improved indicators of cardiovascular risk when compared to usual care. Medical
      outcomes are proportion achieving 4% or higher weight loss, mean weight loss, and reductions
      in cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, glucose and serum lipids). Psychosocial outcomes are
      general health, psychiatric functioning, quality of life, and self-esteem and medication
      adherence. Mediators include physical activity, dietary management, self-efficacy, and
      motivation/readiness to change. The intervention involves a well specified combination of
      individualized and group based services and draws on evidence based techniques and materials
      that are currently well packaged in an existing VA program called MOVE! The Comparison
      condition is operationalized as usual treatment plus monthly weight measurements and
      distribution of educational brochures regarding diet and exercise.
