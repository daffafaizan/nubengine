      blinding of participants, treating physicians, and investigators. Study participants undergo
      a resting-state fMRI before, after and at '1-month post-ketamine infusion' (standard care).
      Patients will be recruited over 2 years, from Pain Clinics at Toronto Western Hospital and
      Mount Sinai Hospital. The primary null hypothesis for this trial is that there are no fMRI
      brain patterns of patients with neuropathic pain that predict pain relief following ketamine
      infusion. The secondary null hypothesis for this trial is that there are no correlations
      between specific fMRI brain patterns of patients with neuropathic pain and change in
      intensity of pain immediately following ketamine infusion. Further secondary hypothesis
      include that cortical reorganization in the brain as measured by fMRI at one month after the
      infusion of ketamine does not correlate with persisting analgesic benefit in patients with
      neuropathic pain. Finally, we hypothesize that ketamine infusions do not provide significant
      pain relief, reduction in anxiety and depression, and improvement in quality of life early
      (at 1 month) and late (at 3 months) after the infusions in patients with neuropathic pain.
