      regional and tertiary referral hospitals. ED overcrowding status significantly affects ED
      operational efficiency, resulting in ambulance diversion, increased ED 72h return visits,
      patient satisfaction, and left without being seen (LWBS) rates.

      Several estimation tools were derived to determine ED overcrowding status using various
      operational parameters such as, but not limited to, total number of ED patients, total ED
      admission holds, nursing staff, and patient injury severity. However, these tools cannot
      precisely evaluate ED overcrowding status, nor show strong correlations with ED operational
      inefficiency. The National Emergency Department Overcrowding Study (NEDOCS) is a widely used
      estimation tool to determine ED overcrowding status with relatively high consistency rates.
      However, the study was not able to evaluate interrater reliability since no standard
      definition of overcrowding existed.

      An ED overcrowding estimation tool, SONET, was developed and internally validated at JPS and
      showed more consistency and accuracy when compared to estimation rates utilizing NEDOCS. All
      things considered, it is worthwhile to perform a survey study to determine the interrater
      variability between different evaluators for an ED overcrowding evaluation tool, one
      utilizing all possible collectible operational variables. In order to minimize the bias and
      further determine the accuracy of evaluating ED overcrowding status, a multi-center external
      validation study is warranted. This study will extend to six sites for the purpose of
      externally validating JPS' novel ED overcrowding estimation tool, SONET, by comparing its
      overcrowding estimation rates with those derived utilizing NEDOCS.
