      respiratory related symptoms are also inducing sleep disturbances. Recently, a correlation
      between altered sleep quality and low activity levels have been shown in this population. In
      primary insomnia, it is well established that physical activity has a positive impact on
      sleep quality.

      The purpose of our study is to assess the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on objective
      sleep quality in COPD patients.
