      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of SB-715992 administered as a 1-hr intravenous
      infusion on days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle in patients with solid tumors.

      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      SB-715992 for this administration schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe clinical response of SB-715992 given days 1-3, every 21-days. II. To
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SB-715992 for this administration schedule.

      III. To explore drug metabolism, molecular and cellular predictors of efficacy (biomarkers)
      and toxicity and drug interaction potential.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SB-715992 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional patients are treated at
      the MTD

      Patients are followed for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-19
      months.
