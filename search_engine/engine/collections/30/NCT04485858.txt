    
      The objective of this clinical study is to prove the safety and effectiveness of the CorNeat
      Keratoprosthesis (KPro), a synthetic, artificial cornea for or the treatment of corneal
      blindness in subjects who are not candidates for traditional corneal transplant.

      Ten subjects who are willing to take part in the study will undergo screening examinations to
      verify their eligibility.

      The CorNeat KPro will be implanted unilaterally in eligible subjects. Follow up procedures
      will be performed at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 & 12 months post implantation and will
      include clinical assessment of the implanted eye using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intra ocular
      pressure measurement and ocular imaging. Additionally, subjects' visual acuity will be
      assessed and recorded throughout the 12 months follow up period.
