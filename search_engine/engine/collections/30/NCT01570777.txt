    
      The DENER-HTN study is a, multicenter, prospective, open, randomized, controlled study of the
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of renal denervation plus standardized optimal
      antihypertensive treatment compared to standardized optimal antihypertensive treatment alone
      in patients with proven resistant hypertension. Patients with essential resistant
      hypertension will first enter a 4-week run-in period during which they will receive a
      standardized triple combination therapy (diuretic+ ACE inhibitor+ CCB at maximal dose). After
      4 weeks of standardized triple therapy patients will be randomized to renal denervation +
      optimal antihypertensive treatment compared to standardized optimal antihypertensive
      treatment if daytime ambulatory BP remains ≥ 135 and/or 85 mmHg. Bilateral renal denervation
      will be performed using the Symplicity Catheter (Medtronic ®) - a percutaneous system that
      delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through the luminal surface of the renal artery. Study
      amendment: Extended follow-up of 48 months for all randomized patients.
