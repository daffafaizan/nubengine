      electrical stimulation of 4 acupuncture needles around the knee that touch periosteum) as an
      analgesic for older veterans with advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) and daily pain. The
      primary aim of the proposed trial is to optimize and sustain the efficacy of PST for reducing
      pain in veterans with advanced knee OA and unrelieved pain by combining it with booster PST.
      Our secondary aims are to 1) improve physical performance in these individuals, and 2)
      ascertain the physical and psychological predictors of response to PST. In a randomized
      controlled clinical trial, 180 veterans (age 50 and older) with persistent knee pain who have
      x-ray evidence of advanced OA will be assigned to one of three intervention groups: 1)
      control PST once a week for 10 weeks (i.e., needle placement with brief stimulation of
      non-periosteal needles), 2) PST once a week for 10 weeks followed by tapering PST boosters
      over 6 months, or 3) PST once a week for 10 weeks followed by tapering control-PST boosters
      over 6 months. Prior to initiating the intervention, immediately after the last session, and
      6 months later, the following parameters will be assessed: 1) pain severity (WOMAC), 3)
      physical performance (gait velocity, stair climb, repetitive chair rise, timed up and go),
      and 4) psychological function (mood, coping, self-efficacy). Monthly telephone calls will
      assess pain, interim illness and physical activity.
