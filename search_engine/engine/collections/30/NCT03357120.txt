    
      Patients with an invasive breast cancer on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with the exception of
      cT2cN0 tumors) are preselected before the surgical procedure. They are definitely included
      during the post-surgery visit following the analysis of the surgical specimen (only patients
      whose tumor did not achieve a complete pathological response are included).

      Sequential plasma samples for ctDNA mutations analysis will be taken during the post-surgery
      visit (within 2-5 weeks after surgery) and every 6 months (+/- 1 month) thereafter for 5
      years.

      In case of relapse patients will be proposed to participate to an optional research program
      with a blood test for ctDNA assessment and biopsies from a metastasis (when these biopsies
      are clinically indicated).
