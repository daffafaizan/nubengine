      arterial compliance and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This will be
      a placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over trial.

      Two of the measures which were initially listed as separate outcome measures: (Decrease in
      inflammation) and Efficacy of pioglitazone in improving rheumatoid arthritis disease activity
      and markers of inflammation are now shown as a combined score (DAS-28-CRP). The Risks or Side
      Effects as an outcome measure would be duplicative of the tables in the adverse event section
      and therefore were deleted as an outcome measure.
