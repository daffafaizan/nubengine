      mechanisms of carcinogenesis due to H. pylori remain unexplained and consequences of
      infection are variable and unpredictable. The aim of this research is to examine the RNA
      transcriptome of gastric cancer mucosa (gastric mucosa is the mucus membrane of the stomach),
      in patients with H. pylori infection and examine the spectrum of disease associated with
      infection. We will also examine bacterial content of samples to pinpoint the specific H.
      pylori strain(s) and the stomach microbial profile to correlate with the gastric mucosal
      transcriptome and predisposition of gastric cancer. Patients with prior or current active H.
      pylori infection who are planning to under endoscopic evaluation will be eligible for
      participation. From these patients, we plan to take up to four additional biopsies from each
      area of stomach already being sampled.

      The biopsies will be used for next-generation RNA and DNA sequencing and novel bioinformatics
      analyses. The analysis will be performed at Weill Cornell Medical College by Doron Betel,
      PhD. The sequencing will be performed in the Epigenetics Core laboratory under the
      supervision of Doron Betel, who will be working closely with the principal investigator,
      Manish A. Shah, M.D. Examination of the genetic impact of H. pylori infection in patients may
      expose genetic factors that influence gastric cancer carcinogenesis and give deeper insight
      into molecular pathways that serve as candidate biomarkers for gastric cancer carcinogenesis.
      Our goal is to distinguish patients with chronic H. pylori infection who are at risk of
      subsequently developing gastric cancer from the vast majority of patients with H. pylori
      infection who do not develop malignancy.
