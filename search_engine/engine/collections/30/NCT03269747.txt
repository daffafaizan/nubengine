      Active BAT increases energy expenditure and improves glucose tolerance. Pharmacological use
      of glucocorticoids (GCs) is widespread in clinical practice due to their high
      anti-inflammatory efficacy. While short-term administration even of high doses usually is
      well tolerated, long-term use of medium to high amounts of GCs leads to unfavorable metabolic
      changes, characterized by an increase in intra-abdominal fat mass, a decrease in muscle mass
      and insulin resistance.

      In line with these well-known side-effects of GCs, several in vitro studies and animal models
      demonstrate an inhibiting effect of GCs on BAT thermogenesis.
