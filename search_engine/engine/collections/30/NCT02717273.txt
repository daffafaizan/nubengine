      post-operative antibiotics are used following liver transplantation. All adult patients,
      admitted to the University of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center for first-time liver
      transplantation will be randomized to the standard of care of peri-operative antibiotics or
      extended course of three total days.

      Patients will be evaluated primarily for the presence of post-operative surgical site
      infections but also for fever, elevated white blood counts, secondary infections (urinary
      tract, pneumonia, and blood stream), length of hospital stay, graft loss, and mortality for
      30 days after liver transplant.
