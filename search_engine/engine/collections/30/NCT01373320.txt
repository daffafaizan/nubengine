      (CBPR) principles to identify the needs and preferences of community members with regard to
      cancer prevention. In the intervention phase, this group-randomized trial administers and
      evaluates a set of culturally appropriate interventions aimed at facilitating smoking
      cessation and increasing cancer screening among participants in 6 distressed Appalachian
      counties. Faith institutions are recruited and randomized to treatment or wait-list control
      conditions, and participants are recruited and enrolled within those institutions.
      Participants select one or more targeted health behaviors from a menu including smoking
      cessation, colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, and breast cancer
      screening, and subsequently receive the intervention(s) aimed at their selected health
      behaviors.
