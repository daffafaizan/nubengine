      clinical imaging of the pulmonary circulation, metastable isotope 99 of technetium. This
      agent is exclusively used for the diagnosis of physical defects of the circulation due to
      pulmonary embolus. There is imperative need for new lung tracers that will provide a greater
      safety profile while enabling functional as well as anatomical imaging of the pulmonary
      circulation. A novel adrenomedullin derivative has been developed, for molecular imaging of
      the pulmonary circulation. PulmoBind is labelled with metastable isotope 99 of technetium,
      the most commonly used imaging isotope in clinical nuclear medicine. PulmoBind is a
      adrenomedullin derivative specifically designed to bind to the adrenomedullin receptor while
      avoiding any hemodynamic effects. This novel tracer has the potential to help in the
      diagnosis and follow-up of various disorders of the pulmonary circulation for which there is
      currently no alternative. In PulmoBind I three escalating doses were administered and safety
      was assessed. The product was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. Imaging
      revealed predominant lung uptake.
