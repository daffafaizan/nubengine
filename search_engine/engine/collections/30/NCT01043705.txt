      morbidity and expense. The frequency of CIED infection is increasing faster than the
      frequency of CIED implants, suggesting more effective prophylactic strategies are needed.

      The TYRX Anti-Bacterial Envelope is an FDA-cleared polypropylene mesh that is intended to
      securely hold a pacemaker pulse generator or defibrillator (ICD) in order to create a stable
      environment when implanted in the body. It contains the antimicrobial agents, rifampin and
      minocycline, which have been shown to reduce infection in an in vivo model of bacterial
      contamination following surgical implant of the generator or defibrillator.

      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter registry of subjects undergoing CIED
      replacement with an ICD or CRT and TYRX, with or without lead revision/addition. The registry
      subjects will be compared to a published historical control group undergoing CIED replacement
      with an ICD or CRT and no TYRX , with or without lead revision/addition. The CRT registry
      subjects will also be compared to a case-matched retrospective control group undergoing CIED
      replacement with a CRT and no TYRX , with or without lead revision/addition. The primary
      study endpoints are major CIED infection and CIED mechanical complication during the 12
      months following CIED replacement with an ICD or CRT.

      Originally executed as two separate studies (Citadel - ICDs) and (Centurion - CRTs), a
      protocol amendment was executed in 2012 due to slow enrollment, combining the databases for
      analysis of results.
