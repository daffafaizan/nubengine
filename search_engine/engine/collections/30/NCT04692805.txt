      complications of portal hypertension including variceal bleeding and hypersplenism. The
      procedure is normally performed by clinicians engaged in interventional radiology via a
      transcatheter embolization method as the successful embolization of the selected splenic
      arteries results in devascularization of a focal lesion followed by splenic infarction and
      subsequently reducing the splenic contribution to the portal blood flow. Our previous case
      study suggests implanting coil in a branch of splenic artery under the endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS) -guidance followed by the glue injection was an alternative PSE procedure to control
      hypersplenism. Recent advance has also heightened the therapeutic aspect of EUS in managing
      varices. We have established the novel approach to manage varices and hypersplenism at the
      same time by combining EUS-guided PSE and EUS-guided treatment of varices. This study aims to
      evaluate the efficiency of EUS-guided combination therapy (EUS-guided PSE + EUS-guided
      treatment of varices) to EUS-guided treatment of varices alone in cirrhotic patients with
      portal hypertension who have developed gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage and accompanied
      with hypersplenism.
