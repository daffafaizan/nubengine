    
      This is a pragmatic, prospective, multi-center trial with blinded outcome assessment of
      treatment candidates three months after stroke. Treatment candidates will be defined as
      patients with final discharge diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, and onset-to-alarm time â‰¤4
      hours, disabling symptoms not resolved at time of ambulance arrival, and able to walk without
      assistance prior to emergency. These patients will be included if their emergency call from a
      predefined catchment area in Berlin, Germany, caused a stroke alarm at the dispatch center
      during STEMO hours (7am-11pm, Monday-Sunday). About 50% of STEMO dispatches will be handled
      by regular ambulances since STEMO will be already in operation creating the quasi-randomized
      control group.

      Because of several organisational issues during the transition of the STEMO service into
      provisional regular care, the B_PROUD 1.0 evaluation has been defined as implementation study
      and will be complemented by the B_PROUD 2.0 study. B_PROUD 2.0. recruits patients with index
      event after May 1st, 2019.

      B_PROUD uses data from the Berlin - SPecific Acute Treatment in ischemic and hemorrhagIc
      Stroke with longterm outcome (B-SPATIAL) registry. The B-SPATIAL registry started recruitment
      in January 2016.
