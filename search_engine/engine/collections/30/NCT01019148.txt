      physical exam. Photographs may be taken. We will ask questions about the size and duration
      wounds.

      LAB TESTS We will draw blood to determine overall health status to include Hepatitis B,
      Hepatitis C, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing. Genetic testing may also be
      performed.

      BIOPSIES Biopsies may be collected to check for Collagen 7 and for antibodies to Collagen 7.

      Based on the results obtained, it may be possible to identify patients who would qualify to
      participate in current or future clinical trials.
