      beats in 24 hours will be enrolled in the two participating centers and randomized to the
      treatment or to the placebo for 4 weeks. At the end of the first treatment period, a 24 hours
      Holter ECG will be performed. After 1 week of wash-out therapy, subjects will be crossed over
      to the other treatment for 4 weeks. Another 24 hours Holter ECG will be performed at the end
      of the study. During the baseline visit and during each follow up visit, symptom score and
      quality of life questionnaires will be completed by the subjects.
