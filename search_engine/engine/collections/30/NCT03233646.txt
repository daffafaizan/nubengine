      pathophysiology of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Parkinson's
      Disease (PD) or other neurodegenerative disease. The investigators propose to develop and
      evaluate biomarkers using non-invasive optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to
      assess the structure and function of the retinal microvasculature in persons with MCI and AD,
      PD or other neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease..

      The investigators hypothesize that microvascular network alterations in the retina mirror and
      possibly precede changes in the cerebral microcirculation seen in these diseases. Using
      advanced image analysis, the investigators aim to evaluate markers of reduced capillary blood
      flow and non-perfusion in the superficial and deep retinal vascular plexuses and
      choriocapillaris imaged using OCTA, in a resolution not previously possible, that would
      complement already established retinal structural markers and increase their sensitivity and
      specificity in the early detection of MCI and AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's
      disease. or other neurodegenerative disease.

      This study looks to provide a proof of concept for OCTA-based retinal microvascular
      biomarkers as an effective screening tool in cognitive aging.
