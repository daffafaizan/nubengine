    
      This study focuses on patients prescribed neoadjuvant (preoperative chemotherapy and
      radiation) prior to surgery for borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This allows
      for a known, preoperative window long enough to provide an effective exercise intervention.
      The exercise program will be administered for at least eight weeks, but has no cap on length,
      as neoadjuvent treatment periods can vary between participants and a cessation of the
      exercise program before the end of this period could result in an undesirable loss in
      physical fitness and function.

      The study is a non-randomized, parallel group, intervention control trial, based on pilot
      studies in similar patient populations. All participants meeting the inclusion criteria and
      able to participate in the exercise program will be assigned to the exercise group.
      Participants meeting the inclusion criteria, but unable to commit to the exercise program for
      practical reasons (transportation, location, etc), will be assigned to the standard care
      group.
