      strategy for atrial fibrillation. Peri-procedural complications rates are estimated at
      between 1.5 - 6% with the two most feared complications being stroke and atrial-esophageal
      fistula. The risk of these complications increases with (1) longer left atrial dwell times
      with greater potential for clot formation and (2) esophageal heating during delivery of
      radiofrequency energy. 'High-power short-duration' (HPSD) is an increasingly utilized
      strategy to decrease procedure duration and minimize the risk of these complications.
      Potential mechanisms for benefit include: (1) shorter left atrial dwell times due to more
      efficient lesion delivery (2) rapid, but more controlled, resistive tissue heating, which
      avoids deeper, passive conductive heating that can reach the esophagus and cause injury.
      Moreover, HPSD may improve lesion efficacy and durability due to less recover of excitability
      after ablation. Despite being widely used and several retrospective studies, there have been
      no prospective randomized trials comparing outcomes between HPSD and standard RF ablation
      settings. Moreover, the investigators are interested to see if a shorter procedure (less time
      in the left atrium) is associated with a lower rate of silent cerebral infarctions (which are
      occasionally seen on MRI brain post RF ablation - their clinical significance is unclear).
