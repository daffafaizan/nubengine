      based on MRI data, fit directly into the patient's anatomy and enable total knee replacement
      without use of traditional invasive instrumentation. Data showing extra benefit of this
      technique compared to conventional TKR technique are not widely available.

      Aim: To determine the safety of this new surgical technique compared to conventional TKR and
      whether a clinical, functional and financial benefit can be achieved.

      Methods: 200 patients with primary osteoarthritis will be randomized to 2 groups. 30 patients
      in each group will be included in the RSA section of the study. Participating hospitals UOS
      Ullev√•l, Vestre Viken, Sykehuset Telemark and Betanien Hospital Skien. Inclusion started Aug.
      2011. Clinical scoring: KSS, KOOS, EQ-5D and VAS will be examined at inclusion, after 3
      months, and at the 1 and 2 year control. RSA before discharge on day 2, 3 months, 1 year, 2
      years. RSA images will be sent blinded to CIRRO (Center for Implant and Radiostereometric
      Research Oslo Orthopaedic Centre, Oslo University Hospital) for image analysis. Standing HKA:
      preoperatively and after 3 months. X-ray will be taken pre-operatively, postoperative day 3,
      after 3 months and after 5 and 10 years. CT Perth after 3 months for measuring alignment. A
      cost-benefit analysis will be performed.
