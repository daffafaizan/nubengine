    
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that treatment with
      Memantine, an anti-glutamatergic drug, will significantly improve the core symptoms of those
      suffering from either bulimia nervosa, purging type or suffering from body dysmorphic
      disorder.

      We will test this hypothesis by performing a 13-week open label study investigating the use
      of memantine, at a dose of 10-40mg daily, as a treatment for patients with either bulimia
      nervosa or body dysmorphic disorder. Improvement for patients with bulimia nervosa will be
      assessed using the Frequency of binge eating and vomiting as recorded in diary card, Eating
      Disorder Evaluation (EDE), and the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS).
      Improvement for patients with body dysmorphic disorder will be assessed using the the
      Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS) and Brown Assessments of Beliefs Scale.
      In addition both groups will also receive the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity and
      Improvement Scales (clinician rated), Patient Global Impression of Improvement
      (PGI-Improvement), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating
      Scale (HAM-A), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Version 11, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS),
      and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
