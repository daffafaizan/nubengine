    
      The study group included 30 male diabetic patients who participated in circuit weight
      training (CWT) program as following; 60 minutes training\day for 3 days per week for a period
      of 12 weeks.

      The training session started by a proper warm up for 5-10 min in the form of mild stretching
      of the muscles of upper limb(pectorals,shoulder girdle muscles) and muscles of lower
      limb(flexors, extensors, abductors and adductors of the hip and knee) ( to minimize the risk
      of musculoskeletal injury). Then start the active phase of resisted exercises through using
      free weights ( dumbbels for upper limb and sand bags for lower limb) The frequency and
      intensity increased gradually as follows; Intensity of progress of CWT gradually increased
      intensity by 2.5% of one repetition maximum every two weeks. Moderate resistance used in
      which of 60-65% of 1RM in the first month then the intensity increased to 70-75% of 1RM in
      the second month and finally the intensity of exercises increased to 75-80% of 1RM during the
      third month. The sets of exercises intervened by 1 min rest in between each set of
      repetitions. At last the session ends by 10 min of cooling down in the form of relaxation
      exercises.

      Statistical procedures:

      In this study, the descriptive statistics (the mean, the standard deviation, maximum,
      minimum, and range) will be calculated for all subjects in the study including IL6 and tumor
      necrosis factor alpha variables.

        -  Paired sample t-test will be used to compare the difference between before and after
           treatment results of IL6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in each group.

        -  Paired T test to compare means of variables before and after training.
