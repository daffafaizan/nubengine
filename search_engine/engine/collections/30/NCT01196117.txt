      with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), but it is undetermined whether a change in
      hormone level was not seen due to compliance issues in these long-term studies. These
      investigators will be employing compliance monitoring continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) machines and also assessing "sleepiness" before and after therapy. Sleepiness is the
      dependent variable in our study and will be measured subjectively using sleepiness scales and
      objectively using Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) and an autonomic measure using
      pupillometry prior, during and after treatment.
