      rapid-acting analog products. In addition, current products have inconstant absorption and
      action profiles over the course of infusion set life. Previous human studies of prandial
      insulin preparations have used co-mixtures of rHuPH20 (study drug) with insulin delivered to
      study participants by subcutaneous injection and have demonstrated acceleration of insulin
      absorption and action. CSII has been used clinically for the treatment of diabetes over the
      last three decades, and a previous study using a co-mixture of rHuPH20 during CSII showed
      that the combination resulted in a more consistent and ultrafast profile of insulin
      absorption and action across infusion set use as compared to rapid analog insulin alone.
