      baseline measurements of exhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) before and after methacholine challenge
      testing at least one week apart. All subjects will receive treatment with RhuMAB-E25 in an
      open label fashion at day 0, weeks 4 and 8, and undergo methacholine challenge and NO
      measurement at screening/baseline, weeks 0, 6, and 12. Complete Blood Count (CBC) will be
      done at screening/baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and week 12. For women of childbearing
      potential, a screening pregnancy test will be done. All statistical analysis will occur at
      the conclusion of this study.
