      this figure is expected to rise concurrently with the aging population of most countries.
      Unfortunately, few trials have been performed in this setting. In elderly patients with good
      functional status (KPS >70), radiotherapy (RT) prolongs overall survival (OS) without causing
      a detriment in quality of life compared with palliative care alone. Recently, it was shown
      that TMZ could be an alternative to RT. In elderly patients with poor functional status at
      symptom onset (KPS < 70), RT does not appear to be a satisfactory option in this frail
      population; however, investigators previously found that TMZ alone was associated with
      improvements in functional status in 1/3 of cases and appeared to increase survival compared
      with supportive care alone, especially in methylated MGMT promoter patients.

      Bevacizumab (Bev) is an antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF (vascular
      endothelial growth factor) that is currently used in recurrent GBM, particularly in
      combination with alkylating agents. Its effect as first line treatment in combination with
      TMZ and RT is controversial.

      In this study, investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of the upfront combination of
      TMZ + Bev as an initial treatment for elderly patients with GBM and impaired functional
      status (KPS <70).
