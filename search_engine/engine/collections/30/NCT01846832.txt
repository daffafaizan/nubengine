    
      This is a multicenter, international study where all participants will receive triple therapy
      with the following 3 medications: TMC435 also referred to as simeprevir (formerly known as
      TMC435350) which is an investigational medication in development for the treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a), and ribavirin
      (RBV). PegIFNα-2a and RBV are commercially available therapies for HCV infection.
      Participants will receive treatment with TMC435, PegIFNα-2a, and RBV for 12 weeks. If blood
      levels of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) monitored at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 are below 25 IU/mL, all
      treatment will be stopped at Week 12. If HCV RNA values are above 25 IU/mL at Weeks 2, 4, or
      8, treatment with PegIFNα-2a and RBV will continue for an additional 12 weeks (up to Week 24)
      unless protocol-specified stopping criteria are met at Week 4 or 12, at which time all
      treatment will be discontinued. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase of
      maximum 6 weeks, a treatment phase extending from Day 1 (baseline) up to 12 or 24 weeks
      depending on the response to treatment, and a posttreatment follow-up period of 24 weeks
      after the participant's last planned dose of study drug. The duration of the participation
      (excluding screening phase) for each participant will vary between 36 and 48 weeks, depending
      on the response to treatment. Blood samples for laboratory analysis will be obtained from
      participants at protocol-specified time points during the study and participant safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
