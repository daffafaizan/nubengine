      following total knee replacement. However, severe post-operative pain is an impediment to
      early implementation of rehabilitaion program. The use of femoral nerve block combined with
      tibial nerve block as part of a multimodal analgesic program provides effective pain control
      but causes weakness of the operative extremity preventing patients from bearing weight,
      exercising the leg and increasing the risk of falls thereby delaying early participation in
      rehabilitation. Adductor canal block is a new technique that has been described to provide
      pain control after total knee arthroplasty (1). The advantages of this block is that it could
      potentially minimize lower extremity weakness because the target nerve (saphenous nerve)
      blocked in this technique is a purely sensory nerve and does not provide any motor
      innervation to any muscle groups. Adductor canal block lends itself easily to providing
      prolonged analgesia because a perineural catheter can be inserted and the block maintained by
      a continuous infusion of dilute local anesthetic solution for days. A disadvantage of this
      method is that it may not provide adequate analgesia for posterior knee pain in the early
      postoperative period. By combining adductor canal block with ultrasound guided posterior and
      antero-medial knee injection, the posterior knee pain can be controlled effectively.
      Posterior and antero-medial knee injection of local anesthetic solution has been used as a
      method of controlling posterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (2).
