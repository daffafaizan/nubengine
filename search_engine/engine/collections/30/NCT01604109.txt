      who resided in central part have the highest dental caries prevalence of 69.8 percent with
      dmft affecting 3.63 teeth on average. Fluoride is widely accepted as the most effective tool
      to caries prevention for initial caries lesions. Current best practice recommends twice-daily
      tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste for dentate children.

      CPP-ACP can bolster the effects of fluoridated toothpaste alone to prevent caries.Currently,
      almost all clinical trials have investigated the effectiveness of CPP-ACP containing products
      in dental caries prevention and enhancing remineralization of initial carious lesion in the
      permanent dentition of young adolescents. There are no clinical studies of the effect of a
      CPP-ACP containing product to prevent dental caries in the primary dentition of young
      children.
