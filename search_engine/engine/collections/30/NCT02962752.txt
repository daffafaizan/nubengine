      including improvements to cognitive performance, modulation of blood flow, regulation of
      blood glucose and inhibition of enzymes underpinning normal cognitive function. Of particular
      relevance is our previous demonstration of inhibition of MAO-A and B after consumption of a
      New Zealand 'Blackadder' blackcurrant juice drink in man.

      In an attempt to establish a "therapeutic window" on which future nutritional interventions
      can be based, the current study will assess the pharmacodynamics of MAO-B inhibition, plasma
      prolactin levels and venous blood glucose profile following consumption of the 'Blackadder'
      blackcurrant juice. The trial will utilise a 500mg dose of the 'Blackadder' juice (equivalent
      to ~100g of fresh fruit) which was shown to have MAO inhibitory effects in our previous
      report and effects will be measured in a cohort of healthy male adults.
