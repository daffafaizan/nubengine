      intraoperative (during surgery) administration of a long-acting local anesthetic (pain
      relief).

      Local pain relief medications are accepted as standard of care as a part of a comprehensive
      plan for pain relief following a total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (TKA). We expect that
      the addition of ExparelTM to the usual post-surgery pain control medicines and procedures
      will result in less need for additional pain medication. It is possible that local injection
      into the tissue around the total knee replacement joint (periarticular tissues) may provide
      more effective pain relief than injection directly into the joint (intracapsular) itself, or
      vice versa. It is also possible that pain relief with either method is approximately
      equivalent. On the day of surgery, each patient will undergo total knee arthroplasty and
      cared for utilizing the standard protocol for all patients that undergo total knee
      arthroplasty at Broward Health Medical Center.

      Patients in Group 1 will receive the same amount of ExparelTM injected intracapsularly. Those
      in is Group 2 will receive a standardized medication regimen including ExparelTM by local
      infiltration into the periarticular tissues at the conclusion of their TKA procedure. Study
      participants will undergo injection in this manner until the conclusion of the study.

      All subjects will be provided the same methods of postoperative pain control following their
      TKA surgery as those patients not enrolled in the study.
