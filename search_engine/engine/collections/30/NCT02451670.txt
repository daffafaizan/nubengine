    
      This study adapted a point-of-care electronic health record-based clinical decision support
      system (The Cardiovascular Wizard) to help primary care providers identify, provide
      appropriate care for, and control cardiovascular risk factors for patients with serious
      mental illness (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder). The
      Cardiovascular Wizard is designed to educate primary care providers about the increased risk
      of cardiovascular disease and mortality in people with serious mental illness, identify
      elevated cardiovascular risk factors in patients with serious mental illness, identify
      elevated cardiovascular risk factors in patients with serious mental illness, prioritize
      these cardiovascular risk based on how much improvement in cardiovascular risk a patient
      would experience if the cardiovascular risk factor was adequately addressed, recommend
      specific medications and other interventions to decrease each elevated cardiovascular risk
      factor, and provide this information in an easy-to-understand format for both patients with
      serious mental illness and their primary care providers.

      The Cardiovascular Wizard was printed in intervention clinics and (i) compiled lab data (most
      recent glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein levels), body
      mass index, smoking status, and aspirin use, (ii) calculated a modifiable 10 year
      cardiovascular risk for stroke or heart attack using the American College of
      Cardiology/American Heart Association 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk
      equation, (iii) prioritized clinical domains based on the absolute risk reduction for each
      component, (iv) compiled information related to liver and renal function, creatinine kinase
      level, and previous diagnoses (Congestive Heart Failure, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes
      Mellitus, and (v) provided recommendations for intensification of therapy for glycated
      hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and/or low-density lipoproteins if not at goal.
      Recommendations were based on evidence-based protocols including Joint National Committee,
      American Diabetes Association, and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.
