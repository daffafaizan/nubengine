      120 male and female subjects from the Department of Psychiatry at Kaohsiung Chang Gung
      Memorial Hospital. Eligible subjects will be psychiatric patients, aged between 20-65 years
      old, who have psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia and fulfill the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The intervention with aerobic walking programs will be initiated after
      randomization for patients who continue their usual treatment. Subjects will be enrolled for
      12 weeks aerobic walking treatment and randomly assigned to (1) treatment-as-usual, (2)
      treatment-as-usual plus aerobic walking. The wearable watch will be used during the
      participants join the walking programs. We will measure the treatment response to investigate
      the effect of aerobic walking in patients with schizophrenia. This study is being performed
      to investigate the possibly beneficial effects of aerobic walking on cognitive function in
      schizophrenia.
