      reconstruction of the scapholunate (SL) ligament. The investigators compare patient reported,
      clinical and radiological outcomes up to 10 years after treatment of complete dynamic or
      static but reducible SL ligament lesions. The participants are randomized to two treatments.
      Effect parameters before and after intervention are compared between groups.
