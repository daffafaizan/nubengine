      malignancies. However, its ability to keep patients in maintained remission is limited. In
      order to keep patients in long-term remissions, patients who had achieved MRD-negative
      complete remissions through CAR-T therapy (NCT02965092) will, on their own accord, receive
      allo-HSCT if there are no previous HSCT, contraindications, and other restrictions.
