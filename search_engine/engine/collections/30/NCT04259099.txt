      bone strength and increased risk of fractures. Today, the measurement of quality of life
      plays an important role in the approach to diseases. Quality of Life Questionnaire of the
      European Foundation for Osteoporosis-41 (QUALEFFO-41) has been used for many years as a
      well-established and fully self-administered questionnaire. In the following years, a shorter
      and more practical version was needed because the QUALEFFO-41 contains many questions and
      takes a long time. For this reason, the questionnaire was updated in 2006 and the version of
      QUALEFFO-31 was made and the validity of the current questionnaire was shown. The aim of this
      study is to conduct the reliability and validity study of Turkish version of QUALEFFO-31 and
      to evaluate the power of the questionnaire to distinguish patients with osteoporosis.
