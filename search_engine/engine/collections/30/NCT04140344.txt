    
      A total of 448 adult patients (18 years or older) undergoing spinal fusion surgery at Duke
      University Hospital, will be recruited from the Duke Department of Neurosurgery and the Duke
      Department of Orthopedics. Participants will be consented and will complete standard of care
      outcomes questionnaires (Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Index and Euro-Quol 5D)
      at the pre-operative clinic visit for baseline comparison. Participants will be randomized,
      through REDCap, with equal probability to either: A) the control group, with standard
      post-surgery handouts, or B) the experimental group, which will receive text messages for a
      period of 2 weeks after surgery (daily for the first week, and every other day for the second
      week). Text messages were designed to be standardized and automated, with an embedded link to
      a video regarding at-home, post-surgery-care instructions. Patients will be directed not to
      respond to the text messages, but to call for any questions or concerns. The primary outcome
      will be a reduction in 30-days post-surgery readmission rates. The secondary outcomes will be
      a reduction in 30-days post-surgery ED visits rates, back and leg pain scores, and anxiety
      levels. These outcomes will be assessed via a phone interview at 30-days (up to max of 37
      days) post-discharge for both groups.
