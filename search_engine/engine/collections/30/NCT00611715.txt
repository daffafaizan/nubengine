      Primary

        -  To determine the rate of clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response
           [PR], and stable disease [SD] in patients with hormone-dependent locally recurrent or
           metastatic breast cancer treated with letrozole in combination with erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to progression (TTP) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor activity, as determined by CR and PR rates, of this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine if tumors that are positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or
           Ser118 ER, or that overexpress human epidermal receptor (HER2) exhibit a longer TTP from
           the combination compared to tumors that do not express or overexpress these molecules.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior hormone
      therapy (hormone-therapy naive/first-line therapy vs prior hormonal therapy with either
      tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant or metastatic setting/second-line
      therapy)

      Patients receive oral letrozole and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then yearly thereafter.
