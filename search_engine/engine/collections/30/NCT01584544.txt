      and overall survival in stage II/III rectal cancer patients. But elderly patients, especially
      patients over 75 years were hardly involved in related clinical trials considered of their
      fragility.

      Several retrospective study showed that old rectal cancer patients would also benefit from
      concurrent chemo-radiation, with acceptable toxicity. Several new drug, such as capecitabine,
      also seem to be safety for elderly cancer patients. But few prospective study has been
      carried out.

      The investigators designed this phase I study, to explore the maximum tolerant dose of
      capecitabine in preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for elderly stage II/III rectal cancer
      patients, as well as to evaluate safety.
