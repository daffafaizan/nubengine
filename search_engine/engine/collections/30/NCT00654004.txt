      adiponectin and insulin has recently been proposed from animal studies but has not been
      investigated in humans. Children with trifunctional protein (TFP, including deficiency of
      long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)
      deficiency, inherited disorders of long-chain fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation, lack an ability to
      oxidize fatty acids for energy. They have increased levels of body fat and circulating leptin
      and a high incidence of obesity. Current therapy for children with these disorders is based
      on frequent meals and consuming a low fat, very high carbohydrate diet. Despite treatment,
      exercise induced rhabdomyolysis is a common complication of TFP and VLCAD deficiency that
      frequently leads to exercise avoidance. The effects of these genetic defects on body
      composition and weight regulation have not been investigated. The contribution of fatty-acid
      oxidation during moderate intensity exercise in children has also not been reported.

      Two groups of subjects were recruited: one group of subjects had a long-chain fatty acid
      oxidation disorder (n=13). The other group is a group of controls (n=16). We studied
      peripheral signals of body weight regulation, glucose tolerance, body composition, and
      exercise metabolism in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder compared to
      normal controls.
