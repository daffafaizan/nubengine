      (IDA) in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in developing countries remains high. Apparently,
      intravenous iron sucrose appears to be safe and efficient in treating within a short period.
      From literature review, no study of intravenous iron for IDA treatment has been carried out
      in the third trimester of pregnancy. This research aims to compare the efficacy of body iron
      storage replenishment at 3 weeks as labor may take place at this point in some women. In this
      study,500 mg intravenous iron has been given weekly instead of every other day for the sake
      of patient's convenience in the hope that parenteral iron may become another alternative for
      treatment of pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia who have difficulties or failures
      with oral iron.
