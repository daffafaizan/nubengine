    
      Examination procedure:

        -  Biopsy cores will be collected from the breast during US guided biopsy procedure.

        -  The number of cores taken will be decided per the physician discretion according to the
           clinical demand.

        -  Additional two biopsy core will be taken the SmartBx cassette. Since the SmartBx
           cassette holds two biopsies together, two consecutive cores will be collected using the
           SmartBx.

        -  samples will be photographed for measurements in 2 steps during the process:

             1. On the needle notch [A].

             2. On the glass slide [B].

        -  Standard tissue fixation, processing of the samples in paraffin will be performed
           unchanged per the pathology laboratory protocols.

        -  Embedding of the biopsy cores taken with the SmartBx will be embedded using the SmartBx
           mold and tamper.

        -  Standard staining and histology analysis will be preformed to the sectioned samples,
           unchanged per the pathology protocols.

           â€¢ Analysis will be preformed to the histological results, and a comparison between the
           standard procedures samples to the SmartBx samples will be performed in terms of -

        -  Biopsy core length obtained (i.e. collecting all tissue fragments)

        -  Biopsy core yield (i.e. percent of tissue loss during the pathologic processing)
