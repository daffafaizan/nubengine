      placebo-controlled study to determine whether elacestrant reduces the frequency and severity
      of vasomotor symptoms (VMS; "hot flashes") in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe
      hot flashes. Postmenopausal women who met study criteria were followed for 12 weeks on
      double-blind study medication and two weeks off study medication.

      Treatment was randomized 1:1:1:1 to ensure that an approximately equal number of patients
      were exposed to each of three RAD1901 (elacestrant) doses (5, 10 and 20 mg/day) or placebo.
      The total period of placebo exposure was 14 weeks.

      Enrolling approximately 300 patients was expected to provide power for testing superiority of
      the primary efficacy endpoint outcomes.
