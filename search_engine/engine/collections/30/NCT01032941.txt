      patients with compensated cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension (VIP study) to
      determine whether this agent would have beneficial effects in portal pressure reduction
      (unpublished data Tandon, P. et al.). The open label design and the inclusion of compensated
      (Child Pugh A) cirrhotic patients in this initial study were chosen to confirm the safety and
      tolerance of VSL#3 and the safety of the portal pressure measurements at our center. No
      changes of physical status occured. There was a non-significant reduction in portal pressure
      from 19.7 to 18.1 mm Hg after 2 months of VSL#3 supplementation. Furthermore, there was a
      significant reduction in the serum aldosterone level (p=0.03). IL-8 levels were reduced in
      4/6 patients analyzed to date. These results suggest that VSL#3 results in cytokine reduction
      and an improvement in the effective circulating volume even in these well-compensated
      cirrhotic patients. The comparison of the rest of the pro-inflammatory mediators and stool
      microflora is still being analyzed.

      The data in our initial study is very promising. As our patients were compensated cirrhotics
      with normal intestinal permeability and only mild baseline perturbations in hepatic function
      parameters (INR, bilirubin, albumin) and neurohormonal markers (aldosterone, renin), it is
      not surprising that a reduction in portal pressure was not identified. Consistent with
      previous studies however, these local results confirm the safety and tolerance of both VSL#3
      as well as portal pressure measurements in cirrhotic patients (20,24,25).
