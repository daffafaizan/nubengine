      pain and discomfort, namely AI induced joint pain and joint stiffness. Given the lack of
      effective treatments for AI induced joint pain/ stiffness and the safety and efficacy of
      omega 3 fatty acid for musculoskeletal pain, it is therefore reasonable to test the efficacy
      of these dietary supplements in a population of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who
      experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors. Since women with hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer require long term hormonal therapy, an important objective is
      minimizing long term side effects to enhance patient compliance and improve quality of life.
