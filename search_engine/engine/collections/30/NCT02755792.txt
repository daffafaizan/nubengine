      several community elderly centers in Hong Kong according to selective criteria. The
      participants are randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental
      group is invited to participate in 16 sessions of structured Chinese calligraphy program over
      12 weeks. Each session lasts for 1.5 hours. The control group is invited to participate in an
      iPad learning program with navigating the Internet. The iPad program is also consisted of 16
      sessions of 1.5 hours each over 8 weeks. Cognitive tests and physiological measures are
      conducted immediately before and after intervention and at 6-month post-intervention
      follow-up. Statistical analysis are performed to investigate the significant differences and
      interactions among the three time points. The association of cognitive performance and
      emotional calmness is also investigated.

      Selected participants are invited to take part in a EEG session while doing some computer
      tasks related to Chinese calligraphy. EEG results of are used to explore neural activities
      associated with visuospatial working memory and to provide evidence for neural changes at
      functional level as a result of Chinese calligraphy training and practice.
