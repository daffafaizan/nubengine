      estimated average of population size 200 and allowing a 5% tolerable error, based on a 95%
      confidence interval (CI).

      About 140 female office workers were targeted from the medical colleges of University of
      Dammam (UoD); Medicine, Applied Medical Science, Nursing, Dentistry, Clinical Pharmacology
      and Health Track of preparatory year were recruited into the study (N=140).

      The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Dammam
      (IRB-PGS-2015-03-194).

      Eligible individuals for this study were informed of the risks and benefits and were asked to
      read and sign a written consent form.

      Participants' confidentiality was maintained by using a code (number) instead of the
      participant's name on the data collection form.

      All data collection forms were saved in a file and secured in a locker & the electronic file
      saved with password. Only the researcher and the supervisor had an access to them.
