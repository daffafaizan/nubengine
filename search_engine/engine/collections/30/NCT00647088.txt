      indication for cardiac surgery in Western countries. AS has long been considered as a passive
      and degenerative process. Recent data challenged this concept, showing that AS is an active
      and highly regulated process with some similarities to atherosclerosis. However,
      pathophysiology of AS remains poorly understood and preliminary data suggest that genetic
      factors may be involved. The aim of the present study is to identify genetic factors involved
      in this disease using a case control trial design (1000 patients with AS and 1500 controls
      with no evidence of valve disease). For all patients and controls, blood samples including
      DNA and echocardiography will be performed.
