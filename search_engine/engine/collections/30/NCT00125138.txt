      bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and abnormal posture and gait. Many patients can have mild to
      moderate symptoms, while others with advanced disease have symptoms which interfere with
      activities of daily living to a severe degree. Although effective in addressing motor
      dysfunction, long-term use of anti-Parkinsonian agents has been implicated as a component in
      the development of psychiatric side effects including psychosis. Treatment of psychosis with
      typical antipsychotics is not recommended in this patient population, since even low potency
      typical antipsychotics can cause marked exacerbations of parkinsonism in Parkinson's disease
      patients. The use of atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone and quetiapine)
      has shown some efficacy in the treatment of psychosis in PD patients. Melperone is classified
      atypical antipsychotic. European experience with melperone spans more than 30 years, and it
      encompasses an established antipsychotic efficacy profile in the treatment of confusion,
      anxiety, unrest (particularly in the elderly) and schizophrenia as well as a favorable safety
      and tolerability profile. Eligible subjects with Parkinson's disease psychosis will
      participate in a 1-2 week Screening/Washout Period, a 5 week Titration Phase (one of three
      doses of melperone or placebo), a 1 week Maintenance Phase and a Taper/Follow-up Period up to
      2 weeks. Following the Day 43 assessment, subjects may be given the option of receiving
      melperone in an open-label extension study.
