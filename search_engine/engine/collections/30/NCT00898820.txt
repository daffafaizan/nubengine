    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the intracellular level of pemetrexed disodium (PD) polyglutamates as a measure
           of activity of PD transport and activation enzymes in patients with stage III or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer enrolled in clinical trial MCCRC-RC0524.

      Secondary

        -  Assess polymorphisms and gene expression of PD target genes and genes encoding enzymes
           involved in the transport, activation, and inactivation of PD in these patients.

        -  Correlate haplotype-tagged single-nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) and gene expression
           levels with intracellular levels of PD polyglutamates

        -  Correlate htSNPs and gene expression levels with toxicity and efficacy of PD.

      OUTLINE: Blood is drawn prior to and 24 hours after day 1 of course 1 of pemetrexed disodium.
      DNA is extracted and genotyped for known polymorphisms in genes involved in the transport,
      activation, inactivation, and mechanism of action or resistance of pemetrexed disodium,
      including reduced folate carrier-1, multiresistance proteins (particularly MRP5), folate
      receptor, folypolyglutamate synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine
      synthase, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate
      reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Plasma and red blood cells are
      also processed for an intracellular polyglutamate assay for pemetrexed disodium by a
      high-performance liquid chromatography-based method.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
