      development of colon cancer.

      The classic endoscopic mucosal resection technique and the submucosal dissection technique
      require the creation of a submucosal "cushion" by injecting crystalloid substances or
      colloids. However, these advanced techniques have technical limitations when facing a lesion
      that presents poor lifting or non-lifting at all as it might be observed in scarring or
      fibrotic lesions

      Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) in the colon using an over-the-scope clip (OTSC)
      is a recent technique that does not require the injection of a submucosal solution and allows
      a resection of colonic lesions of up to approximately 30 mm, en bloc, allowing a correct
      histological study of the sample, to confirm its complete resection with adequate deep
      margins, evaluation of the level of invasion and lymphovascular involvement.

      EFTR with OTSC allows a colonic wall full-thickness resection, by the deployment of an
      over-the-scope clip before the resection of the lesion to prevent perforation. The steps of
      the technique are: face the lesion and marking the borders, insertion of the scope with the
      kit (consisting of a cap with an integrated snare and OTSC), grasping and pulling the lesion
      into the cap, deploy the over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) and closing the integrated snare and
      resect.

      This is a multicenter observational study on the efficacy and safety of EFTR with OTSC in
      colon.

      The clinical, endoscopic and histological data are collected prospectively in all cases of
      EFTR performed in the participant centers.
