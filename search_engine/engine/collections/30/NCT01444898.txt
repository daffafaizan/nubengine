      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with hyperphagia and hyperghrelinemia with major
      morbidity because of obesity without effective medical treatment targeting hyperphagia.
      Exenatide (Byetta [synthetic Exendin-4]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington DE) is a GLP-1 receptor
      agonist which reduces appetite and weight and may be an effective treatment in PWS.

      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a 6-month trial of
      exenatide on appetite, weight and gut hormones in youth with PWS.
