      some types of cancer, this is of great concern for the public health. Also, of more immediate
      importance for these women; obesity is associated with increased risks of sub-fertility. The
      overall aim of the current project is to expand the knowledge about effective interventions
      to prevent the increasing prevalence of obesity-associated sub-fertility in population.

      One cause of the increased referral rate for in-vitro fertilization is the growing prevalence
      of overweight and obesity. Currently, about 700 couples are annually referred for in-vitro
      fertilization at St.Olav's Hospital. In this interdisciplinary trial, involving
      physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, gynecologists, and basic researchers, the effects
      of regular high intensity exercise training on fertility in sub-fertile overweight and obese
      women will be investigated.
