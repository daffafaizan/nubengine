      driven in part by inconsistent hospital care following successful resuscitation.
      International guidelines for post-cardiac arrest care recommend delaying neurologic
      prognostication until 72-hours after resuscitation because early prognostication is imprecise
      and may precipitate inappropriate withdrawal of life sustaining therapy (WLST). Early WLST
      has been observed in-post cardiac arrest care. In order to encourage better guideline
      concordant care, the study proposes the implementation of an educational tool to support and
      inform surrogate decision makers in post-cardiac arrest care and neuro-prognostication. This
      pilot study will test the feasibility of implementing an educational tool for surrogate
      decision makers, the acceptability of such an intervention and early measures of knowledge
      translation. This study will inform the creation of a randomized controlled trial to test the
      ability of the tool to encourage guideline concordant timing of post-cardiac arrest
      neuro-prognostication.
