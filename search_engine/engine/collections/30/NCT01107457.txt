    
      The study is a Phase 2 study with 3 parts. Part A is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging design, Part B is an optional, open label
      extension design and Part C is an additional optional extension period with an open-label
      design(up to approximately 104 weeks). Approximately 125 participants will be randomized to 1
      of 4 ixekizumab groups or to placebo (approximately 25 participants per group) in Part A.
      Participants will be evaluated for treatment efficacy and the primary endpoint will be
      evaluated at week 12. Between week 20 and week 32, participants with a less than 75%
      improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score compared to baseline will
      be eligible to begin Part B. Participants in Part B will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections
      of ixekizumab 120 milligrams (mg) every 4 weeks through week 236. Subsequent to an amendment
      on May 2012, administration changed to 80 mg every 4 weeks through Week 236. Participants in
      Part C may receive SC injections of ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to an additional
      104 weeks through approximately week 340. Participants who complete Part A, Part B, and Part
      C will have a total study participation of approximately 344 weeks.
