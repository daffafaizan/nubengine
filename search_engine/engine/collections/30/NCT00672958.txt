      to treat depression in adults who have major depressive disorder (MDD). This study looked at
      MDD relief in people who took vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 600 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was approximately 94 days. Participants made 8 visits to the clinic, and were
      contacted by telephone 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
