    
      STUDY DESIGN The study will enroll 110 patients undergoing stenting for critical carotid
      stenosis, either symptomatic (previous events of cerebral ischemia) or asymptomatic,
      undergoing CAS.

      All patients undergoing CAS in our Center and that fit the predefined Criteria will be
      enrolled in the study. Dual-antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel will be
      administered to all patients with the same modalities in use for coronary heart disease
      patients undergoing PTCA.

      Implanted stents after CAS will be in all patients bare metal stents (BMS) and therefore, by
      analogy with the studies in ACS, the duration of dual-antiplatelet treatment will be of one
      month; later all patients will be continued indefinitely on aspirin.

      Clopidogrel, will be started 48 hours before the procedure with a loading dose of of 300mg
      and continued at 75mg/day; aspirin will be given at the dose of 100-325mg/day.

      Platelet reactivity assessment will be carried-out:

        -  before intervention,

        -  after 1 week of treatment,

        -  after 1 month of treatment

        -  after 1 year. All patients will be recalled for clinical examination at 1 and 6 months
           and at 1 year.
