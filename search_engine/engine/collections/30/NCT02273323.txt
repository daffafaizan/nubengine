      reduces the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. In a number of previous nutrition
      intervention studies tea has been shown to improve vascular function as assessed by Flow
      Mediated Dilation in various populations. The current confirmatory study tests a specific
      black tea against a placebo in a population of in non-tea drinking hypertensive subjects.
