    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study of
      orally administered VX-809 and VX-770 in healthy subjects. This study will evaluate safety
      and tolerability of VX-809 and VX-770 alone and in combination.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo during three 14-day treatment
      periods separated by 14-day washout periods. In Treatment Period 1, subjects randomized to
      study drug will receive VX-809 every 24 hours. In Treatment Period 2, subjects randomized to
      study drug will receive VX-770 every 12 hours. In Treatment Period 3, subjects will receive
      VX-809 every 24 hours and VX-770 every 12 hours. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive
      placebo during all treatment periods.

      Enrollment is planned at 1 clinical site (Lenexa, Kansas). Up to 72 subjects will be
      enrolled. The study will be separated into 3 dose escalation cohorts. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2
      will enroll 24 subjects. Cohort 3 is optional and may be conducted after a review of safety
      and pharmacokinetic data by Vertex.
