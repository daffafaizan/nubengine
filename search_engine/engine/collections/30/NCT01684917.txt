      randomised controlled trial of moderate dietary induced weight loss.

      A cohort of moderately overweight men and women will undergo a metabolomic study follow by
      randomised controlled trial of a healthy diet with a 20% energy restriction for a 12 week
      period. This intervention will improve the volunteer's body composition and reduce their risk
      of developing diabetes.

      Extensive tests will be conducted before and after the dietary intervention using emerging
      technologies with current state-of-the-art methods. These tests will monitor the numerous
      physiological adaptations that have occurred on a gene, cell, organ and organismic level.

      The study will, therefore, aim for a scientific breakthrough by developing a series of novel
      biological "markers" that can accurately determine an individual's health status.
