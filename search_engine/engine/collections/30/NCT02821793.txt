      an opinion scale (Not at all, A little, Moderately, Enough, Many) to explore the eight
      domains. Next to the completion of the expectations questionnaire, patients will have to
      order 4 of the different 8 items that they prioritized in regard of the first line treatment
      that has just been prescribed by their physician.

      Secondary endpoint will focus on those 8 proposed expectations of patients at different
      periods of time since treatment initiation. Patients' priorities will be compared to
      physician's priorities (using the same prioritization grid) before medical treatment and
      after 3 months of treatment and to younger patients' priorities (18-69 years). Associations
      between elderly patients' characteristics (social, medicalâ€¦) and their priorities will be
      search.
