      Causes in this population are multi-factorial, including decreased absorption due to
      intestinal disease, increased losses due to bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
      and poor nutrition. IDA can cause significant impaired physical activity and is associated
      with developmental and cognitive abnormalities in children and adolescents. Oral ferrous
      sulfate has been traditionally used to treat iron deficiency anemia, but this is associated
      with limitations. Studies have shown that only a part of the oral iron is absorbed and the
      non-absorbed iron salts can be toxic to the intestinal mucosa, and was also theorized to be
      capable of activating the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Use of intravenous iron sucrose
      has been used in other populations with iron deficiency anemia such as those with chronic
      kidney disease and children with significant blood loss after spinal surgery. The aim of this
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose in improving iron
      deficiency anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease (in comparison to oral ferrous
      sulfate).
