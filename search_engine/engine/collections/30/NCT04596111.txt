      exercise performance in rowing. Simple fitness tests (e.g., the modified Wingate test and the
      graded exercise test) have been validated to examine aerobic and anaerobic capacities in
      rowers. However, it remains unclear whether these fitness tests can be used to track rowing
      performance changes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between the
      changes in fitness test outcomes and the changes in rowing performance. The investigators
      expect that improvements in rowing performance are closely related to improvements in fitness
      test outcomes.

      Participants will attend two sessions of fitness testing, one in the fall 2020 and one in the
      spring 2021. Each session will include the modified Wingate test to examine anaerobic
      capacity, the graded exercise test to examine the aerobic capacity, and the 2,000-meter
      rowing test on rowing ergometers to assess rowing performance.

      Modified Wingate test:

      After 3 minutes of warm-up at 40-50% of heart rate reserve, the participants will perform 30
      seconds of rowing at maximal effort on the rowing ergometer.

      Graded exercise test:

      Workload will start from 25 Watts and it will be increased by 25 Watts by each stage until
      exhaustion. Each stage includes 2 minutes of rowing and 1 minute of rest.

      2,000-meter rowing test: A 2,000-meter race simulation will be performed using an indoor
      rowing ergometer.
