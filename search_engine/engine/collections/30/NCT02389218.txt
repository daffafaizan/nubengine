      if they have had within the last year at least 2 episodes of documented AF, lasting minimal
      30 sec. One episode in the entire history should have lasted more than 48 h, requiring
      electrical or pharmacological cardioversion or stopped spontaneously after more than 7 days.

      All patients eligible for the study will sign informed consent, have an echocardiogram prior
      to inclusion to exclude severe left ventricular dysfunction, to rule out significant valve
      abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy and to assess the LA volume and diameter.

      Prior to randomization, and after inclusion it is suggested to the local investigators to
      perform an MRI-scan or CT scan of the LA and pulmonary veins (in both branches of the study )
      in eligible patients to assess the anatomy and the left atrial volume. The results should not
      influence the strategy of treatment.
