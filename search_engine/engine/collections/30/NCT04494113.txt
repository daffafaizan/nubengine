      I. Determine whether intravenous (IV) triapine 25 mg/m^2 will induce cell cycle arrest as
      measured by phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) in uterine serous adenocarcinoma cells removed at the
      time of hysterectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether a preoperative dose of intravenous triapine 25 mg/m^2 can be safely
      given prior to hysterectomy and staging for uterine serous adenocarcinoma.

      II. Determine whether changes in cyclin D/E and Ki-67 protein expression are detectable using
      immunohistochemistry pre- and post-triapine treatment in uterine serous adenocarcinomas.

      III. Evaluate plasma and tissue triapine concentrations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of using single-cell transcriptome analysis to quantify changes
      in gene expression following triapine treatment and to evaluate their concordance with
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) endpoints of cell cycle arrest.

      II. Identify genomic variants of uterine serous adenocarcinoma (including but not limited to
      p53) with treatment response to ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors such as triapine using
      whole exome sequencing (WES).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive triapine IV over 2 hours on day 1 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo surgical resection 6-8 hours after completion of triapine infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 42 days.
