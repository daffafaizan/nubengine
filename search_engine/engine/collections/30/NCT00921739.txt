      therapy given in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy/fraction, 6 fractions/week) with concurrent
      chemotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be utilized to spare the
      esophagus. All patients on the dose escalation study will participate in additional
      assessments evaluating esophageal motion and esophageal toxicity from radiation therapy.
