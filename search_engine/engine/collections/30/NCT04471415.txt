    
      This study will be conducted in 4 Parts:

      Part 1: Phase 1 single-agent dose escalation of DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors to define the MTD (up to approximately 50 patients for each intravenous
      and subcutaneous cohort)

      Part 2, Once the MTD of DRP-104 for the IV and subQ route of administration will be
      determined in Part 1, Part 2 will include 2 specific cohorts: Cohort 2 and 3 with one only
      selected formulation. Once the MTD of DRP-104 has been declared for either the IV or suQ
      cohort, Cohort 1 of Part 2 will separately expand for each cohort. -Cohort 1: Phase 1
      single-agent safety expansion at the of DRP-104 in patients with advanced solid tumors (N=
      minimum of 14 and up to 20 patients for each intravenous and subcutaneous cohorts); The
      Sponsor will determine at completion of Phase 1 which route of administration will be further
      developed and continued for all subsequent Cohorts 2 and 3 and Parts 3 and Part 4 in
      combination with atezolizumab.

        -  Cohort 2: Phase 2a expansion at the of DRP-104 in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic NSCLC whose tumors contain a KEAP1 mutation, NFE2L2 mutation and/or STK11
           mutation (N=55 patients)

        -  Cohort 3: Phase 2a expansion at the MTD of DRP-104 in recurrent, unresectable or
           metastatic SCCHN (N=15-25 patients).

      Part 3: Phase 1 combination dose escalation of DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat) (with either IV or
      subcutaneous formulation selected) and atezolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors
      previously treated with an anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1, and/or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, starting one
      dose level below the MTD of single-agent DRP-104 and in combination with atezolizumab (up to
      approximately N=12 patients).

      Part 4: Phase 1 combination safety expansion at the MTD of DRP-104 (with either IV or
      subcutaneous formulation selected)with atezolizumab in a similar patient population as the
      dose-escalation (N=14 patients).
