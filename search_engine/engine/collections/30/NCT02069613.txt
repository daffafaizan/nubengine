    
      Subjects will undergo functional brain testing (magnetoencephalography,
      electroencephalography), anatomical brain imaging (diffusion tensor imaging,
      susceptibility-weighted imaging), neuropsychological testing (memory, language, processing
      speed), sleep patterns using actigraphy, and blood testing of candidate biomarkers. Testing
      will be done at 3 time points post-injury: 1 day, 14 days, and 30 days post-injury. Analysis
      of these tests collectively will be used to develop diagnostic tools for acute mTBI.
