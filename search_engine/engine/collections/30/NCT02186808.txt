      study. The objectives of this clinical study were that industrial centrally produced 3- or
      4-unit bridges of yttrium-oxide partially-stabilized (Y-TZP) zirconia (Procera Zirconia) in
      combination with the veneering ceramic material NobelRondo will show sufficient CDA ratings
      (90% R+S) and a sufficient survival rate after 1 and 5 years.
