      (Group 2) were taken during their otologic examinations. All patients in Group 1 had hearing
      loss and were diagnosed with OME after audiological evaluation. Specific points were
      designated at certain areas on each tympanic membrane, and RGB values of those specific
      points were measured on the tympanic membrane images of both groups. Additionally, in Group 1
      viscosity of each effusion taken by paracentesis during surgery was also measured
      intraoperatively with a viscometer. Patients with viscosity values lower than 450 cP
      (centipoise) were subdivided into Group 1a, and those with values higher than 450 cP into
      Group 1b.
