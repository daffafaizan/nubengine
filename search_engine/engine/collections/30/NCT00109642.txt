      mediating emotional processing is essential for the understanding and treatment of mood and
      anxiety disorders. One such disorder, currently regarded as untreatable, is psychopathy.
      Psychopathy has been linked with noradrenergic and amygdala disturbances. However, an
      understanding of the functional significance of the noradrenergic system in humans remains in
      its infancy. The goal of this protocol is to use targeted noradrenergic manipulations
      (yohimbine and guanfacine) in conjunction with specific neurocognitive and neuroimaging
      paradigms to consider the role of norepinephrine in reward and punishment processing. In
      particular, we wish to evaluate the hypothesis that increased norepinephrine levels following
      the administration of yohimbine will lead to enhanced formation and processing of
      stimulus-reward and stimulus-punishment associations, while decreased norepinephrine levels
      following the administration of guanfacine will reduce the formation and processing of
      stimulus-reward and stimulus-punishment associations. In addition, we aim to examine the
      hypothesis that increased norepinephrine levels will lead to increased neural response in the
      amygdala during either the formation, or processing, of stimulus-reinforcement associations.
