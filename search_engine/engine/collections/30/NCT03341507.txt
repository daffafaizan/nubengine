      diameter of 0.5-2.0 cm , an instrument used to inspect the larynx and surrounding areas. It
      resembles a rigid bronchoscope but it is shorter. When in use, it has to be attached to a
      light source.

      The hypothesis of the study stands that the rigid tube for laryngoscopy could be more
      efficient in tracheal intubation for difficult airway patients when the classical intubation
      with a curved blade laryngoscope is unsatisfactory.

      The retromolar approach in both sides together with bougie(intubating tube introducer)
      intubation is the technique of intubation used in this study.
