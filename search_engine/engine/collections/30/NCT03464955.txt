      Not only is high anxiety traumatic, but research in a surgical setting indicates that high
      anxiety in children before surgery leads to adverse outcomes such as increased pain and
      analgesics requirements, delayed hospital discharge and maladaptive behavioral changes.
      Treating anxiety may decrease any of these undesirable behaviors that may arise when
      experiencing a non-invasive surgical subspecialty procedure in a clinical setting.

      In this study, investigators hope to determine if technology based distractions (VR headsets
      with headphones, AR headset, or BERT projector) are more effective than standard care for
      preventing high anxiety before non-invasive surgical subspecialty procedures. As a secondary
      objective of the study, the investigators seek to determine if the use of technology based
      distraction will result in higher parent and patient satisfaction as well as evaluate which
      techniques are most effective. As a tertiary aim, the investigators seek to understand if
      passive or active interventions are more effective in decreasing anxiety.
