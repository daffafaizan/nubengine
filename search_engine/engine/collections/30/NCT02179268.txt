      of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, on bone. Osteoporosis and
      fracture is overtly the problem of the elderly. However, the process of skeletal
      consolidation begins in childhood and the corresponding phase of demineralisation proceeds at
      a glacial pace and lasts throughout adulthood, as a consequence antidepressant therapy is
      likely to have a substantive impact on a phenomenon likely to manifest decades hence. It is
      known that numerically small changes in bone mineral density are associated with a
      substantial increase in fracture risk. Because the SSRIs have only been in widespread use for
      two decades, it is plausible that the consequences of this adverse effect are yet to emerge.
      These data consequently suggest a recalibration of the risk/benefit ratio of this class of
      agents and additionally beg the question of the potential role of screening for bone mineral
      density in this at-risk population group.
