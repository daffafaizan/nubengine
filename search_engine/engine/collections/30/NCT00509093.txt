      Primary

        -  To determine whether adding imatinib mesylate as maintenance therapy improves
           progression-free survival in patients with c-kit positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
           compared with historical controls.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the feasibility of administering imatinib mesylate as maintenance therapy
           after the completion of induction and consolidation therapy in these patients.

        -  To evaluate potential mechanisms of relapse/resistance in c-kit positive AML by
           examining multidrug resistance gene expression and AF1q gene expression and to determine
           whether these levels correlate with c-kit expression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for up to 12 months.

      Bone marrow and peripheral blood are collected at baseline. Laboratory endpoints are
      evaluated by flow cytometry; mutation and gene analysis by PCR.
