    
      Retrospective and monocentric translational study carried out on patients treated at the
      IUCT-Oncopole by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (sequential treatment FEC100 or EC100 then taxane,
      paclitaxel weekly for the most part) for a triple-negative CS between 2012 and 2018.

      We have the microbiopsy of the primary tumor preserved in FFPE and the operating room
      preserved in FFPE.

      We have all the clinical data for the diagnosis and monitoring of these patients, already
      entered into a database.

      The search for a BRCA germline mutation is available in most patients if indicated for an
      oncogenetic consultation.

      biomarkers analysis :

        -  TILS account according to Salgado et al. before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        -  IHC CK5-6 and EGFR then RA if the first two are negative to characterize triple negative
           tumors in "basal-like" and "non-basal-like"

        -  IHC CD3 (labeling of T lymphocytes)

        -  IHC CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        -  PDL1, TIM3 and LAG3 multiplex IHC before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        -  Labeling of tumor cells: AE1 / AE3

        -  Use of markings for exploratory analyzes: CD68 (macrophages), CD39 (marker of lymphocyte
           exhaust
