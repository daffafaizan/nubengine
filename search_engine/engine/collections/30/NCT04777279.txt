      supplement on improving frailty, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in
      community-dwelling older population.

      Methods: We conduct a quasi-experimental study to measure frailty, depressive symptoms, and
      quality of life before and after intervention. A total of 120 community-living older adults
      with frailty identified by Fried's phenotype method are assigned to four groups: physical
      exercise group, nutrition supplements group, physical exercise and nutrition supplements
      group, and control group. Each participants in the assigned group will receive 12 weeks
      intervention. Measurements include frailty (Fried's phenotype method), depressive symptoms
      (Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GDS-15), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Data analyses
      include describe statistics, Chi-square test, and Analysis of Variance. A Generalized
      estimating equations (GEE) will be used to examine the effect of physical exercise and
      nutrition supplement on improving frailty, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.
