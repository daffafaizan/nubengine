    
      This study is a single-center, non-randomized, open label, no control, prospective clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded allogeneic γδT
      cells from a blood-related donor of NHL or PTCL patients(except for γδT lymphoma). This study
      will include the following sequential phases: sign informed consent, γδT cell pre-culture,
      screening and registration to the trial, apheresis, γδT cell preparation, pre-treatment for
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy (selectable plan), treatments and follow-ups. The study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ex-vivo expanded allogeneic γδT cells in patients
      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)
      expect for γδT lymphoma.
