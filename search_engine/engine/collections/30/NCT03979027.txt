      acute effect of breakfast (ready-to-eat-cereal and milk) vs. no breakfast on cognitive
      function and subjective state in 11-13 year old adolescents. It was hypothesised that the
      consumption of breakfast will have a positive acute effect on cognitive performance and
      subjective state compared with breakfast omission in 11-13 year olds. The study sample
      consisted of males and females aged 11-13 years who were recruited to take part in the study
      from a UK secondary school. There were two conditions in this parallel groups study:
      Breakfast and No breakfast (fasting). The breakfast intervention consisted of ad libitum
      intake of ready-to-eat-cereal with milk. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and +70
      and +215 minutes post-intervention. The Cambridge Neuro-psychological Test Automated Battery
      (CANTAB; Cambridge Cognition Ltd) was used to assess cognitive function. The battery
      included: Simple Reaction Time (SRT), 5-Choice Reaction Time (5-CRT), Rapid Visual
      Information Processing (RVIP), and Paired Associates Learning (PAL), which measured reaction
      time, visual-sustained attention, and visual-spatial memory respectively. Concomitant ratings
      of subjective mood, alertness, satiety, and motivation were taken throughout the morning
      using eight unipolar Visual Analogue Scales
