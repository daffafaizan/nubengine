      changes in gastric and intestinal motility. This change predisposes to an abnormal amounts
      and composition of bacteria in the gut, probably leading to uncontrollable diarrhea and
      severely impaired quality of life. Transferal of intestinal microbiota from a healthy donor
      to a patient is called faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT may potentially change
      the bacteria in the gut and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. However, FMT may also have
      potential side effects, especially in persons with autonomic neuropathy and delayed transit
      through the gut.
