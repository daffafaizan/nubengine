      admitted for pneumonia predisposes to worse long-term outcomes. In addition, the association
      between the detected immunological alterations and clinical, functional, nutritional or
      comorbidity risk factors will be evaluated.

      Methodology: Prospective observational study. It will include 149 patients ≥ 65 years
      admitted for pneumonia. After 30-45 days of pneumonia diagnosis, a complete clinical,
      functional, nutritional and immunological assessment will be carried out. FRI will be defined
      as a positive cytomegalovirus serology together with at least one of the following: CD4 / CD8
      <1, CD8 T cells> 600 / μl or negative CD28 T cells> 300 / μl15. Mortality and re-admissions
      at 12 and 18 months will be evaluated.

      If the hypothesis is confirmed, helpful immunological markers will be identified. This will
      be useful in clinical practice to identify patients who can benefit from an intervention and
      / or to identify the best time for vaccination. Otherwise, valuable information will be
      obtained on the interrelation between immunological, clinical, functional and nutritional
      aspects.
