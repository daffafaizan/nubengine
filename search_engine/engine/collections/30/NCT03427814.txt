    
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized multicenter global phase 2 study
      comparing the efficacy and safety of single agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      inhibitor BGB-290 to placebo as maintenance therapy in participants with advanced gastric
      cancer who have responded to first line platinum based chemotherapy. Participants are
      randomized 1:1 to BGB-290 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by
      geography, biomarker status, and ECOG performance status.

      Participants will undergo tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks, or as
      clinically indicated. Administration of BGB-290 or placebo will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

      After end of treatment, long-term follow-up assessments include tumor imaging every 8 weeks
      for those participants without disease progression, survival status, and new anticancer
      therapy.
