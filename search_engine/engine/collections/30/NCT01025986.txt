      criteria will be recruited prospectively. Patients diagnosed with non-infectious uveitis will
      be asked to self-administer the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) - 10, following informed
      consent. Patient demographics will also be collected. The presence of inflammation will be
      then be assessed by the investigator. Patients will be asked to complete the PSS-10 again at
      all subsequent standard-of-care visits within a 6-month timeframe. PSS-10 scores are obtained
      by reversing the scores on the four positive items (4, 5, 7 and 8), then summing across all
      10 items. Patient and the investigator will be masked to the PSS scores.
