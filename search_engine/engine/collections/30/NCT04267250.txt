    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, multiple-dose, open label study of the effect
      of multiple doses PF-06700841 on single dose combination oral contraceptive (OC)
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in healthy female participants aged 18-60.

      The study consists of a screening phase (up to 28 days prior to Day 1); two treatment periods
      during which participants are resident in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and a final
      follow-up telephone contact, which will be conducted after 28-35 following administration of
      the last dose.

      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. A total of 18 healthy female
      participants (9 in each treatment sequence) will be enrolled in the study. Each treatment
      sequence will consist of 2 periods in a single fixed sequence. Participants will be screened
      within 28 days of the first dose of investigational product. Participants will report to the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) the day prior to Day 1 dosing in Period 1 for both treatment
      sequences, and will report to the CRU the day prior to Day 1 dosing in Period 2 for Treatment
      Sequence 2. In Treatment Sequence 1, participants will remain in the CRU for up to 21 days
      and 20 nights. There will be no washout period in Treatment Sequence 1. In Treatment Sequence
      2, participants will remain in the CRU for up to 22 days and 20 nights. Participants in
      treatment sequence 2 will have an outpatient washout period of at least 10 days between
      Period 1 and Period 2. A single administration of OC in the form of 1 PORTIA or equivalent
      tablet will be administered in one of the two periods (reference treatment) and in the
      alternative treatment period, daily doses of 60 mg PF-06700841 will be administered for 13
      days with a single dose of OC being administered on Day 10. PK (AUCinf, Cmax, AUClast, Tmax
      and tÂ½) of OC will then be assessed at pre OC dose and over 96 hours, post OC dosing.

      Safety assessments will be conducted at the CRU.
