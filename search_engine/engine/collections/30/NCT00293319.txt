      Primary

        -  Determine if iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine can provide palliative therapy for
           patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the acute and late toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease and symptom responses of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a compassionate use study.

      Patients receive iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine IV over 2 hours. Beginning 10 days
      later, patients with low neutrophil counts receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously until
      blood count recovers. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive a second dose of
      iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine at least 6 weeks after the first dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
