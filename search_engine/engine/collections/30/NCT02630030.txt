    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measurement of tissue concentration of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) in a glioblastoma after
      preoperative administration.

      II. Measurement of blood and plasma concentration of ixazomib during surgical sampling after
      preoperative administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assessment of the safety of ixazomib after single dose administration in glioblastoma
      patients undergoing surgery for tissue concentration assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) 3 hours before surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and then periodically
      thereafter.
