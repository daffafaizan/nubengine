    
      This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance, like flipping a coin), multicenter,
      double-blind (neither physician nor patient will know the treatment the patient receives),
      parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time) study. JNJ-40346527
      will be compared to a placebo, which is an inactive substance used to test whether a drug has
      a real effect. Patients will receive study medication for 12 weeks and will continue their
      permitted, stable DMARD therapy (methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and/or
      hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) through Week 12. A follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after dosing
      is complete. The maximum length of patient participation will be 22 weeks, including a 6-week
      screening period. Other study visits will occur during the study, and patient safety will be
      monitored.
