      with MDD was wearable technology. This study looked at the correlation of mood and cognition
      outcomes on wearable technology with traditional objective neuropsychological cognitive
      function tests and self-reported mood outcomes.

      The study enrolled approximately 30 patients. Participants were provided with a watch on
      which brief cognitive and mood tests were evaluated daily up to 6 weeks.

      All participants prompted to complete cognitive and mood assessments on 3 occasions across
      the day. Two occasions (morning and afternoon) comprised assessment of cognition, and the
      final assessment in the evening constituted a review of the day focusing on self-reported
      depressed mood.

      This single-center trial was conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in
      this study was 6 weeks. Participants took part up to 5 study visits (1 in-person on-site
      visit, 3 web-based and 1 at home visit) assessing performance on traditional objective
      neuropsychological cognitive function tests and self-reported measures of depression symptom
      severity and social function.
