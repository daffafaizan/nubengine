        -  Compare overall survival in patients with stage I-IV ovarian epithelial or fallopian
           tube cancer treated with adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without
           gemcitabine.

        -  Compare response rates, progression-free survival, and duration of response in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to FIGO stage (I-IIA vs IIB-IIIC and tumor no greater than 10 mm vs
      IIB-IIIC and tumor greater than 10 mm or IV), plan for interval surgical debulking (yes vs
      no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
           on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin and paclitaxel as in arm I. Treatment in both arms
           repeats every 21 days for 6 to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients undergo interval debulking surgery.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 3 and 6, and then at 3, 6, and 12
      months after completion of study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for up to 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,716 patients (858 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
