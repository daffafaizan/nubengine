      deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation (mechanical ventilation-induced lesions, VILI)
      by drastically reducing minute ventilation (volume reduction). current, Vt, reduction of
      respiratory rate, reduction of mechanical power, reduction of motor pressure or driving
      pressure), adapting the level of PEEP from the data collected by monitoring oesophageal
      pressure and systematically performing positioning sessions in the prone position. This
      ultra-protective strategy could thus promote the restoration of the integrity of the
      alveolo-capillary membrane and thus facilitate the healing of patients. In order to verify
      this concept and, if necessary, to propose a study whose objectives would be more clinical
      (mortality, ventilator-free days), we propose to carry out a study aimed at showing that this
      ultra-protective multimodal strategy reduces the lesions induced by mechanical ventilation
      compared to usual protective ventilatory management during the ECMO as proposed in the EOLIA
      study.
