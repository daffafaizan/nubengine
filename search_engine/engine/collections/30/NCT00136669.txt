      practitioner-given acupuncture treatment followed by semi-permanent acupuncture studs. Our
      primary endpoint is subjective; therefore, a placebo control will be applied with patients
      blinded to treatment allocation.

      In clinical practice, acupuncturists individualize treatment: two patients with a similar
      conventional diagnosis may receive different point prescriptions depending on the acupuncture
      differential diagnosis. Randomized trials of acupuncture can either prescribe a fixed
      treatment formula in terms of the number of sessions and points to be used, or allow
      practitioners to exercise clinical judgment in individualizing care. There has been
      considerable debate in the methodological literature about the merits of each approach. The
      use of a fixed treatment schedule increases the reproducibility of the findings but is said,
      by practitioners, to generally reduce treatment effectiveness. In this trial, we have
      developed an approach that allows practitioners to individualize treatments in a manner that
      allows exact replication, by specifying particular point locations to be used depending on
      the sites where a patient experiences pain. Point locations for this and for all of our
      acupuncture studies are determined by our licensed, credentialled acupuncturists.

      Following accrual of the initial 10-15 patients, we will review treatment compliance,
      blinding and accrual. Adjustments will be made to deal with compliance issues, to facilitate
      placebo blinding, or deal with recruitment problems for the remainder of the study.
