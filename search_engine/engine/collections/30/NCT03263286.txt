      functional tasks. The hand frequently suffers from finger flexor hypertonia as well as finger
      extensor weakness. This leads to increased difficulty in grasp and release of objects.
      HandSOME is a light weight wearable hand orthosis that increases range of motion and
      decreases effort during grasping tasks. The goal of this study is to evaluate the HandSOME
      device's effectiveness in the rehabilitation of stroke patients through an 8 week
      intervention. Eligible subjects will use the device daily at home for 8 weeks with one visit
      per week to the clinic to evaluate progress and troubleshoot problems with the device. The
      hypotheses are that the gains from the 8 weeks of training will be statistically significant
      and clinically important (defined as gains of greater than 10% of full scale) in the domains
      of impairment, function and amount of arm use.
