      fulfills this objective with the comparison of Losartan and Perindopril after 08 weeks of
      administration in a subsaharan African population.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term effects of ACEi and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers on cardiac and renal protection in black type 2 diabetics patients

      Methods: CARE-PLP is a double-arm, double-blind, randomized and parallel clinical trial
      conducted at the National Obesity Center in the Yaound√© Central Hospital. A population of
      Type 2 diabetes patients, with hypertension and / or microalbuminuria and who are not taking
      ACEi or angiotensin receptors blockers, is randomize into two groups. Depending on the group,
      10 mg Perindopril or 100 mg Losartan is add to the usual treatment for each patient. The
      patients are followed-up for a period of 08 weeks. The primary outcome is the variation of
      exercise induced urinary albumin excretion after 08 weeks of intervention.

      Progress: Recruitment for CARE-PLP was completed in february 2018 with 29 patients.
