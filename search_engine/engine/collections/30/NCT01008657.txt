    
      206 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(s) including up to three nodules measuring up to
      four cm in diameter, will be randomized in two therapeutic legs: multipolar no touch
      radiofrequency versus multipolar intra nodular radiofrequency. Patients previously treated
      for hepatocellular carcinoma will not be enrolled in the study. Diagnostic of hepatocellular
      carcinoma will be based on American Society of Liver Diseases guide line. Early response to
      the treatment will be assessed one month after the radiofrequency ablation procedures (up to
      three in case of incomplete necrosis) with dynamic contrast medium enhanced CT or MRI liver
      examinations. For the follow up dynamic contrast medium enhanced CT or MRI liver examinations
      will be performed every three months.

      The trial will last for 73 months including 45 months for the recruitment of patients. The
      main criteria of judgement will be the 2-years recurrence rate.
