      training. Two types of interventions (20 subjects in each group) will be tested: 1) Open-loop
      group (OLG); 2) Closed-loop group (CLG). Each session of the OLG training includes walking
      courses aimed at provoking freezing episodes. The experimenter will trigger an auditory
      rhythmic stimulation (RAS) in walking conditions likely to invoke freezing (e.g., turning)
      and the subject will learn to synchronize his/her gait with the auditory cues, i.e., to keep
      the walking pace and coordination and, as a result, to avoid freezing. Similar principles
      will apply for the CLG training; however, the RAS will be elicited automatically by a device
      that recognizes an approaching freezing episode.

      We anticipate that after intensive training, the central nervous system (CNS) of subjects
      with PD will be able to anticipate impending freezing episodes based on awareness of the
      environmental conditions (e.g., an approaching turn) and/or based on sub-conscious response
      to a deteriorating gait pattern. As a result, an automated motor response that paces and
      coordinates gait will be internally triggered by the CNS and the approaching freezing episode
      will be averted. The overall freezing burden will therefore decrease in trained subjects.
