      instruction intervention among Hispanic breast cancer survivors (n=70, 35 per arm). The study
      is comparing Arm A: standard of care written dietary recommendations for cancer survivors,
      with Arm B: the 12-week ¡Cocinar para su salud!. ¡Cocinar para su salud! will provide
      hands-on education and instruction to Hispanic breast cancer survivors in nutrition
      education, food shopping, and meal preparation in a group setting. Participants will be
      followed for a total of 12 months, have clinical assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12
      months, and will have monthly telephone contacts using motivational interviewing. The primary
      endpoint is at 6 months because the investigators hypothesize that it will take participants
      at least 3 months to adapt some of the dietary behaviors taught in the 3-month intervention.

      A total of 70 women with a history of histologically-confirmed early stage breast cancer will
      be randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Assuming an accrual rate of approximately 2-4 participants
      per month, the investigators expect to complete enrollment within 24 months.
