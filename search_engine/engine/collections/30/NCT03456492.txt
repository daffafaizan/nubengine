      injury, the main result of acute symptomatic hyponatremia and associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Severe hyponatremia (i.e., a serum sodium concentration <125 mmol/L)
      ), if unrecognized in its first stages and left untreated, has a high rate of mortality; for
      this reason, an accurate clinical assessment must be made, focusing on fluid status,
      examining the potential etiology, and conducting the appropriate investigations. In
      approximately 50% of patients, chronic hyponatremia results from inappropriate antidiuretic
      hormone secretion. Chronic mild hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic and is traditionally
      regarded as benign. However, it is associated with a lower bone mineral content and density
      in nearly all regions of the hip, with more pronounced losses in the trochanteric and femoral
      neck regions. It can also lead to osteoporosis, abnormal gait patterns, cognitive impairment,
      bone demineralization, respiratory failure, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, falls, and
      fractures. Compared to normonatremic individuals, hyponatremic individuals are known to have
      a longer time from admission to surgery.

      Glutamate which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our body may play role in
      implication of hyponatremia on the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample can be taken while
      dripling during spinal anathesia for surgical intervention for determination of glutamate
