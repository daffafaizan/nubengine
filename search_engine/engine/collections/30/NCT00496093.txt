      PNEUMOVAXTM 23 in healthy adults in India. The participants enrolled in this study were
      healthy Indian adults, 50 years of age or older, with no prior history of having received a
      pneumococcal vaccination (14-valent or 23-valent) and no prior history of Pneumococcal
      disease. All participants enrolled in the study received one 0.5 mL dose of PNEUMOVAXTM 23 by
      intramuscular (deltoid) injection on Day 1. Serum samples were obtained prior to vaccination
      on Day 1 and on Day 28 (+/-7 days) postvaccination. The duration of participation for each
      participant was approximately one month, with the study completion at the Day 28
      postvaccination bleed and return of the Vaccination Report Card (VRC). Enrollment was
      completed within approximately 2 months. The last postvaccination blood sample was collected
      within 3 months of study initiation.
