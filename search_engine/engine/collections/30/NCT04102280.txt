      Xevonta Hi 15 dialyzer and the Elisio 150H dialyzer in removing Î²2-microglobulin related to
      the albumin removal into the dialysate during high volume online hemodiafiltration.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the FX P600 dialyzer with the comparator
      dialyzers with regard to their efficacies in removing other performance variables (see
      below). Furthermore, the safety of the FX P600 will be investigated by collecting and
      analyzing clinical adverse events.
