      spiritually-based cancer communication intervention to increase IDM for prostate cancer
      screening among African American men in church settings, and including women as supportive
      "health partners".

      A randomized controlled trial is utilized, in which churches will be randomized to: 1)
      male-only educational groups; and 2) co-educational groups where women supportive "health
      partners" are invited to attend with the men in dyads, and then break out into men's and
      women's discussion groups. These two approaches are compared through use of cluster
      randomized design to determine whether the addition of the women health partner increases the
      intervention efficacy in the study outcome of informed decision making for prostate cancer
      screening.
