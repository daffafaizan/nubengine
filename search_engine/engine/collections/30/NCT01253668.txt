    
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of brivanib in the
      treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in
      patients who have progressed on treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, or
      pazopanib. The primary endpoint of the trial will be PFS at 16 weeks. The secondary
      objectives are to further examine the safety and tolerability profile of brivanib, to examine
      the efficacy of brivanib in this population in terms of best overall response, response rate,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival, to describe baseline and changes in I-cG250
      PET/CT in relation to observed therapeutic effects, to describe novel baseline histologic
      features of these tumors in relation to observed therapeutic effects. Modalities will include
      Von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 gene (HIF-1) expression
      assessment and a novel histo-cytometric assessment of the tumor microenvironment in terms of
      p-STAT3, p-ERK, Ki67, VEGFR2, FGFR1 expression, to describe changes in circulating collagen
      IV on brivanib in relation to therapeutic effects, to explore the relationship between single
      nucleotide polymorphisms in angiogenesis-related genes and the activity of brivanib in the
      treatment of these patients.
