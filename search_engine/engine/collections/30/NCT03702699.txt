      ability of a novel APD for auricular point detection among patients with knee osteoarthritis,
      as compared with an already commercialized device. The investigators will test if the novel
      APD could provide a more reliable and quantifiable diagnosis than traditional devices
      currently available in the market; They will also use the APD device to test whether the
      cutaneous electrical impedance detected from the corresponding auricular points by the novel
      device is the lowest in the knee and lower limb area in the KOA population. As a pilot study,
      12 patients with KOA will be recruited from the Department of Anesthesiology, Queen Mary
      Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. 12 healthy subjects will be recruited from the
      university community. Auricular acupoint detection will be accomplished with the new device
      and a control device. The electrical impedance will be measured and recorded. Patient's
      condition will also be evaluated by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The
      specificity and sensitivity of the auricular point detection by the APD device will be
      calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº) will be used to test the inter-methods reliability,
      test-retest reliability, and inter-tester reliability. Moreover, the Pearson Correlation
      Coefficient will be used to test the correlation between the electrical impedance of the
      auricular point of knee and the KOOS score and WOMAC score.
