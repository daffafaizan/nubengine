      transduced chondrocytes that express TGF-b1 to regenerate the damaged cartilage.

      During the clinical trial Phase 2, the investigators compare low dose or high dose
      TissueGene-C in 12 - months trial with 18 outpatients who have degenerative arthritis. The
      patients are randomized to two dose levels of TissueGene-C by 1:1 ratio, and they are
      monitored and recorded for alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and
      the presence of adverse events.
