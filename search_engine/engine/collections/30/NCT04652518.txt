      centers globally to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LYT-100 compared to placebo in 168
      adults with post-acute COVID-19 respiratory complications who were treated with, but no
      longer require mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, non-invasive
      ventilation (eg CPAP or BiPAP), high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, or combination thereof.
      LYT-100 or placebo will be taken daily for up to 91 days with the primary outcome of change
      in distance walked on the six-minute walk test performed in line with the American Thoracic
      Society Respiratory Society Guidelines assessed at Day 91. Secondary endpoints, including
      pharmacokinetics, inflammatory biomarkers, imaging, and patient-reported outcomes of dyspnea
      and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey will also be evaluated.
