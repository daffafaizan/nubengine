      control subjects. The study will consist of the standardized collection of data from HED
      medical history questionnaires and non-invasive tests. A subset of subjects will undergo
      genetic testing. All data will be collected from families attending the 2010 NFED Family
      Conference, July 22-24, 2010, in Colorado Springs, CO.

      Since HED is a rare disease, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on a sufficient number
      of subjects in any one region. The NFED Family Conference is a location where families
      affected with HED come together, and therefore, presents an ideal location to obtain data
      needed to design future studies. As the procedures are non-invasive and are designed to take
      a relatively short period of time, subjects can participate in this study while attending the
      NFED Family Conference.
