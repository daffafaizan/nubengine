      modification of the recommendations proposed by the Nordic Guidelines.

      Four concentrations of Chenopodium album allergen extract, together with a positive and
      negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol
      saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar
      surface of the forearm.
