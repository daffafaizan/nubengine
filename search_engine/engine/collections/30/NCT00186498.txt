      memantine, FDA approved for use in moderate to severe alzheimers dementia, may reduce the
      neurocognitive deficits associated with right unilateral ECT treatments in patients receiving
      ECT for a severe and relatively refractory Major Depressive episode.

      Our hypothesis is that the use of an NMDA antagonist would reduce intracellular calcium
      levels, and glutamatergic stimulation during ECT. This reduction in excitatory stimulation
      during ECT would reduce hippocampal and prefrontal neuronal endangerment and dysfunction,
      thereby reducing cognitive impairment associated with right unilateral ECT treatments. We
      also hypothesize that ACTH and cortisol levels will correlate with neurocognitive impairment
      in placebo treated subjects, but not in the memantine treated individuals.
