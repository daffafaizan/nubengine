      exposed to ultraviolet light, mushrooms will convert a precursor to vitamin D. This reaction
      produces large amounts of vitamin D. This study is comparing a natural source of vitamin D to
      a synthetic source of vitamin D and will help determine if mushrooms are a novel source for
      this essential nutrient.
