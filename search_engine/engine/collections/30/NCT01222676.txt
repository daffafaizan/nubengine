    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the activity (pathological complete response) of neoadjuvant cisplatin and
           gemcitabine hydrochloride in combination with sorafenib tosylate in patients with
           muscle-invasive, node-negative transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the potential biological correlates of disease response and drug activity
           in tumor tissue samples before and after treatment.

        -  To evaluate the correlation between fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography
           (18FDG-PET) and standard computed tomography (CT) results and the ability of changes of
           18FDG-PET (as measured by EORTC criteria for response) to predict subsequent favorable
           response to treatment (pathological complete response rate and progression-free
           survival).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive sorafenib tosylate
      twice daily on days 1-21. starting on day 1and continuing up to Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 2 courses. Patients are reassessed after course 2, those who experience disease
      progression or deemed unresectable are off study. Other patients continue the treatment for 2
      more courses*.

      NOTE: *Sorafenib tosylate are stopped 14 days prior to planned cystectomy.

      No more than 30 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo planned
      radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection off study.

      Tumor tissue and serum samples may be collected during study for additional biological
      studies.
