      a protease inhibitor (PI), plus concurrent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) ABC and 3TC on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic, HIV-1 infected
      patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Treatment duration is 24 weeks, and patients
      serve as their own controls. The combination therapy is evaluated for safety, tolerability,
      efficacy, and effects on body composition. The proportion of patients who attain plasma HIV
      RNA below the lower limit of quantitation of the Roche Amplicor (less than 400 copies/ml) and
      Ultrasensitive (less than 50 copies/ml) is measured at 24 weeks after starting therapy with
      APV plus ABC plus 3TC.
