      decline in real function. The contrast enhanced CT is especially in emergency patients an
      important diagnostic tool for example in the detection of pulmonary embolism or mesenteric
      ischemia. Creatinine has been used as a marker for real function so far. But the
      investigators all know that creatinine is not a perfect marker especially as it is influenced
      by age, sex, weight and muscle mass. Especially in the diagnosis of acute renal failure
      creatinine does not allow and recent change in the kidney function.

      This prospective, unicentric study should therefore investigate two new markers in emergency
      patients who need an emergency contrast enhanced CT to early predict pending kidney function
      decline.
