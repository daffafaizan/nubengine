      behavioral intervention for obese children. Participants will be divided into 3 groups
      according to their change in weight: 1) children who lost greater than 5% of body weight; 2)
      children who lost less than 5% of body weight or gained less than 1% of body weight; 3)
      children who gained greater than 1% of body weight. We will invite five families from each of
      groups 1 and 3 to participate in an open-ended interview.
