      fasting conditions. Subjects checked into the clinical facility the day prior to dosing at
      least 10 hours prior to dose administration. On study day 1, subjects were dosed with single
      oral dose (1x10mg tablet) of the test and reference products thirty minutes after initiation
      of a standardized, high fat breakfast which was preceded by an overnight fast. Following a
      seven day wash out period, subjects returned and were dosed with an alternative treatment as
      per randomization

      personal reasons prior to period II check in. Subject 22 was excluded from statistical
      analysis due to emesis before twice the median Tmax of reference product
