      network builds on a static registry that was based on a one-time clinical characterization of
      PP patients in Europe (ERASPEN). The International Rare and Severe Psoriasis Expert Network
      (IRASPEN) already has multiple clinicians involved who have successfully characterized and
      included their patients in ERASPEN. IRASPEN addresses the question of temporal evolution of
      clinical features and is actually a non-interventional prospective registry that aims to
      describe the clinical course and responses to already established treatments of a large
      number of PP patients over a period of 5 years. The data collection with this registry will
      give insight on the natural course of PP disease revealing the burden of disease including
      frequency and severity of flares and the role of therapeutic interventions.
