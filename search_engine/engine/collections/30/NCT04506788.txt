      comatose cardiac arrest survivors under propofol anesthesia and its association with
      neurological outcome. Comatose adult patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) after
      cardiac arrest are included. Patients with previous neurological disease expected to affect
      substantially the EEG are excluded. The patients' relatives are asked for an informed written
      consent to participate. In the intensive care, the patients are sedated using continuous
      infusion of propofol while receiving temperature management/hypothermia treatment following
      the ICUs' common practice. EEG is recorded within the first 24h after ICU admission. If
      possible, the recording is repeated on the second and third day i.e. 48h and 72h after ICU
      admission, respectively. To induce the maximum effect of propofol on EEG, additional boluses
      of propofol during the EEG recording may be given until the burst suppression level is
      reached. Slow wave activity is calculated offline from the EEG recordings. The neurological
      recovery of the patients is defined 6 months after cardiac arrest from patient documents
      and/or by phone call to the patient/ relative using Cerebral Performance Category. After the
      follow-up period patient or the relative is also asked to fill a survey (SF-36) to estimate
      the health and quality of life.
