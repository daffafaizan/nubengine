      were divided into four groups of 10 patients. The control group (Group C) was not subjected
      to laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopic surgery was respectively performed with an
      intra-abdominal pressure of 9, 12 and 15 mmHg in Groups L (low), M (medium), and H (high
      pressure). Intraocular pressure was measured binocularly in each patient at three different
      time (before, during and end of surgery) using a contact tonometer.
