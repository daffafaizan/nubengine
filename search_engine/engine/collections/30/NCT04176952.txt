    
      This is an integrated, open label, non-randomised, phase II trial of 2 neo-adjuvant regimens
      (FOLFOX-A and AG) assessing efficacy and toxicity with integrated translational work. The
      study is powered on testing a proposed DNA damage response deficient biomarker for
      responsiveness in patients treated with FOLFOX-A; patients being treated with AG are
      recruited concurrently. The study has a prospective safety assessment of neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy consisting of
      conventional radiotherapy with concomitant capecitabine. This safety assessment will include
      all patients (FOLFOX-A and AG)
