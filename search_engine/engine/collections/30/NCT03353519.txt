      the unit of randomisation. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the clinical and long-term
      cost effectiveness of a novel model of primary care for stroke survivors living in the
      community.

      People with a history of stroke on the registers of GP practices in the East of England and
      the East Midlands will be invited to take part. We will aim to recruit approximately 920
      people registered with 46 general practices. We will target Practices with a stroke register
      comprising a minimum of 100 patients, to ensure that we reach our cluster target of 16 - 24
      participants.

      Potentially eligible participants will be sent an invitation to take part in the study by
      their GP surgery. Once all invitation letters and reminders have been sent out to patients in
      a practice, the GP practice will be randomised. GP practices will be randomised in a ratio of
      1:1 to intervention or control. Intervention practices will deliver the new model of primary
      care. The control arm will consist of current usual care.

      Data collection will occur at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. This will comprise a
      combination of postal and telephone administered questionnaires and a review of general
      practice notes. The primary endpoint for the trial will be two sub-scales (emotion and
      handicap) of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS v3.0) as co-primary outcomes at 12 months (adjusted
      for baseline). Economic evaluation as well as quantitative and qualitative assessments of
      intervention fidelity will also be performed.
