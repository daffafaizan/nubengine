    
      The effect of the co-administration of verapamil on the steady state PK of solifenacin
      succinate and tamsulosin HCl OCAS (Oral Controlled Absorption System) is evaluated in this
      study.

      Verapamil has been chosen to represent the effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the
      combined administration of solifenacin and tamsulosin given as combination tablet EC905.

      Subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -1. From Days 1-10, they receive one daily dose of
      EC905 to obtain steady state, followed by 20 days (Days 11-30) combined dosing of EC905 and
      verapamil.

      On Day 10 a 24-hour PK profile is obtained for solifenacin/tamsulosin. After the last dosing
      on Day 30, a post-dose 24-hour PK profile for solifenacin/tamsulosin and verapamil is
      obtained.

      Additionally, vital signs, safety ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurements, safety laboratory
      assessments, adverse events and concomitant medications are monitored throughout the
      investigational period.

      Subjects return for an ESV (End of Study Visit) 10 days after the last dosing.
