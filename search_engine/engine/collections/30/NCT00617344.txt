      was assessed in a subset of participants in each group.

      Safety was assessed in all participants as follows: solicited adverse event (AE) prelisted in
      the diary card were collected for 7 days after vaccination for solicited injection site
      reactions and 14 days for solicited systemic reactions , unsolicited AEs were collected for
      28 days after vaccination, and serious adverse event (SAE) information collected throughout
      the study up to 6 months after vaccination.
