      and/or cisplatin in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Unfortunately, considerable
      proportions of patients with metastatic gastric cancer do not respond to first-line
      chemotherapy and most of the patients who do respond eventually experience disease
      progression. In the second-line treatment, however, standard therapies are less clearly
      defined.

      Meanwhile, regarding re-challenge of previous failed drugs as a combination with an other
      newly introduced chemotherapeutic agent, there are few data. Increased expression and
      activity of thymidylate synthase, which is inhibited by fluoropyrimidine, is regarded to be
      the main reason for the development of clinical resistance to fluoropyrimidine. Since the
      cotreatment of docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil decreases the activity and expression of
      thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (5-fluorouracil degradation enzyme),
      and increases the expression of orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, the addition of docetaxel
      into S-1 may recover the sensitivity to S-1 in patients previously resistant to S-1.

      Several reports found that MDR-1 and MRP-1 are related to cisplatin-resistance; cisplatin
      induces the overexpression of MRP-1, which reduces intracellular cisplatin accumulation.
      Since docetaxel suppresses the cisplatin-induced MRP-1 upregulation, the addition of
      docetaxel into cisplatin may recover the sensitivity to cisplatin in patients previously
      resistant to cisplatin.

      Based on these synergism mechanisms, we speculate that the cotreatment of docetaxel and
      cisplatin or S-1 has better anti-tumor activity than docetaxel alone in patients resistant to
      cisplatin or S-1.
