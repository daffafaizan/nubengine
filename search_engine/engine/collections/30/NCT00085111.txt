      I. To estimate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of bevacizumab by dose escalation to a
      maximum of 15mg/kg, even if MTD is not reached, administered as an intravenous infusion,
      every 2 weeks to children with refractory solid tumors.

      II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and other toxicities of bevacizumab given
      on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of bevacizumab in children with refractory
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of bevacizumab within the confines of a
      phase I study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of bevacizumab by measuring levels of total serum VEGF,
      and parallel angiogenic markers V-CAM-1, ICAM-1, bFGF, and TSP-1 at baseline and at time
      points post therapy.

      III. To explore the biologic effect of bevacizumab on circulating endothelial cells (CECs)
      and circulating endothelial cell precursors (CECPs).

      IV. To determine in archival tumor tissue the expression of VEGF by immunohistochemistry
      and/or real time PCR.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
