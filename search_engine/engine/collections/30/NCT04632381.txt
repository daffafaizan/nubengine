    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of zotatifin administered IV to adults with mild or moderate COVID 19.

      Patients will be randomized to receive zotatifin or placebo in 3 cohorts of 12 patients each.
      Cohorts will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher zotatifin dose levels. Study
      drug will not be administered to patients who are hospitalized. The second dose of study drug
      will not be administered should a patient progress from mild or moderate COVID-19 to severe
      COVID-19 prior to or on Day 8. Patients will assess and record their symptoms daily through
      Day 22 and at follow up (30 days after last infusion) (or at the early termination visit [if
      conducted]) in a paper patient diary using the WHO 9-point ordinal scale for clinical
      improvement. Other safety and efficacy measures will be assessed according to the Schedule of
      Procedures on Days 1, 4, 8, 10, 15 (end of treatment visit), and 22, and at follow up (30
      days after last infusion). On non-dosing days, study visits will be conducted as home health
      visits, except for the follow-up visit, which will be conducted as a telephone visit.
