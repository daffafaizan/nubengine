      infant is a critical period for the development of health and disease in the whole life.
      Exposure of negative environmental, nutritional and lifestyle factors in pregnant women
      during this period can have adverse effects on fetal and infant. In addition, for mothers,
      complications during pregnancy could also have a negative effect on long-term health of
      mothers, such as diabetes, hypertension. Thus, the Peking University Birth Cohort in Tongzhou
      is primarily aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of pre-pregnant and
      prenatal exposure on maternal and child health. Data are collected regarding environmental,
      nutritional and lifestyle exposures as well as short-term and long-term health outcomes of
      mothers and their children from birth to 6 years old. Biological samples including blood and
      tissue samples are also collected from mothers and their children.
