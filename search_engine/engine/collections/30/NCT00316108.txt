      stroke cases each year. Mortality rates as high as 40 percent have been reported for stroke
      as a result of ischemia associated with the carotid distribution. Currently, the primary
      therapy for carotid artery occlusive disease is carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or the surgical
      removal of atheromatous material from inside the artery.

      Although CEA is an effective treatment for the majority of patients with carotid occlusive
      disease, there remains a need for a treatment option for those patients with significant
      surgical risk factors. These patients have been shown to have much higher rates of morbidity
      and mortality. There are approximately 50,000-70,000 patients each year who are considered
      poor surgical candidates. These patients present with either one or more anatomical or
      co-morbid conditions and have a one-year stroke and death rate of up to 15% with traditional
      surgical treatment.

      Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported by numerous single-center trials to be
      feasible in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Moreover, the risk benefit ratio has
      been suggested to be the largest in those patients with a higher risk profile for the CEA
      treatment option.

      This trial will study the effects of percutaneous intervention using the Monorail™ Carotid
      Wallstent® Endoprosthesis (Carotid Wallstent) in conjunction with the FilterWire System
      distal protection device (FilterWire EX and EZ) on rates of common peri-procedural
      complications as well as on long-term outcomes as compared to historical outcomes of patients
      undergoing CEA.
