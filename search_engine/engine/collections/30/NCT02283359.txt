      utilizes the standard 3+3 design for dose. The dose of selinexor will be escalated in
      combination with the standard doses of irinotecan. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for study
      is defined as the highest dose level at which 1 or less of 6 patients experience a dose
      limiting toxicity DLT.

      Once the MTD is reached and/or the recommended dose for expansion is determined, an
      additional cohort of 15 patients with advanced gastric or esophageal cancer will be accrued
      to better define the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen.
