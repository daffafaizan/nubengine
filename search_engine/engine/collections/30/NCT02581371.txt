    
      Rehabilitation programs and drug therapy in a stroke aimed, primarily, to the stimulation of
      the processes of neuroplasticity.

      After the screening procedures the eligible patients get randomized in 1 of the 2 groups:
      either the group of a standard therapy in combination with Cerebrolysin infusions, or the
      group of a standard therapy in combination with placebo infusions.

      The therapy consists of the 3 consecutive periods:

        1. st - 10 days of daily infusions of Cerebrolysin / placebo;

        2. nd - 7 days break;

        3. d - 10 days of daily infusions of Cerebrolysin / placebo.

      All participants will attend 7 Visits of the study (Visits 0, 1-6) at 2 sites respectively:

        1. st - clinical center #1 - Sverdlovsk Regional Clinical Hospital #1, Ekaterinburg

        2. nd - clinical center #2 - Clinical Institute of Brain, Ekaterinburg.

      Patients will be transferred from the 1st site to the 2nd one at the moment of time between
      Visit 2 and Visit 3.

      Patients will undergo traditional laboratory and clinical examination procedures and several
      specific ones such as scale NIHSS, modified Rankin scale, Barthel index, hand Frenchy
      assessments. All hand Frenchy assessments will be videotaped for later evaluation by an
      authorized researcher.

      All participants will undergo the procedure of navigational transcranial magnetic stimulation
      of the brain NBS eXimia Nexstim with the use of an individual 3D brain model created on the
      Visit 0 MRI results basis.

      Neither the patient nor the doctor will know whether they receive an investigational drug or
      placebo.
