      Virgino (R) CTPRO or butter) for 6 to 8 weeks. They are separated from each other with an
      eight-week washout period. At the end of both periods and 12-hour fasting an oral glucose-fat
      tolerance test is carried out. Except glucose, the test consists cream (after the butter
      phase) and CTPRO (after the CTPRO phase).

      Otherwise, the subjects (n=43) are asked to maintain their normal dietary habits.
