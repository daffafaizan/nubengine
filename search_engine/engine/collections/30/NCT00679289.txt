      intravenously (IV) once every 2 weeks starting on Day 3 of Week 1 at the following doses: 5
      mg/m^2 in Cohort 1, 10 mg/m^2 in Cohort 2, and 20 mg/m^2 in Cohort 3. HDI was administered
      concurrently at a dose of 20 million units (MU)/m^2 IV once daily (QD) for 5 consecutive days
      per week for 4 weeks (induction phase), followed by 10 MU/m^2 administered subcutaneously
      (SC) 3 times per week (maintenance phase). Patients received KW2871 and HDI combination
      therapy until disease progression requiring treatment intervention that would have interfered
      with the interpretation of the study results.

      Initially, 3 patients were enrolled within a cohort and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) and regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) for the first 8 weeks of study treatment. If 1 of 3
      patients experienced an RLT, the cohort was expanded to 6 patients. Escalation to the next
      higher dose cohort proceeded if the RLT rate was <33% (0/3 or 1/6 patients) in a given
      cohort. The combination treatment was considered safe if â‰¤ 20% patients experienced RLT.

      DLT was defined as any adverse event (AE) that required reduction of the HDI dose or
      discontinuation of KW2871. RLT was defined as an HDI-related DLT that required more than 2
      dose reductions of HDI during the induction phase or the first 4 weeks of the maintenance
      phase, or any KW2871- or regimen-related DLT.
