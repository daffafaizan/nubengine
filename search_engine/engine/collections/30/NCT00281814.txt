        -  Investigate the relative importance of having a consistent inpatient lay care-partner
           for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, in terms of the effects
           on modes of adjustment to illness and survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 40-minute recorded oral interview in person to provide personal
      and social demographic data using a 20-item questionnaire (The Adjustment to Illness
      Questionnaire-Bone Marrow Transplantation) at baseline (pre-transplant) and at day 100
      post-transplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
