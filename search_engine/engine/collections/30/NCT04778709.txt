    
      The proposed study is a Randomized, single-masked, split-mouth, single center study.

      About 20 subjects will be screened in order to randomize 10 study subjects. 10 patients who
      needing bilateral sinus augmentation procedure using the lateral window technique will be
      randomized using computer generated randomized technique.

      At the day of the surgical procedure each tooth sites will be randomized 1:1 into one of the
      following bone grafts to either the right or left side of the mouth.:

        -  Bone graft A: A mixture of 25% small-particle cortical allograft, 25% large-particle
           cortical allograft, 25% small-particle cancellous allograft, and 25% large-particle
           cancellous allograft is used for one sinus (N=10)

        -  Bone graft B: 100% large particle cancellous allograft for the contralateral sinus
           (N=10) Immediately after the sinus augmentation surgery a CBCT will be acquired and will
           be compared to a second CBCT prior to implant placement in order to compare the
           volumetric changes in the sinus.

      At the visit of implant placement, a bone core will be collected from both sinuses for
      histomorphometric evaluation to evaluate the residual graft particles, the new vital bone
      formation and the amount of soft tissue components.
