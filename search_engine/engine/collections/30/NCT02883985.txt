      cancer irradiation was common in the forties and 50s and, while very successful in achieving
      tumor control, was found to leave significantly inferior cosmetic results due to severe
      fibrosis and telangiectasia compared to those obtained with multiple fraction regimens
      (38-40). These complications were due to the use of very large fields, with the inclusion of
      a large proportion of uninvolved skin and tissue surrounding the tumor.

      Based on these assumptions, a few large fractions can be safely delivered to breast cancers
      provided that 1) the target volume is sufficiently small and 2) the radiation technique
      assures maximum sparing of the surrounding normal tissue. Conformal RT to the tumor bed of T1
      breast cancers satisfies both requirements.
