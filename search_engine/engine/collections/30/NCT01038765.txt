    
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a 8 session group intervention and is well
      described by several authors.

      Previous studies showed Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to be effective to prevent
      relapse in patients with recurrent depression and 3 or more previous depressive episodes.

      Study aims are:

        1. to replicate previous findings in The Netherlands, by a research team which did not
           develop the intervention

        2. to investigate if MBCT is applicable for patients with recurrent depression and current
           depressive symptoms

        3. to examine possible mediators of treatment effect and predictors of relapse in the year
           following the treatment

      In this study, patients are randomly assigned to a MBCT intervention group or a waiting list
      control group. Patients allocated to the waiting list control condition will receive the MBCT
      course three months later. All patients who participated in a MBCT training will be assessed
      during the year following the completion of the MBCT course. We aim to include about 220
      patients.
