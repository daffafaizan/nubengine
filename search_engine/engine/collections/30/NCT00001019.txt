      manufactured through recombinant DNA technology and used as an immunogen. Antibodies directed
      against gp120 can neutralize HIV-1, and gp120 can also stimulate certain types of
      cell-mediated immune responses. Because many immunogens, including candidate HIV vaccines,
      may evoke relatively weak immune responses, the use of adjuvants, or substances that augment
      immune responses to vaccines, is of interest. MTP-PE/MF59, composed of the immunomodulator
      MTP-PE combined with MF59 emulsion, appears to be a promising adjuvant and has been selected
      for studies with the gp120 vaccine.

      In Part A, 32 volunteers (eight on each of four treatment arms) are randomized to receive one
      of two doses (15 or 50 mcg) of gp120 vaccine with either MTP-PE/MF59 adjuvant emulsion or
      MF59 emulsion alone. The volunteers receive three IM injections at 0, 1, and 6 months. In
      Part B, 16 female volunteers (eight on each of two treatment arms) are randomized to receive
      either MF59 emulsion alone (placebo) or MF59 emulsion plus gp120 vaccine (50 mcg). Volunteers
      receive five IM injections at monthly intervals.
