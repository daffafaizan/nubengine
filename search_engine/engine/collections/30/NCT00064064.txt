        -  Determine the partial and complete objective response rate in patients with metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 4 hours followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly
      on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
