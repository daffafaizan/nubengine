      address pain management in the inpatient setting while appropriately managing pain and
      optimizing patient safety in the inpatient setting. This strategy involves developing a new
      health Information Technology tool in the Omnicell and electronic medical record,
      implementing a "menu" of pain management and relaxation strategies, and developing
      educational materials for staff and patients to change the culture of pain management.

      This intervention will be implemented throughout CHS hospitals, using a stepped wedge design
      to guide rollout. The initial pilot will be conducted in the trauma inpatient units at
      Carolinas Medical Center. All patients admitted to the two primary trauma units (11A and 11
      Tower) during the pilot study period will be included in the evaluation.
