        1. To investigate the efficacy and safety of SCCCG-LBL-2017 in Chinese children with LBL.

        2. To explore the feasibility of risk stratification of T-LBL by combining genotyping.

        3. To investigate the correlation between MDD and MRD in lymphoblastic lymphoma and
           prognosis.

        4. To investigate the role of PET/CT in the assessment of residual lymphoblastic lymphoma.

        5. To explore the effect of reducing HD-MTX dosage and shortening maintenance therapy time
           on the efficacy and survival of low-risk LBL patients.

        6. To explore the effect of prolonging the duration of maintenance therapy on the efficacy
           and survival of high-risk LBL patients.
