      complete clinical record is collected as well as a sperm and a fasting blood sample. Patients
      are stratified according to current guidelines focusing on sperm and anatomical
      characteristics. Sperm characteristics will be studied on fresh samples immediately after
      collection; blood samples will be centrifuged and plasma stored at -80Â°C until analysis that
      include routine glucose and lipid profile by commercial kits. Vitamin E (alpha- and
      gamma-tocopherol), oxysterols profiling, and fatty acids profiling is analyzed by state of
      the art gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using isotope dilution methods.
