      clusters (30 clusters per treatment arm). The cohort will be followed for 6 months for
      baseline covariate measurements and 24 months with intervention. Blood samples will be taken
      once every 4 weeks from all cohort subjects to test for malaria infection and whenever a
      subject reports a recent history of fever (within previous 48 hours). RDTs will be used for
      point-of-care treatment of positive infections. All positive malaria infections, clinical and
      asymptomatic, will be treated. The incidence of malaria infection will be measured by
      microscopy and estimated and compared between treatment arms to determine the benefit of
      using an SR in an area with high, seasonal transmission of malaria. Entomological endpoints
      of exposure risk to mosquitoes will also be measured to identify entomological correlates of
      SR efficacy that may be useful for the evaluation of new SR products.

      The SR will be a new formulation of transfluthrin. This active ingredient (AI) is widely used
      in mosquito coils and other household pest control products. The new formulation is a passive
      emanator that will release the AI over a period of up to four weeks. The emanator will
      consist of a pre-treated piece of cellulose acetate, which will be positioned within
      consenting households according to manufacturer specifications. The SRs and placebos for this
      study will be designed and manufactured by SC Johnson, Inc. USA.
