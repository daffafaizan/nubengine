      include limited time during appointments, consultations with multiple different providers,
      technical communication style, health literacy issues, and a sense of feeling overwhelmed.
      Patients with chronic pain syndromes experience symptoms which can negatively impact their
      quality of life by interfering with ability to sleep, work, and function in their social
      roles. One proposed mechanism in chronic pain management is mindfulness. Mindfulness is the
      intentional and non-judgmental conscious awareness of the present moment, or "paying
      attention on purpose" with the goal of physical and psychological health improvement.
      Participants are taught autonomy, increasing self-regulation, and focusing awareness on a
      particular goal or activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that a mind-body counselor will improve patient engagement and
      promote adherence to pain coping treatments. If the initial findings from this project
      support the use of Integrative Medicine services in women with chronic pelvic pain, the
      investigators hope to expand this study to a larger, randomized controlled trial that is
      adequately powered to determine significant difference among participants in the control and
      study groups.
