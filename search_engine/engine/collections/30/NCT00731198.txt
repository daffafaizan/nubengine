      biliary diseases. Duodenal peristalsis can make cannulation of the papilla and the necessary
      therapeutic procedures difficult. Intravenous hyoscine-N-butylbromide is often used during
      ERCP to inhibit duodenal motility and enhance cannulation in China. However, the
      pharmaceutical agent is occasionally associated with serious complications such as
      cardiovascular events or anaphylactic shock. Hyoscine-N-butylbromide may also affect the
      ocular, urinary, and salivary systems.

      Drotaverine hydrochloride is an analogue of papaverine with smooth muscle relaxant
      properties. It is a non-anticholinergic antispasmodic, which selectively inhibits
      phosphodiesterase IV and is accompanied by a mild calcium channel-blocking effect. Adverse
      effects with drotaverine hydrochloride, such as hypotension, vertigo, nausea, and
      palpitation, are mostly mild. It can be supposed that intravenous drotaverine hydrochloride
      might be a feasible antimotility alternative to intravenous hyoscine-N-butylbromide in ERCP.
      But there is no clear evidence to recommend the use of drotaverine hydrochloride as an
      antispasmodic during ERCP.

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of drotaverine hydrochloride versus
      hyoscine-N-butylbromide in reducing duodenal motility during diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP.
      The effects of drotaverine hydrochloride on facilitative cannulation and its adverse effects
      were also compared to hyoscine-N-butylbromide.
