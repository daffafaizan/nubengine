      indication for valve surgery. Bioprosthetic valves are known to degenerate via a process that
      is predominantly driven by calcification. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has
      recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement
      (AVR) surgery. Whilst this technique holds great promise, long-term follow up data are
      lacking and the longevity of these valves remains to be established.

      In this longitudinal, cross-sectional study of 180 subjects with either surgical or
      transcatheter implanted bioprostheses, this study proposes to look for the earliest signs of
      active calcification using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET). During a 5 year
      follow-up period, this study hopes to demonstrate that 18F-fluoride PET will predict
      subsequent bioprosthetic valve degeneration and identify patients at risk of premature valve
      failure. The study also hopes that it will inform about the comparative durability of novel
      percutaneous valves. If successful, 18F-Fluoride could provide a useful method of assessing
      novel therapeutic strategies targeted at improving the longevity of bioprostheses and help to
      guide future valve design.
