      technique for assessing micro-vascular structure by tracking the pharmacokinetics of injected
      low-molecular weight contrast agents as they pass through the tumor vasculature. This
      modality is being increasingly used in many oncological studies to characterize tumor
      angiogenesis and invasiveness, and monitor the treatment response.

      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) enables qualitative and quantitative assessment of tissue
      diffusivity (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC) without the use of gadolinium chelates. DWI
      has been suggested to be useful in monitoring the response of HCC after TACE because of
      earlier assessment of tumor necrosis with increasing ADC values.

      MR spectroscopy facilitates the study of cellular metabolism and in vivo detection of
      abnormalities. A few studies of in vivo MR spectroscopy reported an increase in choline
      levels within tumors such as HCC and a reduction in the lipid-to-choline ratio after
      conventional TACE was performed for HCC.
