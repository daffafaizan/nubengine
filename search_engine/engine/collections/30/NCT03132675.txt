    
      The study will be comprised of a screening period, a treatment period (up to 2 years), a long
      term follow-up period, and a survival follow-up period.

      Eligible patients will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for
      18 tavo-EP cycles and 35 pembrolizumab cycles (from baseline) of continued treatment
      (approximately 2 years), or until disease progression. As many accessible lesions may be
      treated as deemed feasible by the treating physician assuming the size of each lesion is
      greater than 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm.

      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after End of Study (EOS) Treatment visit
      for SAEs (through 90 days from last dose of study drug). Subjects who discontinue treatment
      due to disease progression will directly enter the survival follow-up period following the
      End of Study Treatment visit. Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason other than
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent enter the long-term follow-up period. They will
      have scans, photographs, and investigator-assessed disease evaluation per RECIST v1.1
      collected every 3 months until disease progression, subject receives a new anti-cancer
      treatment (with the exception of maintenance pembrolizumab).

      Information on all subjects' first new anti-cancer therapy will also be collected.

      Survival Follow-up: Once a subject receives a new anti-cancer treatment or progresses during
      long-term follow-up, they will move into survival follow-up. All subjects will be followed
      for survival and disease status-, every 3 months until treatment period, long-term follow-up
      period, and survival follow-up period reaches a total duration of 5 years, withdrawal of
      consent, or until Sponsor terminates the study.
