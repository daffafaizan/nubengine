      COPD patients. Primary evaluations including medical history, physical examination,
      anthropometric data, blood routine, blood biochemistry, blood coagulation,
      electrocardiogram,high resolution chest CT, arterial blood gas, pulmonary function test,6-min
      walking test(6MWT),modified medical research council(MMRC),St George's respiratory
      questionnaire(SGRQ). After initial evaluation, the investigators obtained extraction
      bronchial basal cells micro tissue from 3~4 grade bronchus to by mean of fiberbronchoscopy,
      then purified and selectively amplified bronchial basal cells to reserve .The basal layer
      cell culture system for our partners (Regend Therapeutics) patented technology using culture
      medium containing special combination of growth factors and composite materials to simulated
      composite basal layer environment and can selectively amplified bronchial basal cells, while
      other types of mature epithelial cells and fibroblasts could not grow naturally. After a
      period of time, the basal lamina of the bronchial epithelial cells can be stored in the
      liquid nitrogen cell bank for a long time. Before applied to the patient, bronchial basal
      cells need to go through a series of strict examination. Then, bronchoscopy was performed
      again and the bronchial basal lamina suspension was injected directly into the lesion site .
      Estimate the change of respiratory function(symptoms, signs, chest CT, pulmonary function,
      the 6 minute walk test, MMRC, SGRQ etc) and serum index in third days , first months, third
      months, sixth months and first years of the follow-up after treatment respectively, to
      evaluate the safety and efficiency of autologous bronchial basal cells for treatment of COPD
      .
