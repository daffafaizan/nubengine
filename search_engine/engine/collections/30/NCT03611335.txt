      strategy for engaging patients with OUD in MAT. A pragmatic trial at 6 hospitals, conducted
      in collaboration with the New York City Health and Hospitals system (H+H) and the New York
      City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), will study the CATCH intervention in
      real-world settings and at scale. Guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework, this hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation study (Type 1) focuses primarily on effectiveness, but also
      measures implementation outcomes to inform the intervention's adoption and sustainability. A
      rigorous stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design determines the impact of CATCH on
      opioid treatment outcomes in comparison to usual care for a control period, followed by a
      12-month intervention period and a maintenance period, and utilizes existing administrative
      data to evaluate outcomes. Aim 1 (primary aim) is to evaluate the effectiveness of CATCH in
      increasing post-discharge initiation and engagement in MAT, defined respectively as receiving
      outpatient MAT within 14 days of discharge, and having at least 2 additional MAT visits in
      the first month. Aim 2 is to assess the effectiveness of CATCH for increasing treatment
      retention, defined as continuous receipt of MAT for 6 months. Aim 3 is to compare the
      frequency of acute care utilization and overdose deaths, and their associated costs, among
      patients with OUD who are hospitalized during the CATCH period versus usual care. Aim 4 is to
      evaluate implementation outcomes at CATCH sites using a mixed methods approach to assess the
      intervention's Reach (proportion of eligible patients reached); Adoption (utilization by
      medical staff); and Implementation fidelity (barriers to delivering high-quality MAT).
