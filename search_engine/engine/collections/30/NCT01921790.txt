      poorer outcome in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,and Avastin impacted on tumor
      endothelial cells to make standard chemotherapy work better for T cell lymphoma. Many
      researches on Gemcitabine combined with Oxaliplatin for treatments of recurrent and
      refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed patients could benefit from the combination
      treatment . Pegaspargase plays an important role for treatment of NK/T cell lymphoma.
      Dexamethasone is used in combination with other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which
      may be implicated in the development or growth of some cancers.So we explored to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Avastin combined with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, pegaspargase and
      dexamethasone(Avastin+ GemAOD) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated NK/T cell
      lymphoma
