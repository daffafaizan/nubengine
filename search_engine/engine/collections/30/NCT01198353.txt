      multicenter, non-comparative, open-label trial. Prior antipsychotics were allowed to be
      maintained for up to 4 weeks during the titration of ziprasidone. Efficacy was primarily
      measured using the 18-item Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks,
      and 12 weeks. Efficacy was secondarily measured by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity
      (CGI-S) scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale at each visit. Regarding
      the metabolic effects of switching to ziprasidone, weight, body mass index (BMI),
      waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and lipid profile-including triglyceride (TG), high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol levels-were measured
      at each follow-up visit.
