      even in the era of drug-eluting stents (DES). DESs working principle consists of the delivery
      of controlled amounts of antiproliferative agents at the local level, which results in the
      suppression of neointimal proliferation, the main cause of lumen re-narrowing after stent
      implantation. At present, several DES platforms have been developed and evaluated for
      clinical use. They differ between them with regard to the stent type, anti-proliferative
      drug, presence of polymers employed for drug storage and modification of drug-release
      kinetics as well as type of polymer used for this purpose. Although their mid-term efficacy
      has been well-established, there is an ongoing debate on the potential of an increased
      incidence of late stent thrombosis, particularly after discontinuation of thienopyridine
      therapy, as well as of delayed onset of restenosis or catch-up phenomenon with DESs. Based on
      animal and human pathological data, investigators have linked the above-mentioned concerns to
      the presence of polymers in DESs, which have a proinflammatory and prothrombinogenic
      potential, and sometimes may induce a hypersensitivity reaction. This trial will compare the
      anti-restenotic efficacy of the permanent polymer (PP), biodegradable polymer (BP) and
      polymer-free (PF) rapamycin-eluting stents in patients with coronary artery disease. Cypher
      stent (PP) is a stainless steel stent coated with sirolimus with use of permanent polymers
      while the ISAR stent is a rough surface stainless steel stent which allows not only polymeric
      coating (for example biodegradable polymer, BP ISAR stent) but also coating without the need
      of polymer (PF ISAR stent) in the cath lab.
