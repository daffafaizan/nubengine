      receive transplants of increasing doses of HLA-matched umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell
      into the spinal cord. In the fourth group, we will transplant the highest volume of cells
      that did not increase neurological deficits along with a single bolus of 30mg/kg
      methylprednisolone sodium succinate. In the fifth group of four subjects, we will inject that
      volume of cells plus a bolus intravenous dose of 30mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate
      and a 6-week course of oral lithium carbonate titrated to 0.6-1.0 mM serum levels. All the
      subjects are encouraged to stand or walk for one hour a day after the cell transplantation.

      The neurological and walking outcomes will be assessed 1, 2, 6, 24 and 48 weeks after
      transplantation. The outcomes of the five treatment groups will be compared by analysis of
      variance and, if possible, correlation with cell dose. Efficacy and safety will be analyzed
      comparing neurological change scores amongst the five different treatment groups. Loss of
      motor (>5 points) or sensor scores (>2 points) from baseline pre-treatment levels would be
      considered deleterious. Increases in scores above baseline would be considered beneficial.
