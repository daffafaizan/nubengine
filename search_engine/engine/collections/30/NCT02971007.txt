    
      This is a multi-center, randomized study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      of 200 mg CAMB and 400 mg CAMB compared with a single 150 mg dose of fluconazole in the
      treatment of moderate to severe VVC.

      Approximately 75 women with moderate to severe VVC will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups (200 mg CAMB, 400 mg CAMB, or fluconazole) to achieve approximately 25 subjects in
      each group. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of 200 mg and 400
      mg doses of oral CAMB for 5 days compared with a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole in
      subjects with moderate to severe VVC. The secondary efficacy objectives of this study
      included the clinical cure rate, mycology eradication and responder outcome. Tertiary
      objectives include pharmacokinetics.
