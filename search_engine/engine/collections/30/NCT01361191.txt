    
      In addition to the above:

        -  To evaluate the overall survival after three years.

        -  To determine the rate of global responses and complete remissions, uncertain and
           partial.

        -  To determine the duration of the complete response after the treatment termination.

        -  To carry out an exploratory follow up of the event free survival and the overall
           survival at 5 years.

        -  To evaluate the treatment toxicity according CTC criteria (version 3.0) of the National
           Cancer Institute (NCI).

        -  To asses the role of PET in the disease stage and response evaluation compared to CAT.

        -  To identify the predictable response factors after 6 cycles of treatment with R-MegaCHOP
           administrated every 21 days; or 3 cycles of R-MegaCHOP, followed by IFE+TAPH in patients
           with DLBCL of severe prognosis.

        -  To evaluate the therapeutic fulfillment of the R-MegaCHOP and R+IFE cycles of treatment
           and/or R-IFE in reference with delays with the cycles administration and reductions of
           the chemotherapy dose (planned dose administrated in the planned term).
