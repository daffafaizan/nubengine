      independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease
      and premature death. The main physiological role of vasopressin is to maintain constant
      plasma osmolality. Previous studies in rats and a Mendelian randomization study in humans
      suggest causality between elevated vasopressin concentration and elevated plasma glucose
      concentration. As vasopressin can be suppressed by increasing water intake, the investigators
      hypothesize that water supplementation in individuals with high vasopressin can lower plasma
      glucose and prevent diabetes.

      The aim of this pilot study is to test if six weeks of water supplementation of 1.5 Liters of
      extra water per day in low-drinkers with high copeptin can significantly alter hydration
      markers in general and reduce plasma copeptin in particular. Furthermore, the investigators
      also aim at investigating whether this 6-week water intervention can significantly reduce
      fasting plasma glucose concentration.
