    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on day 1

        -  Erlotinib 150 mg po qd days 1-21

        -  Disease Assessment during even numbered cycles

      If no progressive disease observed, continue (combination or single agent- see below) until
      unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.

      If progressive disease observed, treatment will be discontinued.

        -  Cycles will be repeated every 21 days up to a total of 6 cycles.

        -  Patients with non-progression after 6 cycles may stay on therapy (single agent erlotinib
           or the combination) until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity (at the physician
           discretion).

        -  Patients who require discontinuation of bevacizumab may receive at investigator's
           discretion erlotinib alone on study until progression.

        -  Patients who require discontinuation of erlotinib may receive at investigator's
           discretion bevacizumab alone until progression.
