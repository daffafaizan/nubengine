      or both radio- and chemotherapy suffer from decreased quality of life (QoL). This study is to
      analyse the influence of two adjuvant interventions of physical activity and exercising (PAE)
      (namely resistance training and endurance training) in relation to quality of life,
      depression, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, stress and coping, body image, and social interactions
      (psychological dimensions); cardiorespiratory fitness, morning cortisol secretion,
      inflammatory markers, and objective sleep (physiological dimensions).
