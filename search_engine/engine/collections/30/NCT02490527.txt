    
      Patient Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Must be between 30-75 years of age.

        2. Must have a VO2max greater than 18 ml/kg/min(non-sedentary individuals).

        3. Subjects with LDL>100mg/dL

        4. Subjects without a prior cerebrovascular event (example: stroke)

        5. Subjects without a prior cardiovascular event (example: heart attack)

      Patient Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Liver, thyroid, or kidney disease.

        2. Currently taking drugs that interfere with statin metabolism (calcium channel blockers,
           colchicine etc.).

        3. Acute or chronic infectious disease; autoimmune/inflammatory disease, cancer, COPD,
           anemia, diabetes, psychiatric illness.

        4. Non-smokers, prior smokers, or illicit drug users with abstinence >1 year.

        5. Subjects taking blood thinners (Coumadin, xarelto, pradaxa, Plavix, effient, apixiban,
           etc) will be excluded. If subjects are taking aspirin for routine prevention they will
           be asked to hold aspirin for 7 days prior to biopsy. Routine prevention means that the
           patients are taking aspirin to reduce their risks, but do not have established
           cardiovascular disease.

        6. History of previous knee surgery and active history of knee pain or neuromuscular
           disease are exclusions as they are known to affect muscle structure and function.

      The study will be a double blind placebo controlled study where subjects will be randomized
      to either of two groups:

        1. Simvastatin 40 mg + placebo once daily (statin only group) for 3 months

        2. Simvastatin 40 mg + Epi 50 mg once daily (statin + Epi group) for 3 months
