      (CML) and must have previously attempted to discontinue TKI therapy. All participants must be
      restarted on a TKI at the time of relapse in order to be eligible for this trial.

      After completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy, eligible participants will remain in
      the TFR phase of the study for up to 36 months, and will have central polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) testing during the first 24 months. Therefore, the total duration of the trial
      will be approximately 48 months (12 months on combination treatment phase + 36 months in the
      TFR phase).
