      Primary To examine the progression free survival (PFS) of Avastin and Erlotinib (AE) or
      Avastin (A) as consolidation therapy.

      Secondary To examine the toxicity between the two consolidative regimens AE vs. A. To assess
      the response rate of CTA.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN This study uses a randomized selection design. Both consolidation
      treatment arms are deemed experimental and are compared against a historical control [McGuire
      WP et al. Cyclophosphamide and cisplatin compared with paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients
      with stage III and stage IV ovarian cancer. NEJM 1996: 334:1-6. PMID:7494563]. With 30
      patients in a given arm and 6 months of follow-up, there was 80% power to detect a 61.5%
      increase in median PFS from 13 months to 21 months assuming 1-sided 10% significance.
