      between 18 and more, with 14 weeks of amenorrhea, possessing a smartphone, will be recruited
      and randomized into two groups:

      125 in the control group (smartphone application "placebo" = number of steps) 125 will be
      equipped with the application "Bouge" = coached group

      For three months, the patients do their daily physical activity. The "coached" group, through
      the smartphone application "Bouge", receives computer coaching to increase their physical
      activity (no direct medical intervention, only notifications and computer pusch).

      The control group is not coached by the application (simple display of the number of step)
