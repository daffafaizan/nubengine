    
      In this study, patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CKD1-5, defined by glomerular
      filtration rate，GFR) and healthy people as control will be recruited (50/group, total 300).
      Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,lumbar and hip bone mineral density, bone turnover
      biochemical markers including serum total propeptide of type I procollagen（PINP）, bone
      alkaline phosphatase（BALP）, bone Gla-protein (BGP) and β-CrOSSlaps（β-CTX）, serum calcium and
      phosphorus and related regulators including fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23),
      25-hydroxyl-Vitamin D （25-OH-VitD）, parathyroid hormone（PTH） will be detected. The
      relationship between kidney function and bone turnover, and the rules throughout the
      development process of renal osteodystrophy will be analysed.The micro
      ribonucleotide（miRNA）array will also be performed to screen the biomarkers of renal
      osteodystrophy in different stage.
