    
      This is a prospective study that enrolled 245 residents from 15 participating nursing homes
      with â‰¥2 risk factors for atrial fibrillation. All residents gave informed consent or had a
      legally appointed representative who could consent on their behalf. Exclusion criteria
      included residents with a prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, continuous rhythm
      monitoring over the past year, and pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator in
      situ.

      Screening was performed using the smartphone-based, mobile ECG recording device. Thirty
      second rhythm recordings were obtained on each resident on four different occasions within a
      month. All tracings were reviewed by a cardiologist and, in the case of any uncertainty, the
      diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was confirmed by an electrophysiologist. When atrial
      fibrillation was detected in a resident (primary endpoint), no further rhythm recordings were
      performed and the resident's nursing facility was then notified of the diagnosis. Further
      evaluation and treatment were directed by the resident's primary care physician.

      All data were stored on a secure encrypted server with password protection. The investigators
      used chi-square and t-test analyses to determine if there were significant differences in
      demographic variables or risk factors for atrial fibrillation between residents with and
      without atrial fibrillation. Logistic regression analysis determined if any combination of
      risk factors was predictive of a positive atrial fibrillation screen.
