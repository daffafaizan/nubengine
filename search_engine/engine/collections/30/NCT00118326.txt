    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized bone marrow from an
           HLA-identical pediatric sibling donor as a stem cell source for pediatric patients
           undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for malignant or non-malignant
           disease.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment, number of red blood cell and
           platelet transfusions, number of febrile days, and number of hospitalization days in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the number of nucleated cells and CD34-positive cells, absolute lymphocyte
           count, and lymphocyte subsets (CD3/CD4/CD8) in G-CSF-mobilized bone marrow from these
           donors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days -4 to 0. Donors then
      undergo standard bone marrow harvest on day 0.

      Patients receive pre-transplantation conditioning and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis
      according to the disease for which the patient is being treated and the treatment plan or
      clinical trial for which the patient is enrolled on. Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of bone marrow harvest, donors are followed at 7 and 30 days. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 100 days post-transplantation and
      then periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 participants (40 donors and 40 patients) will be accrued for
      this study within 18 months.
