      In order to reduce postoperative pain and improve mobilization the minimal invasive technique
      was developed. After a 8-10 cm skin incision, a medial parapatellar capsule incision in made.
      The rectus tendon or the vastus medialis are not incised and the patella is not everted.

      In recent years The Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) technique has been developed to reduce
      postoperative pain. With this LIA-technique, a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine), a
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are infiltrated
      intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if Minimal Invasive Surgery results in less
      postoperative pain and better mobilization than conventional technique in Unicompartmental
      Knee Arthroplasty, provided that both groups receive Local Infiltration Analgesia.
