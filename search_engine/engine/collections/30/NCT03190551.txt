      effectiveness, safety and feasibility of a retroclavicular brachial plexus block as compared
      with costoclavicular approach for infraclavicular brachial plexus block. 60 patients
      scheduled for elective upper limb surgery were recruited and randomized into two groups:
      Retroclavicular approach for infraclavicular block (Group I), costoclavicular approach for
      infraclavicular block (Group R). Sensory block, adverse effects and complications were
      evaluated and recorded every 5 minutes until 30 min after local anesthetic injection. Success
      rate of each nerve sensory block, complications, rate of satisfaction, rate of failure and
      incidence rate of adverse effects, the needle shaft visibility, procedure time,duration of
      the block's effect, use of supplemental local anesthetic, use of analgesic are compared with
      both groups.
