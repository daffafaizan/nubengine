    
      INTRODUCTION: Several grafts and/or implants have been used for dorsal augmentation. In some
      cases, especially the traumatic, non-caucasian, and multi-operated ones, the amount of
      augmentation is higher than the usually available from septal and auricular conchal
      autografts.

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of mastoid bone autograft for dorsal nasal
      augmentation in rhinoplasty.

      DESIGN: A prospective study of 15 consecutive patients submitted to dorsal nasal augmentation
      with mastoid bone, during a 2-year period.

      SETTING: One major academic medical center.
