    
      This is an open-label, single-arm study in patients with HER2-expressing recurrent, advanced
      or metastatic endometrial carcinoma. HER2-expression is defined as a 1+, 2+ or 3+ score on
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH). Eligible patients for
      this study should have progressed on or after first line platinum-based chemotherapy.
      Patients who have had two or more lines of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease are
      not eligible.

      Eligible patients will receive SYD985 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who have stopped study treatment for other reasons than disease progression will
      continue their tumor evaluations in an observation period until disease progression or start
      of a new anticancer therapy.
