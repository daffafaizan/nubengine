      chest CT scans for lung cancer screening in patients who meet specific criteria. However,
      many individuals who meet these criteria do not realize they qualify for screening. This
      study will determine the feasibility of using a clinical informatics approach to
      systematically identify potential candidates for LDCT screening, reach out to them via the
      patient portal, and use a web app to provide them with a personalized LDCT screening decision
      aid and facilitate the ordering of screening tests.
