      significant advantages in adverse listening conditions. In cochlear implant users, binaural
      hearing can be achieved via bilateral cochlear implant (CI/CI) or binaural-bimodal
      stimulation, i.e. a cochlear implant in one ear and a hearing aid in the other (CI/HA). It is
      assumed that CI/CI hearing and CI/HA hearing differ with respect to their physiological
      sources and functional benefit. Although both hearing prosthesis (CI/CI or CI/HA) lack
      several of the features needed to allow listeners to experience the full binaural advantage
      conferred by a normal-hearing auditory system it can, however, provide significant advantages
      over the use of a unilateral hearing prosthesis. Most of the accepted assessment clinical
      materials are not sensitive enough to evaluate the contribution of binaural hearing
      rehabilitation via CI/CI or CI/HA hearing for the perception of intonation. In a previous
      study the perception of intonation was evaluated in 29 adults CI/HA users via a closed-set
      format design with the same target talker. The results of the study showed small bimodal
      benefit. The test paradigm was apparently an easy task for the adult listeners and not
      sensitive enough to show the expected CI/HA bimodal benefit over cochlear implant alone.

      The perception of correct intonation identification will be computed for each listener in
      each of the listening conditions. The amount of change in the fundamental frequency that was
      required in order to identify a question will be computed for each listener in each of the
      conditions. ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to assess the differences among the
      conditions for each group as well as the differences among the groups.
