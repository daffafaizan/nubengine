      outcomes in children on long-term mechanical ventilation has not been previously evaluated.

      The investigators' objective is to assess the feasibility of individualized diet intervention
      in children dependent on long-term mechanical ventilator support using a multidisciplinary
      model. The investigators will optimize energy intake (based on indirect calorimetric
      measurement) and protein intake (based on recommended intake values) in this group. The
      subjects will be administered the modified diet for 12 weeks, and a comprehensive nutrition,
      metabolic and respiratory assessment will be performed before and after intervention, in the
      subjects' home. The investigators will examine the effect of individualized diet optimization
      on nutritional status, body composition, CO2 production (VCO2) and minute ventilation (MV).

      The investigators hypothesize that optimizing energy and protein intake would be associated
      with improved nutritional status, particularly increment in LBM, and decrease in VCO2 and MV.
      If nutritional optimization is associated with positive outcomes in our study cohort, this
      concept could be generalized to a wider patient population with respiratory insufficiency.
