      as the standard of care for cancer of the esophagus.However, locoregional failure remains
      problematic, with 25% of patients having persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease
      following the standard dose (50-50.4 Gy) chemoradiotherapy . Our previous phase I radiation
      dose escalation trial established the maximum tolerated dose of 86 Gy with concurrent weekly
      paclitaxel and cisplatin in advanced esophageal cancer.The aim of this phase II study is to
      examine the efficacy of this regimen.
