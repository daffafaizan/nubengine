    
      The G-CHF Registry is a prospective global cohort study of approximately 20,000-25,000 HF
      patients enrolled over approximately 5 years. Baseline data will be obtained on demographic
      and socioeconomic data, clinical and laboratory variables, co-morbidities, biomarkers,
      echocardiography, HF causes, medication use, management patterns, quality of life, and health
      systems. Six-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month follow-up data will be obtained to
      document patient outcomes and factors associated with outcomes.

      A sub-study of approximately 4000 patients (a subset of the main study population) will be
      performed to measure frailty, cognitive and lung function, mental health, medication
      adherence, patient-reported barriers to care, dietary assessment, and collection of blood and
      urine samples for central storage and analysis.
