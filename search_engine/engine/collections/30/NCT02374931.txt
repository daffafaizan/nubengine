      I. Establish the avidity of desmoid tumors on 18F-FES PET/CT imaging. II. Correlate 18F-FES
      PET avidity with degree of estrogen receptor (ER) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FES PET/CT imaging over 30 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
