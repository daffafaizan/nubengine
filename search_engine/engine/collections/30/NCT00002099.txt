      combination with intravenous lentinan or placebo (administered once weekly) for 26 weeks.
      Patients who are already stabilized on 400 mg/day ddI will proceed directly to randomization.
      Following completion of the combination therapy, patients may be offered 26 additional weeks
      of therapy on an optional basis.
