      have undergone successful PCI with at least one locally approved drug eluting stent
      discharged on DAPT with aspirin and ticagrelor of at least 3 months intended duration from
      centers still to be determined in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the impact of antiplatelet monotherapy with ticagrelor alone
      versus DAPT with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 12 months in reducing clinically relevant
      bleeding (efficacy) among high-risk patients undergoing PCI who have completed a 3-month
      course of aspirin plus ticagrelor. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the
      impact of antiplatelet monotherapy with ticagrelor alone versus DAPT with ticagrelor plus
      aspirin for 12 months in reducing major ischemic adverse events (safety) among high-risk
      patients undergoing PCI who have completed a 3-month course of aspirin plus ticagrelor.

      Exploratory objectives include assessing the comparative safety and efficacy of the different
      DAPT regimens for individual components of the primary efficacy and secondary safety
      objectives.

      The primary analysis for TWILIGHT will be performed independently by the London School of
      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
