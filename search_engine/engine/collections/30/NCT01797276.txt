      Congenital Lactic Acidosis (CLA) are eligible to continue treatment with investigational
      medication DCA at the same dose of 25mg/kg/day for expanded access. Study participants must
      travel to the study site for bi-annual evaluation by the study investigator. Bi-annual
      evaluation will include an interim medical history review, physical exam, blood collection
      for DCA trough level, and urine pregnancy testing (if indicated).
