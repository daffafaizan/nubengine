      pump and therefore decreases acidity, will reduce the iron's absorption in patients with CDA
      TYPE I and whether it will be possible to use it for a period instead of giving drugs which
      have much more adverse effects, for removal of iron excess from the body.

      Therefore, we would like to enroll 10-12 patients over 30 kg who can swallow tablets (age
      over 12) and whose ferritin levels are higher from the normal range, but still don't require
      medical treatment (ferritin levels between 400-700).

      These patients will be given LOSEC 20 mg X 1/day for 6 months. That group will be her own
      control group in the 6 months later. Drug will be dispensed to the patients.

      In the beginning of the study, after signing Informed Consent Form, blood tests will be taken
      for Complete Blood Count, iron levels, iron saturation, ferritin, complete chemistry panel,
      including calcium & magnesium.

      Same tests will be taken after 3 and 6 months and also 3 and 6 months after end of treatment.

      In every event of fever, headaches, abdominal pain or diarrhea, patients need to apply the
      doctor and report.
