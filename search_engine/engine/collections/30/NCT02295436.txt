      years) volunteers, which was conducted in four parts. In Part 1, minodronic acid tablets were
      administered to young volunteers at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg. In Part 2, after a single dose,
      young volunteers in the 1-mg dose group received repeated oral doses of minodronic acid once
      daily for 7 days. In Part 3, a single oral dose of minodronic acid 1 mg was administered to
      elderly volunteers. In part 4, after a washout period of 8 days, volunteers in the 4-mg dose
      group received a single dose of 4 mg minodronic acid under fed conditions (administrated 30
      minutes before high-fat breakfast). Plasma samples were collected and plasma concentrations
      of minodronic acid were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study
      by physical examinations, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, and monitoring of
      adverse effects.
