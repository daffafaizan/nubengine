      As with any translational research study, the procurement of human tissue samples can be a
      difficult and time- consuming process. The establishment of this biorepository will help
      streamline GI biospecimen collection and centralize these samples in a conveniently located
      space to facilitate the implementation of future unspecified translational studies.
