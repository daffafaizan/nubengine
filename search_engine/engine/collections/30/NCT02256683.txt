      (NOAC), has been shown to effectively prevent thromboembolic events in patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF). However, there is a paucity of data on the antithrombotic efficacy and
      safety of dabigatran in the resolution of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi in AF patients.

      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of the RE-LATED trial is to assess whether treatment with
      dabigatran results in a faster complete LAA thrombus resolution as compared to vitamin-K
      antagonist phenprocoumon. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of dabigatran on
      complete LAA thrombus resolution rate during treatment of 6 weeks, and change in LAA thrombus
      volume under treatment. Furthermore, this study aims to assess and compare safety and
      tolerability of dabigatran vs. phenprocoumon.

      METHODS The study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      controlled, explorative, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial. Patients with AF and left atrial
      appendage thrombus confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) will be randomized to
      receive either dabigatran (150 mg bid) or phenprocoumon (INR 2-3) for the resolution of LAA
      thrombus formation for at least 21 days. Thrombus resolution will be determined by TEE 3
      weeks after treatment initiation and subsequently at week 4 and 6, if the primary study
      endpoint (LAA thrombus resolution) has not yet been achieved. A total of 110 patients are
      planned to get randomized.

      CLINICAL CONTEXT This is the first controlled trial that investigates the safety and efficacy
      of a NOAC for the resolution of a LAA thrombus in patients with AF.
