      population. The intensity of the pain can be minor to very serious, which may prevent one
      from eating or performing ordinary oral hygiene practices. The most accepted mechanism by
      which DH occurs is hydrodynamic theory, which suggests that pain-producing stimuli cause
      rapid movement of fluid within the dentin tubules, as a result the free nerve endings, at the
      inner ends of the tubules or the periphery of the pulp, are excited and DH occurs. According
      to this theory, one approach to treat DH is reducing dentin tubule fluid movement through
      occluding open tubules. Strontium chloride was the first tubule-blocking ingredient used in
      dentifrice about fifty years ago and since that time a paucity of clinical studies have been
      carried out to test its effectiveness on DH. The other approach is to reduce the pulp nerve
      excitability by depolarizing the nerve endings, in which the most widely used material is
      potassium salts. Although there is limited clinical evidence that dentifrices containing
      strontium chloride or potassium nitrate alone, as the major desensitizing agent, has an
      effect on reducing DH, no clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of a dentifrice
      containing both strontium chloride and potassium nitrate in a silica base on alleviating DH.
