      cardiovascular and diabetes management among poor and minority patients. We propose to
      implement and evaluate an innovative, but practical intervention: CPR visits. CPR visits are
      designed to minimize competing demands for clinicians and reduce clinical inertia by focusing
      clinician and patient attention on optimizing cardiovascular and/or diabetes management and
      disease control and through use of clinician prompts and decision support at the point of
      care. Following training of clinician staff, CPR visits will be implemented within two sites
      of a single community health center (Westside Health Services, Inc). Patients will be
      randomly assigned one CPR visit with a clinician other than their primary care clinician or
      to usual care. The primary study outcome will include control of hypertension, diabetes, and
      lipids. Secondary outcomes will include process measures for cardiovascular and diabetes
      care. Both personnel and data collection infrastructure will build on the existing Health
      Disparities Collaborative at Westside. A research team from the University of Rochester will
      assist in the implementation of study design. This team will lead both the quantitative and
      qualitative evaluation of the project including outcome and process measures. Project
      findings offer promise for improving care to underserved populations through dissemination
      and implementation of a feasible strategy among practices caring for the underserved.
      Findings will be disseminated nationally in conjunction with the Robert Wood Johnson
      Foundation, the National Association of Community Health Centers, and the National Health
      Disparities Collaborative and through publication in the peer reviewed literature and
      presentation at national conferences.
