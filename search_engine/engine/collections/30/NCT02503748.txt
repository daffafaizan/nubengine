      are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer at an early stage are confronted
      with a difficult decision: they are faced with different treatment alternatives, each with
      its own advantages and disadvantages. That is why a comprehensive information delivery and
      processing is extremely important for patients to make an informed decision.

      Therefore, an online platform has been developed in collaboration with urologists and former
      patients. This online platform is designed to cover the individual information needs of
      patients with early prostate cancer. Additionally, the software aims at facilitating
      cooperation between patients and doctors and at increasing the satisfaction of patients with
      their treatment decision.

      In this study, the online platform will now to be tested in clinical practice, and data will
      be collected for the benefit of the platform: Can the online platform actually satisfy the
      indivudal information needs, facilitate the therapy decision and support the cooperation
      between doctors and patients?
