    
      Participant are randomly assigned in 3 home exercise groups.

        1. The traditional program: consists of solely strengthening the rotator cuff muscles and
           scapular muscles (e.g. external rotation)

        2. Separate kinetic chain program: same exercises as the first group but they also receive
           an exercise program to separately train the core and lower body. (e.g. external rotation
           separately and squat separately)

        3. Integrated kinetic chain program: same exercises as the first group but all exercises
           are performed while simultaneously activating the kinetic chain. (e.g. external rotation
           while squatting).
