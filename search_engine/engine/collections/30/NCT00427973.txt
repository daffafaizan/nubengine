      I. Assess the progression free survival of patients with locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treated with AZD2171.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. II. Determine, preliminarily, the
      efficacy of this drug, in terms of response rate, duration of response, and overall survival,
      in these patients.

      III. Determine the blood flow changes and vascular permeability of the tumor in patients
      treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI
      and CT perfusion scan of the liver are performed at baseline, 72 hours after the initial dose
      of AZD2171, and at the end of course 1. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies are
      collected periodically during study.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
