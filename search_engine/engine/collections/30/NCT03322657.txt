      anesthesia and surgery continues to be a common problem in the postanesthesia care (PACU).

      Neostigmine remains the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in the United States.
      However, administration of the drug significantly impairs genioglossus muscle activity when
      administered after full recovery from neuromuscular block. Moreover, doses of neostigmine
      exceeding 0.06 mg/kg increase the risk of respiratory complications independent of NMBAs
      effects.

      Sugammadex is a modified Î³-cyclodextrin that rapidly reverses that effect of the steroidal
      nondepolarizing NMBAs rocuronium and vecuronium. Sugammadex forms a stable, inactive 1:1
      complex with rocuronium or vecuronium, reducing the amount of free NMBA available to bind to
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Unlike neostigmine,
      sugammadex completely reverses even dense neuromuscular blocks.

      Patients having catheter-based neurointerventional procedures are kept deeply anesthetized.
      It is common to find patients nearly completely paralyzed at the end of neurointerventional
      procedures and have a markedly delayed emergence while waiting for muscle function to recover
      sufficiently to safely antagonize with neostigmine.
