      developed countries. In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP,
      fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of
      bactericidal activity. TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a
      selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor.

      This study will Evaluate the clinical efficacy, microbiological efficacy and safety of
      Intravenous Nemonoxacin compared with Intravenous Moxifloxacin in adult patients with
      community-acquired pneumonia.

      Besides, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after continuous
      IV Infusion and the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)are to be determined.
