      detailed below:

        -  Examine adverse events of all employees after vaccination using adverse events form

        -  Examine the immunogenicity of the vaccine by collecting blood samples at days 0, 21 & 42
           after vaccination (up to 500 people)

        -  Provide a detailed time course of the immune response to vaccination with a novel
           influenza H1N1 virus including the kinetics of the T-cell, B-cell and antibody responses
           in 50 volunteers

        -  Investigate the long lasting immunity induced by the vaccine

        -  Examine the ability of the vaccine to induce cross-reactive immunity to H1N1 strains.
