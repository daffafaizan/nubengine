      60-75% of patients with schizophrenia. Patients experiencing persistent AVH tend to be
      interrupted in their daily routines and have trouble keeping regular jobs due to the
      intrusiveness or abusive contents of voices. In addition, auditory hallucinations are
      reported to remain even after disappearance of other psychotic symptoms in many patients with
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders after treatment with typical antipsychotics.

      The study involves detailed phenomenological assessments of AVH and other psychotic symptoms,
      as well as side effects of atypical antipsychotics.
