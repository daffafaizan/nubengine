      acceptability and efficacy of the dietary plan over 24 weeks. Subjects will participate in a
      program similar to WW Freestyle and have access to study-specific weekly workshops and a
      suite of study-specific digital tools for tracking eating, activity, and weight. Within a WW
      program, participants are provided instructions on calculating points for the foods and
      beverages they eat and drink. This study will examine the impact of the modified WW food
      program on weight and fitness levels of adults with overweight and obesity.
