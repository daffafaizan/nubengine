      also measure the fluid in your arms using Bioimpedance Spectroscopy. These measurements are
      made by passing a harmless electrical signal of very low strength through your body to
      determine the difference in the amount of fluid in each arm. The test is simple and painless,
      and takes about 3 minutes. In addition, whenever you have an arm measurement, you will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire. While completing the questionnaire, you can skip any
      questions you do not wish to answer. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to
      complete. Arm measurements with the Perometer and Bioimpedance Spectroscopy and completion of
      the questionnaire will occur every 4-7 months when you are at MGH for regular medical visits.
