      and a CT scan. Other scans or tests will be done as needed. Women able to have children must
      have a negative urine pregnancy test. A blood sample will be taken for routine testing once a
      week during treatment and a month after treatment ends.

      Patients will also be asked to complete two questionnaires before they start treatment,
      before Courses 3 and 5, and at the end of treatment. These questionnaires will help
      researchers understand how this drug affects patients' daily lives and also identify the side
      effects caused by this treatment. Each questionnaire will take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Patients in this study will be given paclitaxel and carboplatin through a catheter (tube)
      placed in a vein. Paclitaxel is given first (over 3 hours) followed by carboplatin (over 1
      hour). All treatment is given in the outpatient department at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

      Patients may receive up to 6 courses of treatment. If the disease gets worse or intolerable
      side effects occur, patients will be taken off study.

      -Before each course of treatment, patients will have a checkup. At each checkup, patients
      will have a physical exam and blood tests. Another CT scan will be done after the third
      course of treatment. A complete physical exam and a CT scan will also be done at the end of
      treatment.

      This is an investigational study. Both of the study drugs are FDA approved. Their use
      together in this study is experimental. A total of 50 patients will take part in this
      multicenter study. About 35 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
