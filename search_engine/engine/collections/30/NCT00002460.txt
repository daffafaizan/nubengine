      administration of a course of adjuvant tamoxifen or ablation of ovarian function results in
      prolongation of time to recurrence or death in patients under 50 years of age with operable
      carcinoma of the breast. II. Determine how hormone manipulation affects mood and sexual
      functioning in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by clinician. All patients are
      randomized following primary therapy, which, in addition to surgery, may include local
      irradiation, perioperative cyclophosphamide, or up to 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide,
      methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for high-risk patients. Clinicians may elect to
      randomize patients to all groups or to only those groups including tamoxifen. The first group
      receives no further therapy. Then second group receives tamoxifen daily for at least 2 years.
      The third group receives ovarian ablation with goserelin via monthly injection for at least 2
      years. The final group receives ovarian ablation with goserelin plus daily tamoxifen for at
      least 2 years. All patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3
      years, then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 800 to 1,000 patients will be entered.
