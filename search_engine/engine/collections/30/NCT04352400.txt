    
      Purpose: SARS-Cov-2 enters the lung cells by binding to ACE-2 and activating the protease
      TMPRSS2, which, therefore, can be a target for antiviral treatment. Accordingly, TMPRSS2
      inhibitors prevent SARS-CoV cell entry in vitro. The most potent such inhibitors, nafamostat
      is being used as anticoagulant and anti-pancreatitis agent, and is approved for the treatment
      of cystic fibrosis as its mucolytic action can prevent lung function deterioration by owering
      airways infections.

      RACONA study will test the hypothesize that nafamostat is useful in COVID-19 lung involvement
      because COVID-19 entails activation of the coagulation cascade, pulmonary embolism, and
      bacterial superinfections.
