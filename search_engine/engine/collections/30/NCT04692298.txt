      one-third of a woman's life is spent in this state, it is imperative to identify effective,
      safe, and economical approaches that can minimize disease risk that is associated with this
      phase of life. Pulses are excellent source of fiber, protein, essential amino acids,
      vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, that can act as prebiotics and prevent gut dysbiosis
      and promote a healthy gut. A few studies in overweight or obese adults have shown the health
      benefits of pulses, including gut modulating potential. However, studies examining the use of
      pulse crops are limited, especially in alleviating health risks associated with menopause.
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the prebiotic potential of pulse-based diet and
      consequent effects on metabolic and bone biomarkers in postmenopausal women. We hypothesize
      that daily intake of pulses, due to its nutrient content and many other bioactive compounds
      including fiber content, will beneficially affect gut health and subsequently improve
      metabolic outcomes and bone markers in postmenopausal women. To accomplish our objectives, 40
      postmenopausal women (50- 65 y old and â‰¥ 1 y menopause) will be recruited and will be asked
      to consume 100 g/d of pulse (alternate between lentils, pinto beans, peas, chickpeas, and
      kidney beans) for 3 months. Pulse intake, anthropometric measures, markers of gut and bone
      health, and metabolic outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at the end of pulse
      consumption.
