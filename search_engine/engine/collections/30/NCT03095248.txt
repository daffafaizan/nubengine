      in children and young adults with NF2 who are treated with selumetinib. Dosing will be based
      on age: For patients with NF2 who are 3 to < 18 years of age, dosing will be based on BSA.
      Dosing is based on BSA calculated at the beginning of each course. For patients with NF2 who
      are â‰¥ 18 to 45 years of age, dosing will be the standard adult dose of 75 mg BID.

      Selumetinib is taken orally twice a day continuously. One course is equivalent to 28 days.
      Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 courses) in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      There will be two treatment strata. Stratum 1 is for those patients who have a target
      vestibular schwannoma which is causing hearing loss. Stratum 2 will be reserved for patients
      who exhibit growth of a tumor(s) besides vestibular schwannoma and are therefore not eligible
      for stratum 1.
