    
      Aim 1: To investigate the efficacy of pre-treatment with oral pseudoephedrine 60mg for
      decreasing MEB during HBOT.

      Hypothesis: Patients randomized to pseudoephedrine will have a lesser need for oxymetazoline
      rescue therapy while being compressed. They will also report less ear pain once at pressure
      compared to patients receiving placebo.

      Aim 2: To measure the incidence of MEB during HBOT. The investigators will also identify
      factors (age, gender, medical history) that could predispose an individual to developing MEB
      during HBOT.

      Hypothesis: The incidence of MEB defined as requiring stopping compression of the chamber and
      oxymetazoline rescue will be greater than 30%. Female sex, age above 60, and prior history of
      ear conditions will be associated with development of MEB.
