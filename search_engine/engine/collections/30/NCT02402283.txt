      metronidazole under fasting conditions. These products are: Metronidazole benzoate (400 mg
      metronidazole per sachet oral granules)/Terix Labs Ltd, Test product manufactured by ONE
      PHARMA, Greece and Flagylâ„¢ 400 mg Tablets (400 mg metronidazole per film coated
      tablet)/Zentiva, a Reference product manufactured by Famar Health Care Services, Spain. The
      bioequivalence of a single 400 mg dose of both products will be assessed by comparing the
      pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the plasma concentration-time profiles for
      metronidazole.
