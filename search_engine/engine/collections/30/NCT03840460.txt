      identify molecular subgroups from a multicentre series of patients who are investigated for
      and subsequently diagnosed with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or a precursor lesion or a
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.

      The secondary objective is to determine disease control rate (CR, PR and SD >24 weeks),
      duration of response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in locally
      advanced / metastatic patients or relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      early stage curative / pre-cursor lesion patients, associated with the identified molecular
      subtypes of PDAC pancreatic cancer and relevant anti-cancer therapies.

      To identify molecular predictors of response or toxicity to standard of care anti-cancer
      therapies in PDAC/PanNET. The study also has a number of exploratory objectives listed below:

      Depending on the number of patients assessable for each biomarker of interest and the
      prevalence of biomarker expression in the study population, exploratory endpoints of this
      study include:

        1. Evaluation of the predictive value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a
           biomarker to predict responsiveness or resistance to a specific anti-cancer treatment).

        2. Evaluation of the prognostic value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a
           biomarker to predict outcome regardless of a specific anti-cancer treatment).

        3. Comparison of biomarker expression among IPMN, MCN, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
           evaluation of their prognostic value.
