      visit will consist of a fasting chemistry panel, a health questionnaire, an Insomnia Severity
      Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Beck Depression
      Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Fatigue Severity Scale.

      Ten subjects passing screening will take for 2 weeks between dinner and bedtime in a blinded
      and balanced order: 1. Eight ounces of cherry juice standardized to its proanthocyanidin
      content in the morning and 8 ounces of cherry juice standardized to its procyanidin content
      1-2 hours before bedtime for 14 days; 2. A similar amount of placebo juice with the same
      timing for the cross-over. There will be a 2-week washout between each of the treatment
      periods. Subjects will be scheduled for two overnight PSGs, one at the end of each two-week
      treatment period. On the morning following each test the insomnia severity index and other
      questionnaires will be repeated. The order of the placebo juice and cherry juice will be
      random and balanced.
