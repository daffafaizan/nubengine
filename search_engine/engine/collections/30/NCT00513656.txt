    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy, parallel group study
      using oxycodone/naloxone and oxycodone to treat moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain.
      Subjects with documented history of cancer pain that requires around-the-clock opioid therapy
      will be included. Subjects must have a medical history of constipation that was induced by,
      or worsened by their opioid therapy.

      After subjects have qualified for the study they will be randomised and to enter the
      double-blind treatment phase of the study.

      Subjects will be randomised to receive either oxycodone/naloxone or oxycodone. Subjects will
      receive the double-blind medication for a period of 4 weeks.

      Subjects who complete the double-blind phase or who discontinue due to constipation and still
      comply with all relevant screening inclusion and exclusion criteria will have the option to
      enter the 24 week extension phase. Subjects will receive open-label oxycodone/naloxone for up
      to 24 weeks.
