      accepted definition of exacerbation in COPD; 4 definitions are widely used: (1) using a
      combination of 3 cardinal symptoms: increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence;
      (2) looking at the presence of the following patterns of symptoms during >=2 consecutive
      days: either 2 or more of 3 major symptoms (increase in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum
      purulence); or any 1 major symptom together with any 1 minor symptom (increase in nasal
      discharge, wheeze, sore throat, cough or fever); (3) a sustained worsening of the patient's
      condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in
      onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD; (4)
      a complex of respiratory events (i.e. cough, wheezing, dyspnoea or sputum production) lasting
      >=3 days.
