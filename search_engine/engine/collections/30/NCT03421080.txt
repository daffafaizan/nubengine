      current depression who also drink in a hazardous fashion (N=986) will be recruited for a
      study to 'help improve an online intervention for depression.' Participants will be assigned,
      by chance, to receive MoodGYM or to receive MoodGYM plus a brief Internet intervention for
      hazardous alcohol consumption - Check Your Drinking (CYD). Participants will be contacted 3-
      and 6-months after receiving the interventions to assess changes in drinking and depression
      status. It is predicted that participants receiving the CYD intervention in addition to
      MoodGYM will reduce their alcohol consumption to a greater extent than those who just
      received MoodGYM. Further predictions include the impact of receiving Check Your Drinking on
      improvements in depressive symptoms.
