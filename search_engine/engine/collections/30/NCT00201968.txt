      individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) is the broad number of secondary medical
      complications typically associated with their injury, such as bone loss, spasticity, urinary
      tract infections and pressure sores. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an
      intervention that applies short current pulses to muscles and causes them to contract. FES
      can be applied to individuals with SCI to help them restore functions such as walking and
      grasping by contracting groups of paralyzed muscles in an orchestrated manner. Pilot work
      conducted by our research group suggests that applying FES to augment functional improvement
      often reduces incidents of secondary complications such as spasticity, pressure sores, and
      swelling of the legs. Specifically, functional and meaningful walking tasks performed on a
      regular basis with the help of FES therapy have the potential to improve overall physical and
      psychological well being of persons with incomplete SCI. This study seeks to demonstrate that
      thrice-weekly FES training for 4 months can restore/improve walking function in chronic,
      incomplete SCI individuals and that this therapy will considerably reduce the occurrences of
      secondary complications due to SCI. This will subsequently promote opportunities for active
      social participation and enhance the quality of life for SCI consumers. Comparison: 32
      individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI will be randomized to either thrice-weekly FES
      therapy OR thrice-weekly aerobic and resistance training. The study will determine which
      therapy is superior for improving walking function and reducing secondary complications
      associated with SCI after 4 months of training, and after 2-month and 8-month follow-up
      periods.
