      cava-pulmonary anastomosis (either Glenn or Hemi-Fontan) cardiac surgical procedures who
      receive cefazolin as their surgical prophylactic antibiotic. Cefazolin concentrations will
      then be determined in both microdialysate and plasma samples and used to define the
      pharmacokinetics of cefazolin at the tissue level and compare that to plasma
      pharmacokinetics. In addition, the data gathered will be used to assess how cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB), deep hypothermic cardiac arrest (DHCA), and modified ultrafiltration (MUF)
      affect tissue penetration of the prophylactically administered cefazolin.

      The study involves the use of microdialysis (MD) and plasma sampling methods to determine the
      pharmacokinetic properties of cefazolin when used as a prophylactic antibiotic during the
      second palliation procedure (superior vena cava-pulmonary anastomosis) for infants with
      single ventricle physiology. This requires the use of microdialysis (MD) catheters inserted
      into the left deltoid muscle in eligible subjects after the induction of general anesthesia
      as well as collection of microdialysate and blood samples throughout the duration of the
      procedure. Cefazolin will be administered as standard of care. Cefazolin concentrations in
      the collected samples will be measured via a validated high-performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) and mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed.
