    
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of palifermin administered
      intravenously (IV) in weekly doses (minimum of 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in
      reducing the incidence of severe (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3 or 4) oral
      mucositis in subjects with locally advanced HNC receiving RT concurrent with CT (RT/CT) as
      adjuvant treatment for their disease (postoperative setting). This study will assess the
      safety and tolerability of palifermin at the dose of 120 Î¼g/kg IV administered weekly
      (minimum 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in this subject population. This study will
      also evaluate the effect of palifermin on the clinical sequelae of severe OM (eg, average
      subject-reported mouth and throat soreness [MTS] score), and on RT-induced xerostomia in this
      population, as well as the long-term effects of palifermin on disease outcome and survival in
      this population.
