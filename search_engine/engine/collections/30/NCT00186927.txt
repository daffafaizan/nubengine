      intranasal Sendai virus in children and toddlers.

      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the magnitude and duration of the immune
      response elicited by intranasal Sendai virus. Responses between seropositive and seronegative
      children will be compared.

      This study also tests the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination at the highest
      dose tolerated during primary immunization dose-escalation.
