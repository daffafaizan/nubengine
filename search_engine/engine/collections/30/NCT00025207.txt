      I. Determine the activity of gefitinib, in terms of failure-free survival, in patients with
      malignant mesothelioma.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the overall survival of patients
      treated with this drug. V. Determine whether overexpression of epidermal growth factor
      receptor and expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 can predict the effectiveness of this drug in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months.
