      dexmedetomidine for cataract surgery under topical anesthesia . In the
      dexmedetomidine-pregabalin group, the patients will be premedicated by pregabalin. In the
      placebo group (control group) the patients will be premedicated by placebo capsules. All
      patients will be sedated by dexmedetomidine. Sedation will be assessed as a primary outcome
      measurement where pain, vital signs, intraoperative and postoperative pain, total analgesic
      needs and side effects will be assessed as secondary outcome measurements.
