    
      This is a 4 weeks, Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled,
      parallel group study with 12 weeks of follow-up to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      recombinant human Nerve Growth Factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution versus vehicle, in patients
      with moderate to severe dry eye (DE).

      Test product is rhNGF 20 μg/ml; reference product is vehicle. Test and reference will be
      instilled in both eyes according to the following scheme:

      Group 1: one drop of rhNGF 20 μg/ml will be instilled in both eyes three times daily (every
      6-8 hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm).

      Group 2: one drop of rhNGF 20 μg/ml will be instilled in both eyes two times daily plus one
      drop (40 μL) of vehicle will be instilled in both eyes once daily (every 6-8 hours, e.g. 7:00
      am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm).

      NB: rhNGF will be instilled in the morning and in the evening while the vehicle will be
      instilled in the afternoon.

      Group 3: vehicle eye one drop will be instilled in both eyes three times daily (every 6-8
      hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 02:00 pm; 09:00 pm).

      Randomization 1:1:1 of 300 patients to rhNGF eye drops solution 20 μg/ml TID (100 patients)
      or rhNGF eye drops solution 20 μg/ml BID + vehicle eye drop SID (100 patients) or vehicle eye
      drops solution (100 patients) TID for 4 weeks.
