    
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disability in the U.S. The
      severity of a TBI may range from "mild" (i.e. a brief change in mental status or
      consciousness) to "severe" (i.e. an extended period of unconsciousness or memory loss after
      the injury). However, most TBI's that occur each year are mild and are commonly called
      concussions. Unfortunately, TBI terminology does not adequately describe the injury or
      impairment, its treatment, or the resulting outcomes. Due to the complexity of the human
      brain, each person's physiology can result in different patterns of impairment and secondary
      conditions, requiring different treatment or rehabilitation. The intent of EPIC ClearView™
      TBI Feasibility (EPIC-011) is to collect data to further develop the ClearView™ Response
      Scale to measure electrophysiology associated with TBI
