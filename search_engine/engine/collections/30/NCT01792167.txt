      physical fighting, homophobic name calling (victimization and perpetration), and sexual
      violence (victimization and perpetration). Given that students in the intervention received
      only one-year (15 lessons; 50 minutes/week) of the developmentally-sequenced three-year
      curriculum, it was hypothesized that the strongest intervention effect would be seen for
      overt physical aggression, followed by more subtle effects for bullying and peer
      victimization outcomes. Because students were not introduced to concepts of prejudice, bias,
      and sexual violence (referred to sexual harassment) until the 7th and 8th grade curriculum,
      it was hypothesized that no significant intervention effects would emerge for these
      constructs at this point in time.
