      reconstruction. If post-mastectomy radiation therapy is recommended, the reconstruction is
      often delayed until 6 - 12 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy due
      to risk of complication that might delay adjuvant treatment. At this time the native skin
      over the removed breast cannot be used in the reconstruction, resulting in a suboptimal
      aesthetic outcome. In the delayed-immediate reconstruction method, a skin sparing mastectomy
      and reconstruction with implant is performed at primary surgery, to save the native skin
      under radiation therapy, thereby improving the chance for a good aesthetic outcome at the
      final delayed reconstruction. In this trial breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy and
      loco-regional radiation therapy is randomized to either delayed reconstruction or
      delayed-immediate reconstruction. The complication rate as well as morbidity, aesthetic
      outcome and psychological well-being after delayed-immediate reconstruction will be compared
      with delayed reconstruction
