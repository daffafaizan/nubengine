      difficulty swallowing, is one of the most common issues in gastroenterology. In many
      patients, esophageal obstruction is not identified despite workup with upper endoscopy or
      barium swallow x-ray. Patients are often referred to the Motility Laboratory for evaluation
      of non-obstructive dysphagia. Transnasal esophageal manometry-impedance is a diagnostic test
      to measure the pressures and coordination of the esophagus during swallowing. The Endolumenal
      Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (EndoFLIP) is another instrument used to measure the lumen
      distensibility of the esophagus and pylorus. Both tests are FDA-approved and are currently
      being used in clinical practice. However, correlation of the results obtained from these
      tests with clinical syndromes and symptoms is not clearly understood. Furthermore, the
      relationship between esophageal impedance-manometry and EndoFLIP results has never been
      defined.

      The primary Aim is to develop a registry of patients undergoing esophageal
      manometry-impedance and Endoflip from the GI Motility Lab at the IU University Hospital
