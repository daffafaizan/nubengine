    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to stage of avascular necrosis (I vs II vs III). Patients are randomized into one of two
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo a core biopsy and decompression of the hip followed by a standardized
      program of touch down or nonweight bearing with appropriate equipment and regular physical
      therapy for 6 weeks and then full weight bearing if tolerated.

      Arm II: Patients undergo the standardized ambulation and physical therapy program as in arm
      I. They do not undergo any surgical procedure.

      For 1 week prior to the beginning of the standardized program and during the 6 weeks of touch
      down or nonweight bearing, all patients complete a weekly pain and medication diary.

      Patients are followed at 3 months and 6 months, then every 6 months for 1.5 years, and then
      annually for up to 5 years.
