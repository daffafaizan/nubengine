      hands and may develop musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome and
      hand-arm vibration syndrome. Protective braces may be worn to decrease the incidence of
      occupational MSDs. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has identified
      key attributes for protective braces; these attributes include vibration damping, comfort,
      non-interference with worker dexterity, and maintenance of safe hand temperature. Most
      currently available braces do not adequately address these NIOSH requirements. This study
      will evaluate the efficacy of a brace with piezoelectric damping material.

      Participants in the study will be fitted with a brace on each hand. One brace will have
      piezoelectric damping material and the other will be a currently available, off-the-shelf
      commercial brace. Hand-held joysticks and handles mounted to a vibration shaker table will be
      used to simulate power tool use. Participants will undergo a series of tests designed to
      measure hand acceleration and vibration while grasping the study joysticks and handles. The
      tests will take approximately 30 minutes.
