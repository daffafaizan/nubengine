      more than 100, 0000 registered drug addicts mostly are heroin dependence. Drug dependence
      post great risks to physical condition, their family and society, and can lead to infectious
      disease transmission. Though almost 500 MMT clinics which can offer MMT service to heroin
      addicts have been set up, there are still some problems, for example, poor compliance, high
      rate of dropping out and relapse which affect the service delivery to them. The guideline
      developed by WHO focused on psychotherapy to opiate addicts with MMT. So delivery of a set of
      comprehensive, integrated psychotherapy to opiate addicts is very critical in such methadone
      clinics.
