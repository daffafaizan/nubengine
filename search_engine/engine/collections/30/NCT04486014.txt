      the palms, which is often accompanied by the head, face, or plantar hyperhidrosis. PPH
      demonstrates no obvious organic cause; however, some patients may feel distressed because
      their palms sweat more than normal, and such a situation may lead to severe psychological,
      social, and occupational dysfunction.

      Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy abolishes eccrine sweating in all areas supplied by the
      postganglionic fibers with its complications which include post-sympathetic neuralgia which
      is the most important, wound infection, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, horner syndrome, no
      response to the operation and compensatory hyperhidrosis in non-denervated areas.

      Forero described ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block for treatment of thoracic
      neuropathic pain and explained it as a peri-paravertebral regional anesthesia technique that
      has been used for prevention of postoperative pain in various surgeries.

      Ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block is a facial plane block which provides
      analgesia by blocking of lateral branches of intercostal nerves above or below the serratus
      plane muscle. There are few cases and studies in the literature reporting successful
      analgesia provided by serratus anterior plane block
