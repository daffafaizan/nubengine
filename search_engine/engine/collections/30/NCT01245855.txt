      that some myocardial injury was often associated with the procedure, and even asymptomatic
      minor post-procedural myocardial necrosis does have an important prognostic signification.
      The possible mechanisms of periprocedural myocardial injury were often attributed to distal
      embolisation of atheromatous material during the procedure, occlusion of minute side
      branches, occlusive dissection or no-reflow.

      Prostaglandin E1 incorporated in lipid microspheres (lipo-PGE1) is a new galenic form of
      PGE1, with PGE1 incorporated into soybean oil microspheres 0.2 micron in diameter, using
      lecithin as surfactant. This drug preparation can protect PGE1 against inactivation in the
      lung and has targeting effect to tissues injured by arterial occlusion. It was shown in the
      experiments that, by the pharmacological effects such as improving endothelial function,
      dilating coronary and systemic microvessels, inhibiting platelet aggregation and reducing
      ischemia-reperfusion injury, lipo-PGE1 had a more marked protective effect in arterial
      occlusive tissue injury and a more potent platelet aggregation inhibitory effect than free
      PGE1. Clinical studies have demonstrated that lipo-PGE1 is a very valuable agent for the
      treatment of peripheral vascular disorders and diabetic neuropathy.
