      dexamethasone given perineurally as an adjuvant to the nerve block will prolong the time to
      recovery from sensory nerve block from a saphenous (or adductor canal) nerve block. The
      primary outcome will be time to resolution of the nerve block as assessed by pinprick over
      the saphenous nerve distribution. If this primary end point is met, this study will also
      serve as an equivalency dosing study comparing 1 mg of perineural dexamethasone to 4 mg of
      perineural dexamethasone.
