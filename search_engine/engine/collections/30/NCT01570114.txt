    
      It is a national multicentric retrospective study on the use of fully covered metal stent
      placement in patients with benign colorectal strictures.

      Consecutive patients above 18 years of age with a symptomatic benign colonic stricture
      despite optimal medical and/or endoscopic dilation therapy and which required the use of a
      FCSEMS were included. All strictures were confirmed to be benign by histology. All details
      concerning previous history, origins and treatment (medical or endoscopic) of the colonic
      stenosis were collected from the medical file.

      Senior endoscopists with an experience of more than 50 colonic stent placements performed the
      procedure under general propofol-induced anesthesia with the same technic (The stent was
      placed under fluoroscopic and videoendoscopic controls).

      Patients were required after the procedure to take oral osmotic laxatives regularly.
      Post-stenting complications were defined as immediate (during the procedure), early
      (occurring â‰¤ 30 days) and late (> 30 days) after the procedure. Stent removal and routine
      follow up endoscopy were scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after placement in most patients or earlier
      if complications occurred.

      All patients were followed up at regular intervals based on their clinical situation. A
      retrospective chart review was performed to analyze the long-term outcome of the patients.
