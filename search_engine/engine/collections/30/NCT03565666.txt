      pivotal studies using the insulin-only configuration of the bionic pancreas.

      The Adult RCT Period will consist of a multi-center, three-period, random-order, cross-over,
      feasibility study in 36 adult participants ≥ 18 years old with T1D. Insulin therapy for each
      participant will be administered (i) using the iLet in the insulin-only configuration and the
      insulin analog that they use for their usual care (either Humalog or Novolog) for 7 days,
      (ii) in another period using the iLet in the insulin-only configuration with faster insulin
      aspart (Fiasp) for 7 days (iii) in a third period using the participant's own usual care (UC)
      for 7 days. All three experimental periods will be followed by round-the-clock, remote,
      telemetric monitoring for hyperglycemia (> 300 mg/dl for ≥ 90 minutes) and hypoglycemia (< 50
      mg/dl for ≥ 15 minutes). Half the subjects enrolled were expected to manage their diabetes
      with MDI and the other half with insulin pumps in their UC. An implantable Eversense CGM will
      also be placed in half the study participants for a CGM comparison.
