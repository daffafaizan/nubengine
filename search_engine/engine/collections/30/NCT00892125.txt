    
      The current study is designed as an open-label, multiple-center, multiple-dose, 2 treatment,
      2 period sequential drug interaction study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase
      beginning within 21 days before the first study drug administration; an open label treatment
      phase consisting of 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will
      receive multiple oral doses of 6-mg paliperidone ER alone or in combination with multiple
      oral doses of carbamazepine, and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study
      procedures in Period 2 or at early withdrawal. There is no washout period between treatment
      periods. Given the potential concomitant use of carbamazepine with antipsychotics, such as
      paliperidone ER, in the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, this study is
      designed to investigate the effect of carbamazepine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of
      paliperidone ER. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.. Period 1: 6
      mg paliperidone ER once daily from Day 1 through Day 7, route oral; Period 2: 6 mg
      paliperidone ER once daily and carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily from Day 8 through Day 28,
      route oral.
