    
      SQUELCH-C is an investigator-initiated, single arm, non-blinded pilot study on the use of
      eltrombopag in combination with ribavirin, pegylated-interferon, and boceprevir, for patients
      who would not otherwise be treatment candidates because of low platelet counts (less than
      75x10^9/L).

      Administration of the drugs ribavirin and boceprevir will be standard of care, with one
      exception for interferon.

      The total drug treatment period for the study patient will range from 32 - 56 weeks,
      depending on liver disease stage and viral response. Follow-up will take place at 12 and 24
      weeks post treatment to evaluate for sustained viral response. Total study participation may
      require 1.5 years.
