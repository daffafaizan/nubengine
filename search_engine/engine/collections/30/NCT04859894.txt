      Covid-19 infection (Post-COVID-19 Syndrome) are poorly understood and evaluated. For example,
      the extent to which subjective symptoms correlate with physiological impairments are not
      known.

      This study will recruit subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Post-Covid-19-syndrome) who are
      scheduled for either of lung function testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing or cardiac
      ultrasound. Patients' symptoms will be correlated to physiological measures and compared to
      predicted values.

      In addition, in 20 patients, symptoms and physiological measures will be correlated to
      epigenetical alterations, or DNA-methylation patterns. In addition, a subset of patients will
      be examined a year after the baseline testing in order to follow the progress of the disease.
