      of these illnesses occur as a result of endemic exposure in Arizona and California. The
      benefits of antifungal therapy for uncomplicated disease are not currently established.
      Current therapies for serious and complicated forms of coccidioidomycosis are only partially
      effective and in themselves are unable to eradicate the fungus from sites of infection,
      commonly resulting in breakthrough infection and/or relapse. Nikkomycin Z is effective in the
      mouse model and results in improved microbiological response over fluconazole.

      The goals of this study include: 1) Evaluating the safety and tolerance of nikkomycin Z
      following administration of multiple doses (50 mg Q 12 h to 750 mg Q 8 h) for two week and 2)
      Evaluating the pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z after single and multiple doses in
      relationship to dose. The study will include patients with uncomplicated Coccidioides
      pneumonia (mild illness) which will allow exploratory analysis of efficacy and dose response
      based on biomarkers.
