      Currently, standard management of acute pain after surgery consists mainly of systemic opioid
      narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Generally, opiates and NSAIDs
      are not completely effective at managing pain, and they carry significant risk of addiction
      and overdose, particularly with prolonged or increased dosing. The concept of multimodal or
      ''balanced'' analgesia is rapidly becoming the 'standard of care' for preventing
      post-operative pain. It consists of the use of combinations of analgesics of different
      classes with different sites of action in an attempt to provide superior pain relief with
      reduced analgesic related side effects. Local anesthetic injection to block specific nerves
      has been widely recognized as a useful adjunct in a multimodal approach to postoperative pain
      management.

      Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block is a recently described plane block designed to block the
      dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. It has shown to be an effective
      modality for postoperative pain management as a part of multimodal analgesia in spinal
      surgery.
