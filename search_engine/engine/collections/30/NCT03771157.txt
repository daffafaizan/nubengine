    
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) are known risk
      factors for zoster reactivation, commonly called shingles. Although a recently FDA-approved
      recombinant, adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is currently being offered to these
      populations, no study has specifically evaluated them.

      The purpose of the study is to complete a single-arm trial evaluating if patients with CLL or
      WM, while on treatment with first-line BTK inhibitors, can achieve immunologic response to
      Shingrix. If effective, this will result in a new, well-tolerated shingles prevention
      strategy for these patients.

      The primary objective is to assess the capability to mount a humoral immune response to
      Shingrix in patients with CLL or WM under first-line BTK inhibitors.
