      extracted, and a blood sample is taken for DNA. The DNA samples are tested for variation both
      at the CFTR gene (the CF gene) and over the entire rest of the genome. Using large numbers of
      people with CF, and knowing who does and does not have CFRD, we identify genetic variations
      that associate with CFRD. Knowing these variations allows us to better understand the causes
      of CFRD, and with enough information, better to predict CFRD and identify people at
      particularly high or low risk of CFRD. People participating in this study also have the
      option to participate in related studies of other metabolic traits in CF such as over- and
      underweight.
