      quality is believed to have effects on initial implant stability and success of
      osseointegration. Different implant designs and surgical protocols were developed for
      improving the survival rate in different bone quality. Although bone quality can be partly
      diagnosed by radiographic images, lots of experienced surgeons also evaluate bone quality
      with tactile sensation when they drill the bone. However, variations in evaluation of bone
      density maybe exist among different surgeons. The drilling speed also may have effect on the
      outcome of evaluation. For less experienced dentists, it is difficult to diagnose bone
      quality with tactile sensation in the beginning. The purpose of this study is to find proper
      drilling speed to classify bone quality by tactile sensation on a saw bone model. Saw bones
      of variant densities are used as training & testing materials. The proper drilling speed to
      distinguish different bone quality will be evaluated and offered to junior dentists for
      better implant treatment outcome.
