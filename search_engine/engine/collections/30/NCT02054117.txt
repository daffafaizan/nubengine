      stroke, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Brain injury from
      intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in two phases. The early phase involves the mechanical
      compression of brain tissue by the expanding hematoma. In a later phase, brain edema,
      especially perihematomal edema, develops causing further compression that may lead to brain
      herniation and death. Several factors are implicated in the development of brain edema,
      including inflammation resulting from the oxidative stress caused by iron-rich hemoglobin
      released from lysed erythrocytes in brain tissue. This study investigates the neuroprotective
      role of an acute phase reactant, haptoglobin, in minimizing the development of perihematomal
      edema following intracerebral hemorrhage. This protein protects brain tissue from hemoglobin
      degradation products by forming haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes that are subsequently
      cleared by the spleen. Notably, different alleles of haptoglobin exist in humans, with
      varying affinities for hemoglobin. Investigating the association between the different
      alleles and the degree of perihematomal edema formation is the primary goal of this study.
      The investigators will also look at a marker of inflammation, matrix metalloproteinases, and
      analyze its level of expression in subjects with different alleles of haptoglobin.
