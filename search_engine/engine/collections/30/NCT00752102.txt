      calcitriol significantly increased the serum calcium-phosphate product and aortic calcium
      content, while paricalcitol had no effect. The objective of this randomized, blinded
      single-center is to determine the differential effect of oral calcitriol and paracalcitol on
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      We performed a total of 89 screening visits and randomized 44 participants. Forty
      participants completed the final visit. Diagram 1 presents the recruitment schematic.
