      subjects chosen for the study will have biopsy proven breast cancer and are eligible for
      chemotherapy. They will undergo bilateral breast MRI for staging which is considered standard
      of care. Breast MRI and PEM scans will be performed at at baseline (phase 0 or pre-operative
      phase), 2nd MRI and PEM after 1 to 2 weeks of NAC (phase 1) and 3rd MRI and PEM after 1 to 2
      weeks of phase 1 (phase 2). DCE-MRI and PEM will be performed not more than 14 days apart
      within each phase. Cranio-Caudal (CC) and Medial Lateral Oblique (MLO) PEM views will be
      performed of both the ipsilateral and contralateral breast and axillae by a Mammography
      Technologist trained in mammographic positioning.
