      patients and families. This questionnaire will also be available electronically through an
      educational website. Data collected will include photographs of skin lesions, video images of
      gastrointestinal lesions, demographic data, clinical information, therapeutic interventions,
      glass slides of tissue biopsies, and collection of DNA. Enrollment will be patient family
      driven and modeled after several successful registries of rare diseases.
