      span has improved in HLHS/single ventricle variants (SVV) survivors, focus has shifted to the
      understanding and management of associated health problems. Growth failure is a
      well-recognized major co-morbidity in these patients.

      Infants with HLHS/SVV demonstrate progressive growth failure after stage 1 procedures, which
      appears to stabilize only after stage 2 procedures. Poor nutritional status increases risk
      for post-operative infections, extends hospital length-of-stay, and adversely affects
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.

      To date, evidence-based feeding strategies that support adequate weight gain and improve
      nutritional status have not been identified after stage 1 procedures. Continuous enteral
      feeding regimens have resulted in improved growth in a diverse population of infants with
      congenital heart disease and have been shown to decrease energy expenditure in premature
      infants and adults. A randomized, controlled study of HLHS/SVV infants who underwent stage 1
      procedures at a single medical center was conducted with the primary objective of comparing
      weight gain at hospital discharge between infants receiving a continuous feeding regimen
      versus an intermittent feeding regimen. Secondary objectives were to compare growth and
      markers of nutritional status at hospital discharge between the two groups. The investigators
      hypothesized that infants with HLHS/SVV who receive a continuous enteral feeding regimen
      versus an intermittent feeding regimen will demonstrate improved weight gain, growth, and
      nutritional status after stage 1 procedures at hospital discharge.
