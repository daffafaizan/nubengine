      cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke has balance disorders. Over the last few years the
      assessment of balance has taken on special importance, carrying out the development,
      adaptation and validation of various tools that assess it.

      The Brief-BESTest has 6 items, it has demonstrated comparable reliability to the Mini-BESTest
      and potentially superior sensitivity. This version represents all dimensions based on the
      original BESTest theory.

      The purpose is to adapt and validate the Spanish version of the Brief-BESTest in stroke
      patients in order to have a brief tool, appropriate to the clinical environment and to the
      characteristics and limitations of these patients.
