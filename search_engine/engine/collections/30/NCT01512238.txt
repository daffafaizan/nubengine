        1. Association between medicine adherence and number of generic substitution

        2. Association between medicine adherence and use of non-prescription drugs, herbal
           medicine and dietary supplements and interaction between 'prescription drugs' and
           'non-prescription drugs, herbal medicine and dietary supplements'

        3. Intentional and unintentional non-adherence

      Some of the data in the present study were originally collected as part of a major research
      project 'Methods for Improving Compliance with Medicine Intake' (MICMI). The study sample of
      945 persons was randomly selected into three groups: two intervention groups and one control
      group. Interventions were pharmaceutical care and an electronic reminder system. All groups
      were followed for one year.

      Data in the present study is from the pharmaceutical care group and the control group, and is
      descriptive.
