      migraine population. It is often associated with medication overuse that makes this condition
      very difficult to treat. The literature of the last decades confirm the efficacy of
      withdrawal for patients with medication overuse. Also, patients need to be carefully followed
      after withdrawal to avoid relapses in overuse and to improve the clinical benefit. It has
      been also reported that the clinical results can be improved if traditional therapies are
      combined with behavioral approaches in particular mindfulness, that help patients to become
      more conscious about their symptoms and able to manage pain without medication.

      This preliminary study will be performed because the emergency for Covid-19 with the
      restrictions imposed will not allow patients. The literature of the last decades promote the
      use of smart phone or telemedicine for clinical and therapeutic application with encouraging
      results. Twenty five patients that have been submitted to a withdrawal according to the
      standard procedure at our hospital will practice mindfulness daily by a standard session of
      12 minutes on their smartphone recorded by the expert who generally manage their sessions at
      the hospital. Also a weekly video-call to evaluate the clinical condition and to encourage to
      use strategies for pain management will be scheduled.

      This modality will allow the patients to continue their therapeutic process and to be
      followed regularly during the one year after withdrawal
