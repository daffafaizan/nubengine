      because anticoagulation provides a 66% risk reduction in recurrent stroke. However,
      opportunities to prevent stroke due to AF are frequently missed because AF is paroxysmal and
      therefore not detected at the time of stroke. In addition, even when AF is identified
      anticoagulation may not be initiated due to perceived contraindications.

      This study will (1) evaluate whether a gene marker can improve the identification of AF in
      patients with ischemic stroke, and (2) evaluate decisions by health care provider and
      patients to anticoagulate AF, and whether this decision could be improved by a marker of AF
      at time of stroke. An AF Gene Score will be developed comprised of genes associated with
      inflammatory and thrombotic pathways related to risk of AF thromboembolism in stroke patients
      with AF. The AF Gene Score measured at time of stroke can stroke will permits rapid
      identification of stroke due to AF which may increase initiation of anticoagulation therapy.
      This is important in cryptogenic stroke, where prolonged monitoring leaves uncertainty
      regarding the association of delayed AF with initial stroke and delays anticoagulation.
