    
      Basal period

      Patients will be managed based on the most current acute pancreatitis clinical guidelines and
      the requirements will be:

        -  Complete medical history including: sex, age, history of chronic degenerative diseases,
           pulmonary and/or cardiac diseases, alcohol consumption, onset of abdominal pain, body
           mass index.

        -  Laboratory tests: blood count, biochemical profile, amylase and serum lipase, complete
           serum electrolytes, lipid profile, arterial blood gases.

        -  Image studies:

             -  Ultrasound of the upper abdomen to rule out biliary etiology

             -  Computed tomography of simple abdomen in case of diagnostic doubt

             -  Chest radiography

        -  Pulse oximetry with Finger Pulse Oximeter Brand: Carejoy Model G11002

        -  Severity of acute pancreatitis as follows:

             -  Severity will be established based on the revised Atlanta 2012 Criteria.

             -  The modified Marshall system will be evaluated to determine organic failure, which
                is defined as: â‰¥ 2 points in any of the 3 organic systems evaluated (renal,
                cardiovascular and pulmonary).

             -  Variables will be obtained to determine systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

      Intervention Arterial blood gases will be taken to calculate the PF ratio at admission and
      every 24 hours, until the resolution of pancreatitis and/or the first 5 days of admission.

      Pulse oximetry will be performed at the same time as arterial blood gases, to calculate the
      SP ratio at admission and every 24 hours, until resolution of pancreatitis and/or the first 5
      days of hospitalization.

      Treatment The management of pancreatitis upon admission will be based on the established
      clinical guidelines: Hartman IV solution at 20 mL/kg and subsequently infusion at 3 mL/kg/h
      for the first 24 hours.

      Follow up

      According to the state of severity of acute pancreatitis, the following groups will be
      formed:

        -  Mild: Without multiple organic failure or ARDS

        -  Moderately severe or ARDS <48 hours

        -  Severe or ARDS> 48 hours

      To assess respiratory dysfunction, 2 groups will be formed:

        -  No respiratory dysfunction: PF> 300

        -  Respiratory dysfunction: PF <300
