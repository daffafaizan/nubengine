      when they get infected with this virus. After developing chronic hepatitis B these patients
      are more likely to get livercirrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Bodsworth et al.).

      Hepatitis B vaccination is available and the vaccine is about 95% protective in preventing
      immunocompetent persons from developing chronic hepatitis B infection (Lemon). The response
      on this vaccin is less effective in HIV-infected persons (Carne et al.). Furthermore there is
      a compliance problem in the standard scheme.

      In this study we compare the efficacy of two different HBV vaccination schedules in
      HIV-infected persons concerning immune response and compliance. A short schedule: t=0,1,3
      weeks, in which there are good results concerning immune response and compliance in
      immunocompetent persons (Saltog et al.) and the standard schedule: t=0,1,6 months. Patients
      not immune at week 28 will be offered boostervaccination. This consists of double doses at
      t=0,1,2 months.

      800 persons are needed to show non-inferiority with lower margin of 10% of the short schedule
      in comparison with the control group. Powercalculation is 80%. Randomization is stratified
      according to CD4 count(CD4 <200, 200-500, >500).

      The hypothesis of the study is a better compliance and a comparable immune response in the
      short schedule, through which persons will be protected against hepatitis B in an early
      stage.
