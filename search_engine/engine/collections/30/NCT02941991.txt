    
      This study is a long-term, follow- up of a Phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, 4-cohort,
      dose escalation, multi-center clinical trial (referred to as the core trial or core protocol)
      in which a maximum of 12 SMD patients were transplanted with sequential doses of hESC-RPE
      cells, starting at a dose of 50,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted and increasing to a maximum
      dose of 200,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted. All patients who participate in the core
      protocol are eligible for participation in the follow-up protocol. The first visit of this
      extension protocol will correspond to the last visit of the core protocol, and will take
      place at 12 months post-cell implantation. Informed consent for this follow-up protocol will
      be obtained at the first visit which will occur at the 12-month visit of the core protocol.
      Patients will be evaluated at 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-transplant (or more
      frequently as clinically indicated). Follow-up will include obtaining information about
      ophthalmological findings and events of special interest as defined in the Primary Outcome.
      At the last visit of this follow up study, whether at 60 months post-transplant or at early
      discontinuation, patients will be invited to participate in a life-long annual health survey,
      under a separate protocol, to further monitor long-term safety.
