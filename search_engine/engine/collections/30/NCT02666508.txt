      the trial was posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. We screened all potentially eligible subjects
      from the Medical District of the University of Illinois which includes the Colleges of
      Dentistry, Medicine, Public Health and Pharmacy.

      All willing and eligible subjects signed informed consent forms and were instructed to
      refrain from brushing or flossing teeth, using any oral hygiene aids (such as mouthwash or
      chewing gum) the evening prior to and the morning of the data collection appointment. All
      subjects were be asked to complete the following procedures:

        1. Rinse for 10 seconds with 25 mL of phosphate buffer

        2. Rinse for 1 minute with 5.0 mL of 1240-ppm fluorescein in phosphate buffer

        3. Rinse 3 times (for 10 seconds) with 25mL of phosphate buffer

        4. Be positioned on a tripod chin rest 15 inches in front of the camera, retraction placed
           and intraoral images captured under UV LED light imaging.

        5. Provide a blood sample for hs-CRP.

        6. Use a 30 day supply of their assigned toothpaste and were instructed to follow the same
           brushing protocol for the entire month as well as a brushing diary to assist in
           recording daily participation.

      The identical procedures were repeated at the 30 day follow up visit.. In addition, the
      Plaque HD group was instructed to brush in front of a mirror for 1 minute and to concentrate
      on removing all visible dye. The placebo group was asked to brush their teeth for 1 minute in
      front of a mirror, using the provided manual toothbrush.
