      in protein, high in fiber, low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol. Their functional
      properties and nutrient content make them ideal to use as an ingredient for meat
      alternatives. Fermotein™ is such a mycoprotein type novel food source. The digestion
      characteristics of Fermotein™ are not known, but essential to evaluate their future potential
      as a sustainable protein source. Also, information on the degree of digestibility would
      strengthen a novel food dossier that is being constructed for this product.

      The primary objective is to assess the degree of digestibility of 3 different Fermotein™
      products and compare this to a reference commercially available Mycoprotein (Quorn).
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects on blood glucose and insulin levels.

      The study has a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled design. Four different
      treatments, all representing a 20g protein load, will be evaluated with a washout period of
      minimum one week between the test days. On test days, research subjects will receive a
      product e.g. Fermotein™ dry, Fermotein™ wet, modified Fermotein™ wet and a reference
      Mycoprotein (Quorn), in the form of a porridge, in randomized order. Blood will be collected
      via a catheter before and up-to five hours after protein consumption. Wellbeing, health
      complaints or other adverse effects will be collected via short questionnaires during each
      test day. After each test day gastrointestinal complaints are collected via an online
      questionnaire.
