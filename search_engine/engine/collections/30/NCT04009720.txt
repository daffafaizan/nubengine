    
      The RESPOND EDGE study is a prospective, open label, single arm, multi-center, observational
      post market study designed to collect real world clinical and device performance outcomes
      data of the commercially available Lotus Edge Valve used in routine clinical practice for the
      treatment of severe calcific aortic stenosis. Approximately 200 real-world, consecutive
      subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 study centers. The study duration for each subject is
      expected to be approximately 2 years. Implanted subjects will be contacted for follow-up at
      30 days, 1 and 2 years post index procedure. Subjects who are enrolled but not implanted with
      a Lotus Edge valve will be followed for safety through 30 days after the initial attempted
      index procedure.

      Collection of safety events will include any serious adverse event (SAE), serious adverse
      device effect (SADE), adverse device effect (ADE), unanticipated serious adverse device
      effect (USADE), and all Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) events regardless of
      seriousness and device relationship through 2 year follow-up.
