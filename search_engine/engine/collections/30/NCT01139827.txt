      glucose tolerance groups). Vascular 18F-FDG uptake was measured as both the mean and maximum
      blood-normalized standardized uptake value (SUV), known as the target-to-background ratio
      (TBR). And We analyzed that the association with Framingham risk score, hs CRP and vascular
      inflammation by FDG-PET scan.
