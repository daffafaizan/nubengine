    
      AIM 1: PHASE 1: Use Multiphasic Optimization Strategy (i.e., MOST), a highly efficient
      experimental strategy, to determine specific components for inclusion in an intervention to
      1a) improve primary clinical outcomes of A1C and percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia
      and 1b) address secondary clinical outcomes by improving adherence and biological markers of
      complications in high-risk pediatric patients with T1D (A1C=9-12%) as part of 12-month
      personalized behavioral intervention delivered via in-person T1D clinic visits and home
      telemedicine.

      MOST methodology uses factorial designs and the hypotheses in Aim 1 will be tested through a
      2x2 factorial experiment, a highly efficient experimental design despite several common
      misconceptions about sample size requirements and power. A 2x2 factorial experiment is NOT a
      4-arm trial in which each condition is compared in turn to a control condition. In fact,
      factorial designs do not require a larger number of participants than other designs (e.g.,
      Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)) and when used to address suitable research questions,
      they require fewer participants than other designs. Adding factors does not require a
      dramatic increase in sample size to maintain power.

      H1: There will be a main effect of Personalized Adherence Intervention on percentage of A1C,
      time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence behaviors, and biological markers of complications.

      H2: There will be a main effect of Personalized Behavioral Health Intervention on percentage
      of A1C, time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence behaviors, and biological markers of
      complications.

      AIM 2: PHASE 2: Determine effectiveness of the intervention components on maintenance of A1C,
      percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence, and biological markers improvements
      throughout 6-month follow-up.

      H1: Participants who are randomized to T1D medical appointments every 6 weeks will show
      better improvements in gains in A1C, percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia, adherence,
      and biological markers compared to those participants who revert to medical appointments
      occurring every 3 months.
