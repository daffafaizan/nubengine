      began causing an increase in reports of influenza-like illness in North America. Although the
      virus subsequently spread rapidly around the world, the earliest reported outbreak of cases
      occurred in Mexico City, which is seen as the epicenter of the influenza pandemic, the
      world's first in 40 years.

      Many questions remain about this emerging pandemic and the virus causing it, the answers to
      which could better inform patient management and policy decisions both in Mexico and
      internationally. Sparse reliable clinical research data have been collected on the natural
      history of the disease, on the risk factors associated with severe disease, or on the
      severity of this pandemic influenza as compared to seasonal influenzas. This study is an
      initial step to better characterize individuals in Mexico who develop influenza-like illness
      (including illness caused by novel H1N1), to describe the clinical management of those
      individuals, and to assess their short-term outcome. The planned data collection will provide
      timely information to inform policy and guidelines for the local populations and governments
      involved and may also be used to design future ancillary studies of this influenza virus
      and/or studies of other emerging infectious diseases.

      The purpose of this observational study is to characterize individuals in Mexico who seek
      medical care for influenza-like illness (ILI) and to describe clinical course over a period
      of at least 28 days after enrollment.
