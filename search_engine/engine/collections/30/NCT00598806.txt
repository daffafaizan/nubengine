    
      This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Within
      14 days of Screening, eligible patients underwent a TURBT during Visit 1 (Day 0) following
      which they were immediately randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or 4 mg
      apaziquone, instilled in a volume of 40 mL into the bladder within 6 hours from the end of
      the TURBT procedure. After a 60-minute retention period, study drug was drained from the
      bladder.

      A postoperative follow-up examination and review of the local pathology report were performed
      at Visit 2, which occurred 21 days (Â±10 days) after the TURBT (Week 3).

        -  If the histology of the patient's tumor was confirmed as Ta, G1-G2 (ie, low grade
           according to World Health Organization [WHO]/International Society of Urologic Pathology
           [ISUP] classification), no further treatment was given and the patient was observed
           cystoscopically every 3 months through Year 2 for tumor recurrence (Visit 3 through
           Visit 10).

        -  If the histology of the patient's tumor was other than Ta, G1 or G2 (low grade [WHO/ISUP
           classification]), further treatment was given in accordance with current treatment
           guidelines, and the patient was followed up cystoscopically every 3 months through Year
           2 for tumor recurrence (Visit 3 through Visit 10).

      All patients were to be followed for 2 years.
