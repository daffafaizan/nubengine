      series of patients in a French center where Total Knee Arthroplasty with HLS prosthesis is
      performed routinely.

      All patients treated with HLS KneeTec (cemented, non-cemented or hybrid versions) implant
      will be included. All eligible patients seen in consultation and who agree to participate in
      the study should be included, systematically and consecutively, since the initiation of the
      study.

      Data will be collected retrospectively for HLS I, II, Evolution and NoetosÂ® implants, and
      when prospectively for cementless, cemented and hybrid HLS KneeTec prosthesis.

      Post-surgery visit data will be collected at 1-y , 3-y , 5-y, 10-y FU visits per protocol
      then up to the latest FU visit available.
