      blood glucose. In vitro and animal studies have shown that polyphenols and polyphenol-rich
      extracts of foods, including berries, may inhibit digestion and absorption of carbohydrates
      and thereby suppress postprandial glycemia. However, current evidence on the effects of
      berries on postprandial glycemic responses in humans is limited.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of berries on postprandial glycemic
      responses (blood glucose and insulin) to starch or sucrose in healthy subjects. It consists
      of five substudies each of which includes 2-4 meals with different berry species typically
      consumed in Finland and a reference meal without berries. The following combinations of
      carbohydrates and berries are studied:

        -  Studies 1-2: white wheat bread (starch) is consumed with several berry species

        -  Study 3: white wheat bread or rye bread is consumed with a mixture of berries

        -  Study 4: sugar (sucrose) is consumed with berries and berry nectars

        -  Study 5: a sugar-sweetened bakery product (starch + sucrose) is consumed with berries
           and berry nectar.
