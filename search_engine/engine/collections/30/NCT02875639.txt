      coronary disease combined with cardiac failure is the disorder Nerve-endocrine-immune network
      mechanism, disorder of energy metabolism, blood coagulation/anticoagulation imbalances,
      vascular endothelial injury and the expression of inflammatory factors and cytokines
      disorder, etc. Some studies have identified that the Chinese traditional medicine of
      supplementing qi and activating blood circulation drugs could adjust the nerve - endocrine -
      immune network, improve endothelial function, improve ventricular remodeling, ameliorate
      heart function, alleviate the clinical symptoms, enhance the quality of life, and so on. This
      study by comparing the curative effect of Yi-Qi Formula, Huoxue prescription and two
      prescription of yiqi huoxue (buyang huanwu decoction and Qishen Yiqi Drop Pill) on improving
      energy metabolism, ameliorating heart function, adjusting the blood coagulation and the
      expression of cell adhesion factor, improving endothelial function, to reveal the curative
      effect mechanism of Yiqihuoxue prescription which treat the disease of qi deficiency and
      blood stasis, and confirm the TCM theory that "Qi and blood are correlated.
