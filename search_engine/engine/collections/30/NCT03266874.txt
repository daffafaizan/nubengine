    
      The G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell belongs to the G7 multi-bearing platform. It was
      developed to provide an additional surgical option for patients in need of a total hip
      replacement. The aim of the G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell is to increase hip function while
      reducing pain.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled post market
      surveillance study involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hip arthroplasty procedures. A
      minimum of 4 and a maximum of 5 sites will be involved in this study. This number of clinical
      centers will permit assessment of consistency among a multitude of investigators. 140-175
      implants will be included into the study. Each site will be allowed to enroll 35 patients.
      All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      The safety and performance of the G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell will be assessed as
      following: implant survivorship based on revision with removal of the study device; safety
      based on incidence and frequency of adverse events; and clinical efficacy measured by overall
      pain and function, quality of life data and radiographic evaluation.
