      cross-over study published in 2003. The drug is now widely used for this purpose in many
      countries, although no confirmatory study has been published. The aims of the present study
      are: 1) to see if the results in the first candesartan study can be replicated in a new
      patient population, including patients with chronic migraine, and, 2) to perform a
      head-to-head comparison of candesartan 16 mg/day with standard treatment with propranolol 160
      mg slow release. We also intend to study whether responsiveness to these drugs may be related
      to heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity.
