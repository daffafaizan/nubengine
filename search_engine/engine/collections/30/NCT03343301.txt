    
      Phase 1 is an open-label dose-escalation of FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6. Eligible
      patients will have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GI cancer of any type and be
      candidates to receive at least 2 doses of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy. FGFR2 status is not a
      requirement for enrollment. FGFR2 status will be tested retrospectively by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) if tissue is available and a sample will be obtained for
      circulating tumor deoxynucleic acid (ctDNA) blood assay. Phase 1 consists of at least 2
      dosing cohorts of FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6 to determine the recommended dose of
      FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in the phase 3.
