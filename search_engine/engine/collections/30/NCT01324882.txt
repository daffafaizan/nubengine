    
      There will be two arms to the study, the CF-H180 adult colonoscope (Control Arm) and the
      Olympus Technically Improved Colonoscope (Olympus). (Control Arm). In this protocol the
      investigators will randomize patients to either the adult colonoscope or to the Olympus
      Technically Improved Colonoscope (Olympus) arm. The name of the arm (CF-H180 adult
      colonoscope or Technically Improved Colonoscope) will be in a sealed envelope and opened by
      the nurse. The endoscopist will be blinded to the scope that will be used.
