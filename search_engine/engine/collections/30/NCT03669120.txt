    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility of two different approaches for smoking cessation (print materials
      developed for smoking cessation among the mainstream population versus [vs.] an
      individualized text based approach) among 60 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
      smokers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the levels of helpfulness, appropriateness, and perceived difficulty of the
      above mentioned cessation approaches among 60 LGBT smokers.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the smoking abstinence rates of two different individualized intensive cessation
      approaches (mainstream vs. individually-tailored) among 60 LGBT smokers.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive mainstream instructional care including brief advice on how to
      quit smoking, 10-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of nicotine
      patches, and intensive print materials to promote smoking cessation.

      ARM II: Participants receive tailored intensive care including brief advice on how to quit
      smoking, NRT, and intensive print materials to promote smoking cessation as in Arm I.
      Participants also receive individualized text based messages to promote smoking cessation for
      6 months.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
