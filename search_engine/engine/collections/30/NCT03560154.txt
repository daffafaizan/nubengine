    
      Patients:

      All participants with ILD will be recruited from a Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital
      between January 2017 and June 2018. All treatments will performed in the same hospital.

      Sample Size:

      "Power and Sample Size Program" was used to calculate sample size. Power analysis was done
      with Pass 11 Home program. In the power analysis program, α = 0,05, β = 0,15 1- β = 0,84.
      When the number of samples of the groups was 30 and 30, 84% power was obtained. Using a
      two-sided two-sample t-test, the standard deviations from the 0,05 alpha value are 7.0 and
      6.0.

      Procedure:

      A list of individuals diagnosed with interstitial lung disease who are following the
      outpatient clinic of the Department of Chest Diseases of the Istanbul University Cerrahpaşa
      Medical Faculty and who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be created. The
      created patient list will be enumerated. Two groups will be formed from the numbered persons
      by the random number table method (n = 60). Groups will receive 30 participants in the
      treatment group, whose protocol numbers end in an even number, and 30 members in the control
      group, who finished with an odd number of protocol numbers. Up to 10% of the sample size will
      be selected as a substitute, taking into account the non-participation of the selected
      individuals in the study.

      Assessments at baseline and after training will be performed by pulmonary physiotherapist.
      All the participants will be treated in the Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty hospital by a
      physiotherapist who is experienced in pulmonary rehabilitation.
