      package (HELP) against intestinal parasitic infections among Orang Asli schoolchildren in
      West Malaysia. The package has been tested by a pilot study in 2013 among children in 2
      schools in Pahang state.

      In the current study, HELP package has been improved and children from 13 primary schools in
      11 districts of six states in Peninsular Malaysia were allocated into two groups
      (intervention and control groups) and the impact of HELP was evaluated after 3 and 6 months
      of baseline assessment and HELP intervention.

      The evaluation involved soil-transmitted helminth infections and intestinal protozoa
      infections.
