      associated with adverse outcomes. Frontal electromyogram based Responsiveness Index (RI) aims
      to quantify patient's arousal. RI monitoring together with staff education may have potential
      to improve sedation quality. Investigators will evaluate the safety of RI based sedation
      versus standard care using Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for sedation.

      Methods: randomized study, critically ill adult patients with mechanical ventilation and
      administration of sedation to either RI- or RASS-guided sedation. Propofol (and midazolam
      combined with if needed) as a hypnotic drug and oxycodone as an analgesic drug. Investigators
      will follow standardized sedation protocol in both groups to achieve the predetermined target
      sedation level: either RI 40-80 (RI-group) or RASS -3-0 (RASS group). RI measurement is
      continuous in both groups, but blinded in the RASS group. Accordingly, RI group is blinded to
      RASS assessments. State Entropy (SE) will register in both groups.
