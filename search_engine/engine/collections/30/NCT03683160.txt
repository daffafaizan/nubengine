      directly related to important functional issues, such as challenges in crossing a street in
      time, difficulty walking to a bus stop and increased risk of falls. These functional issues
      can then impact a person's confidence to move around their community, ultimately leading to
      lower levels of physical activity and potential negative health consequences. The best way to
      optimize recovery in walking and mobility is not yet known, and there are critical gaps in
      existing treatments. While some approaches are effective in the short term, strategies to
      promote the maintenance of improvements are not well established, benefits are usually not
      transferred beyond the specific skills trained and the specific context in which they were
      learned, few interventions impact community participation, and cost effectiveness has rarely
      been investigated. A potential solution exists in combining best-evidence interventions:
      task-specific gait and mobility training to improve skill quality, cardiorespiratory and
      strength exercises to improve endurance and speed, and cognitive strategy training to teach
      problem solving, improve confidence and to ensure long-term maintenance and transfer of
      skills to home and community settings. The investigators will combine best evidence mobility
      interventions with best evidence cognitive strategy training to develop and evaluate a new
      intervention to optimize long-term functional mobility outcomes for those living with stroke.
      The project consists of two sequential stages: 1) intervention development through literature
      synthesis; face validity testing using focus groups with patients, family members and expert
      stroke rehabilitation clinicians; and intervention refinement; followed by 2)
      feasibility/pilot testing with 10 people more than 6 months post stroke. Anticipated outcomes
      include a fully developed intervention with the potential to optimize mobility rehabilitation
      and effect size estimates to permit the design of a future, appropriately-powered randomized
      controlled trial.
