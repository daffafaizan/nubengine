      Prospective observational studies of the effectiveness of AutoloGel have demonstrated
      promising results in regard to the healing of DFUs, including severe Wagner grade 3 and 4
      ulcers. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of complete wound healing
      in a prospective, open-label, case-matched cohort trial in which diabetic foot ulcers will be
      treated using AutoloGel to determine the time to heal at 12 weeks. Comparison will be made
      with a case-matched concurrent cohort of patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary
      Care (UCC).
