      Information, Motivation, Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) on self-management and HbA1c. This study was conducted with a randomized
      controlled trial. This study, between January 2019 and September 2019 were conducted in
      endocrine clinic. A total of 63 patients (31 interventions, 32 controls) diagnosed with T2DM
      were included. The intervention group received 45-60 minutes of patient training based on the
      Information, Motivation and Behavioral Skill Model (IMB). A weekly short reminder message and
      a two-weekly phone call were made and a total of 12 weeks of follow-up was conducted. As a
      result, there was a statistically significant difference between pre-test HbA1c, weight and
      systolic blood pressure (p<0.05). Also, after three months of follow-up, self-efficacy,
      self-management and self-management perceptions were significantly higher in the intervention
