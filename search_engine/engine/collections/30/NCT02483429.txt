      to standard ED diagnostic care at three performance sites. The Specific Aims are to assess
      diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic workup costs, and estimate the short-term impact of correct
      diagnosis in anticipation of a larger, definitive Phase III trial. Adult ED patients with a
      chief symptom of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness, new or clearly worse in the previous 30
      days, will undergo on-site vestibular function tests by trained research personnel using a
      portable, quantitative VOG recording device. Research personnel will also record a focused
      symptom history and bedside hearing tests. Eligible patients with at least one pathologic
      vestibular eye movement finding or pathologic ataxia will be randomized to VRT or standard ED
      care. Patients eligible for pre-randomization testing but excluded from randomization will be
      slated for the Observational Arm of the study and will undergo limited 1 and 6 month phone
      follow-up. The VRT arm relies on an automated algorithm to interpret VOG results, thereby
      determining a patient-specific clinical care pathway. For safety, all VRT-arm study subjects
      will undergo stroke protocol MRI before release. All randomized subjects will undergo
      confirmatory testing at one week, including vestibular specialist exam and 1.5 or 3-Tesla
      research MRI combining stroke and internal auditory canal protocols. All randomized patients
      will also undergo 1 month and 6 month phone follow-up and medical record review to confirm
      diagnoses. Clinical findings, ED diagnoses, diagnostic resource utilization, treatments
      applied, and clinical events during follow-up will be recorded. A multidisciplinary, masked,
      expert panel will adjudicate final diagnoses.
