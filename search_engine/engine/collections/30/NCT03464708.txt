    
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised controlled trial with the primary
      objective of investigating the effect of HMB on skeletal muscle wasting in early critical
      illness. Secondary objectives include determining the effect of HMB on skeletal muscle
      quality, strength, function and quality of life in survivors of critical illness. In
      addition, the effect of HMB on muscle protein turnover, muscle protein signalling, muscle
      fibre size and protein:DNA ratio will be investigated in a sub-group of participants.

      Eligible participants will be randomised to receive either 3 g/day HMB or 3 g/day placebo
      within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This will be continued until
      hospital discharge or 28-days, whichever comes first.
