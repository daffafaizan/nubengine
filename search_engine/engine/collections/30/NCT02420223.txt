    
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study designed to evaluate whether a drug designed to
      block the physiologic effects of stress is effective at blocking stress-related gene
      expression in people receiving autologous stem cell transplants (their own cells) for
      multiple myeloma. Such stress-related gene expression is one way that the body is programmed
      to make specific proteins under conditions of stress. These proteins are believed to
      contribute to worse health outcomes. By using the drug propranolol, we aim to see whether we
      might block these negative health effects of stress as occur in the cancer setting and during
      the transplant process. We hypothesize that individuals taking propranolol will have more
      favorable gene expression.

      We will enroll 40 individuals, randomizing half to receive propranolol and half to serve as
      the control group not on the study drug. Study participants will start propranolol three
      weeks prior to their transplant and continue it until 30 days after the transplant. We will
      explore the effect of socioeconomic status, depression, and anxiety on individuals' gene
      expression response to propranolol with the idea that the more impoverished, anxious, or
      depressed individuals will display an even greater change in their gene expression. Part of
      the purpose of this study is also be to assess whether it is feasible to give this drug to
      individuals with cancer. Results of this study may inform larger trials assessing the effects
      of propranolol on cancer progression.
