      treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.
      Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to
      increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC.

      Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an
      additional option for these patients.

      The primary objective therefore is to compare the pathological complete response (pCR= ypT0
      ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment of sequential, nab-Paclitaxel followed by EC +/- the
      PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 in patients with early triple negative breast cancer.
