      cell lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique.
      We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from these molecules
      and identified that these peptides significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL
      response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the
      safety, immunological and clinical response of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated
      twice a week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination day, the URLC10-177 peptide(1mg), TTK-567
      peptide(1mg) and KOC1-508 peptide(1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by
      subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until patients
      develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the phase I
      study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide vaccine. In the following
      phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.
