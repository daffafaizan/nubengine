    
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel viral disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2
      infection with a particular predominance of upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms. First
      diagnosed in China in late 2019, the virus has progressed to a state of pandemia, involving
      Spain with a important outbreak.

      While the outcomes of viral infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients tend to be
      worse than those from the general population due to chronic immunosuppression, there is
      little information on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in liver transplant (LT)
      recipients. LT recipients are usually under less immunosuppression than other SOT and the
      clinical expression and outcomes of COVID-19 may be different to the reported outcomes in
      other SOT.

      The Spanish Society of Liver Transplantation, which includes 25 LT programs, has promoted a
      nationwide registry for LT with COVID-19 to help ascertain the incidence and outcomes and
      help evidence-based management .
