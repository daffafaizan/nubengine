      sitosterolemia. However, plant sterol levels remain substantially elevated compared to those
      in healthy individuals. Thus, combination therapy needs to be considered. Agents that provide
      cardiovascular benefits such as colesevelam, a second-generation bile acid sequestrant, and
      fish oil are potential candidates to help further reduce sterol levels, but have yet to be
      evaluated in sitosterolemia patients.

      The purpose of this study is to dtermine the effects of colesevelam, fish oil and combination
      therapy (fish oil + colesevelam) on plant sterols, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk
      factors in sitosterolemia patients treated with ezetimibe. The results of this study will
      enhance knowledge on the pathogenesis of sitosterolemia and the mechanisim of actions of
      colesevelam and fish oil as adjunct therapies to ezitimibe in patients with the disease.
