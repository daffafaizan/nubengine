      approximately 2.7 million U.S. adults. Percutaneous catheter ablation is an effective
      treatment option for individuals with persistent AF. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has
      emerged as the gold standard for paroxysmal AF with excellent success rates, however,
      individuals with persistent AF procedural efficacy from pulmonary vein isolation is not
      optimal. Therefore, improved ablation strategies for these individuals are needed.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare two radiofrequency ablation strategies, PVI
      alone and pulmonary vein isolation plus left posterior atrial wall (LPAW) isolation in
      individuals with persistent AF. Both strategies are currently used to treat persistent AF,
      but no randomized controlled trial ahs been conducted to investigate which strategy is more
      efficacious.

      Two-hundred subjects will be randomized into groups of 50 to undergo a radiofrequency
      ablation procedure for AF. For group 1, a series of radiofrequency applications will be
      delivered around both sets of pulmonary veins. For group 2, a series of radiofrequency
      applications will be delivered around both sets of pulmonary veins and along a roof and low
      posterior line of the left atrial wall.

      All subjects will be followed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post ablation. If
      indicated, antiarrhythmic drugs will be discontinued. For the first month, subjects will
      receive a continuously recording electrocardiogram heart card to monitor for AF, and then
      two-week ambulatory monitors at 3 months and one year post ablation.
