    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose, 2-period, incomplete
      block, crossover, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate 3 once-daily doses of
      umeclidinium (UMEC) in adolescent asthma subjects aged 12 through 17 years,) who are
      currently using asthma medications that do not contain inhaled corticosteroids (non-ICS). The
      objectives are to investigate safety and tolerability, and PK after a 7-day (+2) repeat
      once-daily dose of UMEC (15.6, 62.5, and 250 mcg) in asthmatic adolescent subjects. Safety
      endpoints will include reported adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests,
      and rescue albuterol use. The PK endpoints will include serial PK (plasma and urine)
      concentrations and derived parameters.
