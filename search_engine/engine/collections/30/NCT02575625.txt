      still mainly based on histological exam of the liver. An histological continuity exists going
      from clean liver steatosis (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, NAFLD) to steatohepatitis with
      signs of inflammation and tissue fibrosis (Non Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, NASH). It's now
      well-known that disease can evolve to cirrhosis and its complications.

      Hypothesis of this study is the existence of a relation between parameters measured by
      FibroScanÂ® FS 502 according to our non invasive method and liver steatosis condition.

      This proof of concept validation is made up of two steps:

        -  Step 1: feasibility study of the method on 10 healthy volunteers

        -  Step 2: diagnosis study on 50 healthy volunteers (25 between 18-30 years-old and 25
           between 40-65 years-old) and on 25 patients whom cares including an liver biopsy et whom
           the histological answer is clean steatosis (NAFLD).

      Measures on healthy volunteers enable to do an intra-operator reproductibility analysis, a
      study of an age effect and a search of potential mechanic aging of the liver.

      Experimental procedures consist in:

        -  Fibroscan measure, preceded by tracking ultrasonography.

        -  liver MRI (for substudy about MRI comparison, in step 2)

        -  a blood test for biological assessment of liver functions

      The final aim of this study is to propose a device enable medical community to do in vivo
      hepatic rheology observation, highly correlated to liver lipid overload. After
      industrialization of this innovation, this diffusion could making easier patients follow-up.
