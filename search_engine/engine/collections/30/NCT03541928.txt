    
      This phase II study plans to assess efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk+ valacyclovir gene
      therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy, external beam
      radiotherapy, and prostatectomy in previously untreated high-risk prostate cancer patients.

      Clinical response as evaluated by changes in serum PSA level and digital rectal examination
      as well as by histological alterations on re-biopsy and prostatectomy such as the presence of
      apoptosis, necrosis, tumor proliferation and immunologic response, will be assessed following
      HSV-tk + valacyclovir treatment. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological
      response, blood counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
      neuro-toxicity scores (See Appendices). Additionally, patients will be followed closely to
      assess nadir PSA, freedom from PSA-progression, and freedom from local and distant
      progression and overall survival.
