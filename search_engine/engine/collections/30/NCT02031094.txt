      with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Management of liver injury is complex and
      challenging and can often involve debridement or anatomical resection of liver tissue.

      Following liver resection, the liver regenerates to its original volume. Liver regeneration
      involves complex metabolic processes and maximal regeneration occurs over the first post
      operative week. This process is highly energy dependent and adds a further burden on post
      operative energy and therefore nutritional requirements.

      Inadequate post-operative nutrition is associated with poorer outcomes and complication
      rates. Additionally, over feeding is also associated with adverse outcome. The actual
      additional energy expenditure involved in liver regeneration is not currently known and
      therefore accurate calorific balance remains a challenge.

      The measurement of energy expenditure in these patients is therefore important. Traditionally
      energy expenditure has been measured by indirect calorimetry and doubly labelled water. These
      techniques require skilled operators and are often impractical for everyday clinical usage
      and impossible in the deployed setting.

      A recent development is a lightweight armband that measures total and resting energy
      expenditure. It has been validated against the gold standard techniques in various settings
      including cancer cachexia, obesity and healthy volunteers and is deemed highly acceptable
      also. It has not been validated in the unique setting of liver regeneration.

      Therefore this study will assess the energy expenditure in patients undergoing liver
      regeneration and attempt to validate a new minimally invasive device against the traditional
      measurements of energy expenditure.
