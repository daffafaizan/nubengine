      therapeutic target. This technique is considered an approach that can be of a great benefit
      to patients with chronic medical illnesses and those who have moderate to high risk for
      general anaesthesia.

      In the present study, the investigators examined the safety of a novel co-induction approach
      that relied on a simple timing and dosing alterations to the classical approaches of
      inhalational sevoflurane and propofol induction. The significance of this study is to find a
      reliable safe alternative method of induction that can provide optimal parameters,when
      compared to the classical methods of induction. The investigators evaluated the time needed
      for laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, number of LMA insertion trials, succession of LMA
      insertion, adverse events related to the airway, respiratory and cardiovascular systems,
      haemodynamic stability and satisfaction scores of enrolled patients.
