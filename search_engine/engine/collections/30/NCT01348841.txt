      to evidence-based guidelines (published methods that have been supported scientifically)
      results in better clinical outcomes and better cost-effectiveness. Wound management by
      interdisciplinary teams may have these advantages in both the community primary care setting
      and the hospital specialized care setting. Systematic review of the literature indicated that
      the evidence was incomplete to support implementation of an intermediate care model for
      community management of chronic wounds. Therefore, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory
      Committee recommended that a field evaluation be conducted to provide stronger evidence about
      the relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of managing chronic wounds in
      the community using both standardized, comprehensive primary care and a systematic method of
      referral to a specialty, multidisciplinary team based in a hospital
