      from nerve endings and damaged tissue which leads to an inflammatory and hyperalgesic
      response. COX-2 inhibitors are often used for treating pain. This is a double-blind
      randomized study in surgical patients receiving a spinal drain for surgical purposes. The
      hypothesis is that valdecoxib will reach therapeutic concentrations in CSF, and will decrease
      plasma and CSF concentrations of inflammatory mediators. Subjects will receive valdecoxib 40
      mg or placebo approximately 1 hr prior to surgery. Serial blood and CSF samples will be
      obtained. Valdecoxib and cytokine concentrations will be measured.
